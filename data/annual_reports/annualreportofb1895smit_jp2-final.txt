JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 23, 1895.
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted

_ January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth

Wednesday in January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (the Hon. M. W. Fuller) in the chair, the
Hon. J. 8. Morrill, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. R. R. Hitt, Dr. Henry Coppée, the Hon. J. B. Henderson,
and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were read from Dr. William Preston
Johnston, on account of illness; from the Hon. S. M. Cullom, on account
of a domestic affliction, and from Dr. Andrew D. White, on account of
absence in Europe.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read in abstract the
minutes of the last meeting, which were approved.

The Secretary stated that the term of Dr. Andrew D. White as
Regent of the Institution having expired on February 15, 1894, he was
reappointed by joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President
March 19, 1894.

The Secretary announced the death, on September 4, 1894, of Dr.
Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee.

On motion, the Chancellor appointed Senator Henderson and the
Secretary a committee to prepare suitable resolutions expressing the
Board’s sense of loss, and the committee presented the following:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
have been called upon to mourn the death of their esteemed colleague, the late

James C. Welling, LL. D., president of the Columbian University, who has long
been interested in the welfare of the Institution, and who for many years has been

.a Regent and chairman of its Executive Committee,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feels deep regret in the loss of one whose
long and distinguished career of public usefulness, especially in the promotion of
institutions for higher education, commanded their respect, and whose personal
character and unselfish devotion to the highest ideals of scholarship and citizen-
ship, their sincere admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of President Welling the Smithsonian Institution has
suffered the irreparable loss of an earnest friend, a wise and judicious counselor,
and one who was preeminently an exponent of its time-honored policy; and the
Board of Regents a friend and associate whom they valued most highly. |

xXI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the Journal of the Proceedings of
the Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to the family
of their departed associate and friend, in token of sympathy in this common
affliction.

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to prepare a eulogy of President Welling
for insertion in the Journal of the Board of Regents.

Dr. Coppée said that he had been longer associated with Dr.Welling
than any other member of the Board, since 1884, and particularly as a
member of the Executive Committee with him, and as he had for Dr.
Welling a very high esteem, he thought it proper to say a word in this
connection. Dr. Welling was one of the most valuable citizens of
Washington, to whom was confided many trusts, among them the
presidency of the Columbian University, and the chairmanship of the
Executive Committee of this Institution, and he did well everything
that was confided to him. He was aman pure in thought, honest in
purpose and action, and intelligent in judgment. He held a ready pen,
and how polished his public utterances were, all here would remember
who had heard him when he presented papers and other matters before
this Board.

Dr. Coppée added that Dr. Welling was cautioned by his friends that
he worked too hard, and instanced the fact that at the last meeting
which he attended, in May, he announced his purpose to write a work
with reference to his favorite subject of anthropology, when Senator
Henderson, now present, said to him: “The best thing that you can do
is to consider one individual of the species of ‘anthropos,’ and very care-
fully, at this time. You are the ‘man;’ take care of yourself.” It was
a grave pleasantry. It was good counsel, but it came too late, for Dr.
Welling was injured by the hard work that he did. In him is lost
a man who was preeminently excellent in counsel, whether to the
Board or in private, but he would leave it to the Secretary to speak of
him further.

Senator Henderson spoke of his long and intimate acquaintance with
Dr. Welling and expressed his admiration for him as a citizen and as
an officer of the Institution.

The Secretary then said:

LT have lost in Dr. Welling a personal friend, but I only have to speak of him now
in his relationship to this Institution—an institution whose conservative character
has been partly due to good fortune in the presence and advice of such men.

Dr. Welling was one who possessed, beyond anyone else, what may be called the
tralitions of the Institution; and though these were not of course his exclusive
property, in this respect, as in others, his loss can not be supplied.

The rules of conduct which have been laid down by the Regents and by the Sec-
retaries who have administered them are not so much derived from a priori views
as they are the outgrowth of accumulated experience; and this experience, it has
been thought, is in part, perhaps, due to the exceptionally long incumbencies of
members of the Board as compared with ordinary tenures of office here, and to
the continuity of the knowledge of its activities, as illustrated in the case of this
departed friend.

James Clark Welling, at the time of his death, September 4, 1894, was nearly 70
years of age. Descended from New England colonial ancestors, a native of one of
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

the Middle States,! in early manhood a teacher in the South, and for nearly half a
century a resident of the national capital, he was an American of the noblest type,
free from sectional bias, personifying the best traits and tendencies of the nation,
loyal to the traditions and aspirations of its founders.

He was graduated in 1844 from the College of New Jersey, studied law, and was
admitted to the bar, but soon afterwards entered upon the profession of journal-
ism. He always retained, however, a strong inclination for the study of constitu-
tional and international law, and of politics, and his interest in public affairs was
greatly stimulated by his connection for fifteen years with the most important of
Washington journals, at that time national in its influence. He became the literary
editor of the National Intelligencer in 1850, and was its managing editor throughout
the entire period of the civil war. In this capacity he had the privilege of personal
acquaintance with all our public men, and confidential access to many of them,
including Lincoln, Seward, and Stanton.

In later life his attention was given chiefly to educational work. For a time
president of St. John’s College, Maryland, and later professor of belles-lettres at
Princeton, he was, in 1870, recalled to Washington to become president of the
Columbian University, an institution founded fifty years before, in the hope that it
might fulfill the desire of Washington, Barlow, and Adams, that a seat of liberal
learning should exist at the capital. Dr. Welling was led to accept this position by
the urgency of the philanthropist Corcoran and the advice of Henry, both of whom
were influenced by the hope of having with them one of the founders of a national
university, and who believed that a man of Dr. Welling’s character would find in
such a position a wide field of influence.

His aspirations for the university were never fully realized, owing to the impos-
sibility of securing endowments from private sources for a public institution located
so near to the seat of government. He nevertheless secured a considerable addition
to its endowment, added new professional schools, greatly increased the number of
its faculty and students, removed the institution from the suburbs to a new build-
ing in the heart of the city, and accomplished many other things which seemed
really wonderful in view of the smallness of the resources at his-command. The
dream of his life was to establish a school of comparative jurisprudence—the only
one of its kind in the world—as a branch of the university. In 1892 he visited
Europe, secured approval of his plans from Sir Frederick Pollock and other eminent
jurists, and their promise to come to America to lecture as members of the faculty.
Failing health interfered with the realization of his plan, which I can but believe
he would have otherwise forced into success.

After his resignation of the presidency in 1893, he still retained the chair of inter-
national law and the position of dean of the university law school, and, full of
hopefulness, it was his purpose to labor on for his beloved project. He confidently
expected to live to be 80, and to devote the remaining ten years of his life to the
compilation of a political history of the civil war, a work for which no one was so
well qualified by experience, knowledge, and critical skill as himself. He was a
representative man in Washington, identified with all interests which tend toward
good citizenship, and held many positions of public trust and honor. He was
president of the board of trustees of the Corcoran Art Gallery and of the American
Copyright League, and was appointed by President Harrison commissioner to the
Columbian Historical Exposition at Madrid in 1892. His bearing was that of a
courteous gentleman of the old school. His scholarship was accurate, broad, and
genial, as was shown by the critical reviews which he contributed during his Jater
years to some of the principal American journals. His favorite study in hours of
relaxation was that of the sacred poetry of the early Christian Church, some
of which he had translated, though not for publication.

In 1884 he was chosen a Regent of this Institution to succeed the Reverend Dr.
Parker. For ten years he gave conscientious attention to its interests, and upheld

in every way those conservative and dignified traditions of which I have already
spoken of him as almost the living embodiment; and while he did this primarily
because of their harmony with his own personal tendencies and convictions as to
their value, he did so because of his affection and reverence for the first Secretary,
Joseph Henry, whose pupil he had been in his youth, and with whom in middle life
he maintained the relation of friend and confidant. After Henry’s death, Dr. Welling
consented to add to his already burdensome duties those of the chairman of the
Executive Committee, which he performed till his own death, so that he may be said
to have been a link between the past and present in the history of this Institution,
though happily not the only one, since it has preserved others in his contemporaries.

On motion, the resolutions were unanimously adopted by a standing
vote. :

The Secretary then presented his printed annual report to June 30,
1894, and recalled to the Regents the fact that by act of Congress,
approved by the President March 12, 1894, section 5579 of the Revised
Statutes was amended to read as follows:

That the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of Execu-
tive Departments are hereby constituted an establishment by the name of the
Smithsonian Institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,
and by that name shall be known and have perpetual succession, with the powers,
limitations, and restrictions hereinafter contained, and no other.

As now organized, the Smithsonian Establishment consists of the
following ex officio members:

GROVER CLEVELAND, President of the United States.
ADLAL E. STEVENSON, Vice-President of the United States.
MELVILLE W. FULLER, Chief Justice of the United States.
WALTER Q. GRESHAM, Secretary of State.

JOHN G. CARLISLE, Secretary of the Treasury.

DANIEL S. LAMONT, Secretary of War.

RICHARD OLNEY, Attorney-General.

WILSON S. BISSELL, Postmaster-General.

Hitary A. HERBERT, Secretary of the Navy.

Hoke Smiru, Secretary of the Interior.

J. STERLING Mormon, Secretary of Agriculture.

By the same act section 5591 was amended as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive into the
Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James Smithson, such sums
as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the
original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000.

Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of the Smith-
sonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift, bequest, or devise,
and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of the purposes thereof.

The Secretary added that what he had otherwise said in the report
before the Board might almost be summarized in the statement that
the past year had been, in many respects, perhaps the busiest that the
Institution had ever known; and this both in the field of its ordinary
activities and in new ones.

The progress of the Museum had been very considerable, the collec-
tions were never in better condition, and the contributions to science
derived from their study had been of more than usual extent and value.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

The buildings had been visited by 200,000 persons during the past
year, and a very large number of specimens, accurately named and
labeled, have been sent out to other museums and institutions through-
out the United States. It should be said, however, that those who are
interested in the Museum see with a feeling of real distress that, with
all that it is doing, it is compelled to come short of its functions as a
national institution, from the fact that such large collections of material
gathered on the North American continent are being carried abroad
for the want of means to retain them at home, and that desirable col-
lections in every other field are constantly slipping out of our grasp.
European museums have spent during the last year hundreds of
thousands of dollars in availing themselves of the fast diminishing
opportunities for making collections of material objects representing

the work of the primitive races of this continent, while the entire sum

FOR

of money available here for this purpose has been $3,725. Notwith-
standing the great opportunities offered at the close of the Chicago
Exposition, within the past year the new Field Columbian Museum
had expended probably more than $500,000 in the purchase of collec-
tions, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York not
less than $100,000.

The Secretary went on to say that he need hardly recall that the
Zoological Park, as originally sanctioned by the Regents, was a national
and not a local measure. It was to be a great preserve of certain animal
races of the continent—like, for instance, the buffalo—and was to do
work which, for reasons already explained, the great national parks of
the West could not do so well. This was to be its primary function, and
recreation a subordinate one. Indirectly, if not through formal legisla-
tion, the direction in which the park is tending is more that of the
ordinary zoological garden, where entertainment is a principal feature,
than in that of the primary object. In spite of this the park has pre-
served, as far as it can, the lines of the original purpose. The buffalo,
for example, are breeding in captivity in a way only possible in such
paddocks as can be provided in this large reserve, while others of the
great races are being sheltered, and the park is, though in a limited
measure, filling its place as a city of refuge for these vanishing animal
peoples. The Regents will be glad to know that a secondary legitimate
object of the gardens is being most amply filled, for, to use a common
expression, it is becoming like “the lungs of the city,” since, from its
position, it is accessible to the poor as well as to the rich, and is for the
health and recreation of every citizen; and he would mention in striking
evidence of the public appreciation of this most important feature, and
as an evidence that the Regents’ large intent has not wholly failed of
its purpose, that the park, even in its inchoate condition, has been
visited by as many as 30,000 people in a single day.

The Secretary continued that the work of the Bureau of Ethnology
lies largely in collecting and preserving material for the study of the
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

languages of the Indian tribes of the continent, upon which all con-
clusions as to their origin and relationship so closely depend; and in
that respect the Bureau had done its usual valuable service. He had
authorized the sending out, on its own account, minor expeditions for
collecting records of the vanishing aboriginal races and for the study
of the peculiar customs among the last of the really savage tribes of our
borders, and important results had been obtained, such, for instance,
asin a recent expedition to the home of the Papagos and Seri Indians.

The Secretary called the attention of the Regents to the growing
activities and consequent increased labor in the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges. There are something like 24,000 correspondents
seatterec over the world, and its usefulness has never been greater.
These correspondents are partly indicated on the map inserted in the
report, which strikingly shows their world-wide distribution, where it
will be noticed that the occurrence of the red dots is about propor-
tional to the spread of civilization, and where a glance shows that a
comparison of Spain and France, of China and Japan, in education,
may be inferred from their relationships to the Institution alone.

In regard to the Astrophysical Observatory, the Secretary remarked
that he had said less because it was something in which he had a strong
personal interest, and perhaps a personal bias; but under this correc-
tion he might observe that there was probably no other such observa-
tory in the world for just this purpose, or one whose work has had more
gratifying recognition from ali specialists in its own subject than this
has in the last year.

He further said that he had left to the last the mention of the affairs
of the parent Institution, and he desired at present to repeat that all
the activities which had just been mentioned, and which were now
supported by Government appropriations, were really carried on in
part by the Smithsonian fund, for there was no appropriation to meet
the general expenses of the Secretary’s office, incident to the admin-
istration of the different Government appropriations with which the
Institution was charged. He referred not only to the minor matters
of clerical and messenger service, but to the responsibilities connected
with the disbursement of Government funds and to the increasing
burden of general administrative work that can not be delegated by
the Secretary to an ordinary clerk, but calls for a much higher order
of ability, and necessarily also for more liberal compensation. These
expenses should not be borne by the Smithsonian fund, as they were,
to a large extent, at present; nor were they properly chargeable to any
one of the Government appropriations, but they were common to them
all.

In connection with the Hodgkins fund, the Secretary said that he
had already called the attention of the Regents to the fact that, in
accordance with the wishes of Mr. Hodgkins, he had submitted to him
before his death a plan for expending the income of the first two years _
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

of the Hodgkins bequest largely in prizes of considerable amounts,
which were intended to draw attention to the subject. He had also
placed before the Regents a portion of the circulars which were sent
all over the civilized world, on the part of the Institution, to this end,
and he had taken occasion in the same connection to send a description
of the Institution, written in various languages, which had been pre-
pared after consultation with one of the Regents, and which some of
them might care to see.

The result of this work had been the presentation of more than two
hundred coinpetitive works for the prizes, some of them from the most
eminent men of science in Europe and America, and some from names
comparatively unknown; and a committee—whose active members are
Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of this Institution, Deputy
Surg. Gen. John 8. Billings, U.S. A., and Prof. Mark W. Harrington,
Chief of the Weather Bureau—was engaged in examining them.

It was expected that the European committee would be composed of
Professors Huxley, Janssen, and Helmholtz, who had kindly consented
to serve, but the death of the last-named eminent man of science has
temporarily deferred its formation.

The Secretary added that he was not yet prepared to advise the
Regents of the result of these competitions, further than to say that,
incidentally to their main object, they had probably brought the work
of the Institution before not only European men of science, but the
world of action, as well as of study, more completely than any incident
which had occurred at any time in its history. This interest was slow
in awakening, but afterwards grew rapidly, so that the time for receiv-
ing the essays was extended to the close of 1894.

The Secretary considered that the system of prizes had now com-
pleted its best work in calling attention to the Institution and the fund
it administered, as well as to its fitness as an administrator of other
trusts of this character.

The Secretary continued that he had already advised the Regents
that a bequest had been made to the Institution by a resident of Wash-
ington, Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, whose extremely feeble health at
the time of the last Board meeting did not give hope that he would
survive the year. Mr. Avery died on September 12, 1894. Owing to
the general fall in prices, the amount coming from the estate is likely
to be very much smaller than the testator supposed he was giving.

On motion, the report of the Secretary was accepted.

Dr. Coppée then said that by reason of the death of the chairman of
the Executive Committee, it devolved upon him to present the report
of that committee for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which he
did in printed form, and, on motion, the report was adopted.

SM 95 II

XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Dr. Coppée then introduced the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1896, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secre-
tary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

The Secretary stated that in 1874 the Institution received $1,000
from the estate of James Hamilton, esq., of Carlisle, Pa., bequeathed
in the following clause of his will:

I give $1,000 to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, located at
Washington, D. C., to be invested by said Regents in some safe fund, and the inter-
est to be appropriated biennially by the Secretaries, either in money or a medal, for

such contribution, paper, or lecture on any scientific or nseful subject as said Secre-
taries may approve.

Under resolution of the Regents, the bequest was deposited in the
Treasury on the same terms as the original Smithsonian bequest. In
administering the trust the income has thus far been only partially
used, the annual interest not being yet sufficient to bear the expense
attendant on the designing and striking of a proper medal. The
accrued interest on the fund having reached a sum more than equal
to the original bequest, $1,000 of this interest might now be added to
the principal, thus bringing the fund to $2,000, the interest on which
would more properly carry out the purposes of the testator. The
authority of the Regents was therefore requested for thus increasing
the original bequest and for treating the $2,000 thereby created as the
limit of a permanent fund to be called by the name of the donor, the
interest to be administered under the terms of the resolution relative
to income and expenditure.

Senator Henderson offered the following resolutions, explaining that
their purpose was to add $1,000 of the $1,200 which had accumulated
to the original bequest, which would make a fund of $2,000 and leave
a balance of interest to its credit of $200:

Resolved, That the Secretary is hereby authorized to add to the bequest of $1,000
received from James Hamilton the accrued interest upon the said bequest to the
amount of $1,000 and no more, the same to be deposited in the Treasury of the United
States under the terms of section 5591 of the Revised Statutes. ,

Resolved, That the fund of $2,000 thus created be known as the “‘ Hamilton fund,”

and that the income from this fund be administered by the Secretary under the terms
of the resolution relative to income and expenditure.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted.
There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion,
it adjourned.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

For THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

- Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
Condition of the fund July 1, 1895.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson and savings from
income and other sources, to the amount of $134,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James. Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift
from Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000, and $8,000,
being a portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and
$1,000, the accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in
all, as the permanent fund, $912,000.

The net expenditures of the Institution for the year ending June 30,
1895, were therefore $52,750.68, or $6,074.33 less than the gross expendi-
tures, $58,825.06, as above stated.

All moneys received by the Smithsonian Institution from interest,
sales, refunding of moneys temporarily advanced, or otherwise, are
deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the
Secretary of the Institution, and all payments are made by his checks
on the Treasurer of the United States.

REPORT

OF

SD ee UNECE e
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with established custom I have the
honor to submit herewith a report of the operations of the Smithsonian
Institution for the year ending June 30, 1895, including the work placed
by Congress under its supervision in the National Museum, the Bureau
of Ethnology, the Bureau of International Exchanges, the National
Zoological Park, and the Astro-physical Observatory.

I have given briefly in the body of the report a general account of
the affairs of the Institution and of its bureaus for the year, reserving
for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports from the offi-
cers in charge of the different branches of work.

The full report upon the National Museum by the assistant secretary,
Dr. G. Brown Goode, occupies a separate volume (Report of the
Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, 1895).

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

sM 95——1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 23, 1895, at 10
o'clock a.m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

It becomes my sad duty to announce the death of two members of
the executive committee of the Board of Regents during the year, Dr.
Welling, on September 4, 1894, and Dr. Coppée, on March 21, 1895. I
give sketches of their lives and work on subsequent pages devoted to
necrology.

On February 27, 1895, Mr. Gardiner G. Hubbard, of Washington City,
was appointed a Regent by joint resolution of Congress.

The term of office of Senator Cullom expired with his term as Sena-
tor on March 4, 1895.

ADMINISTRATION.

The expenses borne by the Institution, incidental to its administration
of Government trusts, are increasing so rapidly that I feel it my duty
to again call attention to the subject, though it has been mentioned at
greater or less length in all of my recent reports. The expenses that I
refer to are not specifically provided for by any of the present appro-
priations, since they belong, not singly to the National Museum, or to
the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the International Exchange Service, or
the like, but to expenditures common to all of them. I deem it in the
interest of economy that an appropriation be asked to cover these items,
for it seems manifest that this expenditure should be met from some
common source, owing to the limited size of the establishments in
question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions than to
bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of $17,000
for international exchanges or an appropriation of $10,000 for an
observatory can not each so well bear the separate provision of a dis-
bursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employees as in the
case of larger bureaus. There is, however, no practicable way of
arranging this in accordance with the present terms of the appropria-
tions, which may be said to tacitly assume that each of these bureaus
or divisions is thus completely provided for. It is in some cases impos-
sible that it should be so without the expenditure of much more than
the appropriated sum, and the terms of the appropriations should, in
the interest of economy, either recognize the propriety of meeting each
bureaw’s share of these common expenses out of each one’s appro-
priation, or else out of a special appropriation made in their common
interest.

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming a
part of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of
the properties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the
fundamental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion
of the purposes thereof.

Under this section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest alone
being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1894, the unexpended
_ balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report
for last year, was $59,598.50. Interest on the permanent fund in the
Treasury and elsewhere, amounting to $56,153.92, was received during
the year, which, together with a sum of $6,074.38, received from the
sale of publications and from miscellaneous sources, made the total
receipts $62,228.30.

The entire expenditures during the year, including the $1,000 accu-
mulated interest on the Hamilton fund, mentioned above, which was
added to the permanent fund, amounted to $58,825.06, for the details
of which reference is made to the report of the executive committee.
On June 30, 1895, the balance in the Treasury of the United States to
the credit of the secretary for the expenses of the Institution was
$63,001.74, which includes the sum of $10,000 referred to in previous
reports, $5,000 received from the estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like
sum from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter a gift made personally

4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to the secretary to promote certain physical researches. This latter
sum was, with the donor’s consent, deposited by the secretary to the
credit of the current funds of the Institution. .

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, besides
relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which may be
expected to mature as the result of different scientific investigations or
publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 1894-95, of the following appropriations:

All the vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October
2, 1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury, were

BUILDINGS.

On a subsequent page I again call attention to the excessively over-
crowded condition of the National Museum building and to the neces-
sity of continuing the use of several wooden sheds adjacent to the
Smithsonian building for storage purposes, constituting a constant
menace to the safety of the main building and its contents. I can give
no more adequate idea of the real danger from fire that here exists than
by stating that no insurance company was found willing to place insur-
ance upon these sheds or their contents at less than ten times the ordi-
nary rates. The provision made by the last Congress for rent of addi.
tional storage rooms proves inadequate for the needs of the Museum,
as I have represented elsewhere.

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

In continuing much needed improvements in the east wing of the
Smithsonian building, especially with a view to better light and venti-
lation, the lighting of the rooms on the first floor occupied by the
library, has been greatly improved by enlarging the window frames and
replacing the small diamond panes by single sheets of glass. Similar
changes have been made in the Secretary’s office, on the second floor, as
well as in some of the rooms on the third and fourth floors. Several
rooms on the fourth floor, heretofore of no use except for storage, have
been made habitable and have proved useful for various needed pur-
poses.

The sanitary condition of the building has been improved by the
removal of certain objectionable features and by the installation of a
comprehensive system of ventilation by which pure air at an equable
temperature is assured in most of the office rooms. Work upon this
was well advanced at the close of the year.

Another great improvement added during the year is the introduc-
tion of electric lights in all the offices of the east wing, the electric
power being supplied by a special plant, which, with the ventilating
apparatus, has been placed in the basement of the south tower, where
considerable changes were tnade for their accommodation.

For the proper heating and ventilation of the Astro-physical Observa-
tory a dry-air duct has been built connecting the observatory with
the systems of the main building.

These minor repairs which I have thus briefly mentioned have made
the rooms of the east wing much better adapted to use as offices.

RESEARCH.

In pursuance of what appears to be an essential portion of the origi-
nal plan for the organization of the Institution, that its secretary
Should be expected to personally contribute to the advancement of
knowledge, whether in letters or in science, I have given such time as
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

I could spare from engrossing administrative duties to the prosecution
of two independent investigations which had engaged my attention for
several years before I became connected with the Institution, and which
I believe are likely to lead to important scientific and utilitarian results.
The first of these researches, that upon the solar spectrum, has been
carried on in the Astro-physical Observatory, and to it I have referred
more at length in the account of the observatory. The second
research, an investigation of certain physical data of aerodynamics,
has been continued with results which appear to be approaching the
time of publication.

Prof. E. W. Morley’s investigations on the density of oxygen and
hydrogen, referred to in previous reports as aided in part by the Insti-
tution, have been completed, and his memoir is now in press. The
atomic weight of oxygen may be called the base upon which practically
our entire system of atomic weights rests, and a small error in its
measurement becomes large by multiplication in the higher parts of the
atomic-weight scale. Hence its accurate determination is of funda-
mental importance. In his investigation Professor Morley has studied
the problem by two methods:

(1) By the synthesis of water, in which he, for the first time, has
achieved completeness by actually weighing the hydrogen, the oxygen,
and the water formed, whereas all his predecessors took one or another
of these factors by difference.

(2) By the density ratios between oxygen and hydrogen. In this
method he has weighed the gases of greater purity and in larger quan-
tity than hitherto, and he has in some instances operated without the
intervention. of stopcocks, and therefore with no possibility of error due
to leakage. He has also, as a correction to the density ratio, redeter-
mined the composition of water by volume.

By both methods he reaches the same result: O=15.879, with vari-
ation in the fourth decimal place as between the two.

The valuable balance purchased for these investigations has been
returned to the Institution.

The subscription has been continued for 20 copies of the Astronom-
ical Journal as a slight aid to its publication, the separate numbers of
the journal being sent regularly to foreign libraries and observatories
as exchanges of the Institution.

A small grant was made to Dr. Carl Barus to enable him to continue
certain investigations.

The researches that I have here referred to are connected altogether
with the physical sciences. In the biological sciences I may refer to the
work of the occupants of the Smithsonian table at Naples, though the
Institution’s work in this field has been largely indirectly provided
throughits connection with the National Museum. Investigations aided
by the Hodgkins fund are mentioned elsewhere.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. %

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has carried on some interesting ethnological and
natural-history explorations during the year,as noticed in detail on
other pages in the reports on the National Museum and the Bureau of
Ethnology.

I will here call special attention to the benefit that has been derived
from the explorations made by Dr. William L. Abbott and by Mr.
William Astor Chanler and Lieut. von Hohnel in Africa and India.
Many valuable ethnological and natural-history objects which they
have collected on these expeditions have been courteously placed in the
National Museum as additions to the collection they had previously con-
tributed.

In the Azores Prof. William Trelease has gathered some interesting
natural-history specimens.

Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., has made large collections of mam-
mals and pottery in Florida, and Mr. Mark B. Kerr has contributed a
collection of fossils from Ecuador.

Explorations have been continued among the aboriginal villages
in northeastern Arizona. Some particularly interesting explorations
were made in Arizona and Sonora (Mexico) among the Papago and Seri
Indians, where a number of prehistoric ruins were discovered with
extensive irrigation works, and studies were made of the arts and cus-
toms of those hitherto little-known Indians.

Ethnological researches were also carried on among the Kathlamet
Indians of the lower Columbia region and among the Kiowa and
other plains Indians in Indian Territory.

Explorations begun during May in the Red Rock country, southwest
of Flagstaff, Ariz., by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, as a part of the work of
the Bureau of Ethnology, have resulted in the discovery of a group of
extensive cliff ruins hitherto unknown to archeologists and not
despoiled by white men, and excavations in that region were in prog-
ress at the close of the fiscal year.

PUBLICATIONS.

The plan of organization adopted by the Regents in 1847 contem-
plated the publication of a series of reports giving an account of the
new discoveries in science and of the changes made from year to year
in all branches of knowledge not strictly professional, and a second
series of separate treatises on subjects of general interest, consisting
of valuable memoirs translated from foreign languages, or of articles
prepared under the direction of the Institution.

Three series of publications have actually been established, the Con-
tributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual
Reports, the first two being printed at the expense of the Institution,
while the reports are Government documents. The Institution also

issues various publications through the National Museum and the
Bureau of Ethnology.

Contributions to Knowledge-—No memoir of the Contributions to
Knowledge was completed during the present year, though two papers
now in type wiil be published early in the next fiscal year—one of these
is a memoir by Professor Morley on the densities of oxygen and
hydrogen, and the second a report by Drs. J. 8. Billings, S. Weir
Mitchell and D. H. Bergey on investigations carried on by them, under
a grant from the Hodgkins fund, to determine the nature of supposed
poisonous properties of expired air.

It was hoped that during the year two elaborate memoirs, on
“Oceanic ichthyology” and on “Life histories of North American
birds,” mentioned in my last report, would be published, but they are
not yet completed, though they are entirely ready for presswork.

Miscellaneous Collections.—Five papers of this series were issued
during the year, besides separates of the several scientific papers con-
tained in the General Appendix of the Annual Report.

In connection with the system of meteorological observations estab-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution about 1850, a series of meteoro-
logical tables was compiled by Dr. Arnold Guyot, at the request of
Secretary Henry, and was published in 1852. A second edition was
issued in 1857, and a third edition, with further amendmeuts, in 1859.
Though primarily designed for meteorological observers reporting to the
Smithsonian Institution, the tables were so widely used by physicists
that, after twenty-five years of valuable service, the work was again
revised and a fourth edition was published in 1884. In a few years the
demand for the tables exhausted the edition, and it appeared to me
desirable to recast the work entirely, rather than to undertake its revi-
sion again. After careful consideration I decided to publish a new
work in three parts—Meteorological Tables, Geographical Tables, and
Physical Tables—each representative of the latest knowledge in its
field, and independent of the others, but the three forming a homo-
geneous series. Although thus historically related to Dr. Guyot’s
Tables, the present work is so entirely changed with respect to mate-
rial, arrangement, and presentation that if is not a fifth edition of the
older tables, but essentially a new publication.

The first volume of the new series of Smithsonian Tables (the Meteor-
ological Tables) appeared in 1893, and so great has been the demand
for it that a second edition has already become necessary. The second
volume of the series (the Geographical Tables) was published during
this year. It was prepared by Prof. R. 8S. Woodward, formerly of the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, but now of Columbia Col-
lege, New York.

The manuscript of the Physical Tables, prepared by Prof. Thomas
Gray, has been sent to the printer and some progress made toward its
publication. This work will form the third volume of Smithsonian
Tables.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

In continuation of the series of indexes to chemical literature, pre-
pared under the direction and on the recommendation of a committee
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, three
additional pamphlets have been issued, entitled Indexes to the Litera-
tures of Cerium and Lanthanum, by W. H. Magee, Ph. D.; Index to
the Literature ot Didymium, by A. C. Langmuir, Ph. D.; and Bibli-
ography of Aceto Acetic Ester, by Paul H. Seymour, M.S.

One of the treatises in the Miscellaneous Collections published during
the year, entitled The Varieties of the Human Species, by Giuseppe
Sergi, a translation of that author’s work, Le Varieta Umane, Principi
e metodo di Classificazione, Torino, 1893, sets forth quite fully his
doctrines of craniology, elaborating a plan for a classification of human
species based on shapes of the crania.

AS a special publication of the Institution there was issued a Diary
of a Journey through Mongolia and Tibet in 1891 and 1892, by Mr.
William Woodville Rockhill. It is an octavo volume of 443 pages,
illustrated by 13 text figures and 28 plates, together with a large map
on a scale of 32 miles to the inch, showing the route traversed and the
topographic features of those little-known regions. The journey was
undertaken partly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.
In addition to much valuable information gathered concerning the
characteristic features of those countries, Mr. Rockhill made some very
interesting ethnological collections for the National Museum, which are
described in detail in one of the accompanying papers of the Museum
teport for 1893.

A revised edition of the Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Peri-
odicals (1665-1882), published by the Institution in 1885, is being pre-
pared under the direction of Dr. H. C. Bolton. In this new work the
periodicals in the former edition will be continued to 1895, and new publi-
cations will be added, making the catalogue as near as possible complete
to the time of printing.

A supplement to the Bibliography of Chemistry, 1492-1892, published
in 1893, is being prepared by Dr. Bolton, with the assistance of several
collaborators in European libraries, and will bring the work down as
near as practicable to date.

Annual Reports.—The Smithsonian Annual Report is the only public
document published by the Institution, and the greater portion of the
edition is distributed through the document rooms of the Senate and
House of Representatives. It is in two volumes—the first devoted to
the Institution proper and the second part relating to the National
Museum. The General Appendix of Part I consists of selected memoirs
of a special interest and permanent value which have, for the most part,
already appeared elsewhere, and which are sufficiently untechnical to
be interesting to the general reader.

The Annual Report of the Institution for 1893 and of the National
Museum for 1892 were received from the Public Printer and distributed
during the year, and the Museum report for 1893 was nearly completed.
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The manuscript of both volumes of the report for 1894 has been sent
to the printer, and some progress made toward their publication. -

The secretary’s report for the year ending June 30, 1894, was sub-
mitted in printed form to the Board of Regents at their January meeting.

Proceedings and bulletin of the National Museum.—The publications
of the Museum are discussed on another page, and therefore need no
reference here other than to mention that there were issued fifty-six
separate papers of the proceedings, chiefly on natural-history subjects,
and one number of the bulletin series, of interest chiefly to entomolo-
gists. ;

Bureau of Ethnology publications.—The eleventh and twelfth annual
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology were published during the year,
and the thirteenth report was put in type, while the manuscript of the
fourteenth and fifteenth reports have been sent to the printer, thus
bringing the work practically to date. The contents of the published
volumes, as also mention of several papers of the bulletin series, are
discussed on subsequent pages.

LIBRARY.

The growth of the library steadily continues, 31,953 titles having been
added during the past year. Among the more notable accessions, I
may mention a collection of albums of photographs presented by the
Sultan of Turkey, which portray the natural scenery, the art, education,
industries, and government of the Ottoman Empire.

It has been possible to improve the light in the reading room of the
library offices and to assign another small room to the library, and a
small collection of wholesome popular literature has been commenced
for the use of the employees of the Institution.

The results of the plan to increase the library by exchange, detailed
in my report for 1887-88, have been carefully tabulated with a view to
the completion of incomplete sets of periodicais and the publications of
_learned societies, and to further additions to the already large list.

This plan has thus far, after seven years’ labor, secured for the Insti-
tution 2,035 new periodicals and the entire or partial completion of
1,133 defective series.

The tabulation shows that the Institution now possesses 869 complete
sets of foreign publications and 395 of American publications, while
888 sets of foreign publications and 569 sets of American publications
are aS complete as the publishers are able to make them.

The collection of scientific and other periodicals possessed by the
Institution is now probably the largest in the English-speaking world—
numbering, approximately, 4,000. Many of these are no longer pub-
lished, and in some cases the exchange is discontinued. At present
there are currently received 3,045; of these, 1,372 are in the English
language, 621 in German, and 423 in French, the remainder represent-
ing almost all the languages of civilized nations, and including publi-

cations even in modern Greek, Japanese, and Arabic. There are 825
annuals, 397 quarterlies, 670 monthlies, and the remainder are issued
at different intervals or irregularly. A portion are for the present
retained for reference, but are ultimately designed for the Smithsonian
deposit at the Library of Congress. Itis my desire that the Institution
shall keep abreast of the ever-growing number of scientific periodicals
and journals and of the publications of societies cultivating the various
branches of science. The work is never ending, and the preparation of
new lists and correspondence for exchange and revision are constantly
going on.

The time is now not far distant when an adequate provision will be
made for the major portion of the Smithsonian library, which is, in
accordance with the act of 1865, deposited with the Library of Con-
gress. The Librarian cf Congress states that the Smithsonian library
will be arranged in a separate stack of the new building, now completed
and rapidly approaching the time when it will be habitable, and that a
Special reading room, convenient to the main reading room and the
stack, will be provided. It may be suitable to mention, in connection
with the library, the fact that the Institution is now, as it has been
from its inception, heartily interested in the publication of bibliograph-
ical memoirs and in the general subject of the bibliography of science.

During the past year I have been informed of a project of the Royal
Society for the preparation of a bibliography of science, beginning
with the year 1900, and some correspondence on this important subject
has taken place between the Royal Society and the Institution. At
the present writing no definite result has been reached.

HODGKINS FUND.

‘It is gratifying to the Institution to note the wide interest taken in
the Hodgkins fund prizes which were offered for certain essays upon
the properties of atmospheric air, in accordance with the wishes of the
donor of the fund, Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins. ‘

The recent discoveries made upon the composition of atmospheric air
have been most important, and researches now in progress seem to
promise still further additions to the knowledge of our atmosphere.

It will be remembered that three prizes were offered—one for $10,000,
one for $2,000, and one for $1,000; the terms of competition being stated
in a circular issued by the Institution in 1893 and printed in full in my
report for that year.

For reasons stated in a circular issued in June, 1894, the time for
submitting memoirs in competition for the Hodgkins fund prizes was
extended from July 1 to December 31, 1894, and resulted in a consid-
erable increase in the number of papers, so that the total number up to
December 31, 1894, was 218.

It is interesting to note the various countries that participated in
this competition: the United States contributing 66 memoirs, France
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

40, Germany 33, England 19, Italy 8, Russia 6, Austria-Hungary 9, and
Denmark 4; the other countries represented were Belgium, Scotland,
Ireland, Norway, Bohemia, Finland, Spain, Bavaria, Switzerland,
Servia, India, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina.

As soon as the competition was closed the following circular was
sent to all participants, and was published in several of the leading
scientific journals:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
HODGKINS PRIZES.

WASHINGTON, January 10, 1895.

Sir: The time for the reception of treatises or essays offered in com-
petition for the Hodgkins fund prizes of $10,000, of $2,000, and of
$1,000, respectively, closed on the 31st of December, 1894, and all —
papers so offered are now in the hands of the committee of award.

In view of the very large number of competitors, of the delay which
will be necessarily caused by the intended careful examination, and of
the further time which may be required to consult a European advisory
committee, if one be appointed, it is announced that authors are now
at liberty to publish these treatises or essays without prejudice to their
interest as competitors.

Very respectfully, S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The circular was also issued in French, as follows:

MONSIEUR: Le terme fixé pour la réception des traités ou des essais
soumis au concours du fonds Hodgkins, pour les prix de 10,000, 2,000,
et 1,000 dollars, est expiré le 31 décembre 1894 et tous les ouvrages
présentés sont actuellement entre les mains de la commission des
récompenses.

En raison du tres-grand nombre de concurrents, du délai qu’entrai-
nera examen sérieux que l’on compte faire, et du temps qui pourrait
étre exigé pour prendre V’avis du comité consultatif d’Europe, s’il en
est nommé un, il est donné avis que ces traités ou essais pourront
maintenant étre publiés par leurs auteurs en toute liberté et sans que
leurs intéréts de concurrents en soient atteints.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The committee of award was composed of Dr. S. P. Langley, chair-
man, ex officio; Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution; Asst. Surg. Gen. John 8S. Billings, United States
Army; and Prof. M. W. Harrington, Chief of the United States Weather

sureau.

The foreign advisory committee was represented by Mons. J. Janssen,
Prof. T. H. Huxley, and Professor von Helmholtz; and after the death
of the latter, Dr. W. von Bezold was added.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ihe

Immediately upon the close of the competition the award committee
began examination of the papers, and at the end of the fiscal year had
practically completed their labors. Although the awards were not
formally announced until August 9, yet in view of the importance
and opportuneness of the subject it seems proper to include the com-
mittee’s report in my report for this year.

tO of the committee appointed by the Smithsonian Institution to award
the Hodgkins fund prizes.

The committee of award for the Hodgkins prizes of the Smithsonian
Institution has completed its examination of the 218 papers submitted
in competition by contestants.

The committee is composed of the following members:

Dr. 8. P. Langley, chairman, ex-officio; Dr. G. Brown Goode, appointed
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; Asst. Surg. Gen. John
S. Billings, by the president of the National Academy of Sciences; Prof.
M. W. Harrington, by the president of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

. The foreign advisory committee, as first constituted, was represented

by Mons. J. Janssen, Prof. T. H. Huxley,and Professor von Helmholtz;
and after the recent loss of the latter, Dr. W. von Bezold was added.
After consultation with these eminent men, the committee decided as
follows:

First prize, of $10,000, for a treatise embodying some new and
important discoveries in regard to the nature or properties of atmos-
pherie air, to Lord Rayleigh, of London, and Prof. William Ramsay, of
the University College, London, for the ‘discovery of argon, a new ele-
ment of the atmosphere.

The second prize, of $2,000, is not awarded, owing to the failure of
any contestant to comply strictly with the terms of the offer.

The third prize, of $1,000, to Dr. Henry de Varigny, of Paris, for the
best popular treatise upon atmospherie air, its properties and relation-
ships. Dr. de Varigny’s essay is entitled ‘‘ L’Air et la Vie.”

the award of any medals, there remained several papers to which the
committee had been unable to give any prize, but to which they had
felt desirous to give some honorable mention, and on their representing
this to the Smithsonian Institution, they have been commissioned to do
So and also to give certain medals of silver and bronze which had been
subsequently placed at their disposition.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

Immediately after the announcement of the award of the first prize
to Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay, of London, for their discovery
of “argon,” an element of the atmosphere, a draft for $10,000 was
despatched to these gentlemen, through the courtesy of the Department
of State, and of the Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, United States ambassador
to Great Britain.

With regard to other work carried on by the Hodgkins fund, I may
state that Dr. J. S. Billings and Dr. 8S. Weir Mitchell have completed
the investigations begun by them in 1893, under a grant from the
Hodgkins fund, to determine the nature of the peculiar substances of
organic origin contained in the air expired by human beings, and their
report 1S now in press.

In their report the investigators state that for a number of years
prior to 1888 the prevailing view among physicians and sanitarians
had been that the discomfort and dangers to health and life which had
been known to exist, sometimes at least, in unventilated rooms occu-
pied by a number of human beings were largely or entirely due to
peculiar organic matters contained in air expired by these persons, and
that the increase in carbonic acid due to respiration had but little effect
in producing these results, its chief importance being that it furnished
a convenient means of determining the amount of vitiation of the air.
Recently, however, several experimenters have concluded that the
organic matters in the exhaled breath are not harmful, at all events to
animals, and the main object of the investigations was to determine
the correctness of these conclusions.

The investigators found that the air in inhabited rooms, such as the
hospital ward in which experiments were made, is contaminated from
many sources besides the expired air of the occupants, and that the
most important of these contaminations are in the form of minute par-
ticles or dust, in which there are micro-organisms, including some
of the bacteria which produce inflammation and suppuration. It is
probable that these dust particles were the only really dangerous ele-
ments in the air, and it appears improbable that there is any peculiar
volatile poisonous matter in the air expired by healthy men and ani-
mals other than carbonic acid.

In concluding their report the authors state that the results of the
investigations, taken in connection with the results of other researches
summarized in the report, indicate that some of the theories upon which
modern systems of ventilation are based are either without foundation
or doubtful, and that the problem of securing comfort and health in
inhabited rooms requires the consideration of the best methods of pre-
venting or disposing of dusts of various kinds, of properly regulating
temperature and moisture, and of preventing the entrance of poisonous
gases like-carbonic oxide derived from heating and lighting apparatus,
rather than upon simply diluting the air to a certain standard of pro-
portion of carbonic acid present.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work of Dr.O. Lummer and Dr. E. Pringsheim, under a grant from
the Hodgkins fund, on the determination of an exact measure of the
cooling of gases while expanding, with a view to revising the value of
that important constant technically termed the “gamma” function,
was referred to in my last report.

The limitations of the fund have rendered it necessary, with slight
exceptions, to postpone further action on requests for grants, although
it is hoped that it will prove practicable at a later date to aid certain
important researches which are under consideration.

A design for the Hodgkins fund medal of the Institution was
decided upon in May, 1895, and the preparation of the dies has been
ordered.

AVERY FUND.

Mr. Robert Stanten Avery, of Washington City, died September 12,
1894, bequeathing the greater portion of his estate to the Smithsonian
Institution. The estate has not yet been fully administered upon, and
I am therefore unable to state the exact amount of the fund.

CORRESPONDENCE.

Besides the very voluminous routine and business correspondence of
the National Museum, or special correspondence of the Bureau of Eth-
nology, of the Zoological Park, and of the Bureau of Exchanges, a great
number of letters come directly to the Seeretary’s office from all parts of
the country, on every imaginable subject that can by any possibility
be supposed to have a relation to science. Requests for statistics that
may be of great value and importance to the writer, inquiries from
teachers and others, are constantly received, and it is still my aim that
this correspondence shall receive the same careful attention that was
bestowed upon it in the early days of the Institution, when the num-
ber of letters received formed but a small fraction of the present num-
ber; but it will be understood that the fulfilment of this aim grows
increasingly difficult. An effort is made to give a full reply to all such
inquiries, often invelving a large amount of labor on the part of the
curators, as well as of those immediately occupied with the correspond-
ence of the Institution, out of proportion to the merits of the case.

Of the more important correspondence of the Secretary’s office, 3,601
entries were made in the registry book of letters received during the
year, while double that number of letters were received and referred to
the different bureaus of the Institution inthesametime. A modification
of the system of registry was introduced on January 1, 1895, by which
each letter receives an arbitrary number indicating the date of the
letter and a subsidiary number giving the order of entry on that day.

The card index of letters received and written is now complete from
January 1, 1892, to the present day, constituting the current file. The
correspondence prior to the current file has been placed in the
archives, and the index to the files is now practically complete.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

As I have elsewhere remarked, this work of the Institution could be
much expedited, as far as the purely clerical part of it is concerned,
were al appropriation available for the general administrative pur-
poses to which I have referred more at length under “Administration.”

MISCELLANEOUS.

Naples table-—Dr. J.S. Billings, U.S. A., Dr. E. B. Wilson, Dr. J. A.
Ryder, and Dr. C. W. Stiles, as an advisory committee, have continued
valuable aid in examining the teStimonials of applicants for the occu-
pancy of the Naples table, as well as in the consideration of various
questions in connection with the assignment of the table, to which I have
asked attention. Dr. Ryder died in April, 1895, and was succeeded on
the committee by Dr. Harrison Allen.

The Smithsonian table at the Naples Zoological Station has proved of
value to the investigators who have carried on biological studies there
during the year.

Among the numerous additional applications for occupancy of the
table the following have been favorably acted upon:

Lewis Murbach, Ph. B., B. Sc., University of Michigan; appointed
for three months during summer and autumn of 1894.

T. H. Morgan, B.S., Ph. D., Johns Hopkins University; appointed
for six months, November 9, 1894, to May 9, 1895.

Herbert Osborn, professor of zoology and entomology, lowa Agricul-
tural College; appointed for three months in spring and summer of 184,

Thetable has been occupied constantly since October 1, 1893, the date
of the first appointment, with the exception of May, 1894. In several
instances Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station, has courteously
arranged for the accommodation of two occupants at the same time.

In order that all investigators may be given an equal opportunity to
avail themselves of the facilities for study at Naples, final action upon
applications is not taken more than six months in advance of the date
for which the table is desired, and when more than one application is
filed for the same period, presumably of equal merit, the assignment is
made according to priority of application. No appointment is made for
a period of more than six months.

The reports thus far submitted by the investigators who have occu-
pied the table indicate an appreciation of the special privileges there
offered for study.

Atlanta Exposition —Under the provisions of an appropriation made
by Congress for a Government exhibit at the Cotten States and Inter-
national Exposition at Atlanta, during the autumn of 1895, a very
satisfactory exhibit has been prepared, illustrating every phase of the
activities of the Institution and its bureaus, especially the National
Museum.

Oriental Congress.—As delegate of the Smithsonian Institution Prof.
Paul Haupt attended the Tenth International Congress of Oriental-

sm 95——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ists, held at Geneva, Switzerland, September 3-12, 1894. Besides the
Smithsonian the following American institutions and learned societies
were represented by delegates: Columbia College, Cornell University,
Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, University of
Pennsylvania, American Oriental Society, American Philosophical
Society, Bureau of Education. The Congress was opened by the Pres-
ident of the Swiss Republic, Colonel Frey. The president of the con-
gress was the well-known Geneva egyptologist, M. Edouard Naville.
The work of the congress was organized in eight sections: India, lin-
guistics and Aryan languages, Semitic languages, Mohammedan lan-
guages, Egypt and African languages, Extreme Hast, Greece and the
Orient, Oriental geography and ethnography. There were altogether
about 600 members (about 100 of whom were ladies), representing
Africa, America, Asia, and 16 European countries. More than 275
(about 60 ladies) were present, not including those living at Geneva.
Of the 28 American subscribers (including 5 ladies), 12 (4 ladies)
attended the congress. Papers were read by the following American
members: Haupt, Jackson, Merriam, Rogers.

At the first meeting of the first section the great Sanskrit scholar of
the University of Berlin, Prof. A. Weber, referred to the death of Pro-
fessor Whitney, and the proposition of the president of the section,
Lord Reay, to send a resolution of respect and condolence to Mrs.
Whitney, was unanimously adopted.

The Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists will be held at
Paris in 1897.

Archives.—The special room set apart on the fourth floor for the bet-
ter arrangement of the valuable archives of the Institution has proved
of great convenience, as there is frequent necessity for reference to the
early correspondence files, or to other records.

Assignment of rooms.—A room in the basement of the east wing,
which has been specially fitted up with piers for pendulum experiments
and connected by telegraph, through the Western Union Telegraph
Company’s office, with the United States Naval Observatory, is still
reserved for the occasional use of the officers of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The Astro-physical Observatory standard clock has been mounted
in the room adjoining, where it is protected from sudden changes in
temperature and other disturbances to which it would be liable in the
observatory building. It can be compared with the Naval Observa-
tory time signals, and provision has been made for transmitting its own
signals to any part of the Institution.

History of James Smithson.—Arrangements are in progress for plac-
ing bronze tablets on Smithson’s tomb and in the English church at
Genoa, in memory of the founder of the Smithsonian Institution.

A further English record has added somewhat to the knowledge of
Smithson’s personal family.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

A complete set of the publications of the Institution has been sent
to Pembroke College, Oxford, where Smithson received his education.

Portrait of Secretary Baird.—The Board having authorized a portrait
of Professor Baird, one has been painted by Mr. Robert Gordon Hardie
and placed in the Regents’ room of the Institution.

The Hamilton fund.—tThe original amount of $1,000, the bequest of
Mr. James Hamilton, of Pennsylvania, received by the Institution in
1874, has been increased during the year to $2,000 by the addition of
accumulated interest, under authority given by the Regents in their

- meeting of January 23, 1895.

American Historical Association.—The annual report of the American
Historical Association for the year 1894 has been transmitted to Con-
gress through the Secretary of the Institution, in accordance with the
act of incorporation of the association. These reports are Congressional
documents and the Institution has no control of their distribution.

American Medical Association.—A large collection of medical books,
which had for many years been in the care of the Institution as the
property of the American Medical Association, has been transferred
by the association to the Newberry Library in Chicago.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In my last annual statement I pointed out three conditions which
are operating to seriously retard the growth of the National Museum:
First, the lack of space for the installation of objects which should be
placed on exhibition; second, the unsymmetrical growth of the collec-
tions; and third, the fact that the storage of collections in the wooden
sheds south of the Smithsonian building, as well as in the basement of
the building itself, is most undesirable and dangerous. The sum of $900,
allowed for 1896, will be necessarily expended in the rental of shop
and storage room in place of the “ Armory building.” The actually
dangerous wooden sheds must therefore remain occupied until a sum
of money is provided which will enable me to discontinue their use
altogether by renting other quarters, removed entirely from proximity
to the Smithsonian building.

The problem of even providing shelter of any kind for the vast
amount of material daily received from persons interested in the growth
and work of the Museum, still remains unsolved. The Institution is
placed in an embarrassing position. It has been designated by law as
the only depository of collections offered to, or made under the auspices
of, the Government, and can not, under the law, refuse to receive them.
The fact remains, however, that when accepted, there is no suitable
place in which to store them, and no space in the Museum building to
exhibit such of the objects as should properly be shown to the public.
As I have already pointed out, there is probably no museum in the
world in which so small a proportion of the objects worthy of exhibition
is visible to the public, or in which the objects exhibited are crowded
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

together so closely. It is now more true than ever that if another
museum building as large as the present one were provided, it could
be at once filled with specimens already on hand.

In my estimates to Congress I have frequently dwelt upon the need
of larger appropriations for the preservation of the collections, but
regret to say that no substantial increase has yet been made. Indeed,
the amount recently appropriated for the coming year (1895-96) is
nearly $2,000 less than for 1892, although the accessions since that
time have already amounted to more than 375,000 specimens. In my
estimates for 1897, recently submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury,
I placed stress upon the fact that the purchase of collections is now
essential for the completion of large and important series, the deficien-
cies in which can not be supplied in any other way.: Valuable collee-
tions which should by all means be acquired by the United States for
its National Museum are every year passing beyond our control, and
American students will be compelled more than in the past to pursue
their researches in the museums of foreign countries.

I desire to repeat that an unduly large proportion of the curators
are not compensated for their services from the Museum appropriation.
This is not as it should be, although without larger appropriations it is
impossible to make any additions to thesalaried staff. Many on the
clerical force, too, who have by long training become valuable, are
paid at rates considerably less than for similar services in the Execu-
tive Departments, and it is difficult to keep the force in effective condi-
tion on this account.

The resources of the Museum have been taxed to the utmost to pro-
vide cases for the collections, but the amount appropriated is altogether
inadequate. The sum of $10,000 which was allowed for the present
year (1895) is not sufficient for the construction of new cases and for
repairing old ones. I am therefore about to submit an estimate of
$30,000 for the year 1897. It not unfrequently happens that valuable
collections are offered to the Museum on condition that suitable cases
be provided. This seems a fair requirement, but it is one which unfor-
tunately the Museum is not always in a position to meet.

With a view to adding to the area available for the display of collec-
tions, I included in my estimates for this year (1895) an item of $8,000
for the erection of two galleries, one in the southwest court, and
another in the southeast range. Galleries were provided for in the
original plans for the Museum building, and can be supported so as
not to detract from the appearance of the halls or to interfere with the
present system of installation. No appropriation, however, was made.
The same amount was included for this- purpose in the estimates for
1896, but was again refused. I shall repeat the recommendation in my
estimates for 1897.

By the provisions of the new printing bill, as interpreted by the Pub-
lic Printer, the editions of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

have been reduced to 1,000 copies. This is most unfortunate, and unless
relief is obtained at once, will canse the suspension of the greater part
of the distribution of those volumes. It has hitherto been possible to
supply 2,300 of the most important libraries and about 500 specialists
with our publications, but unless the former number of copies is again
allowed, very little can be done in either direction. Furthermore, the
possibility of securing in exchange the publications of other institu-
tions, will be almost entirely removed. It is often possible to acquire
valuable specimens in exchange for publications, even when the owners
would not part with them fora money consideration. Papers of great
scientific value are not unfrequently offered to the Museum for publi-
cation, but it is now becoming necessary to decline to publish them,
as their acceptance would swell the cost of the annual printing for
the Museum to a sum far beyond the present allotment. Many impor-
tant papers published by the Museum are out of print, and should at
once be reprinted to supply the urgent demand, but this can not be
done without a larger appropriation.

It is not too much to say that the usefulness of the Museum will be
considerably impaired if the editions are not at least increased to their
former extent, namely, 3,000 copies. The relations of the Museum with
the colleges, scientific schools, scientific and technical societies in the
United States, as well as with the principal centers of learning through-
out the world, will be impaired. It should be borne in mind that the
publications of the Museum are not “public documents,” so that the
possibility of obtaining the usual increase of copies is precluded, none
others being printed excepting those which are actually paid for from
the Museum allotment for labels, Proceedings, and Bulletins. In view
of these facts I can not too strongly urge that the National Museum be
excepted from the restrictions of the printing act of January 12, 1895,
so far as the extent of the editions of its publications is concerned, and
that it be permitted to issue as large an edition both of Proceedings
and Bulletins as can be procured out of the Museum allotment. I have
asked for $18,000 for the year 1897, and am quite confident that this is
not by any means too large for the purpose. It is my belief that if
this amount be allowed—and provided that the Museum be removed
from the restriction of the printing act in this particular—the number
of copies can be increased to 5,000. This would enable the Museum to |
meet its obligations, and to use a fair proportion of its publications in
exchange for specimens as well as for the publications of other scientific
institutions.

In recognition of services being rendered to the Museum the hon-
orary title of ‘‘ Associate” has been conferred on Dr. Theodore N. Gill,
in zoology, Dr. R. E. OC. Stearns, in zoology, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, in
comparative anatomy, and Dr. C. A. White, in paleontology.

By act of Congress approved August 18, 1894, the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Museum were directed to participate in
2? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, commencing
September 18 and closing December 31, 1895. With this in view it
became necessary for many of the curators to devote a large share of
the year to the preparation of suitable exhibits. A description of these
will accompany the report of the Assistant Secretary for 1896.

Large and important accessions have been received, as usual, from
the United States Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture,
the Bureau of Ethnology, and the U.S. Fish Commission.

It is gratifying to note that Dr. William L. Abbott and Mr. William
Astor Chanler and Lieut. von Hohnel have continued to contribute
valuable collections of ethnological and natural history objects, obtained
in connection with their respective explorations in Africa and India.
The Museum still enjoys the cooperation of several officials of the Geo-
logical Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commis-
Sion aS honorary curators of collections.

About 127,000 specimens have been added to the collections during
the year. In view of the fact that no special effort has been made to
acquire material, this large addition would be very gratifying if the
conditions were such that it were possible to administer it properly.

In the Appendix accompanying this report some of the most impor-
tant operations of the Museum during the year are briefly referred to.
The report of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the National Museum,
constituting the second volume of the Smithsonian Report, discusses
fully the work of the Museum during the year.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The researches upon the ethnology of the American Indians have
been carried forward, as heretofore, under the direction of Maj. J. W.
Powell. Asin previous years, a certain amount of field exploration
has been carried on. Especially interesting have been the results of the
expedition in the arid region in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, known
as Papagueria, lying south of the Gila River, west of the Sierra Madre.
The region first visited was that occupied by the Papago Indians; nearly
all of their villages and rancherias were examined and a number of pre-
historic ruins were discovered, among them those of villages with
extensive irrigation works. Subsequently was visited the domain of
the Seri Indians, occupying Tiburon Island in the Gulf of California,
and a considerable region of the adjacent mainland in western Sonora.

The Papago Indians are peaceful and represent the higher grade of
aboriginal intelligence among the inhabitants of Mexico and Central
America; the Seris are savage and primitive in their habits, being prob-
ably the least advanced of the North American tribes still remaining.
The archeological results of the collections obtained are of special
interest, since the region is very peculiar and but partially known.

The surveys in the Canyon de Chelly, referred to in previous reports,
were completed during the year, and an account of the work will soon
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

be published, which it is hoped will be an important contribution to
our knowledge of the origin and early history of the cliff dwellings
and pueblos of the Southwest.

Experts have also been engaged in the Indian Territory during the
year investigating the heraldic systems and the calendars of the Kiowa
Indians: Toward the close of the year a special expedition was sent
to excavate the ruins of the pueblos in the little-known country south-
west of Flagstaff and at Tusayan, in northeastern Arizona. This sec-
tion was under the charge of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, and the results,
so far as reported, have been exceedingly important.

The death of Col. Garrick Mallery interrupted for the time the work
of the Bureau in the investigation of Indian sign languages. The
study of the Mexican codices and inscriptions has been continued, and
an important paper on the Maya year has been published.

As during previous years, especial attention has been paid to the
study of myths, beliefs, and ceremonials, especially those of the Zuni
Indians, who are particularly interesting by reason of the important
part played by mythology in their organizations.

The illness of Mr. James C. Pilling, the distinguished specialist, who
has for many years had charge of the bibliographical work of the
Bureau, has for a time put an end to the publication of bibliographical
material. It is fortunate that so much of the important work of Mr.
Pilling has already been completed and printed.

The study of the aboriginal languages, which has from the beginning
been a most important branch of the work of the Institution, has been
carried forward uninterruptedly, and has resulted in a preliminary
classification of the Indian tribes. During the year a large amount of
new material has been permanently recorded and satisfactory progress
has been made in the arrangement of the vocabularies and grammars
already collected. The Bureau has in its fireproof vaults several hun-
dred valuable manuscripts pertaining to the Indian languages which
are available for the use of students, pending the work of editing and
publication. The Bureau has also suffered a severe loss in this depart-
ment of the work in the death of Rev. J. Owen Dorsey.

In addition to the special branches of investigation already referred
to, much has been done in the assembling and classifying ot informa-
tion concerning the Indian tribes.

Satisfactory progress was made in the publication of the results of
the Bureau’s researches during the year. Hight complete volumes,
comprising 10 papers, covering nearly 2,000 pages, with 674 illustra-
tions, were received from press and in part distributed, and other
volumes were made ready for the Public Printer.

Further details concerning the operations of the Bureau may be
found in the statement of Director Powell, which accompanies this
report as Appendix II.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

In making arrangements for the distribution of its early publications
the Smithsonian Institution was led to establish relations with foreign
scientific societies and libraries, which have proved of very great value
in giving effect to one of the principal aims of its founder, “the diffu-
sion of knowledge.”

In England and Germany, with which the most active exchange of
scientific literature has always been maintained, it has been found
necessary to establish special agents, who devote a large part of
their time to the Institution’s interests.

There thus exists a channel of communication between this and for-
eign countries by means of which societies or individuals engaged in
the promotion of scientific work can exchange publications practically
without expense.

The extent of the service is best illustrated, though yet imperfectly,
by the accompanying map of the world, which conveys an idea of how
the more than 24,000 correspondents of the exchange service are dis-
tributed. Upon such a small scale the precise statistical distribution
can not, of course, be shown.

The Smithsonian exchange service, which at first was mainly for the
distribution of scientific publications, underwent an important change
when it became the agency for the United States Government in the
exchange of its parliamentary documents for similar documents of for-
eign Governments, and though Congress now makes annually an appro-
priation for carrying out the provisions of a treaty formally entered into
by our Government to maintain a bureau for “the free transmission of
the works exchanged,” these appropriations have never been sufficient
to meet the entire expense involved, and the service is only kept up by
continuing to rely upon the generosity of many of the ocean steamship
lines, which in the early days of its existence granted to the Institu-
tion the privilege of free transportation in recognition of its disinter-
ested and important scientific work.

The important change to which I refer lies in the fact that so large.
a proportion! of the books carried now consists of Government publi-
cations, such, for instance, as the Congressional Record and reports;
indeed, in the transmission of such documents alone the Institution
has in past years expended of its own private fund over $38,000,” for
which it has never been reimbursed.

The appropriation for the past year having been restored to its former
amount of $17,000, and slightly increased amounts having been made
available to certain Government bureaus for the distribution of their

1The exchange of Government documents is about 70 per cent of the entire
exchange work.

We or

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

reports, it became possible to bring up the arrears of work to which
I called especial attention in my last report.

The disbursements on account of the expenses of the exchange office
during the year amounted to $21,090.61, of which $16,997.99 were paid
from the appropriation of $17,000 by Congress; $4,092.62 were paid by
Government bureaus or private institutions, the balance at the close
of the fiscal year being held to meet outstanding obligations.

That the exchange service is generously appreciated by its great
number of correspondents in this country, libraries, State and private
institutions, and individuals, I am well aware, but Iam also aware that
with the resources at command it is uot keeping pace with the growth
of the country and the reasonable. expectation of its correspondents
for the prompt transportation that modern facilities warrant. The
improvements that are needed—more foreign agents in the pay of the
Institution, more frequent use of rapid transportation, more clerical
assistance in properly recording and accounting for packages intrusted
to the care of the service—can only be attained by securing from Con-
gress an increased appropriation.

In view of the near approach to completion of the building for the
Library of Congress it would seem desirable that steps should be taken
to secure a more adequate return from foreign Governments for the
large number of publications of the United States sent abroad. How
much can be accomplished in this way that cannot be done by corre-
spondence I personally experienced in a visit made during the past year
in the interest of this Government exchange to the minister of public
instruction in Paris which will, it is hoped, result in securing a very
considerable increase in the number of documents received from the
French Government.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The appropriation made for this purpose for the service of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1895, was in the following terms:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures for animals; and for administrative purposes,
care, subsistence, and transportation of animals, including salaries
or compensation of all necessary employees, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, fifty thousand doilars; one-half of
which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia
and the other half from the Treasury of the United States; and here-
after a report in detail of the expenses on account of the National
Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the beginning of each
regular session.

The appropriation was not made until August 18, 1894, when the
working season was already considerably advanced, and this led to
delay and uncertainty in the plans for the year, and owing to this and
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the limited amount no change in the character of the development has
seemed advisable. It may accordingly be said that the principal aim
of the past year has been to keep the animals on hand in proper healthy
condition and to improve the general appearance of the park as much
as practicable with the limited funds available.

The general agitation of the question of a proper system of streets
and roadways in the District of Columbia which has occurred during
the last year, owing to the passage of an act authorizing the District
Commissioners to establish such a system, has had its effect upon the
park in an indirect manner, as it has led to a fuller consideration of
the means of access to the park and its probable development in the
future.

In the District act of August 7, 1894, the following appropriation was
made:

For opening entrance into Zoological Park, from Woodley Lane road,
and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from said entrance along
the west bank of Rock Creek, two thousand five hundred dollars, to be
paid wholly from the revenues of the District of Columbia.

As this appropriation was associated with others relating solely to
District affairs and was payable wholly from District revenues, it
seemed proper that the disbursement of the funds should be made by
the District Commissioners, who commenced the construction of the
roads described in the act.

With the desire that the road might finally come under the control
of the park, Mr. H. P. Waggaman, a property owner in that vicinity
presented to the park a strip of land, as shown in the plat herewith
submitted. (See W.) This addition amounted to 1.217 acres, increas-
ing the total area of the park to 168.70 acres.

The appropriation was wholly insufficient to complete the roadway,
and an additional amount was appropriated for the prosecution of this
work by the sundry civil act of March 2, 1895, in the following terms:

For continuing the entrance into the Zoological Park from Woodley
Lane, and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from said entrance
along the west bank of Rock Creek, five thousand dollars, to be imme-
diately available, which sum is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, one-half chargeable to the
revenues of the District of Columbia.

In accordance with the terms of this appropriation the work on this
road was continued, and there is at present a heavy fill completed from
the Woodley road down into the park. With the very steep grade at
this point it has not been possible to do more than to rough out this
road, and it is hardly practicable for carriages. In order to complete
it a still greater fill should be made, the road should be macadamized,
and a sidewalk constructed. It will then be necessary to construct a
bridge across the creek at the point marked A, as the steep cliff on the
right side of the creek where the road now ends makes it impracticable
“TAGOI| WOYS “HYVd WWOIDO1OOZ IVWNOILVN JO MalA SAS-S.0ulg

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2F

to carry the road any farther on that bank. Having crossed the creek,
the road should continue along the stream on the left bank, traversing
the region where the Adams mill formerly stood, and then, as it again
reaches a precipitous bank, it should cross on another bridge at or near
the point marked B, and communicate with the system of roads now
established in the park.

As this road will probably become in time one of the main drives
through the park system, it should be well built, have easy grades, and
be provided with bridges not only of a substantial character but suit-
able otherwise to the scenery in which they are to stand, leading as the
road does through one of the most beautiful and picturesque valleys in
the vicinity of Washington.

Plans for a system of roadways for the District have been completed
for that section lying to the eastward of the park. Here a broad street,
to be known as the “Park Drive,” reaches the boundary of the park
at its southeastern corner and thence proceeds along the eastern
side by gentle curves adapted to the topography of the region, as
shown upon the accompanying plan. The establishment of this road
will greatly improve the access to the park, which has always suffered
from the steep grades that are necessary for descent into the valley
of Rock Creek. It will, however, entail some new difficulties which
should be met at once. The road does not skirt the boundary of the
park at all points, but touches or leaves it according to the contour
of the ground and the practicability of the grade. Some tracts of land
are therefore left between the drive and the park, and if these become
built upon, a succession of private houses will be thrust directly upon
the boundary, marring the air of seclusion that was one of the objects
for which the expenditure of the first purchase was made, and which
is still a principal attraction of the valley.

In order to avoid this the land in question should be added to the
park, the eastern boundary of which would then lie along a broad and
excellent roadway affording access to the park at several convenient
points. The accompanying map shows the land which should be added.
It involves a strip (C) lying immediately south of the bear pits much
needed for the security of the animals confined there. At present the
boundary of the park is so near the pits that the bank is very steep, and
as it is composed in considerable degree of soil and decomposed rock it
constantly crumbles under the action of the weather and precipitates
loose stones and débris into the pits thus endangering the safety of the
animals and gradually undermining the boundary fence, which must
sooner or later fall inward. It should also include a tract of land lying
on a hillside to the north of the Quarry road and forming a portion of
the property of Mr. H. D. Walbridge. This is an exceedingly impor-
tant tract, as its possession would extend the park toward Kenesaw
avenue, which will doubtless be the principal route of access upon the
eastern side, and it would be desirable to extend the park on the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

southern side by taking in the cemetery that now lies near the Adams
mill entrance and constitutes a serious blot upon the surroundings of
the park.

The following letter from the landscape architects, Messrs. Olmsted,
Olmsted & Eliot, sets forth the advantages of the additions upon the
eastern side of the park, and may be considered in connection with
the plan just referred to, and the adjoining bird’s-eye view, the same
letters in each case indicating the same features:

DEAR SIR: We have at various times since our first employment in
connection with the Zoological Park strongly urged that more land
be acquired in order to secure a suitable boundary at various points.

Having been employed a year or more in connection with the plans
for the extension of the street system in the city of Washington, we
gave considerable study to the question of suitable boundary streets
on the east side of the Zoological Park, and in designing these streets
we were governed largely by regard for the desirability of adding to
the Zoological Park with a view to improving its landscape borders.

It is generally recognized that the Zoological Park is not solely a
piece of ground of sufficient area for the proper maintenance and exhi-
bition of living animals, but that it possesses remarkable landscape
beauties and includes a considerable part of one of the most charac-
teristic topographical features of Washington, namely, Rock: Creek,
winding picturesquely among unusually high hills and with beautiful,
wooded slopes.

It is obvious, therefore, that in securing land primarily for the pur-
pose of a zoological park it would be a great waste of a most valuable
opportunity not to secure also, to be preserved for the enjoyment of the
public, the scenery of Rock Creek and the adjoining slopes. This pur-
pose was undoubtedly constantly had in view at the time the Zoological
Park was purchased, but unfortunately, owing to the inadequacy of
the funds then available, some pieces of land of vital importance in the
landscape had to be omitted.

The land which it is of most pressing importance to add as soon as
possible to the park lies along the eastern boundary from a point near
the southeast corner to Kenyon street. This addition may, if necessary,
be secured in three stages.

The most important is a narrow strip (C) above the abandoned quar-
ries now occupied in part as the bear pits, and extending from the end
of the southerly branch of Summit road to the Quarry road. Above
the solid ledge in the old quarries there is a constantly disintegrating
stratum of rock, the face of which is nearly vertical, and from which
pieces of rock of considerable size are frequently falling through the
action of the weather, endangering people’s lives, and also the animals
in the cages below and the property of the park. Above this disinte-
grating rock is a bank of hard earth, approaching the consistency of
stone, which stands at an angle much steeper than engineers would re-
gard assafe. This bank can not be sloped back to a gentler inclination,
because the top of it ends immediately at the boundary of the park,
and it would be a serious damage to the private lands adjoining to have
the present surface lowered. We believe that no one examining the
matter on the ground would hesitate a moment in acknowledging that
an addition to the Zoological Park at this point is a pressing necessity
for safety, aside from any consideration of benefit to the landscape and
suitability of appearance.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

The land (D) proposed to be added to the Zoological Park from
Quarry road to Kenyon street is of great importance in the landscape
from almost all parts of the park. It would be a great misfortune if
this land were to be occupied and built upon for private residences.
Houses and other constructions on this steep, open hillside, close to the
creek and facing toward the most used portions of the Zoological Park,
would be excessively conspicuous and destructive of the landscape,
which woald otherwise have a most unusual degree of continuity and
completeness.

The southerly section (E) of the proposed addition to the Zoological
Park, extending from the southerly branch of Summit road to a point
near the southeast boundary ot the Zoological Park, is a very desira-
ble addition to the park, not only for landscape reasons above referred
to, but also because if occupied by private residences they would almost
necessarily back upon the park, and owing to their high position and
the lack of sufficient woods on the steep slopes south of the quarried
they would be annoyingly conspicuous from a large part of the park.

One important object to be attained by the whole of the proposes,
addition on the easterly side of the Zoological Park is that of securing
a frontage upon the new public street recently laid out, and which is
from Ontario avenue northward practically an extension of Highteenth
street. The importance of having a public park bound upon public
streets instead of against back yards of houses is generally recognized
and would alone justify the proposed addition to the park, even if it
was not of enormous advantage to the general landscape of the park.

In conclusion, we wish to point out that if the reasons which we have
given for the proposed addition are sound ones, and if it is conceded
that it should be made very soon because the required land is in a
neighborhood which is rising rapidly in value, and which is being
rapidly built upon, delay will not only involve additional expense for
land and probably much in excess of the interest on its probable present
cost, but also there is a strong probability that if the addition is not
made at once there will be the cost of new houses and other improve-
ments tobe met. * * *

Yours, respectfully,
OLMSTED, OLMSTED & ELIOT.

The amount of land that would be added to the park by these vari-
ous additions is as follows:

The adjustment of the boundaries of the park and the final estab-
lishment of the roads that lead to it will naturally make it necessary
to devise a system. of roads within the park connecting with the en-
trance. This can not be fully done until the exterior roads are finally
Settled, upon the western as well as upon the eastern side. One road
has, however, been contemplated, leading from the Adams Mill entrance
through the grounds to communicate with the road already adverted
to running up the valley from the Woodley Lane road. <A small appro-
priation was set aside for this purpose by the act of March 2, 1895.
This will not be available until the beginning of the next fiscal year.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

EXTINCTION OF THE BUFFALO.

When the Yellowstone Park was organized it was believed that a
permanent place of refuge for the buffalo had been secured, and that
out of the natural increase of the hundreds then remaining represent-
ative herds would be preserved for future generations. It seems now
evident that the conditions in the Yellowstone region are such that the
extermination of the Government herd of buffalo may be anticipated,
and that it may be accomplished within a very short space of time. The
superintendent of the Park appears not to have adequate means for
their protection, and there are on the border plenty of persons whose
respect for law is insufficient to keep them from poaching when the
prize is a buffalo head or skin which will readily sell for several hun-
dreds of dollars. The temptation to these men seems to be irresistible,
and as the herd diminishes the value of the animals increases and the
difficulty of protection becomes constantly greater.

Since, then, the extermination of the Yellowstone herd seems rapidly
approaching, something should at once be done, that this may not mean
the extinction of the Government control of the species, with the death
of the few specimens now in captivity. Only one course suggests itself
as completely efficient—transference of the great part of the now few
remaining animals to a region where they can be effectively protected
and increase normally under natural conditions, in which case the
bison need not vanish from the face of the earth. ‘Two years ago there
were supposed to be 200 in the Yellowstone Park. The present esti-
mate is one-quarter of thatnumber. The superintendent reports them
as being “constantly pursued,” and in another year there may be none
left. If these animals, or a majority of them, can during the next few
months be transferred to the National Zoological Park at Washington,
which affords room and security, they will be safe, and their natural
increase in the future can be distributed by exchange with the zoolog-
ical gardens of the various parts of the United States, so that no large
city need be without its representatives of the great herds so often
referred to in our early history, and now a memory.

Having in mind certain statements made in the public press with
regard to the slaughter of the bison within the Yellowstone National
Park by marauding poachers, I addressed to Capt. George S. Anderson,
U.S. A., the superintendent of that park, a letter of inquiry, to which
he made the following reply, which is of interest as supplementing the
information given in his annual report to the Secretary of the Interior,
and which, though properly belonging to a later report, I give here on
account of its urgent importance:

December 12, 1895.

I can give you no definite information about the bison in the Hayden
Valley, near your corral. My scouting parties have reported the trails
of several small bands leading in that direction, but as the snowfall
has been light, they have not as yet been driven to that narrow area.
| BUFFALO IN NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

‘REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. . 31

I do not expect to be able to get an accurate estimate of their number
before the latter part of January. I hope there are enough remaining
for a source of supply for your park, and if they can be inclosed the
cost of maintenance will be very small.

The reports made through the newspapers of the slaughter of the
bison recently are, of course, much exaggerated, but unfortunately
several have been killed. I feel pretty certain that ten were killed
within the past four months. I have now in custody in the guard-
house a man who was captured in possession of the scalps of five.

I made a pretty thorough tour of their range in October last, and saw
very few signs. Iam sure that I have heretofore overestimated their
numbers. I doubt if there are over fifty remaining, and these will not
all winter in the Hayden Valley. They increase but slowly under the
best conditions, and here, where they are being constantly pursued and
where the winters are very severe, but small increase can be looked for.
Of course, the stockade recently erected will be a great assistance in
their protection, if they can be secured within it.

Allof the animals in the park are protected properly and are increas-
ing, with the exception of the bison, and of these it is difficult to predict
as yet.

There are now but seven of these animals in the National Park here,
and even these are a relatively considerable part of the extremely small
pure-blooded stock which represents the vanished herds which once
covered this continent. An illustration of the head of one of them is
given herewith. The present value of such animals being over $1,000,
the value of these remaining 50 buffaloes in the Yellowstone is then over
$50,000. If so much national property can be saved by the appropri-
ation of one-tenth of that amount, should not this be done on the
ground of economy alone; and if, by spending on their transportation
little more than the expense of shipping a few carloads of beef cattle,
these bison may be saved from extinction, is it not worth while?

The threatened decrease of the collection of animals in the park is
a constant source of anxiety. As under the existing appropriations
no purchases can be made, recourse is naturally had to the preserves
in the Yellowstone Park, from which a number of valuable animals
have already been obtained. .

The number of persons that avail themselves of the advantages of the
park increases year by year, and it seems proper that more adequate
provision should be made for the collection than now exists. New
buildings suitable for special classes of animals are especially desirable.
A suitable elephant house should be built without delay, also an aviary
for the accommodation of both native and foreign birds. The property
yard, in which are included a blacksmith’s and a carpenter’s shop, should
be removed from the site it now occupies to some less conspicuous
location. The following appropriation was made in the District act of
August 7, 1894:

For continuing the construction of the Rock Creek intercepting sewer,
twenty thousand dollars: Provided, That the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia are authorized to enter into contract for said work

‘

32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

at a cost not to exceed eighty thousand dollars, to be paid for from time
to time as appropriations may be made by law; and the said Com-
missioners are authorized to construct said sewer, where necessary,
across lands belonging to the United States: Provided, That after the
construction of said sewer the.excavated portions of said lands shall
be restored to their original condition from the appropriation herein
provided for.

In accordance with this law the Commissioners of the District pro-
ceeded to survey a course for an intercepting sewer along Rock Creek
within the limits of the park. While the engineers in charge of the
work have conducted their operations with discretion and courtesy the
circumstance has brought forcibly to my attention the desirability of
clearly defining the authority of the park officials in cases where it
becomes necessary for employees from other branches of the Govern-
ment to carry on work within the park. There is a very real danger
that engineering operations may be conducted so as to injure the ani-
mals and destroy the natural beauties of the region, making it impossible
to ‘‘restore the land to its original condition.” As conflict of authority
would seriously embarrass the work it would be well if in future
cases of this kind the law should specifically provide that operations
should be conducted under such reasonable regulations of the park
authorities as may insure, as far as practicable, the safety of the ani-
mals and the preservation of the natural features of the park.

Immediately subsequent to the date of this report one of the most
interesting and valuable animals of the park (a sea lioness) died from
fright, due to an explosion without. warning caused in the progress of
the work just referred to.

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The investigation of the infra-red spectrum has been continued in the
Astro-physical Observatory during the past year with increased energy,
and Lam glad to be able to say that if only provisional results have
yet been published, which, like those of last year’s report, are intended
merely to show the character and progress of the work, it is because
the means of giving greater exactness are constantly growing, so that
the result it is now hoped to present will be given with the aim of a
still higher standard of precision; an aim which it may be trusted will
be considered a legitimate cause for the delay in the appearance of the
final results.

I refer for all details to the more extended report given later, but,
briefly, it may be stated that a larger number of bolographic records
has been obtained than in any previous year, and that these continuous
observations have been accompanied by further improvement in the
apparatus, a higher standard of accuracy, and a nearer approach to
the completion of the research; but that they have also shown beyond
a doubt that the limit of accuracy which is desirable can never be

reached in the present most unsuitable, provisional site, which is sub-
ject to every kind of disturbance due to the neighborhood of the streets
of a busy city.

NECROLOGY.

I am called upon to record here the death of two Regents of the
Institution, Dr. James C. Welling and Dr. Henry Coppée; also three
gentlemen long associated with the work of the Institution, Mr. Will-
iam B. Taylor, Col. Garrick Mallery, and Rev. James Owen Dorsey,
besides Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, who has bequeathed his estate to
the Institution.

JAMES CLARK WELLING.

I have lost in Dr. Welling a personal friend, but I only have to
speak of him now in his relationship to this Institution—an institution
whose character has been partly due to its good fortune in the presence
and advice of such men.

Dr. Welling was one who possessed, beyond anyone else, what may
be called the traditions of the Institution; and though these were not
of course his exclusive property, in this respect, as in others, his loss
can not be supplied.

The rules of conduct which have been laid down by the Regents, and
by the Secretaries who have administered them, are not so much derived
from a priori views as they are the outgrowth of accumulated experi-
ence; and this experience, it has been thought, is in part, due to the
exceptionally long incumbencies of members of the Board as compared
with ordinary tenures of office here, and to the continuity of the knowl-
edge of its activities, as ilustrated in the case of this departed friend.

James Clark Welling, at the time of his death, September 4, 1894,
was nearly 70 years of age.! Descended from New England colonial
ancestors, a native of one of the Middle States, in early manhood a
teacher in the South, and for nearly half a century a resident of the
national capital, he was an American of the best type, free from sec-
tional bias, personifying the higher traits and tendencies of the nation,
loyal to the traditions and aspirations of its founders.

He was graduated in 1844 from the College of New Jersey, studied
law, and was admitted to the bar, but soon afterwards entered upon the
profession of journalism. He always retained, however, a strong incli-
nation for the study of constitutional and international law, and of
politics, and his interest in public affairs was greatly stimulated by his
connection for fifteen years with the most important of Washington
journals, at that time national in its influence. He became the literary
editor of the National Intelligencer in 1850, and was its managing

1He was born in Trenton, July 14, 1825.
sm 95——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

editor throughout the entire period of the civil war. In this capacity
he had the privilege of personal acquaintance with all our public men,
and confidential access to many of them, including Lincoln, Seward,
and Stanton.

In later life his attention was given chiefly to educational work.
For a time president of St. John’s College, Maryland, and later pro-
fessor of belles lettres at Princeton, he was, in 1870, recalled to Wash-
ington to become president of the Columbian University, an institution
tounded fifty years before, in the hope that it might fulfill the desire of
Washington, Barlow, and Adams, that a seat of liberal learning should
exist at the capital. Dr. Welling was led to accept this position by
the urgency of the philanthropist Corcoran and the advice of Henry,
both of whom were influenced by the hope of having with them one of
the founders of a national university, and who believed that a man
of Dr. Welling’s character would find in such a position a wide field of
influence.

His aspirations for the university were never fully realized, owing to
the impossibility of securing endowments from private sources for a
public institution located so near to the seat of Government. He never-
theless secured a considerable addition to its endowment, added new
professional schools, greatly increased the number of its faculty and
students, removed the institution from the suburbs to a new building
in the heart of the city, and accomplished many other things which
seemed really wonderful in view of the smallness of the resources at
his command. The dream of his life was to establish a school of com-
parative jurisprudence—the only one of its kind in the world—as a
branch of the university. In 1892 he visited Europe, secured approval
of his plans from Sir Frederick Pollock and other eminent jurists, and
their promise to come to America to lecture as members of the faculty.
Failing health interfered with the realization of his pian, which, I can
but believe, he would have otherwise forced into success.

After his resignation of the presidency in 1893, he still retained the
chair of international law and the position of dean of the university
law school, and, full of hopefulness, it was his purpose to labor on for
his beloved project. He confidently expected to live to be 80, and to
devote the remaining ten years of his life to the compilation of a polit-
ical history of the civil war, a work for which no one was so well qual-
ified by experience, knowledge, and critical skill as himself. He was a
representative man in Washington, identified with all interests which
tend toward good citizenship, and held many positions of public trust
and honor. He was president of the board of trustees of the Corcoran
Art Gallery and of the American Copyright League, and was appointed
by President Harrison commissioner to the Columbian Historical Expo-
sition at Madrid in 1892. His scholarship was accurate, broad, and
genial, aS was shown by the critical reviews which he contributed dur-
ing his later years to some of the principal American journals. His
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

favorite study in hours of relaxation was that of the sacred poetry of
the early Christian Church, some of which he had translated, though
not for publication.

In 1884 he was chosen a Regent of this Institution, to succeed the
Reverend Dr. Parker. For ten years he gave conscientious attention
to its interests, and upheld in every way those conservative and dig-
nified traditions of which I have already spoken of him as almost the
living embodiment; and while he did this primarily because of their
harmony with his own personal tendencies and convictions as to their
value, he did so because of his affection and reverence for the first
Secretary, Joseph Henry, whose pupil he had been in his youth, and
with whom in middle life he maintained the relation of friend and con-
fident. After Henry’s death, Dr. Welling consented to add to his
already burdensome duties those of the chairman of the executive com-
mittee, which he performed till his own death, so that he may be said
to have been a link between the past and present in the history of this
Institution, though happily not the only one, since it has preserved
others in his contemporaries.

Ata meeting of the Board of Regents in January, 1895, the following
resolutions were adopted:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution have been called upon to mourn the death of their esteemed
colleague, the late James C. Welling, LL. D., president of Columbian
University, who has long been interested in the welfare of the Insti-
tution, and who for many years has been a Regent and chairman of its
executive committee,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feel deep regret in the loss of
one whose long and distinguished career of public usefulness, especially
in the promotion of institutions for higher education, commanded their
respect, and whose personal character and unselfish devotion to the
highest ideals of scholarship and citizenship, their sincere admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of President Welling the Smithsonian
Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of an earnest friend, a wise
and judicious counselor, and one who was preeminently an exponent
of its time-honored policy, and the Board of Regents a friend and
associate whom they valued most highly.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the journal of the
proceedings of the Board, and that the secretary be requested to send
a copy of them to the family of their departed associate and friend, in
token of sympathy in this common affliction.

HENRY COPPEE.

Henry Coppée, LL. D., a member of the executive committee of the
Board of Regents of the Institution, died March 21, 1895, in his seventy-
fourth year. He was appointed Regent January 19, 1874, was reap-
pointed by Congress every six years, and during that score of years
_ constantly took the deepest interest in the work of the Institution.

_ Dr. Coppée was born in Savannah, Ga., October 13, 1821, and was
of French ancestry.

36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

After spending two years in the class of 1839 at Yale, he left college
to study practical civil engineering, being engaged in the construction
of the Georgia Central Railroad. July 1, 1840, he entered the United
States Military Academy at West Point, from which place he was
graduated four years later, being promoted to second lieutenant of
artillery July 1, 1845. The following year, after having served in gar-
rison, and at Fort Columbus, N. Y., he was sent to Mexico, taking part
in the battles of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Cherubusco, and Contreras
in 1847, being then promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and breveted
captain for “gallant and meritorious conduct” in those battles.

Dr. Coppée was assistant professor of French at West Point Acad-
emy from August 22, 1848, to June 22, 1849, and after spending a year
at Fort McHenry, Md., he returned to West Point and remained there
five years as assistant professor of English studies. On June 30, 1855,
he resigned from the Army, and for eleven years was professor of
English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, when in 1866 he
was elected the first president of Lehigh University. His love for lit-
erary rather than administrative labor induced him to resign the presi-
dency of the university in 1875, and to accept the chair of English
literature, international and constitutional law, and the philosophy of
history. Upon the death of President Lamberton in 1893 he again
became head of the university, and was acting president when he died.

He was an industrious author, his published works covering a wide
range of subjects, though pertaining chiefly to history and English
literature.

His genial courtesy and manly disposition, the prudent counsel of his
disciplined and well-stored mind, and his devotion to the interests of the
Institution will linger in the memory of his colleagues on the Board of
Regents. As a soldier, as man of letters, as professor and president of
a great university, Dr. Coppée won high distinction, and died leaving
a record of well spent years. .

ROBERT STANTON AVERY.

Robert Stanton Avery, of Washington City, was born near Preston,
Conn., May 1, 1808, and died in Washington on September 12, 1894. He
early became interested in mathematics and physical science and in
Latin and Greek, and for several years was engaged in teaching school
in various parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also in Ohio
and Kentucky. Actuated by a desire for higher education he entered
Harvard College at the age of 35 and there devoted much of his time
to a critical study of the Scriptures in Greek and Hebrew. After his
graduation in 1846 he obtained a license as a preacher, but failing health
prevented active work in that profession.

From 1853 to 1885 he was connected with the United States Coast
Survey, his principal work being computation and reduction of tidal
observations.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot

After resigning from the Government service he prepared for the press
a set of mathematical tables, also some schoolbooks designed for the
teaching of phonetic spelling, a subject in which he became much inter-
ested, and in establishing ‘‘The Avery fund” of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion he expressed a wish that the income be used chiefly for publications
relating to the mechanical laws governing an etherial medium and also
mathematical tables and works on phonetic type and writing.

WILLIAM BOWER TAYLOR.

William Bower Taylor, who died February 25, 1895, was appointed
assistant and editor in the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, He was
born in Philadelphia May 23, 1821; graduated at the University of
Pennsylvania in 1840; studied law and was admitted to the bar Novem-
ber 15, 1843. In 1853 he came to Washington as draftsman and fore-
man of the engineer and machinist departments at the United States
navy-yard, and in 1854 was appointed principal examiner, and later
librarian, in the United States Patent Office. He was one of the
founders and the fourth president of the Washington Philosophical
Society, and was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of other
learned bodies. He represented the Smithsonian Institution at the
International Electrical Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1884. Among
his literary works may be mentioned the Life and Writings of Prof.
Joseph Henry; Professor Henry and the Telegraph, and papers on
Gravitation, Force, and Sound, published by the Institution.

Necrologic notices of Col. Garrick Mallery and James Owen Dorsey,
for many years connected with the Bureau of Ethnology, are given by
the Director of the Bureau in an appendix to this report.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: I have the honor to present a brief statement of some of the most important
features connected with the operations of the National Museum during the fiscal
year which ended on June 30, 1895.

Accessions.—During the year the collections have been increased by 1,225 accessions,
numbering about 127,000 specimens. This compares favorably with the last four
years. The large increase is almost entirely the result of a warm interest in the wel-
fare of the Museum on the part of individuals, many of whom have at one time or
another received some courtesy from the Museum, either in the way of a publication
or special information on some scientific subject. Collections of more than ordinary
interest have been contributed by Dr. William L. Abbott, Mr. William Astor Chan-
ler, and Lieut. von Héhnel, His Majesty the King of Siam, the Reverend L.T. Cham-
berlain, Mr. A. Boucard, Dr. William L. Ralph, and others. Important gifts have
also been received from the Indian Museum in Calcutta and from the Government of
Nicaragua.

The scientific staff.—During the year all the collections of fossils have been placed
under one curator, and are now administered under the department of paleontology,
of which Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the U. 8. Geological Survey, is the hon-
orary curator. The vertebrate fossils are in charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh and Mr.
F. A. Lucas. Among the invertebrate fossils, the Paleozoic collection is under the
care of Mr. Charles Schuchert. The Mesozoic fossils are administered by Mr. T. W.
Stanton, and the Cenozoic, or Tertiary, fossils by Dr. W. H. Dall. The collection of
fossil plants is under the charge of Prof. Lester F. Ward, with Mr. F. H. Knowlton
as custodian of the Mesozoic plants and Mr. David White as custodian of the Paleo-
zoic plants.

Mr. J. E. Watkins has been appointed curator of all the technological collections.
Dr. J. M. Flint, of the United States Navy, has been again detailed by the Secretary
of the Navy to serve as honorary curator of the section of materia medica, in place of
Medical Inspector Daniel McMurtrie. Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agri-
culture, has been appointed honorary assistant curator of the department of plants.
Dr. Walter Hough, Mr. C. W. Richmond, and Miss M. J. Rathbun, have been desig-
nated assistant curators in the departments of ethnology, birds, and marine inverte-
brates, respectively. Mr. F. H. Cushing, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has been
designated custodian of the Pueblo collections.

Distribution of collections.—There have been 39,236 duplicate specimens distributed
during the past year to universities, colleges, museums, and,in a few special instances,
to normal schools. This shows an increase of about 13,000 specimens over the dis-
tributions of last year. The material distributed consisted principally of rocks and
ores, invertebrate forms of marine life, fishes, casts of prehistoric implements, and
minerals. Morethan half the total number consisted of marine invertebrates. Large
quantities of marine forms are collected by the U.S. Fish Commission, and as soon as

40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

practicable after the material has been studied and transferred to the Museum, selec-
tionsare carefully made with a view to the preparation of ‘‘sets” fordistribution. I+
is quite impossible, however, to fill more than a small proportion of the applications
received, until Congress makes a special appropriation to be used for the employment
_ of experts in separating the duplicates in the various departments of the Museum
and arranging them into collections especially suited for use in educational work.

Visitors.—There has been an increase of nearly 8,000 in the number of visitors to
the Smithsonian and Museum buildings during the year. The total for the Smith-
sonian building was 105,658, and for the Museum building 201,744.

Specimens transmitted for identification.—During the year 467 “lots” of specimens
were forwarded to the Museum for examination. Only a very small proportion
proved desirable for permanent addition to the collections. If the specimens sent
have any value, their return is almost invariably requested. If, however, the
Museum is permitted to retain desirable specimens, they are recorded in the Museum
catalogues, first as received for examination and report, and again as gifts to the
Museum. It is rarely the case that specimens thus retained have any intrinsic
worth, their value usually consisting in the fact that they fill gaps in certain series.
During the past year the services of the curators in examining and reporting upon
material were extended, outside of the United States, to correspondents in Canada,
Great Britain, Central America, South America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
India, Java, Borneo, Philippine Islands, several countries of Europe, and various
islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Foreign exchanges.—Exchanges have been made with several foreign museums
during the year. Among them are the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities,
Copenhagen, Denmark; Indian Museum, Calcutta, India; Canterbury Museum,
Christchurch, New Zealand; Museum of Natural History, Paris, France; Manches-
ter Museum, Manchester, England; Museum of Natural History, Vienna, Austria;
La Plata Museum, Buenos Ayres, Argentina, and others. Important exchanges have .
often been effected with individuals, such as Dr. A. C. Haddon, Cambridge, Eng-
land; Mr. Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Water Works, South Australia; Dr. H. von
Ihering, San Paulo, Brazil; Mr. M. Stossich, Triest, Austria; Prof. Edward Tregear,
of Wellington, New Zealand.

Publications.—The report of the Museum for 1892 has been published during the
year, and the report for 1893 is now going through the press. The papers (976-1032)
constituting volume 17 of the Proceedings of the National Museum have, with one
exception, been distributed, and the edition of the bound volume is expected daily.
Advance sheets of two papers containing descriptions of new species, and intended
for inclusion in volume 18, were issued during the year in order to secure to the
authors priority of description.

Of the Bulletin, No. 48, ‘“‘Contribution toward a Monograph of the Insects of the
Lepidopterous Family Noctuide of Boreal North America, A Revision of the Del-
toid Moths,” by John B. Smith, Sc. D., has been published. The following ‘‘ Parts”
of No. 39 are now in the folding room: Part H, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Minerals,”
by Wirt Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Rocks and for the preparation of
Thin Sections,” by George P. Merrill; Part J, “‘ Directions for collecting specimens
and information illustrating the Aboriginal Uses of Plants,” by Frederick V. Coville;
Part K, ‘‘Directions for collecting and preparing Fossils,” by Charles Schuchert.
A supplemental edition of Part A, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Birds,” by Robert
Ridgway, has been printed at the expense of the Museum allotment, in order to
supply the extraordinary demand for this publication.

The second of the series of Special Bulletins, in quarto form, entitled ‘‘ Oceanic
Ichthyology,” relating to the deep sea and pelagic fishes of the world, by G.
Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, has been set in type and will probably be pub-
lished during the winter. The third number of the series, being the second volume
of Life Histories of North American Birds, by Maj. Charles Bendire, is for the most
part in type. It will be illustrated with seven chromo-lithographic plates.
Se

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

Circulars 43 to 46 have been published. Nos. 43 to 45 have reference to the develop-
ment of the library of the National Museum, and request the transmission of the
publications of scientific establishments as well as authors’ separates or reprints. No.
46 invites the cooperation of students and collectors in forwarding plants found in
the District of Columbia, and making notes concerning them, for incorporation in a
proposed revised edition of Bulletin 22, by Prof. Lester F. Ward, entitled A Guide to
the Flora of Washington and Vicinity. This was published in 1881.

Explorations.—The Museum has benefited during the year by the results of the
explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott, who has forwarded valuable ethnological
and natural history material from Africa and India.

Mr. William Astor Chanler has continued his travels in Africa, and has made
important contributions to the collections.

Prof. William Treiease, Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis,
gathered a number of interesting specimens of natural history, including marine
invertebrate forms, reptiles, fishes, birds, and insects, in connection with his expedi-
tion to the Azores.

Large collections of mammals and pottery have resulted from the explorations of
Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., in Florida.

Mr. Mark B. Kerr made a very acceptable collection of fossils in Ecuador, which
he presented to the Museum.

Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta.—The exhibit prepared under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution for display at the Cotton States Exposition
illustrates every phase of the activities of the Institution and its branches, especially
the National Museum. The exhibits of the latter include collections prepared by the
departments of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, comparative anatomy, marine inver-
tebrates, mollusks, insects, paleontology, geology, minerals, botany, prehistoric
anthropology, ethnology, and some of the sections of the department of arts and
industries, i. e., materia medica, oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial, some
technological exhibits, and a collection of games. The space assigned to the Institu-
tion includes 5,300 feet of floor space, exclusive of the central aisle, and is located
in the southeastern quarter of the Government building. The sum allotted to the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum was $22,000. Of this amount
$16,500 was made available for expenditures connected with the preparation of the
exhibits, the remainder being intended to cover the expenses of installation. The
Exposition opens on September 18 and closes on December 31. The report of the
National Museum for 18.6 will contain a complete description of these exhibits and
a full account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution and its various
branches.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOL-
OGY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been prosecuted. during the fiscal year in accord
ance with act of Congress making prevision ‘‘ for continuing researches relating to
the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.” The
operations have been conducted in accordance with the plan submitted at the begin-
ning of the fiscal year, with minor modifications made necessary by circumstances,

The primary classification of the work is topical, and the researches along different
lines comprise field studies or exploration and office work in the elaboration of the
material collected in the field or obtained in other ways. The chief researches dur-
ing the last year relate to (1) archeology, (2) descriptive ethnology, (3) sociology,
(4) sign language and hieroglyphics, (5) linguistics, (6) mythology, (7) psychology,
(8) bibliography, and (9) publication, together with administrative and miscellaneous
work.

In the usual course the researches begin in the field, where surveys are made and
where information and material are collected. The data obtained in this way are
studied and compared and reports thereon are written in the office, and the reports
thus prepared are, after examination by the Director or by the ethnologist in charge
under his instructions, transmitted for publication. The scientific operations there-
fore include (1) fieldwork or exploration, (2) office researches, including the prepa-
ration of reports, and (3) publication. :

EXPLORATION.

During the earlier portion of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was occupied
in extending and completing his explorations and surveys in southwestern United
States. During the field season of 1894 his operations were largely confined to Can-
yon de Chelly in northeastern Arizona, but his reconnoissances and surveys were
extended into contiguous territory. During July and the earlier part of August he
examined San Juan Valley and there obtained information of much interest. In its
topography and general geographic conditions this region appears to have been well
adapted to the needs of the ancient pueblo builders, and it affords examples of nearly
all the types of aboriginal villages now known, together with other types and many
variants which have not been surveyed elsewhere. The examination and compara-
tive study of these relics throw much light on the development of art in architecture
by the people of the pueblos. In other directions, too, the observations add mate-
rialiy to knowledge of the habits and customs of the aborigines. Mr. Mindeleff’s
researches during the season, in connection with his surveys during the last fiscal
year, have covered a large territory and will permit archeologic mapping of value;
even the negative results are useful as indicating the territory barren of aboriginal
works.

Early in September Mr. Mindeleff brought his field operations to a close. The
greater part of the month was spent in completing his accounts and disposing of his
field outfit and equipment. Toward the end of the month he repaired to Washington
to begin the preparation of a final report on his surveys of the preceding fifteen
months.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

The most extended exploratory work of the year was that of an expedition through
the country of the Papago and Seri Indians of Arizona and Sonora (Mexico), con-
ducted by Mr. McGee. The expedition was fitted out in Tucson about the middle
of October. Mr. William Dinwiddie accompanied the expedition as photographer,
and the party included also a Papago Indian interpreter and from time to time Indian
or Mexican guides and interpreters. Leaving Tucson, the party proceeded to and
through San Luis Valley and temporarily crossed the frontier at Sasabe to the
Papago Indian village of Poso Verde. Here the leader and interpreter remained sey-
eral days, collecting information concerning the distribution of the Papago villages
and rancherias, while Mr. Dinwiddie was sent back to Tucson to make necessary
changes in outfit. A few days later the party reassembled at Arivaca, Ariz., where
surveys were made of extended prehistoric works. Thence the expedition moved
to the frontier at Nogales, where after some delay authority for extending the opera-
tions on Mexican soil was courteously accorded, in response to representations made
through the local officials to the federal officers of the Republic of Mexico. Leaving
Nogales, the party proceeded southward, visiting several villages formerly occupied
by Papago Indians but now abandoned, and finding rancherias occupied by repre-
sentatives of the tribe at various points.

The rancherias near Querobabi were found especially interesting, and a number

of valuable photographs were taken. While a primary purpose of the expedition
was the collection of objective material for preservation in the United States
National Museum, little such material was collected during this part of the trip,
(1) because of the desire to comply with the spirit of the Mexican law relating to
the removal of antiquities, and (2) because of the difficulty of transporting objects
over many hundred miles of frequently trackless territory. Other Papago ran-
cherias were found as far southward as Hermosillo, and information was obtained
concerning settlements midway between that city and Guaymas. During the jour-
ney from Tucson to Hermosillo the eastern and southern limits of the Papago ter-
ritory were determined, many of the characteristics of the tribe were ascertained,
and their arts were studied in such manner as to facilitate subsequent collection of
typical objects.

After two or three days’ delay in Hermosillo, due to the difficulty of obtaining
authority to enter the territory of the warlike Seri Indians, the expedition proceeded
toward the coast adjacent to Tiburon Island. During this part of the trip the expe-
dition had the pleasure and advantage of the company of Senor Pascual Encinas, an
aged Mexican, formerly of great energy and courage, who had done much to extend
white settlement into the Seri country, and whose services in this direction have
received abundant recognition on the part of the State and the Republic. Piloted
by Senor Encinas and Senor Alvemar-Leon, the expedition entered the borders of
the Seri territory and was so fortunate as to find a temporary rancheria occupied by
some sixty individuals of the tribe. During the ensuing week their habits and cus-
toms were studied, a part of their vocabulary was recorded, and a number of indi-
vidual and group photographs were made. In addition typical articles of costumery,
weapons, utensils, etc., were collected and some information was gained concerning
the ethnic characteristics of the tribe. The Indians were found quite primitive,
probably more primitive and savage than any other tribe remaining on the North
American continent. Most of their food is eaten raw, they have no domestic animals
save dogs, they are totally without agriculture, and their industrial arts are few
and rude. By reason of their warlike character, little has hitherto been known con-
cerning the tribe; the photographs made by the expedition are the first known to
have been made of the Seri Indians.

Returning to Hermosillo early in November, the party set out on the return
journey, so shaping the course as to determine the southwestern limits of Papago
occupancy. Interesting Papago rancherias were found aé Poso Noriago and at
Cienega, and in both localities photographs and a few small objects of special
interest were obtained. Between these points several prehistoric ruins were dis-

44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vocered, and also examples of the singular prehistoric works called by the Mexicans
“las trincheras” (entrenched mountains) observed. Passing northward, the ancient
Papago town of Caborca was visited and additional photographs were made. A
remarkable example of entrenched mountain near this point received careful atten-
tion. From Caborca the expedition proceeded to Pitiquita, where opportunity was
again presented for collecting Papago material, and thence to Altar. The limit of
the time fixed for the journey on leaving Tucson being nearly at hand, and the stock
having suffered greatly from the rigors of travel through one of the most arid of
Tegions, it was found necessary here to abandon the plan for extending the studies
to San Domingo and Quitobaquita, the westernmost settlements of the Papago; and
the expedition proceeded directly toward the boundary near Sierra de la Union,
between Rancho de San Joaquin, in Sonora, and Rancho Ventano, in Arizona.

There are several Papago rancherias near the last-named rancho, and in these col-
lections and photographs were made. The party then proceeded to Fresnal, the
principal Indian village in Papagueria, where the team was loaded with objects
obtained from the Indians. Later, Tucson (Indian) was visited, and afterwards a
stop was made at the Papago village of Coyote. Between the last-named points and
at Coyote prehistoric villages and other antiquities of much interest were noted,
and a small collection of fragmentary prehistoric pottery, etc., was made. On
November 25 the expedition returned to Tucson, and immediately on disbanding the
ethnologist in charge repaired to Washington, Mr. Dinwiddie remaining for a few
days for the purpose of completing collections on the Papago Reservation at San
Xavier. The expedition resulted in a considerable collection representing the arts
and industries of the partially acculturized Papago Indians, whose arts have been
hitherto but meagerly represented in the National Museum or other repositories of
scientific material; in the first noteworthy collection of objective material ever made
among the Seri Indians; in some 500 photographs of the Seri and Papago Indians
and their surroundings, this collection being of special interest since the Seri
Indians have not hitherto been photographed, while few pictures of the Papago
have hitherto been taken; and in a considerable body of ethnic material appertain-
ing to both tribes.

Toward the close of the calendar year Dr. Franz Boas, who had visited British
Columbia for the purpose of continuing researches relating to the native languages
under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, com-
municated with the Bureau, suggesting that he be given authority and means for
visiting the Kathlamet Indians of the lower Columbia region and collecting texts
representing their language and mythology. After correspondence he was author-
ized to carry out his plan of operations, the material collected to be conveyed to
the Bureau for a stipulated sum. Dr. Boas devoted several weeks to the work, and
after his return to eastern United States prepared the material for publication. It
was not quite complete at the end of the fiscal year, but was soon afterward trans-
mitted and found to be a valuable addition to knowledge concerning the north-
western tribes.

About the end of December Mr. James Mooney proceeded to the field in Indian
Territory for the purpose of making researches concerning the Kiowa calendar and
the Kiowa heraldic system. He remained dwelling among the Kiowa Indians until
after the close of the fiscal year. Among the Kiowa as among other Plains Indians,
and indeed among all of the aboriginal tribes, there is a widespread symbolism by
which the arts are influenced and guided. Under this symbolism tents, shields,
arrows, pipes, musical instruments, robes, and other articles are inscribed, painted,
or otherwise marked with designs. In many cases these designs possess decorative
value, and by superficial students they are commonly supposed to be used simply
for decoration; but study of the Indian character and motive shows that the design
is not primarily decorative (though the germ of decoration may be found therein),
but symbolic and fraught with meaning to those who understand the symbolism.
This primitive symbolism is found to be developed and differentiated in various
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

ways among different tribes of the American aborigines; among the Kiowa Indians
it is differentiated into a crude yet highly significant system of heraldry which
throws much light on the medieval heraldry of Europe; and in another direction it
is differentiated into a system of winter counts or calendars, forming at the same
time a chronologic system and an historical record which, although crude and imper-
fect, are of great interest. Among the same Indians the system of symbolism has
been differentiated in a third direction, though one nearly parallel with the first, in
such manner as to form a symbolic record of social organization and relation, this
part of the record being largely painted on the dressed-skin tents. Thus the sym-
bolism of the Kiowa Indians elucidates the origin of several arts brought to perfec-
tion only among much more highly cultivated people; it represents a crude heraldry,
a budding cronology, a nascent decorative art, and the germ of writing.

Although remaining in the field, Mr. Mooney made considerable progress during
the fiscal year in the preparation of a memoir on the Kiowa calendar, though the
manuscript will require revision as his studies approach maturity, after his return
to the office.

OFFICE WORK.
ARCHEOLOGY.

Prof. W. H. Holmes, who retired from the Bureau before the beginning of the fiscal
year, left two reports nearly ready for publication; one of these relates to the stone
art of the aborigines as exemplified and elucidated by the relics found in and near
the tide-water region adjacent to Chesapeake Bay; the second to the fictile art as
represented by collections from eastern United States, especially from the mounds.
While both reports were substantially complete as to letterpress, they were incom-
plete as to illustrations, and the preparation of requisite illustrations was carried
forward under the supervision of the ethnologist in charge and Mr. DeLancey W.
Gill. During July a number of photographs were made, for incorporation in the
memoir on stone art, by Mr. Cushing and Mr. William Dinwiddie. When the illus-
trations were completed the memoir was incorporated in the Fifteenth Annual
Report of the Bureau, which was sent to press during the year.

During portions of July and August Mr. Dinwiddie was engaged in the elabora-
tion of notes on a remarkable steatite quarry near Clifton, Va., and in the transfer
of the collections to the National Museum. The Clifton quarry is one of the largest
of the aboriginal excavations of soapstone thus far found in eastern United States,
and is noteworthy for the depth of the cutting and the large amount of fragmentary
and other material representing the processes of primitive quarrymen. Mr. Din-
widdie’s work on this material was interrupted when he joined the expedition into
the Papago country, and his report has not been completed.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who returned from the field about the end of September,
was occupied during the greater part of October in closing his accounts and in other
duties connected with the termination of long continued field operations. After-
wards he began the preparation of a report on his surveys and researches. During
November, December, and January the material was reduced to the form of a memoir
on the cliff ruins of Canyon de Chelly. In February a preliminary draft of the text
was brought to substantial completion, and the later portion of March was spent
chiefly in the preparation of illustrations. During March and April the text was
revised and rewritten, and toward the end of the latter month it was submitted for
publication. The preparation of the final drawings for the illustrations was also
substantially completed, and in June the memoir was assigned for publication in the
Sixteenth Annual Report of the Bureau.

Mr. Mindeleff’s surveys recorded in his report on Canyon de Chelly were both
extended and detailed, and have yielded a large body of especially trustworthy data
relating to this interesting portion of the continent. Ina large number of cases he
made diagrams showing the ground plans of structure, based on careful measure-
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ments, and these plans were connected in plats which were in turn combined into
maps. Whenever practicable the plans were supplemented by drawings in elevation
and perspective, and by photographs; and the photographic and other illustrations
present vividly the characteristics of the region examined and the conditions under
which the ancient cliff dwellers lived, moved, worshiped their mysteries, defended
themselves against enemies, died, and were buried Many explorations have been
made in the Southwestern region, and many students have collected material relat-
ing to the peculiarly intelligent aborigines of this district; but none of the explora-
tions have been more thorough, none of the records more faithful, than that just
completed by Cosmos Mindeleff, and it is thought that his report will make Canyon
de Chelly classic ground for the archeologist.

Although conducted primarily for other purposes, the expedition directed by Mr.
McGee resulted in a number of interesting archzologic discoveries. Among these
may be mentioned: (1) ‘‘Las Trincheras,” a class of temporary fortifications about
isolated buttes or peaks near habitable valleys, forming a new archologic type for
this country; (2) a considerable number of prehistoric village sites, irrigation works,
etc., in a region heretofore supposed to be barren archeologically;.(3) extended
village sites, each dominated by one or more ceremonial or other ground structures,
sometimes accompanied by inclosures suggesting the domestication of animals; and
(4) great acequias, carried farther up the valley sides than the present irrigation
works, indicating more complete conquest of the waters during prehistoric times
than at present. The archeologic material collected during the expedition has not
been prepared for extended publication, but is withheld for further research in the
same region.

Although the collections in the National Museum made by members of the Bureau
in former years for the purpose of illustrating the life of the Pueblo tribes since the
Spanish advent is exceedingly rich, comparatively few objects representative of the
prehistoric arts of these interesting people have been collected. Opportunity having
at last been afforded for excavation among the remains of the ancient cliff-dwellings
and pueblo peoples of the Southwest, the Bureau was fortunate enough to enlist the
services of the late director of the Hemenway Expedition, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes,
the results of whose researches among the Hopi Indians of Tusayan, Ariz., are well
known. Dr. Fewkes proceeded, late in May, to the unfrequented locality known as
the Red Rock country, southwest of Flagstaff, Ariz., where he had the good fortune
to find a group of extensive cliff ruins hitherto unknown to archeologists and not
despoiled by white men. Excavation was prosecuted among these aboriginal remains
during June with considerable success, and a number of excellent photographs were
made. At the end of the month Dr. Fewkes returned to Flagstaff with a view of
reoutfitting for a thorough exploration of some of the extensive and presumably
rich ruins in the Tusayan country of northeastern part of the territory.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

Ever since the discovery of the American continent explorers have been impressed
by the characteristies of the aborigines, and many of them have recorded their obser-
vations and impressions in reports, letters, diaries, and treatises, and great numbers
of these records have been printed and published to the world. Inthis way a great
body of literature, sometimes styled Americana, has been produced. A great part
of this body of literature relates partly or wholly to the American Indians. Usually
the records were based on superficial observation and frequently they are vitiated
by misapprehension and hasty generalization. Nevertheless much of the literature
represents actual observation of the Indians while yet they retained primitive char-
acteristics. Thus, although the early records are diverse in value, the body of the
literature of this class contains a large store of information concerning the physical
characteristics, mental attributes, habits, customs, arts, beliefs, and institutions of
the native Americans, Moreover, research concerning primitive peoples has shown
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

that the ideas of the savage and barbarous peoples are expressed in the nomen-
clature much more fully and significantly than are those of cultured peoples, so that
the records of personal and geographic names are often of great utility as indices
to the intellectual characteristics, customs, and institutions of the Indian tribes;
information of this class abounds in America. Thus there is a large store of infor-
mation in the publications of the early and later travelers in America, but the liter-
ature is so vast and so widely scattered that the information is nearly inaccessi-
ble to students.

Even before the institution of the Bureau of American Ethnology, ethnologists
generally recognized the need of systematic information concerning the aboriginal
tribes, and several students had made essays toward the collection of such informa-
tion from the voluminous literature, either for personal use or for publication. When
the Bureau was organized, one of the lines of work projected was the compilation of
such information from the published hterature and from manuscripts, the compila-
tion being guided and corrected, and the material enriched by concurrent research
among the Indians themselves. The bibliographic work undertaken in the Bureau
and so long successfully carried forward by Mr. Pilling, was designed largely as a
meanstothisend. In addition, all of the collaborators of the Bureau were instructed,
and many correspondents were urged, to obtain and record general facts pertaining
to the tribes with which they came in contact; and most of the collaborators of the
Bureau have been employed from time to time in collating the material gathered in
this way. Anterior to the institution of the Bureau most of the students engaged
in systemizing the ethnologic data, arranged the material alphabetically on cards or
in books, generally under tribal and other proper names; this was the method pur-
sued by Dr. O. T. Mason, of the Smithsonian Institution, who was engaged in the
work before the institution of the Bureau; and essentially the same plan was pursued
by Mr. James Mooney during his earlier researches before he became connected with
the Bureau.

Under this method of assembling the data, it frequently happened that the rec-
ords were brief and incomplete and that the terms under which the entries were
made were variable, so that much care and thought were necessarily devoted to the
ascertainment of synonymy. As the work progressed with the Bureau the studies
continued, and the director and collaborators engaged in the compilation came to
speak of the work as a ‘‘Synonymy” of the Indian tribes. As the material con-
tinued to accumulate, and particularly as the more extended and more accurate
information gained by actual researches among the Indians was incorporated, it was
found that the synonymy proper diminished relatively, while the body of general
information became greatly expanded. Now that the records have so increased as
to fill several hundred thousand cards, it is found that the work forms a great cyclo-
pedia relating to the Indian tribes, which even in manuscript form is of large and
constantly increasing utility. With the development of a plan for publication, as
set forth in the last report, the inadequacy of the original name for the work came
to be appreciated, and during the present yearit has been decided to begin the issue
of the work in a series of bulletins corresponding with the aboriginal linguistic
stocks, under the designation ‘‘Cyclopedia of the American Indians.”

Throughout the fiscal year Mr. F. W. Hodge has had charge of the work on the
cyclopedia, and during most of the time he has been engaged in preparing the records
pertaining to several southwestern stocks for publication. Early in the year Mr. J.
Owen Worsey also contributed to the work, and during July, August, and Septem-
ber, Mr. James Mooney was occupied partly in extending the portion of the cyclo-
pedia relating to the Siouan .amily. Several bulletins are practically ready for the
press, and, save for conditions growing out of the modification of the law governing
the public printing, some of these would have been sent to the press before the close
of the year. :

In 1883 Mr. C. C. Royce was employed in the Bureau to collect and tabulate the
various treaties with the Indian tribes relating to the cession and transfer of lands.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work was substantially completed, and the lands affected by the various treaties
described in schedules and platted on maps. These schedules and maps were duly
turned in by Mr. Royce and were added to the archives of the office for use in con-
nection with the more strictly ethnologic researches. Since that date frequent
requests for information concerning the Indian land treaties have been received, and
thereby the value and accuracy of the work has been fully tested. During the year
the demand for such information so increased that it was decided to submit the
material for publication. While the schedules and maps were in most respects ready
for printing, revision of certain portions seemed to be required, and a general intro-
duction was thought to be desirable. sAccordingly in November the work of revision
was assigned to Dr. Cyrus Thomas, who also undertook the preparation of the
requisite introductory chapter. The remainder of the fiscal year was spent by Dr.
Thomas chiefly in the completion of this task, which was not quite done at the end
of that time. The work is designed for publication as Volume VIII of the Contri-
butions to North American Ethnology.

LINGUISTICS.

As the researches relating to primitive peoples in this and other countries pro-
gressed the importance of linguistic studies became more and more apparent. Man-
kind is preeminent partly because of a variety of individual characteristics, yet in
large measure because of social organization; and it is through organization that
men have been successively raised from savagery to barbarism, from barbarism to
civilization, and from simple civilization to the highest enlightenment and humanity,
Now, the basis of organization is expression, and the art of expression is accordingly
paramount among the arts of men, and ethnologists have found that the grade of
development and the classific relations of peoples are more justly indicated by their
arts of oral expression than in any other way. Thus the accepted ethnologic classi-
fication in this and other countries 1s primarily, if not wholly, linguistic.

The importance of linguistic researches has been recognized in the Bureau of
American Ethnology from the outset, and much labor has been expended in the col-
lection of linguistic literature as a basis for the classification of the tribes and also
as a means for still further extending the principles of ethnic classification.

During the last fiscal year this branch of the work has been carried forward con-
tinuously by Dr. Albert 8S. Gatschet and Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, and during a part of
the year by the Director and Mr. J. Owen Dorsey.

The work of the Director in linguistics during the year was largely ancillary to
the researches in psychology and in anthropologic classification. In this connection
portions of the rich store of linguistic manuscripts were examined, and the princi-
ples of linguistic development were formulated for the use of the collaborators.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey was occupied during July in (1) the preparation of a cata-
logue of the Teton-Dakota manuscripts by Messrs. Bushotter and Bruyier, in pos-
session of the Bureau, and (2) the continuation of his work on the Winnebago texts
and dictionary slips, noted in previous reports; and during August the first of
these lines of work was completed, and he then rearranged the linguistic manu-
scripts of the fireproof vaults of the Bureau. Many of these manuscripts are
unique. A large proportion represent the work of the regular collaborators of the
Bureau, but several have been derived from other sources by exchange or by dona-
tion, through the interest in the subject developed early in the history of the
Bureau. The material is of great scientific value, and it is deemed important that
it should be arranged in readily accessible form, in connection with a suitable cata-
logue. On completing this task, Mr. Dorsey resumed the preparation of material for
the synonymy of the Siouan stock, in connection with which he prepared during
November a brief memoir on Siouan sociology, which was afterwards revised by
Mr. McGee for incorporation in the sixteenth annual report of the Bureau. During
December Mr. Dorsey’s work was interrupted by illness, which, to the great loss of
science, terminated fatally.
;

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Gatschet was engaged in elaborating the
large body of Shawano linguistic material described in preceding reports. This
work was continued until the end of September, and a large number of lexic and
erammatic elements were extracted and arranged on cards. In connection with this
work Dr. Gatschet prepared an ethnographic sketch of the Shawano for incorpora-
tion in the cyclopedia of Indian tribes and carried forward his comparative tabu-
lation of the phonetics, grammar, etymology, and syntaxes of all the Algonquian
dialects. Special attention was given to this comparative work throughout the
remaining portion of the year. During June particular attention was given to the
Peoria linguistics, which Dr. Gatschet has continued to elaborate in connection with
his comparative work on the Algonquian languages. The studies and comparisons of
this material indicate that it is in condition for publication so far as the vocabulary
is concerned, though further material will be required before the grammar can be
perfected. There is now in the Bureau archives a large body of carefully selected
material relating to the Algonquian languages, collected mainly through Dr.
Gatschet’s persevering industry. Considerable portions of the material are substan-
tially ready for publication; but it seems desirable, before sending the matter to
the press, to extend researches concerning certain of the dialects and to introduce
the whole by a discussion of the modes of development and the means of dialectic
differentiation. A part of the Director’s work during the year was contributed
toward such an introduction and discussion.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied during a part of the year in transcribing in
form for publication the Tubari vocabulary collected during the last fiscal year by
Dr. Carl Lumholtz, and in making comparative studies of this and other material
obtained by Dr. Lumholtz and other explorers and ethnologists in southwestern
United States and Mexico. The task of preparing the Tubari material for publica-
tion proved to be great, but was nearly completed during the fiscal year; when ready
for printing, the monograph will be an unique and invaluable record of a once
numerous tribe, now nearly extinct.

At intervals during the year Mr. Hewitt was engaged in a comparative study of
the pronoun as used by various Indian tribes. The pronoun is an important element
in primitive speech, and has received much attention from linguists and philologists
in many parts of the world. The archives of the Bureau now afford a more extended
basis for research concerning this element than is known to exist elsewhere, and this
material has been used efficiently and successfully by Mr. Hewitt in his researches.

Although the discussion of the subject was well advanced at the close of the fiscal
year, it was not yet in form for publication.

MYTHOLOGY.

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, whose unfortunate state of health has somewhat
impeded the progress of her researches, continued the revision of notes and the final
writing of manuscript for her report on the Zuni Indians. This elaborate report has
been in preparation several months. In view of the great number and interest of
the ceremonials and the significant nature of the beliefs of the Zuni Indians, it is
thought desirable to spare no pains in making it as nearly exhaustive as possible,
and thus all details of ceremonial and belief are receiving attention, necessarily at
considerable expense in time.

Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, although not completely restored to health, has
been engaged in interesting researches concerning the significance of the arrow in
primitive thought, custom, and symbolism. Recent investigations of games of
divination, American and Oriental, by Mr. Stuart Culin (with whom Mr. Cushing
has in some measure cooperated) and by other students in this country and abroad,
have shown that among many primitive peoples games are conducted ceremonially
rather than for amusement, and that the games are commonly divinatory. The
researches have shown also that the arrow, either in itself or by symbol, is an essen-

SM 95 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tial element in such divinatory games. One of the results of these researches is a
demonstration of the world-wide use of the arrow and of the existence of close
analogies, if not homologies, in fundamental symbolism among the primitive peoples
of several continents. The researches also indicate relative recency in origin of
many of the games played for amusement among civilized peoples; and they show
the origin and successive stages of development of many of these games with remark-
able clearness. In scieftific research each well-established conclusion gives a new
point of view from which the student is able to see further than before into the
unknown, and from which also he is able to see relations among the known more
clearly than before. This is strictly true of Mr. Cushing’s researches concerning the
arrow. His preliminary conclusions have afforded insight into various primitive
customs and ideas.
PSYCHOLOGY.

Throughout the fiscai year the attention of the Director has been given chiefly to
the development of a classification of thé races of mankind with special reference to
the American tribes. To this end the physical and mental attributes of the tribes
were considered in detail; and at the same time the art products were studied as
the tangible expression of mental attributes. Pursuing the investigation, it became
evident that the distinctive characteristics of individuals, tribes, and peoples, are
substantially intellectual. In this way the Director was led to an analysis of the
psychic characteristics of mankind. At first the subject was obscure and appar-
ently so complex as to discourage investigation; but as the work progressed, and as
arts, organizations, beliefs, and ceremonials, were interpreted as expressions of
psychic organization, the causes of apparently unrelated facts fell into order and
substantial progress was made in the researches. During recent months it has been
found that the researches concerning mental attributes of the American Indians
afford a clew to the differentiation of individuals and families, and the coalescence
of groups, and the development of individual and collective attributes. Thus the
researches in psychology have already yielded a basis for the classification of the
native tribes, and have illuminated the aboriginal arts, institutions and beliefs.

Considerable progress has been made in the preparation of an extended report
on the classification .of the native races and their attributes on a comprehensive
psychic basis; but the memoir remained unfinished at the end of the year.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Notwithstanding the serious condition of his health, Mr. James C. Pilling con-
tinued almost uninterruptedly the compilation of the bibliography of the languages
of the North American Indians. The early part of the year was devoted specially to
the preparation of the Shahaptian bibliography; but realizing the gradual failure
of his strength, Mr. Pilling decided to lay aside this work and to devote his energy
to the more important and extensive bibliography of the Mexican languages, and
in this labor he was engaged until toward the close of the year, when, his strength
having become completely exhausted, he was compelled to abandon it. This bibli-
ography, however, is left in such condition that it is believed the compilation may
be made ready for publication without great labor. With the possible exception
of the Algonquian bibliography, the bibliography of the Mexican languages will
be the most voluminous of the entire series, and many inquiries concerning and
applications for the volume have already been made by students. After a long and
faithful career in behalf of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the fruits of which
are known the world over, Mr. Pilling’s services terminated with the close of the
month of May.

PUBLICATIONS.

Satisfactory progress was made with the publications of the Bureau during the

nologist in charge, aided largely by Mr. F. W. Hodge and Mr. George M. Wood.
As stated in my report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, the first proofs of
the thirteenth annual report were received from the Public Printer in June; by
the beginning of October the entire volume, with the exception of the administra-
tive report and the index, was in page form; the former has since been prepared
and transmitted, and the compilation of the index was well under way at the close of
the year.

On June 1 the manuscript of the text and illustrations for the fourteenth annual,
and on June 14 the copy for the fifteenth annual were transmitted to the printer,
but no proofs had been received at the close of the year.

Proof reading of the bulletin bearing the title Chinook Texts, by Franz Boas,
was continued from the last fiscal year (when 176 pages were in type), and carried
to completion by the middle of December. The edition of this bulletin was delivered
in May, 1895.

Final proof reading of the bulletin An Ancient Quarry in Indian Territory, by
W. H..Holmes, was also completed, and in October the brochure was ready for
distribution.

Early in August the manuscripts of three other bulletins were transmitted to the
Public Printer. One of these, the List of Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology,
by F. W. Hodge, was received shortly afterward, and in November the edition was
delivered. In September the first proofs of Archeologic Investigations in James
and Potomac Valleys, by Gerard Fowke, were received. By the close of the year
the proof reading was completed, and the edition was delivered by the Government
Printing Office in May, 1895. During the same period proof of the bulletin entitled
' Siouan Tribes of the East, by James Mooney, was read, and the edition received also
in May.

To summarize, the following publications were delivered by the Public Printer
and transmitted to the regular correspondents of the Bureau during the fiscal year:

Eleventh annual report, for 1889-90, containing, in addition to the Director’s
report of 25 pages, the following memoirs: (1) The Sia, by Matilda Coxe Stevenson.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Library.—The growth of the library, mainly through exchange with scientific

institutions and individuals: throughout the world, has been steady. T..1e number

_ of volumes in possession of the Bureau is 5,029, an increase of 679 volumes since the
last fiscal year. The accession of pamphlets and periodicals during the same period
has been proportionately great.

52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Illustrations.—The preparation of illustrations for the publications of the Bureau
of American Ethnology has been continued under the direct supervision of Mr.
De Lancey W. Gill, to whose artistic skill and intelligent interest in anthropologic
subjects the high standard of the pictorial part of the Bureau’s published works is
largely due.

Photographs.—In addition to the splendid series of photographs made by Mr. Din-
widdie, under the direction of Mr. McGee, during the season of exploration among
the Seri and Papago, and those made by Mr. Mindeleff at Canyon de Chelly, indi-
vidual and group photographs were made of an Osage and an Otoe delegation who
visited Washington in February and March, respectively.

NECROLOGY.

Garrick Mallery.—Col. Garrick Mallery, who-died at his home in Washington City,
October 24, 1894, was born in Wilkesbarre, Pa., April 23, 1831. After his graduation
at Yale College and a due course of study under the direction of his father, Judge
Garrick Mallery, he began the practice of law in Philadelphia, which he continued
until the outbreak of the civil war, when he entered the volunteer service as captain in
the Seventy-first Pennsylvania Infantry. Throughoutthe rebellion Mallery displayed
unusual bravery. In June, 1862, at the battle of Peach Orchard, Virginia, he was
twice severely wounded, and while lying on the battlefield was captured and sent
to Libby Prison, at Richmond, where he remained until exchanged and sent to his
home at Philadelphia. As soon as he had sufficiently recovered from his wounds
Mallery returned to duty and became lieutenant-colonel of the Thirteenth Pennsyl-
vania Cavalry, which position he retained until the close of the war. In 1866 he
was commissioned captain of the Forty-third Infantry of the Regular Army, and
later the brevet rank of colonel was bestowed on him for gallant and meritorious
services. His scientific knowledge was early recognized by the War Department,
and in 1870 he was detailed to execute a plan adopted by law for the prosecution of
meteorological researches by the Signal Service, and in this connection frequently
acted as chief signal officer of the Army.

Colonel Mallery’s studies of the ethnology of the Indians of North America began
with his military service’on the frontier. In 1876 he was assigned to the command
of Fort Rice, Dak., where he became absorbed in the sign language and pictography
of the plains tribes. His writings on these subjects soon became well and favorably
known, and on the organization of the Bureau of Ethnology in 1879 his services
were at once engaged by the director for the prosecution of the researches he had
so well begun. In 1880 his Introduction to the Study of Sign Language Among the
North American Indians as Illustrating the Gesture Speech of Mankind, was pub-
lished, followed immediately by A Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals of the
North American Indians, with Some Comparisons. The latter volume formed the
basis of his memoir on Pictographs of the North American Indians, a preliminary
paper of 256 pages published in the fourth annual report of the Bureau, and the.
greatly extended memoir of 807 pages and over 1,300 illustrations bearing the title
Picture Writing of the American Indians—a monument to his industry and ingenious
research—comprising the body of the tenth annual report of the Bureau. Colonel
Mallery’s Sign Language Among North American Indians Compared with that Among
other People and Deaf-Mutes, which appeared in the first annual report of the
Bureau, was based on his Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals, but even this
monograph of 290 pages and 300 illustrations was regarded only as preliminary, his
great work on this subject remaining unfinished at the time of his death.

Colonel Mallery was the first to direct serious attention to the investigation of the
population of the American aborigines in past times as compared to the present, and
his paper, The Former and Present Number of Our Indians, effectually exploded the
old theory that the aboriginal population of America at the time of the discovery
was much greater than at the present period. But Colonel Mallery’s anthropologic
researches were not confined to the American Indians. His studies in general soci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

ology show a wide and intimate acquaintance with the literature and peoples of both
continents, and his various writings exemplify his scholarly taste and strong power
of philosophic comparison. Among the papers pertaining to this subject prepared
by Colonel Mallery are: Manners and Meals, Greeting by Gesture, Customs of Cour-
tesy, Philosophy and Specialties, and The Gesture Speech of Man. His study,
“‘Tsraelite and Indian—a parallel in planes of culture,” provoked much discussion
among scientific men, and was translated into the German by Dr. Frederick S. Krauss.

In the words of a life-long friend, Garrick Mallery was ‘‘ the gallant soldier with
a stainless record; the scholar largely read in the literature of his own and other
times; the man of science who has left an imperishable record of ingenious and far-
reaching research; the trusted councilor in the societies which honored him with
their highest dignities; the genial companion; the affectionate husband; the staunch
friend; the high-bred gentleman.”

James Owen Dorsey.—In the death of Mr. Dorsey American ethnology lost a bril-
liant student. Born in Baltimore October 31, 1848, he acquired his primary education
in the schools of his native city. At anearly age he evinced a marked precocity in the
acquirement of language; it is said that at 6 he learned the Hebrew alphabet, and
ere he reached his eleventh year he could read the language with facility. At 14
young Dorsey entered the Central High School, now City College, and pursued the
classic course, but during his second year he was constrained to abandon his studies
by reason of ill health. In the autumn of 1867 he entered the preparatory depart-

_ ment of the Theological Seminary of Virginia, and the junior class in 1869. Two
years later he was ordained a deacon of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in
May began mission work among the Ponka Indians of Dakota Territory. But the
rigorous climate and the vicissitudes of early frontier life soon affected his health,
which was never robust, and after serious attacks of illness in July, 1872, and early
in 1873, he was compelled to abandon his mission work in August of the latter year,
soon after he had acquired the ability to converse with the Indians without the aid
or an interpreter. Returning to Maryland he was engaged in parish work until
July, 1878.

While pursuing his work as missionary among the Indians, Mr. Dorsey became a
correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution. His profound knowledge of the dia-
lects of the Siouan languages early attracted the attention of Maj. J. W. Powell, at
whose instance he was sent among the Omaha tribe in 1878 for the purpose of
acquiring additional linguistic and other anthropologic material, remaining among
that people until the spring of 1880. In the meantime, upon the organization of
the Bureau of Ethnology, in 1879, he was immediately chosen one of the scientific
corps and was arduously engaged in linguistic and sociologic work up to the time of
the illness which terminated in his death in this city on February 4, 1895.

His great modesty and his strong conviction that the views of astudent should be
molded by truths prevented him from formulating subjective theories by which to
judge the value of his facts. In the later years of his studies in linguistic morphol-
ogy he began to feel the inadequacy of the venerable agglutination theory to explain
all the facts of word structure prevailing in the languages he was studying, and
he came to look upon adaptation—the infusing with a new meaning or function an
element which before had or had not any definite signification—as an important
and potent factor in the genesis and development of morphologic structures.
His mastery of the wealth of forms in the languages he studied enabled him to
illustrate copiously the working of this principle. His linguistic acumen and pains-
taking accuracy are brought out in his interlinear translations of numerous and
voluminous texts, both in print and in manuscript. His marvelous aptitude in
discriminating, grasping, and retaining sounds enabled him to obtain accurate
vocabularies and texts with great ease, and to detect differences of meaning and
function through differences of sound. His freedom from subjective theories, his
_ deep erudition, and enlightened conservatism made him one of the foremost
_ authorities in American linguistics.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition to numerous essays dealing with the linguistic ana other anthropologie
matters which appeared from time to time in various periodicals, Mr. Dorsey pub-
lished under the auspices of the Bureau of Ethnology the following excellent and
suggestive memoirs: Omaha Sociology, Osage Traditions, A Study of Siouan Cults,
Omaha Dwellings, Furniture, and Implements; Omaha and Ponka Letters, and The
Dhegiha Language, with Myths, Stories, and Letters. He also edited the Dakota-Eng-
lish Dictionary, and Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography of the late Rey.S. R.
Riggs, forming, respectively, Volumes VII and 1X of Contributions to North American
Ethnology. At the time of his death he had completed a paper on Siouan sociology.
Among the papers and articles of marked importance published in extra-govern-
mental mediamay be mentioned Migrations of Siouan Tribes, Comparative Phonology
of Four Siouan Languages, An Account of the War Customs of the Osages, and
Mourning and War Customs of the Kansas.

By reason of the purity and unselfishness of his motives, and the warmth and sun-
shine of his amiable nature, he won the esteem of all who had the pleasure of meet-
ing him, and, being ever kind, affable, and cheerful to his colleagues, ever willing to
aid and advise them, James Owen Dorsey was sincerely and cordially loyed and
revered by all.

Very respectfully, J. W. POWELL,
Director.
Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX III.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, 1895.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. It is
confined almost entirely to the presentation of statistics, compiled upon the plan
established in 1888.

The actual number of packages received during the year was somewhat over 9,000
(or 8 per cent) more than during the year preceding, the increase in the weight of
packages being nearly 92,000 pounds. This increase was due in part to the trans-
mission of a considerable number of packages which, on account of insufficient
appropriation, had to be declined during the preceding year, and more especially to
the transmission of the Congressional Library exchange, including a large number
of packages that had accumulated. Four hundred and fifty-nine more cases were
shipped abroad than during any previous year.

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU.

The work of the Bureau is succinctly given in the annexed table, prepared in a
form adopted in preceding reports:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by Con-
gress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose, and in part by appropriations
made to different Government Departments or Bureaus, either in their contingent
funds or in specific terms for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the cost
of transportation.

In 1878 the Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for
the publications sent out or received by the various Government Bureaus, this charge
being necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution. For
similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of like amount to State
institutions, from which a further small revenue has been derived.

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the exchange service
for the fiscal year 1894-95 was in the following terms:

‘“‘Por expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includin
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, seventeen thousand dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1895, covering
the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows:

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government
Bureaus and other sources was $5,660.88, which added to the appropriation of $17,000
makes the sum practically available for the specific purpose of exchanges $22,660.88,
while the expenses amounted to $21,090.61, the balance being held for repayment to
the Smithsonian Institution of the sum $944.36, which was advanced in the year
1893-94 to enable the Bureau to carry on its operations, and for other outstanding
liabilities. ;

CORRESPONDENTS.

As mentioned in previous reports, it became necessary in the latter part of 1891 to
provide for an addition to the series of “‘ledger” cards upon which were entered all
packages sent or received from a given society or individual. A plan was approved
by which the cards were much reduced in size, the bulk of the older cards having
already become a matter of serious consideration.

The new and smaller ledger cards were begun on January 1, 1892, and since that
date all the transactions have been entered uponthem. The abbreviation of the rec-
ords and their greater convenience in handling proved to be of the utmost service
when it became necessary to reduce the clerical force in the office, and it is only by
such abbreviation of the records and by the introduction of several minor labor-say-
ing devices that it has been at all possible to prevent the work from falling seriously
behind.

The number of ledger cards on June 30, 1894, was 20,223, and on June 30, 1895,
23,408. The difference of 3,185 represents the increase in the number of new societies
or individuals upon the exchange lists during the year making use of the service,
while the entire number of cards (23,408) is the number of societies and individuals,
both domestic and foreign, with which the exchange office has had relations since
January 1, 1892.

Attention has been directed for some time past to the fact that the list of corre-
spondents in the exchange office requires revision and recopying upon cards, the
original office list prepared and printed in 1886 having become so worn and so over-
crowded by frequent interlineations as to be almost illegible. This revision was
authorized by the Secretary in March, 1895, and the work was completed by Mr.
Boehmer before the expiration of the fiscal year.

The statistical statement of this work shows the existence of 23,408 names, of
which 10,765 are establishments and 12,643 individuals. They are located in 3,771
places, embracing all parts of the world from Disco, Greenland, in north latitude
70°, to Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, in latitude 50° south, and extending east and
west to 178° and 170°, respectively. A recapitulation of the work is given in the
following table:

The special exchange list for the distribution of Smithsonian documents is also in
need of revision and correction. It was prepared many years ago, and not a few of
the libraries to which it was deemed proper at the time to send these publications
have sunk into obscurity, while many new libraries have been established to which
it seems desirable that Smithsonian documents should be sent. A considerable
number of requests are received each year inviting an exchange of publications, or
requests for the completion of the Smithsonian series of documents, with which it
is rarely practicable to comply. This work has been begun, but had not been com-
pleted at the close of the year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which is given below,* the ez-
change of the official publications of the United States Government with other
countries has been continued by the Institution, and it now forms a very large
proportion of the Bureau’s work.

* CONVENTION CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES FOR OFFICIAL DOCU-
MENTS AND SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY PUBLICATIONS.

[Translation from the French. ]

The President of the United States of America, His Majesty the King of the Bel-
gians, His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain,
His Majesty the King of Italy, His Majesty the King of Portugal and of the Algarves,
His Majesty the King of Servia, the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation,
desiring to establish, on the basis adopted by the conference which met at Brussels
from the 10th to the 14th April, 1883, a system of international exchanges of the
official documents and of the scientific and literary publications of their respective
States, have appointed for their plenipotentiaries, to wit:

The President of the United States of America, Mr. Lambert Tree, minister resident
of the United States of America at Brussels; His Majesty the King of the Belgians,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provisions
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to, was
23,028, and there have been received in return 974 packages. The United States
Government Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 37,871
packages, and have received in return 14,813 packages. The total number of exchanges
for Government libraries has therefore been 15,787 packages received and 37,871
packages sent abroad, a total of 76,681 packages, or about 71 per cent of the entire
number handled.

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish scale as
ourown. Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the Governments
with which the Institution is in correspondence would also probably result in a
considerable increase to the Library of Congress.

the Prince de Caraman, his minister of foreign affairs, and the Chevalier de Moreau,
his minister of agriculture, industry, and public works,

His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, the Count de Villeneuve, his envoy extraordi-
nary and minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, Mr. de Tavira, chargé d’affaires ad
interim of Spain at Brussels,

His Majesty the King of Italy, the Marquis Maffei, his envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

His Majesty the King of Portugal and of the Algarves, the Baron de Sant’Anna,
envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His Very Faithful Majesty,

His Majesty the King of Servia, Mr. Marinovitch, his envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

The Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, Mr. Rivier, its special plenipo-
tentiary,

Who, after having communicated between themselves their full powers, which are
found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:

ARTICLE I. There shall be established in each of the contracting States, a bureau
charged with the duty of the exchanges.

Art. II. The publications which the contracting States agree to exchange are the
following:

1st. The official documents, parliamentary and administrative, which are pub-
lished in the country of their origin.

2nd. The works executed by order and at the expense of the Government.

Art. III. Each bureau shall cause to be printed a list of the publications that it
is able to place at the disposal of the contracting States.

This list shall be corrected and completed each year and regularly addressed to
all the bureaus of exchange.

ArT. IY. The bureaus of exchange will arrange between themselves the number of
copies which they may be able eventually to demand and furnish.

ArT. V. The transmission shall be made directly from bureau to bureau. Uniform
models and formulas will be adopted for the memoranda of the contents of the cases,
as well as for all the administrative correspondence, requests, acknowledgments of
reception, etc.

Arr. VI. For exterior transmissions, each State assumes the expense of packing
and transportation to the place of destination. Nevertheless, when the transmissions
shall be made by sea, special arrangements will regulate the share of each State in
the expense of transportation.

Art. VII. The bureaus of exchange will serve, in an official capacity, as interme-
diaries between the learned bodies and literary and scientific societies, etc., * * *
of the contracting States for the reception and transmission of their publications.
It remains, however, well understood that, in such case, the duty of the bureaus
of exchange will be confined to the free transmission of the works exchanged, and

62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A large surplus of Government documents available for foreign exchanges has now
accumulated, the number of foreign Governments with which exchange relations
have been arranged not requiring at present the entire number received from the
printing office. The proper storage of these documents has now become a serious,
problem.

that these bureaus will not in any manner take the initiative to bring about the

establishment of such relations.
Art. VIII. These provisions apply only to the documents and works published

after the date of the present convention.

Art. IX. The States which have not taken part in the present convention are
admitted to adhere to it on their request.

This adhesion will be notified diplomatically to the Belgian Government, and by
that Government to all the other signatory States.

Art. X. The present convention will be ratified and the ratifications will be ex-
changed at Brussels as soon as practicable. It is concluded for ten years from the
day of the exchange of ratifications, and it will remain in foree beyond that time,
so long as one of the Governments shall not have declared six months in advance
that it renounces it.

In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed it and have there-
unto affixed their seals.

Done at Brussels in eight copies the 15th of March, 1886.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

J venture to again call attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the exchange
relations with Greece, which are in the same state asa year ago, when, on account of
the expenses attending the distribution of packages, the transmission of miscellaneous
exchanges was discontinued by request of the librarian of the United National and
University libraries, formerly acting as the medium for distributing publications.

The exchange with Mexico is still also in an extremely unsatisfactory condition,
and the transmission of the parliamentary documents to the Mexican Government
has been suspended awaiting some action by the Mexican authorities, to whose
attention the matter was brought through the Mexican minister.

Iam glad to report that the comparatively large repayments made to the Smith-
Sonian Institution by Government bureaus for the transmission of their exchanges
have enabled the Bureau to employ some additional assistance, by which means it
has become possible to bring up to a great extent the records that during the past
year had fallen into arrears. It was also found practicable to make a slight increase
in the regular working force of the Bureau, and I take pleasure in bearing witness
* to the efficiency of the employees in the exchange office, and in expressing apprecia-

tion of their efforts to dispose of all the accumulations of the preceding year and to
keep up with the added volume of work, and I beg leave to call to your notice the
careful attention to the interests of the Institution on the part of its special agents
abroad, Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipsic, and Messrs. William Wesley & Son, in London.

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and others for their liberality in granting the privilege of free freight or in other-
wise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other
firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the dis-
interested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge:

APPENDIX IY.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following. report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

The care of the collection of animals has engrossed most of the attention of the
employees. Such small additions to the buildings and inclosures as the funds at the
disposal of the park would allow have been made. Among these there may be
mentioned a new inclosure for beaver, which has been established in order to give
opportunity for the public to watch their building operations and to round a sepa-
rate colony, and because the beaver inclosure built last year was found insufficient
for the proper confinement of the animals.

It is evident that in order to maintain animals of this kind in security and safety,
more room and separate paddocks are necessary. At times they fight savagely with
each other, and when the inclosure is restricted even to half an acre of ground the
weaker one can not save himself by flight and is frequently killed. This has hap-
pened here.

Combats also take place among the buffalo and the elk, and if a herd of these
animals of any size is maintained it will be absolutely necessary to enlarge and
multiply the paddocks. Great need is felt for more buffalo cows.

Disorders due to confinement have not been absent. One interesting from a sci-
entific point of view was a spontaneous outbreak of rabies in one of the inclosures
for foxes, as these animals were apparently in perfect health and the disease could
not have been induced from without as far as is known. A single case at first
appeared and this inoculated the entire cage, seven animals in all being lost. This
- curious phenomenon is of great interest as bearing upon the sporadic appearance of
hydrophobia in the dog.

Careless feeding by visitors causes a great deal of trouble. Some animals habit-
ually overeat if allowed to do so, and the food which the public tender is often
unhealthful. <A fine cassowary died during the year from gastric irritation due to
this cause. A valuable Diana monkey was poisoned by laurel (Kalmia latifolia)
which she snatched from the hand of a visitor, though the utmost watchfulness is
exercised to keep this noxious plant from the animals.

Some very interesting additions to the collection have been made during the year.
From the Yellowstone Park 20 animals were received, among them a grizzly bear
weighing 730 pounds and of great ferocity, and 10 beaver. A beautiful sea lion was
obtained by exchange, as well asa fine boa constrictor. A fine young puma was
born, also a spotted lynx, several elk and Virginia deer, a zebu, and a llama.

The insufficient character of the buildings used for animals has been made appar-
ent en several occasions during the year. The ‘‘animal house” was constructed
with a view to the accommodation of the large carnivora and is not adapted for the
proper maintenance of monkeys, tropical birds, or pachyderms. Having no other
quarters, it has, however, been necessary to place under the same roof with lions and
tigers, that endure moderate cold well, other creatures that need a constant tempera-
ture of 75° to 80° F. and still others (such as the rhinoceros and hippopotamus) that
need still different conditions. The consequence of this is that more deaths occur than
would be the case were the buildings properly arranged, and it has not been possi-

68
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

ble to prevent such accidents with the means at disposal. It is hoped that funds
may be soon forthcoming for the construction of separate houses for birds and for
pachyderms.

Considerable attention has been paid to the improvement of the grounds during
the year. Near the eastern entrance to the park a culvert has been built to accom-
modate the little stream that enters here and feeds the swan pond, the opening
being concealed by rockwork and shrubs so as to present the appearance of a natu-
ral spring. Below the bridge on the main road a large number of bowlders have
been placed in the creek to present the appearance of a natural ledge, thus raising
the water some 3 or 4 feet. This very greatly improves the stretch of water below
and above the bridge and permitted the introduction of aquatic and semiaquatic
plants along the edges of the stream. It has also the effect of raising the level of
the water in the large pond for aquatic animals situated to the southward of the
meadow. :

A rustic footbridge has been thrown over the ravine that enters the park at
Ontario avenue leading to the stairway by which the public pass to and from the
electric-car line. The wing walls of the main bridge have been completed by the
addition of rustic coping, which very much adds to the appearance of the structure.
The banks of the creek above the bridge are now strengthened and protected by
lining them with Joose riprap and planting them with willows and other quick-
growing shrubs.

The roads have also received considerable attention. The main drive to the north
of the animal house has been widened to 50 feet, and greatly improved by laying a
telford pavement. The main road has aiso been properly graded and improved
between the elephant house and the buffalo house, and about 1,000 feet of it treated
with macadam, making a suitable drive. Macadam has been laid onthe road behind
the elephant house and on the main drive from the eastern entrance to the bridge,
and the large ellipse in front of the bear dens has been completed by the addition
of finely pulverized stone.

The road leading into the park from Woodley road has been commenced, the work
under a preliminary appropriation of $2,500 being done by the District authorities
and the remainder by the park under an appropriation for $5,000. The funds on
hand have been sufficient only to make a 6 per cent grade from Woodley road down
to the banks of the creek. In order to make this road practicable it should be
treated with macadam and a sidewalk be provided.

The water supply has been extended so as to supply the office of the park and the
garden in which vegetables are raised for the animals, and additional drinking
fountains have been put in. An additional sewer has been constructed, by which
the toilet rooms, the elephant house, and the hippopotamus tank can discharge.

A temporary fence has been built around the pond for aquatic birds, and the
fences of the buffalo and elk paddocks have been strengthened. These fences,
although apparently of great strength, are found in practice to need constant
watching, as the powerful attacks of these animals cause them finally to give way.

Some small plantations of shrubbery have been made from time to time as the
funds at the disposal of the park would permit. These are principally in the vicinity
of the buffalo and elephant houses and in parts of the park where it seemed neces-
sary to seclude certain parts from the direct view of the public.

APPENDIX Y.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

During the past fiscal year the work of the Astro-physical Observatory has con.
tinued to be the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum by the bolometri«
method, fully described in the report of the observatory for 1893.

This work consists, briefly, in the production of curves, automatically traced on a
photographic plate by means of the bolometer and its attendant apparatus, which
record by their deflections the existence, position, and intensity of (invisible) absorp-
tion lines in the infra-red spectrum from a prism of rock salt or from a grating.

Such a curve, ideally perfect, would show every line in the spectrum as a deflec-
tion of the curve in its proper place on the plate, and there would be no deflection
present not due to such a solar line. A curve which fulfills the first condition as
regards every considerable line, is in substance already at hand, and has been
shown even in a former stage of the work, and it is in fact easily obtained at
any time by the present method, so long as we confine our attention to the prin-
cipal newly discovered lines; lines or deflections, that is, which are due to solar
and telluric causes. (These may be called “true” lines as distinguished from the
smaller ‘‘false” lines due to minute local disturbance.) I say the principal lines,
because those first discovered result from deflections whose amount is relatively con-
siderable as compared with accidental local disturbances, and in this case the true
lines are distinguishabie (if only by their size and prominence) from the false ones,
the latter being due to many causes, which all, however, tend to produce more or less
minute deflections. This minuteness, then, fortunately, is one of the characteristics
of the false lines. Now, though these minor accidental deflections are negligible
compared with the more prominent real ones, yet as the work progresses and still
finer and finer details are sought, we must evidently at last reach a condition where,
having discovered all the larger true lines, we in seeking smaller and smailer ones,
finally come to such minute deflections that these, though constant, are reduced to
the same order of magnitude as the accidental or “‘ false” ones, however minute the
latter may be.

(In this connection it is proper to state that the plate of the spectrum showing very
minute detail, published in January of this year, had already been given in illustra-
tion of the process and printed in the Proceedings of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, for August, 1894, accompanied by the statement that it was
presented ‘‘only in illustration,” and was ‘‘not to be treated as a criterion of the
final results,” and that the statement that ali these lines had then been verified
escaped attention. )

It is again fortunate, that our criterion is not that of size alone, but that in order
to distinguish between true deflections, however minute (due to solar and telluric
causes), and minute ‘‘false” deflections of the same order of size due to accidental
disturbances, an independent, simple, and infallible criterion exists—infallible, that
is, in theory, but not always easy in practical application.

15
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

This criterion has been elsewhere mentioned, and indeed is sufficiently obvious to
need little explanation; for if among a large number of curves representing the same
spectral region a deflection asserts itself constantly at the same place, that deflec-
tion is evidently due to a constant cause and not to an accidental one. Now, from
the nature of the process, it is hardly possible to imagine any efficient constaat
cause of such minute abrupt deflections as are in question, which is not a solar or
telluric cause, and it is these only we seek. Again, it will be seen that, provided
the deflections are of a finite order of minuteness, and that our mechanism can record
with such precision that the true or solar line falls at absolutely the same place on
each of even two plates, the chances are infinite against any exact coincidence of
lines which are not ‘‘true.” In practice, where absolute accuracy is unattainable,
we mast determine experimentally between what limits error customarily presents
itself, in the case of the true lines and in that of the false, and then ascertain what
probable error attaches to the result from the final comparison of any number.

During the preceding year certain main deflections, somewhat less than one
hundred in number, were so established as ‘‘true;” but when within the past year
the work reached a state of progress warranting the more detailed investigation
of the spectrum alluded to, upon applying the criterion mentioned above to the
deflections representing the minute lines with which the work was now dealing, it
became evident that the number of very small casual deflections made it desirable
to subject the method of making the curves to a renewed examination, in which
the source of each class of minute error should be as far as possible discriminated.
This examination hasshown that the site which the observatory occupies is exposed
to local tremors and magnetic disturbances in’a still greater degree than had been
anticipated. The appended table gives a rough classification of the sources of these

errors.

teries.

From what has been said it will be seen that in order that the agreement
of anumber of separate curves might furnish conclusive evidence of the reality of
a line, it became necessary to establish experimentally the amount of accidental
deflection due to local tremor wholly, and also the admissible amount of final error
inherent in the mechanical, optical, and photographic processes employed. The
following degree of accuracy has been judged possible as a final attainment with
the present means, and is that aimed at, although not yet reached. This aim is to
produce curves which, in a length of 60 centimeters, shall be free from any probable
error of a magnitude greater than one-tenth of a millimeter—a quantity whose
minuteness relative to the means employed may be understood when it is mentioned
that it corresponds to six-tenths of a second of arc, as measured on the circle of the
spectrometer.

For the above reasons it will be seen that the improvement of theapparatus used,
as well as the investigation of sources of possible error, became the most important
work of the observatory before the publication of authoritative results.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ri

Iam pleased to state that by the use of the improved apparatus, to which I refer
later, the amount of the probable error has been greatly reduced, and the investiga-
tion of the causes of false deflections has justified the belief that those not directly
due to the site of the observatory will be, ere long, eliminated.

During the progress of this work the making of observations with the apparatus
on hand has not been suspended, but, on the contrary, has produced a larger num-
ber of bolographs than during any preceding year. The work in detail may most
conveniently be classified under three general heads:

A. General spectro-bolographic work.
B. Special spectro-bolographic work.
C. Improvements in apparatus and methods.

A. The subjoined table shows in detail the number of working days and the num-
ber of bolographs made in the observatory during the year.

On the 5th of December, 1894, an extended experimental investigation of the
errors exhibited by the apparatus and the methods in use was begun on a scale not
before tried, and the effects from variations in the potentials of the batteries and
from temperature effects in the complicated circuit of the bolometer, as well as
from the tremors of the earth and changes of the magnetic field, incident to the bad
location of the observatory, were found to be larger than had been assumed from
previous trial. Since that time the reduction of these errors has been the constant
effort of the observatory.

The entire circuit of the bolometer has been overhauled and made to consist, as
nearly as possible, of copper of the same density and without joints which might
produce thermal effects.

The experimental bolographs, referred to in the above table, were, for the most
part, devoted to the investigation of the error produced by minute variations in the
potentials of the batteries used in the bolometer circuit. In order to give some idea
of the delicacy of the performance required of this apparatus, it may be added that
the variations averaged only 0.0000007 of a volt, but were still considered to be too
large for accurate working. It has also become evident that the arrangement of
balancing coils, which have up to the present time been of the usual laboratory
type, were capable of producing, under the fluctuations of temperature in tho
observatory, effects of the magnitude of those produced by the minute solar lines,
which it was now being attempted to define and measure.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The greater number of working days have been devoted to the production of a
large number of bolographs of the upper infra-red spectrum made under widely
varying conditions for the purpose of studying the possible causes of the errors
which have been roughly indicated above. To this end an investigation of the per-
sonalities of different observers, as they may affect the final results of each observa-
tion, has also been undertaken.

B. The classification, detailed examination, and final reduction of bolographs to
the linear translations, or ‘‘ cylindrics,” which resemble in appearance photographs
of the visible spectrum, has kept pace with the production of the most satisfactory
curves.

The production of these linear spectra involves the services of a photographer
during three to five days in each instance, and extreme accuracy; for this reason,
only the best of the curves obtained are subjected to this process. The table given
below includes only those plates which are free from defects, and consequently rep-
resents but a small part of the labor involved in the production of results which

may seem intrinsically small:

C. The development of the instruments used, to as near mechanical perfection as
it is possible to obtain with the means at command and under the conditions pre-
vailing in the observatory, has constituted, for the reasons given above, a very
large part of the work up to the present time.

The siderostat has been furnished with a new counterpoise for the altazimuth
mirror support, a new direction axis and base for the mirror, and a new polar axis,
resting upon ball bearings, completed December 1, 1894. This massive instrument,
which has been greatly modified since it left the maker’s hands until it has taken
the form shown in the annexed illustration, is now capable of being brought to
exact adjustment, and needs only the addition of a new governor for its driving
clock to make it most efficient.

With the hope of compensating in some degree for the extreme variations of tem-
perature due to the construction of the present building, a conduit for warm air in
winter and cold air in summer from the blowers in the Smithsonian building was
constructed. The coils of piping for bringing the admitted air to the proper tem-
perature after it has reached the observatory are not yet complete, and the need of
‘YSLSWO108-OYLOSdS JHL JO YOOND ONIAIYG SHL

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

a more perfect automatic regulation of the temperature (in the interest of the work
-rather than of the comfort of the observer) is being provided for.

During the year 1893 the galvanometer, perhaps the most important part of the train
of apparatus, was brought to such a condition that no further improvement in this
direction was regarded as necessary until justified by a more permanent building
and better facilities for isolation from magnetic and seismic disturbances than are
at present capable of being obtained, but in order to make the best use of the facili-
ties at hand, the former unstable galvanometer pier has been replaced by a massive
brick and stone structure, finished March 23, 1895, built in such a manner that pro-
tection from the vibrations of the surface earth is insured. It is, however, proper
to repeat that the vibrations of the earth, as well as the seismic disturbances, conse-
quent to the location of the observatory amid the traffic of the city, continue to pre-
sent serious causes of error which no possible care or pains seems able to prevent.

By examinations conducted in October, 1894, it was shown that the driving clock
of the spectro-bolometer train performed its part with less than the rigorous accuracy
required. It has consequently been replaced by a much more accurate mechanism,
of which an illustration is given, installed April 2, 1895, which was constructed by
Messrs. Warner & Swasey, of Cleveland, in part, and in part by Mr. John A. Brashear,
of Allegheny. This clock which controls both the movement of the photographic
plate and of the great azimuth circle carrying the prism, has been shown, under the
strain of repeated use, to perform its duty within the limit of allowed probable
error—that is, one-tenth of a millimeter in 60 centimeters motion of the plate, or six-
tenths of a second of arc in one degree at the circle. A new pier has also been
constructed for the support of this clock.

A mean solar standard clock, by the Howard Watch and Clock Company, has been
placed in the basement of the Smithsonian Institution.

Great difficulty has always been experienced in the proper protection and preser-
vatron of the optical surfaces of the rock salt necessarily employed. <A large gain
in time and economy has been made by introducing the practice of repolishing the
surfaces in the observatory itself, and it is now possible to refigure the surface of a
large prism or lens in a few hours, at a small cost, where it was formerly the custom
to send such a prism or lens to distant opticians at a considerable expense of time
and money.

A new bolometer case, with provision for receiving radiations from two sources,
and many minor pieces of apparatus, have been constructed in the workshop of the
observatory. These improvements in the apparatus have been accompanied by
improvements in the method of their use, which will more fittingly form the subject
of future report, but they may nearly all be connected with the need of a more con-
stant temperature, combined with freedom from ground and magnetic tremors.

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR.

Some further experimental data were collected for the more accurate determina-
tion of the laws governing the change of the index of refraction of rock salt, with
changes in its temperature. The approach of observing weather prevented the com-
pletion of the experiments.

All of the bolometers on hand have been calibrated, in order that their relative
efficiencies, as well as the means of reading their indications quantitatively, might
be known.

The very minute and rapid changes in the potential of certain types of storage
batteries, intended for the use with the bolometer, have been measured, and their
effect upon the indications of the bolometer investigated.

It should finally be repeated, as the most important conclusion of the year, that
the final degree of precision attainable can never be reached in the present site.

PERSONNEL.

Mr, C. G. Abbot was appointed as assistant in the observatory on the 19th of June,
1895.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Srr: I have the honor to present herewith a report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of
Congress extend from 292,426 to 314,499.

The following table gives an analysis in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts of the accessions during the year:

|

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
and the library of the Astrophysical Observatory 321 volumes and pamphlets and
1,995 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,316, and a grand total of accessions for
the year of 31,953 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

Of these accessions, 133 volumes, 7,451 parts of volumes, and 619 pamphlets were
retained for the use of the United States National Museum, and 1,176 medical disser-
tations were deposited in the library of the Surgeon-General, United States Army;
the remaining publications were sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday
after their receipt.

In carrying out the plan formulated by the Secretary in 1887 for increasing the
library exchanges, 473 letters were written asking for publications not on the list, or
for numbers to complete the series already in the library. Iam enabled to report
that 182 new exchanges have been thereby secured, and that 97 defective series
were either completed or added to, as far as the publishers were able to supply the
missing parts.

A separate record of periodicals received is kept, and from this it appears that the
library is now currently receiving 3,045 periodicals, magazines, and publications of
learned societies. This number does not, however, include all such publications
arriving at the Institution, inasmuch as many societies whose publications-are issued
irregularly had not been included in the periodical record up to within recent times.
A detailed statement of the language and frequency of issue of these publications is
herewith given, roughly divided into pure science, of which there are 1,565, applied
science 704, and miscellaneous 776.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel, Greifswald, Leipzig,
Berlin, Halle-Wurtem, Louvain,
Bern, Heidelburg, Lund,
Bonn, Helsingfors, Marburg,
Breslau, Jena, Tubingen,
Erlangen, Johns Hopkins, Utretcht,
Freiburg, Kiel, Wiirzburg,
Giessen, Konigsberg, Zurich.

Of late a considerable number of American universities have begun to publisn
dissertations accepted for the degree of doctor of philosophy, and correspondence is
now in progress for the purpose of securing full sets of these for the Library.

For some time the question of providing reading matter for the employees of the
Institution has been under consideration. During the year the Secretary authorized
the purchase and binding of sets of a number of the more important literary maga-
zines. These magazines, which are freely used, are also of much value in a scientific
library, as they often contain early reports of explorations, new discoveries, and
inventions.

Through a course of changes in the Smithsonian Building, much needed improve-
ments in the ventilation and lighting of the reading room and library offices were
rendered possible.

The list of donors to the library has become so large that it is impossible to specify
them. Attention, however, must be directed to a magnificent gift of His Imperial
Majesty the Sultan of Turkey of more than fifty volumes of photographs represent-
ing the present condition of the Ottoman Empire in all departments of industry,
learning, and art. The Institution has also acquired the library of the late Robert
Stanton Avery by bequest.

In addition to the reading room, which contains the current periodicals and trans-
actions of learned societies, a room is provided for works of reference, and sectional
libraries relating to astronomy and aerodromics are maintained. A collection of
books and catalogues containing addresses is deposited in the office of the Bureau of
International Exchanges.

The library has now set apart five communicating rooms on the north side of the
first floor, as well as a room on the second floor of the building, for prints. In addi-
tion to these, the various sectional libraries above referred to are kept in the differ-
ent office rooms. The space assigned is more than double that allowed in past years,
and the facilities thus accorded are much appreciated by the staff of the Institution
and of the various scientific bureaus of the Government in Washington. _

By your direction I spent the months of August and September, 1894, in England
and on the Continent of Europe, in examining into the exchange service. I also
visited a numberof libraries and booksellers and secured information concerning the
indexing of scientific literature. A detailed report upon these subjects has already
been presented to you.

Respectfully submitted.

Cyrus ADLER, Librarian.
Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1895.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion, This method has been continued in the present report, for 1895.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.!

By PRoF. ARTHUR SCHUSTER, F. B.S.

It is hardly possible to imagine that the first experimenter who
obtained an electric spark sufficiently strong to produce a sensible
sound should not at once have been struck by the fact that he was in
the presence of thunder and lightning on a small scale. We find,
indeed, in various writings from the early days of electrical machines a
number of suggestions that the thunderstorm is an electrical phenom-
enon; but to Benjamin Franklin belongs the merit of having perceived
that a direct experiment was needed to prove what so far was only a
guess. In an article entitled ‘Opinions and conjectures concerning
the properties and effects of the electrical matter arising from experi-
ments and observations made at Philadelphia, 1749,” the following
passage occurs:

“To determine the question whether the clouds that contain light-
ning are electrified or not, | would propose an experiment to be tried
where it can be done conveniently. On the top of some high tower or
steeple place a kind of sentry-box, big enough to contain a man and
an electrical stand. From the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise
and pass, bending out of the door, and then upright 20 feet or 30 feet,
pointed very sharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept clean
and dry, a man standing on it, when such clouds are passing low,
might be electrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from
a cloud.

“If any danger to the man should be apprehended (though I think
there would be none), let him stand on the floor of his box, and now
and then bring near to the rod the loop of a wire that has one end
fastened to the leads, he holding it by a wax handle, so the sparks, if
the rod is electrified, will strike from the rod to the wire and not affect
urna.” ?

The experiment suggested by Franklin was successfully performed
in Marly (France), by D’Alibard, on May 10, 1752,° in London by Can-
ton, in Spital square, on July 20, 1752, and by Wilson, in Chelmsford,

Essex, on August 12 of the same year. Franklin himself describes
having used a kite in Philadelphia in a letter dated October 19, with-
out giving the date of his observations. But this must be supplied in
some passage which I have not been able to find, for Rosenberger
(‘“Geschichte der Physik,” Vol. IL, p. 316) mentions that it was done in
June.

Franklin’s disbelief in the dangerous character of the experiment
must have received a severe shock when he heard of the death of
G. W. Richmann, who, in the year 1753, was killed by an electric dis-
charge drawn from the clouds by means of a kite.

The thunderstorm is the most impressive effect of atmospheric elec-
tricity, though it is rivaled in beauty by the aurora, and in interest by
the many phenomena of daily occurrence which are only made percepti-
ble to us by proper instruments. In a lecture delivered before this
institution on May 18, 1860, Lord Kelvin described the delicate elec-
trical appliances constructed by him for the more accurate observation
of atmospheric electricity. The problems then for the first time clearly
stated gave a powerful and still lasting impulse to the investigation of
atmospheric electricity, and though no decisive answer can be given
to all the questions raised in that lecture, recent researches have.
brought us somewhat nearer to their solution.

Observations which may be made every day and at every place have
Shown that the earth is electrified, whatever the weather may be. In
the language of the older theories, which we can not as yet altogether
abandon, we say that the earth is covered with negative electricity, or,
in modern phraseology, we express the same idea by the statement
that we move about in an electrified field, that electric lines of force
stretch through the air from the ground, from our bodies, and from
everything which is exposed to the sky overhead. The strength of this
electric field is not at all insignificant. If we wish to produce it arti-
ficially between two parallel plates kept at a distance of 1 foot, we
-snould have to apply an electromotive force sufficient—and sometimes
more than sufficient—to light up the incandescent lamps which illu-
minate our dwellings. The electric force is comparatively weak in our
country, but 50 volts per foot are constantly observed, and 100 volts
are not uncommon; but in drier climates the amount of the force may
be considerably in excess of these figures.

Tf we fix our minds on the lines of force starting from the surface of
the earth, we are at once led to ask, Where is their other end? Do
they curve round and back again to earth? Do they end in the dust
which everywhere surrounds us, or do they reach up to the clouds?
Do they pass through the clouds and end where invisible particles
separate the sunset red from the midday blue? Or, finally, do they
leave the earth altogether, and form intangible bonds between us and
the sun, the stars, the infinity of space? These are not idle questions,
and we can not be said to have solved our problem unless some definite
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 93

answer is given to them. The last mentioned view, propounded origi-
nally by Peltier, and latterly supported by Exner, is the simplest. If
we could allow that the earth, once electrified negatively, could remain
electrified forever, the corresponding positive electrification being
outside our atmosphere altogether, the chief difficulty of atmospheric
electricity would be removed, aud the normal fall of potential at the
surface would be explained by the permanent negative electrification
of the surface.

Unfortunately this view, to be tenable, has to assume that the
atmosphere is a complete nonconductor to the normal electric stress,
and this is known not to be the case. We know of several causes
which break down the insulating properties of air. If two pith balls
are electrified and repel each other, and a match be lit in their neighbor-
hood, the pith balls come together, showing that they have lost their
charge, and consequently that the flame of the match has destroyed
the insulating power of air. It is not only the flame itself which con-
ducts, but also the gases rising from the flame.’ The following experi-
ment will prove this. In Fig. 1, Plate I, A represents a metallic tube
bent round at the upper end, and containing at its lower end a Bunsen
burner in metallic contact with the tube, which is also connected to an
electroscope. The tripod T, which supports the tube, is insulated by
blocks of paraffin. A Leyden jar L, on a separate support, is placed
so that the knob stands at about the level of the upper part of the
tube, which acts as chimney to the flame. The knob of the jar may be
a few inches away from the opening of the chimney, and not neces-
sarily in a line with it. The experiment succeeds, although the gases
rising from the burner may not come into contact with any part of the
jar. The jar is charged, and care must be taken that no fibers of dust
attach themselves either to the jar or chimney. I have found it con-
venient to join a piece of amalgamated zine to the end of the chimney.
Under these circumstances the charge of the jar will be found to leak
across to the tube, and the leaves of it will diverge. If, as in Exner’s
form of electroscope, the leaves, on reaching a certain divergence, dis-
charge by forming a contact with earth-connected plates C C’, the
charging and discharging can be watched for a long time. It will be
noticed that the flame, being altogether surrounded by a tube of the
same potential, cannot be active in this case, but the conductivity must
be due to the gas as it escapes from the chimney.

It follows from these experiments that every fire burnt on the surface
of the earth and every chimney through which products of combustion
pass act like very effective lightning couductors, and would conse-
quently discharge, slowly but surely, any electrification of the surface
of the earth. The peculiar immunity of factory chimneys against dam-
age by lightning appears from statistics collected by Hellmann in

1 The most complete investigation of the conduction of gases rising from flames
is contained in-a series of papers by Giese (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Vol. XVII).

Schleswig-Holstein,' for while 6.3 churches per thousand were struck,
and 8.5 windmills, the number per thousand of factory chimneys was
only 0.3.

Franklin was acquainted with the action of flames. He also discoy-
ered that no charge can be given to a red-hot iron ball, a fact which
seems to have been forgotten until rediscovered in our own times by
Guthrie. Franklin also tried the action of sunlight, but obtained no
result. Had he performed the experiment with carefully-cleaned zine,
he would have anticipated one of the most striking of Hertz’s discov-
eries. We now know that a negatively-charged surface will discharge
into air when illuminated by strong violet light, and sunlight will be
sufficient with specially sensitive materials. This action has been
investigated in detail by Elster and Geitel, who have not, however,
succeeded in obtaining results with sunlight acting on such bodies as
we know the earth’s crust to be made of. So far, then, we have no
experimental evidence to include light as an active agent in the phe-
nomenon of atmospheric electricity.

We possess in the electric discharge itself a very powerful and prob-
ably very generally active means of breaking down the insulating power
of air. Some of the experiments (Proc. Roy. Soe., Vol. XLII) which
I described some years ago to prove this were objected to on the ground
that it might not be the discharge itself, but the ultra-violet light sent
out by the luminosity of the discharge, which was active. The follow-
ing form of the experiment conclusively shows that the discharge acts
independently of light.

In Fig. 2, Plate I, R represents a Rhumkorff coil entirely surrounded
by a metallic box B, which is connected toearth. The terminals of the
coil lead to two electrodes inside a metallic tube T, which is also kept
at zero potential. This tube is arranged so that a current of air can
be blown through it. The air, on escaping through the tube, is made
either to impinge on or to pass near a metallic plate connected to a
charged electroscope. Under these circumstances the electroscope is
not discharged either by a current of air alone or by the coil alone;
but as soon as the air is blown through the apparatus while the sparks
are passing and then made to impinge on the plate C, the electroscope
is instantaneously discharged. ‘The experiment succeeds when a plug
of cotton-wool is inserted at W to stop the action of the dust; but a
plug of cotton-wool at the other end diminishes the action so much that
J am doubtful whether the effect then really exists there. I am, so far,
not inclined to believe that the action is due to dust, but rather that
the cotton-wool acts in increasing very considerably the interval which
elapses between the time at which the spark acts and the time at which
the sparked air passes out of the tube. The effect may be observed

even though the tube L is lengthened by an addition of another piece
3 feet or 4 feet long.

Several phenomena, one of which had been known for a long time,
can be explained by the fact. that the electric discharge changes the
condition of the gas into a state similar to that of gases rising from
flames. It is mentioned, for instance, by Faraday that electric sparks
are liable to succeed each other along the same path, and it is known that
the same holds for lightning flashes, facts which themselves point to a
higher conductivity of air along the path of the previous discharge. A
curious instance of a similar effect is afforded by lightning conductors,
which are sometimes put up to protect overhead leads used for con-
veying a high tension current. Owing to the obvious impossibility
of connecting the leads directly to earth, a small air gap is inter-
posed, the idea being that the air gap will act as an insulator for the
current the leads are intended to carry, but that if during a thunder-
storm the potential rises sufficiently high to be dangerous, equalization
may take place through the air gap to earth by means of a small spark.
So far the air gap answers its purpose, but as soon as a spark passes
through the gap it destroys the insulating power of the air, and the
main current consequently takes a short cut through the gap. At
Pontresina, in the Engadine, lightning conductors put up in this way
are so sensitive that a flash of lightning several miles away causes a
small spark by induction, and instantaneously puts out every electric
lamp in the town.

If we accept the view that an electric discharge destroys the insulat-
ing power of the gas, it follows that the outer regions of the atmosphere
must conduct, for we have ample reason to suppose that electric cur-
rents are passing continuously through those regions. The aurora
borealis in the arctic regions is, according to Nordenskiéld’s observa-
tions, a permanent phenomenon, and the diurnal changes of terrestrial
magnetism show that in our latitudes electric currents traverse the air
above us. However small a conductivity we may assign to the atmos-
phere, the earth could not remain electrified inside such a shell of par-
tially conducting gases. Lord Kelvin drew the same conclusion in the
Royal Institution lecture, on the assumption that gases at much reduced
pressures cease to insulate. We may leave it an open question whether
the normal electric stress could in itself cause a discharge in the outer
regions; but we can not deny that under existing conditions these
regions do not insulate, and Lord Kelvin’s argument still holds good.

But the question of the ending of the lines of force—in other words,
the location of the positive charge corresponding to the negative elec-
trification of the surface of the earth—can only be solved by balloon
or kite experiment, and we may briefly mention the more important
results which have so far been obtained.

Observations made up to heights of about 1,000 feet seem to indicate
a strengthening of the electric field, i. e., the fall of potential per meter
96 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.

is greater at a height of, say, 200 meters than on the surface of the
earth. The observations of Dr. Leonhard Weber (Elektrotechnische
Zeitschrift, April, 1888) bring out this point clearly. In one ease the
fall of potential at a height of 350 meters was found to be six times
that at the earth’s level. This increase is in itself not surprising, if
we remember that every particle of dust raised from the ground must
itself be negatively electrified, and probably the observed increase in
the electric force is sufficiently accounted for by the presence of elec-
trified dust.

Observations made at greater heights in balloons, on the other hand,
seem clearly to indicate that this increase soon ceases, and that a
diminution already takes place at moderate heights. Thus the obser-
vations of Dr. O. Baschin (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, September,
1894) gave for the fall of potential in volts per meter the numbers 49,
28,13 at heights of 760, 2,400, 2,800 meters respectively, and at a Reietn
of 3, 000 meters no mnenstma bls fall at all could be obtained. These
Been ations were made in clear weather. The balloon afterwards
passed over a layer of clouds, and strong electric effects were noticed.
Similar observations had been previously made by others (Andrée, Le
Cadet, and Bornstein), and though the subject is by no means exhausted,
we may take it as provisionally established that the lines of force of the
normal electric field of the earth end within the first 10,000 feet or
15,000 feet. This result is of great importance, for it shows that in fine
weather there must be a layer of positively electrified air permanently
above us. Currents of air in this layer must affect the field as we
observe it, and possibly the daily period may be due to changes in the
currents of air at a moderate height. A fact discovered by Exner is of
importance in connection with this subject. Observing at three differ-
ent places (in a field close to Vienna; in St. Gilgen, on the Wolfgangsee,
and on the hills near Venice), he found that whenever there was a
strong south wind, with aclear sky, the normal electric force was always
increased, and sometimes considerably (Wiener Akad. Sitzungsberichte,
Vol. XCVI, 1887).

The aehiey changes show, with few exceptions, a remarkable paienns
at different places. Mhere are in general two maxima of potential—
one at 8 or 9 o’clock in the morning, and one in the evening. The
evening maximum is the most marked, while at some places, and espe-
cially near towns, the morning maximum disappears. The same gen-
eral features of the daily variation have been found to hold at a number
of European stations, at Cape Horn, Melbourne, and in the Northern
Arctic regions. If the variation is separated into two—one having a
period of twenty-four hours and the other of twelve hours—the latter
is found to agree in phase at widely different places on the earth’s sur-
face, while the former is found to vary to a much greater extent, and
hence to be probably more affected by local circumstances. The
remarkable researches of Hann have given a similar result for the
me —

diurnal variations of the barometer, and we may reasonably conclude
that the semidiurnal variation of atmospheric electricity is connected
with the same circulation in the upper regions of the atmosphere which
shows itself in the corresponding changes of pressure.

In addition to the more regular periodic changes, the electric stress
observed in fine weather shows marked differences on different days
and at different seasons. With respect to these, the researches of Prof.
Franz Exner (ibid.) have led to the important result that there is a
close connection, direct or indirect, between the amount of aqueous
vapor present in the atmosphere and the fall of potential observed at
the surface of the earth. If py) be the pressure of aqueous vapor pres-
ent in centimeters, Exner deduces the equation for electric force P

Rie AS
Sl + kpy
where A = 1300, k = 13.1.

The formula agrees very well with observations in which the vapor
pressure varied between 0.23 and 0.95, and it is especially to be
remarked that it is the amount of vapor and not the humidity which
determines the electric force. Observations made by Mr. E. Drory
during a journey round the world fit in very well with Exner’s formula,
and observations made at such widely different places as Suez, Albany,
Sydney, Colombo, and Penang showed a fall of potential practically
identical with that calculated from the above formula, though the same
constants were taken and the vapor pressure varied between 0.8 em.
and 2.2 cm.

Messrs. Julius Elster and Hans Geitel (Wiener Akad. Sitzungs-
berichte, Vol. CI, 1892) have followed up this research. Their investi-

gations have shown a satisfactory agreement with Exner’s formula, if

the mean values of a number of observations in which the vapor pres-
sure iS approximately the same are considered. But individual num-
bers differ very widely from the mean, so that the formula can not be
used to predict the normal fall of potential on any particular day.
There is, perhaps, nothing surprising in the great divergence of such
individual results if it is considered that we only observe the moisture
near the surface of the earth, but are ignorant of the total amount of
water in the column of air over the district in which the observations
are carried out. The same authors have shown that an equally good
agreement can be obtained if, instead of the amount of aqueous vapor,
we take the intensity of active radiation as the determining circum-
stance. The hight might be supposed to act on the general surface of
the earth, as it does according to Hallwachs’ observations on a metallic
body, dissipating a regular charge. There are some difficulties in the
way of this explanation, the most serious being the absence of experi-
mental evidence that sunlight actually does act in the manner indicated
on any substance forming part of the earth’s surface. It is impossible
at the present time to enter more fully into this subject, but attention

must be drawn to the very important indirect result, that there seems
*o be a connection between ultra-violet radiations and the amount of
aqueous vapor present in the air.

The phenomena of atmospheric electricity have been studied at the
mountain observatory established on the “Sonnblick,” in Salzburg, at
a height of 3,100 meters.

The important result has been established that the electric force is
singularly constant. The great differences observed at low level
between the electric field in summer and winter, or on dry and wet
days, seems to be completely absent, and these facts tend to support
the conclusion derived from balloon observation, that the positive ends
of the lines of force are situated at a height of something like 10,000
feet.

Brief allusion must be made to some of the causes which alter to a
marked extent the normal fall of potential. As the surface of the
earth is negatively electrified, it follows that dust carried up by the
wind must be electrified, and it is found, indeed, that in violent dust
storms the laws of force near the surfaces are altogether distorted and
reversed in direction. Werner Siemens (Pogg. Ann., CIX, 1860;
Metecrologische Zeitschrift, 1890, p. 252) could, while standing on the
top of one of the pyramids during a strong wind, charge an improvised
Leyden jar sufficiently to obtain strong sparks. A casual observation
of Elster and Geitel (Ziele und Methoden, p. 11) may prove significant.
On March 7, 1889, the temperature in Wolfenbiittel was rising from —10°
C. to + 2° C., a cirrus layer covering the sky. The fall of potential
changed in the course of four hours from 1,302 volts per meter to —1,200
volts—that is, from a very exceptionally high fall to an equally strong
gradient in the other direction. Although the atmospheric circum-
stances were anomalous, they seem in themselves not sufficient to
account for the anomalous electrical effects, and the authors suggest
that a possible explanation may be found in a violent dust storm which
on the previous day was observed in Alexandria. :

Fogs are generally found to increase the normal fall considerably, so
that the drops of water must be taken as positively electrified.

Waterfalls considerably disturb the electric condition of the air in
their neighborhood, the air surrounding the fall being charged nega-
tively, sometimes to considerable distances.

Whether clouds in themselves are always electrified is very doubtful;
they no doubt disturb and generally weaken the fall of potential at the
earth’s surface, but this may only be due to a displacement of a posi-
tively-electrified layer which balloon observations have shown to exist
at a height of from 10,000 feet to 20,000 feet. While a cloud discharges
rain, the electrical effects in the neighborhood of the place are the |
same as that in the neighborhood of a waterfall. The explanation is
probably the same in the two cases, and by means of experiments,
alluded to farther on, we may reproduce the negative electrification of
air under similar circumstances.
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 99

Measurements of the electrification of falling rain or snow, simple as
they appear at first sight, are beset with very serious difficulty. We
owe the most complete investigation on the point to Messrs. Hister and
Geitel (Wiener Sitzungsberichte, Vol. XCIX, 1890). They find no
regularity in the electrification, though positive signs slightly prepon-
derate with snow and negative signs with rain.

The approach of a thunderstorm announces itself by characteristic
cumuli clouds, and the general atmospheric condition favorable to their
formation is felt by many persons of nervous temperament. Many of
us are accustomed to hear that ‘there is thunder in the air.” What-
ever the special feeling of “thunder” may be due to, it can not be an
electrical effect, for electrical instruments delicate enough to detect a
small fraction of the normal force, give no indications of the approach
of a thunderstorm, and it is only when the cloud has begun to dis-
charge rain or hail that strong electrical effects are noticed. During
the thunderstorm the electroscope is, of course, much disturbed, and
there are frequent and violent reversals of its indications.!. The fact
that no effects are observed at the surface of the earth during the
approach of a thundercloud does not prove that there is no electrical
separation, for we may imagine two oppositely electric layers at different
levels producing a strong electric field between them, but only weak
effects outside. That some such things may possibly occur is indicated
by observations made in mountain districts, where violent electrical
disturbances are observed previous to the formation of clouds (‘Trabert,
Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, p. 342). The cumulus cloud, from
which the lightning strikes out, is nearly always associated with a
cirrus layer above it, and the flash occurs more frequently upward or
sideward between the clouds than down to earth. Under such cir-
cumstances it is clear that instruments on the surface of the earth can
only very partially indicate the nature and distribution of electrical
stress in the neighborhood of the cloud.

Thunderstorms seem always to be connected with a vortex motion,
and meteorologists distinguish two kinds of thunderstorms. The first
kind forms in the outlying portions of a large cyclonic system. The
storms which occur in winter are mostly of this nature, and the vortex
necessary for its formation is of the nature of a secondary disturbance.
The thunderstorm which forms in summer, on the other hand, makes
its own vortex, and is of a much more local character than that which
is produced round a previously established barometric depression. The
-summer storm is much influenced by the character of a district. There
are certain configurations apparently favorable to its formation, as is
clearly brought out by the charts which have been made representing
their frequency.

The route traveled over by the storm is affected by mountain ridges,
and rivers also seem to offer a peculiar impediment. Many of them

Ziele und Methoden luftelektrischer Untersuchungen,” Wolfenbiittel, 1891. é

are brought to an end either along their whole front, or only part of
it, when they reach the banks of a large river.!

Some curious problems are presented by the detailed structure of
lightning flashes. Although these lie outside the range of the present
lecture, reference must be made to the very beautiful photographs of
lightning flashes taken both in this country and abroad. The ordinary
forms which lightning takes are familiar to all, but a good deal of
mystery still surrounds the so-called globular lightning. The manner
in which this form appears is best described in the words of eye-
witnesses.

Dr. A. Wartmann gives to the Physical Society of Geneva the fol-
lowing account of what he saw:?

‘At half-past 6 o’clock in the evening I drove from Versoix to Gen-
thoud. On the Malagny road I heard the coachman say he did not
know where he was. His eyes were so much fatigued by the frequent
and intense lightning discharges that he was blinded and could not,
even in the intervals, see the road, in spite of the good lanterns along-
side. I stepped on to the box and took the reins. We had barely
passed the principal gate of the grounds of Dr. Marcet when I became
conscious of a bright and lasting luminosity behind me. Thinking it
was a fire, I turned round, and saw, at a distance of, roughly, 300 meters,
a ball of fire of about 40cm. diameter. It traveled in our direction with
a velocity about equal to that of a bird of prey, and left no luminous
trail behind. Just as the ball had overtaken us, about 24 meters to our
right, it burst with a terrific noise, and it seemed to me as if lines of
fire started from it. We felt a violent shaking, and remained blinded
a few seconds. As soon as I regained power of distinguishing objects
I saw that the horses had turned at a right angle to the carriage, with
their chests in the hedge, with drooping ears and all signs of great ter-
ror. I returned on the following day to the place where I had seen the
ball explode, but could find no sign of any damage. At a distance of
100 meters I found that a group of three trees, bordering a wood, had
their upper branches singed, but it is not possible to say whether this
was due to the discharge which I had seen.”

The following is a translation of an account given by Mr. H. W. Roth
(Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, p. 231):

‘During the thunderstorm of May 19, 1888, at about 6 p. m., a flash
of lightning took effect which seems to me remarkable from a physio-
logical point of view. The dealer Werner, from Ellerbruch, and his son
(16 years old), with a one-horse conveyance containing rags, were on
the road which leads from here to the village of Ottensen, about 3 miles
away in a southwesterly direction. The father had been left a little
behind, and the son was occupied in giving bread to the horses, when
he found himself suddenly surrounded by light, and noticed a fiery ball,
about the size of his fist, moving toward him along the back of the
horse. Then he lost consciousness. He felt no concussion. The father,
on approaching, saw the horse’s limbs still contracting, and at first he
thought his son was dead, but succeeded, after considerable efforts, in
bringing him back to life in about three-quarters of an hour. The horse
was dead.”

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 101

Some curious statistics have been collected, especially in Germany,
as to the damage done by lightning flashes. That damage seems to
have increased to an enormous extent within the last fifty years, and
although in cases of this kind statistics may easily be at fault, there
seems no doubt about the reality of the fact, which may find an expla-
nation in the partial cutting down of forests in those parts where
thunderstorms chiefly occur. When lightning strikes into forests, it
selects certain trees by preference. Thus, in the principality of Lippe,
taking the percentage of beeches struck by lightning as unity, that
for other trees is as follows: Oak, 48; spruce fir, 5; Scotch fir, 33.

The St. Elmo’s fire, a continuous discharge from points and sharp
angles, is often observed on board ship and in mountain districts during
a storm. Its appearance was considered a sign of the approaching end
of the lightning, and was looked upon with favor by the ancient sailors
in the Mediterranean Sea, who gave to it the name of Castor and
Pollux. There was another appearance called Helena, a bad omen,
which by many is believed to have been another form of the St. Elmo’s
fire, and the present name has been stated to be a corruption of the
word Helena. Some support is given to this view by the fact that the
Emperor Constantine built a castle in the Pyrenees, which he named
after his mother, Helena, and this castle seems to be referred to ocea-
sionally as St. Elne or St. Elme. But it is much more probable, as
argued by Dr. F. Piper (Pogg. Ann., Vol. LX XXII, p. 317), that the
word is derived from St. Erasmo, a bishop who came from Antiochia,
and suffered a martyr’s death at the beginning of the fourth century.
He seems to have been specially considered the patron of Italian sailors.
Churches and castles in Naples and Malta were called St. Erasmo and
St. Ermo, and Ariosto describes St. Elmo’s fires as St. Ermo’s fires.
The electric discharge which goes under this name has a different
appearance according as it is the positive or negative electricity which
escapes, and both kinds occur with about equal frequency.

Although we have not yet arrived at any satisfactory theory of
atmospheric electricity, some progress has been made, and this account
would not be complete without a short account of the views taken by
men of science on the subject. The number of theories proposed is
very considerable. Dr. Suchsland,' in a pamphlet published in 1886,
gives an account of twenty-four, to which he adds one—his own. The
year 1884 alone has given birth to four theories.

We may group the theories according to the origin they assign to
the source of energy which is involved in the formation of the electric
field. All the work we can perform is either derived from the sun or
from the earth’s rotation. There is, as far as I know, only one theory—
that of Edlund—which makes the earth’s rotation in space responsible
for the separation of electricities in the atmosphere. But Edlund’s
views are not tenable in theory, and, even granting his deductions, the

normal fall of potential should, according to the views of the author,
have a different sign in the polar and equatorial regions, which is con-
trary to the observed fact. This theory does not, however, exhaust
the possibility of explaining atmospheric electricity as a phenomenon
of electromagnetic induction, and it is not disproved that in some form
or other the rotation of the earth’s magnetic field may play a part in
the origin of the electric field. The theories which take solar radiation
as the source of the energy divide themselves into several groups.
We may think of a direct thermoelectric or actinic action, but there
is, So far, no experimental support to such views. One of the earliest
and most natural suppositions is the belief. in evaporation as a source
of electrification. This was Volta’s theory, and experiments have at
various times been produced in its support; but so far no one has been
able to invalidate Faraday’s conclusion that whenever electrification
seemed to appear aS a consequence of evaporation, it was really due
to secondary causes, such as the friction of the liquid spray against
the sides of the containing vessel. Rejecting Volta’s theory, there is
nothing left but the belief in some form of contact or frictional elec-
tricity either between drops of water and air or water and ice, or any
two of the various bodies present in the atmosphere. The possibility
of contact electricity between a solid or liquid and a gas is not quite
easy to submit to the test of experiment. If we rub two solid bodies
together, we may, by separating them, investigate the electric field
produced; but, supposing we have a drop of water surrounded on all
sides by air, the water may be covered with an electric layer of, say,
positive electricity, the air in contact with the water with the opposite
kind, and it is not at all clear how we could experimentally demonstrate
the difference of potential between the air and the drop which is thus
produced. A current of air flowing past the drop might carry away
some of the negative layer, and in this way an electric field may be
established while clouds are forming, but the conditions necessary for
an experimental demonstration would be very difficult to realize. Two
methods have been devised which practically demonstrate some form
of contact electricity between gases and water.

Lenard, wishing to imitate the electric field observed in the neigh-
borhood of waterfalls, has established by careful experiment a number
of important facts, which are all consistent with the following explana-
tion. If we imagine two oppositely electrified layers at the surface of
a drop of water such as has been referred to, and if the drop falls on to
a layer of the same liquid, or if similar drops impinge on each other,
the difference of potential produced by the fusion of the surface layers
becomes greater than is consistent with equilibrium. For, taking the
case of drops falling into a mass of water contained in a cylindrical
vessel, the extent of surface between air and water is not increased
by the falling drops, and we must imagine that surface to be already
covered with a sufficient electrical sheet to establish the required dif-
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 103

ference of potential. The electrification of the drops is, therefore, not
wanted, and a change in the distribution takes place. The natural
supposition would be that this equilibrium would be restored very
quickly through the surface of the water, but a certain time seems to
be required for this. Meanwhile, the strong current of air which in
Lenard’s experiments is brought down with the water drops carry some
of the electricity away, the water remaining positive. More recent
experiments of Lord Kelvin’s, with air bubbling through water, point
similarly to contact forces between gases and liquids, and in these
experiments also it appears that a considerable time is required to
establish electric equilibrium between a gas and a solid. Lenard finds
very important differences caused by small impurities in the water, the
water acting much more strongly when it is pure. If it contains as
much salt as is contained in the sea, the effect is reversed, and the air
becomes positively electrified. The explanation which is given above
is practically that of Lenard, whose observations have been confirmed
and further extended by Prof. J. J. Thomson. These experiments, no
doubt, account for the behavior of air in the neighborhood of water-
falls, and they probably also explain the negative electrification of air
in the neighborhood of districts in which rain is falling. The strong
positive electrification of mist may also be due to the same cause.

There seems to be no doubt that the formation of a cloud is often
accompanied by electrical effects. A few years ago, descending from
the Dent Blanche, I found myself, after sunset, at a height of about
12,000 feet. A current of air was apparently blowing up the valley
which stretches from Evolena toward Ferpecle, and I could observe a
cloud condensing below me at a height a little below the snow line.
As night came on and we continued our descent over the glacier and
down the valley, a series of electric discharges were noticed between
the cloud, which was lying in a deep-cut valley, the sides of the moun-
tain, and the blue sky overhead. Here the moist air was evidently
streaming through the cloud, depositing its moisture in the form of
drops, and it seemed the most natural explanation at the time that the
air left the cloud in an electrified state.

But while by means of experiments we have been able to produce
some of the phenomena of atmospheric electricity, we have other
important effects which can not be accounted for in so simple a way.
The electric discharges during a thunderstorm give evidence of electric
fields which could hardly be explained by contact electricity between
drops of water and air alone. The fact that thunderstorms are nearly
always connected with the formation of hail, and Faraday’s experi-
ments showing that water rubbing against ice becomes negatively elec-
trified, is made use of in the theories of Sohnke and Luvini. It is quite
likely that there is some truth in these theories. Their weak point lies
in the difficulty of seeing how particles of ice and water can be first
sufficiently mixed to allow of friction, and then become sufficiently
104 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.

separated to produce an electric field of such magnitude as we know
must exist in a thundercloud.

It is to be remarked, however, that the laws of contact electricity
must be applicable to gases as well as to solids, and that if water
becomes positive when rubbing against air, and negative when rubbing
against ice, there must be a strong contact difference between ice and
air. In other words, it does not matter whether there is direct friction
between ice and water, or whether the air forms an intermediate body.
We may imagine air rising through a cloud containing drops of water
negatively electrified, and then passing through an ice cloud having
its negative electricity increased, thus leaving the ice and water par-
ticles at a difference of potential which may, by a fusion of the drops,
increase sufficiently to produce a lightning discharge. This seems to
me the most plausible theory which, in the present state of our knowl-
edge, can be formed. As regards the permanent negative charge of
the earth’s surface, the time has not yet arrived for forming a definite
opinion. Although we know that the earth, once electrified, would
gradually lose its charge into the atmosphere, yet we can express no
opinion as to the rate at which the loss is.going on. That loss may
be exceedingly slow, and consequently equilibrium might be attained
by a very small preponderance of negative electricity brought back to
its surface through some cause or other. Rain, as has already been
mentioned, is more frequently electrified negatively than positively in
our own climate, and though we do not know how far this holds in the
tropical belt, it is at any rate possible that the surface of the earth may
in this way alone make up for the loss. We may also reasonably think
that Lenard’s observation on salt water may account for the permanent
charge. Every wave that breaks into spray under the action of a
strong wind would leave the water negatively electrified, the air carry-
ing away the positive charge. It would be of great interest to possess
observations on atmospheric electricity on board ship while waves are
breaking in the neighborhood. So far we have only Exner’s observa-
tions to guide us, who found, while observing at Lavinia, in Ceylon,
that the spray from breaking waves affected the indications of the
electrometer, proving its positive electrification (Wiener Akad. Sit-
zungsberichte, Vol. XCVIII).

But although the loss of electricity from the earth’s surface may be
very slow, it is equally possible that it is considerable. We shall not
be able to treat this question satisfactorily until we have some clearer
notion of the causes of the aurora. We know that the aurora implies
electric currents, and the circuit of these currents may lie completely
within the earth’s atmosphere, and have nothing to do with the observed
fall of potential near the ground. It is also possible that the body of
the earth forms part of the electric circuit, and if that is the case,
there must be across different parts of the surface an outward and
inward flow of positive electricity. Such a discharge could not fail to
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 105

influence the phenomena we have discussed, and it seems probable that
we should have some evidence derived from observation if the aurora
was always accompanied by discharges through the earth’s surface.
Except in the polar regions, these aurore do not seem to affect the
normal fall of potential. There is a third view we may take as to the
circulation of electric currents indicated by the aurora—the return cur-
rent may take place in space outside the earth’s atmosphere. A good
deal might be said in favor of this view, and the rotation of the earth’s
magnetic field in space might be a sufficient cause for the production
of these currents; but this is not the place to enter further into this
question.

Calculations made from observation on the height of the aurora have
generally resulted in an altitude of from 100 to 200 miles, except in the
polar regions, where the aurora seems occasionally to desvend to a
much lower level. It has also been noticed that auror are associated
with certain bands of cirrus clouds, and this seems to indicate that
although the luminous phenomena is sufficiently intense to be observed
at only great heights, yet the electric phenomena may descend to the
level of the cirrus.

As regards the connection between the aurora and the sun-spot
period, further observations in the polar regions are needed. On the
one hand, we have Paulsen’s! statement, derived from observations in
Greenland, to the effect that the greatest number of aurore are seen
when sun spots are at their minimum—that is, at a time when in our
own latitudes the number is smallest; and, on the other hand, we have
Nordenskiéld’s observations, which seem to point in the opposite direc-
tion. In a publication which contains much important matter on the
geographical distribution and form of the aurora borealis, Nordenskiéld
contrasts the appearances he has observed in the Vega during the
winter of 1878-79, passed in the Bering Straits, with that previously
observed in 1872-75 to the north of Spitzbergen. According to this
author, the aurore, during the minimum sun-spot period in 1878-79,
were ‘“‘hardly worthy of his notice by the side of those observed in
1872-73.” But although only faintly luminous, the aurore of 1879 were
persistent and regular in shape. They did not affect the magnetic field,
and seemed to show a regular and continuous, though weak, electric
discharge. The are and streamers in 1872 were much more brilliant
and much more irregular. Some objection may be raised against these
observations, in so far as they refer to different places, and local cir-
cumstances may have affected the phenomenon; but, in the face of the
very careful description he gives us, we can not as yet accept Paulsen’s
results without further confirmation.

The problem of atmospheric electricity, like that of terrestrial mag-
netism, presents special features in the arctic regions, and until we

possess a greater number of observations in those little accessible parts
of the earth’s surface, many important problems can not be satisfac-
torily solved. Arctic and antarctic expeditions are of interest to scien-
tific men, not because they care much whether we get a few miles
nearer the pole, but because a well-conducted party collects invaluable
information on its journey. Although much remains to be done in the
regions surrounding the north magnetic pole, our knowledge in the
southern hemisphere is almost disgracefully inadequate, and it is to be
hoped that before long a well-equipped expedition may fill up to a cer-
tain extent the large gaps in our electrical. and magnetical knowledge
which at present stop so many of our researches.

But although investigations to be conducted in the arctic regions are
of primary importance, we may do much nearer home in extending and
completing existing information. Instrumental appliances and meth-
ods of observation, originally put into a satisfactory state by Lord
Kelvin, have been improved, especially by Maseart, Exner, Elster, and
Geite]. One of our most crying wants at present is a series of contin-
uous observations by means of self-registering instruments in places
where the neighborhood of a town or other local circumstances do not
interfere with the normal changes. The Greenwich Observatory, to
which we look for help in such matters, is placed in the difficulty that
the daily variations there observed are markedly different from those
in the majority of places, and it is ‘probable that the nearness of Lon-
don is fatal to any generally useful series of observations of atmospheric
electricity being conducted in our national observatory.
THE GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS|!

By Errrick W. CREAK.

If necessity be the surest prompter of invention, it is not too much
to say that the necessity of the navigator has been a most potent factor
in producing the observer of the elements of terrestrial magnetism.
The traveler on land might rest during darkness until daylight enabled
him to resume his journey; but the seaman on the trackless ocean was
dependent upon the indications of his compass by day and night; and
after the discovery of Columbus that the magnetic declination or varia-
tion of the needle from the direction of the geographical north varied
in amount with the latitude and longitude, a new impetus was given
to observation.

The publication of Gilbert’s grand discovery that the earth is a
magnet and the director of the freely suspended needle, followed by the
discovery of the secular change in the value of the declination, natur-
ally added to the desire of both landsmen and seamen to know as
much as possible concerning that great magnet, both from purely
scientific reasons and to meet the practical ends of the navigator.
Thus the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were remarkable for
the number of observers both of the magnetic dip and declination.

So important had a correct knowledge of the declination become to
the requirements of navigation, as early as the close of the seventeenth
century, that Halley, under the immediate auspices of the Government,
made his celebrated voyage over the Atlantic Ocean in a man-ot-war,
in order that intelligent observation should set at rest much that was
doubtful. The results of this voyage, combined with the observations
of previous navigators, were embodied in his celebrated chart of lines of
equal value of magnetic variation or declination, the first of its kind
and of so convenient a form that charts of equal values of the three
magnetic elements are to this day the most acceptable form for repre-
senting the combined results of magnetic observations made over large
areas of sea and land, as well as of the special magnetic surveys which
in recent years have been made in various countries.

108 GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Here we may pause to consider the word declination as applied to the
angle which the direction of the horizontal magnetic needle makes with
the true meridian. Many magneticians object to the word, but no bet-
ter has yet been proposed, or at any rate accepted; the result being that
while observers on land use the term, seamen adhere firmly to the expres-
sion ‘‘variation of the compass.” This is as might be expected, when
itis remembered that navigators look upon the word declination as con-
nected with the position of the sun and other heavenly bodies, and
would find it most inconvenient to have the same word in daily use,
meaning two totally different things.

During the eighteenth century charts of the magnetic declination
were published by Mountaine and Dodson, Bellin, and Churchman, and
for their time may be considered as fair approximations to the truth.
Churchman’s design was not only to give values of the declination but
to furnish the seaman with a means of ascertaining the longitude—an
ambitious project, especially as we now know there were probably con-
siderable elements of error in these charts, caused by local magnetic
disturbance of the observing compass on land, and from the iron used
in construction disturbing the compass on board the ships. :

This latter source of error was only beginning to be viewed in its
true light at the close of the eighteenth century.

In the years 1801-1802 Commander Flinders of H. M.S. Investigator,
then surveying the southern coasts of Australia, found that when his
vessel’s head was north or south by compass the observed declination
agreed very nearly, but when she lay with her head east or west, it dif-
fered largely. Moreover these errors on the east and west points of the
compass had the opposite sign to those observed in England.

Flinders, however, had supplemented the existing scanty knowledge
of the distribution of the dip over navigable waters by several observa-
tions of his own in northern and southern latitudes, and from these he
drew the conclusion that the errors in the declination observed on board
ship were caused by magnetism induced by the earth in the vertical
iron of the ship, and changed in value proportionally to change of dip.
Here Flinders was wrong, as the errors were really proportional to the
tangent of the dip.

In spite of this mistake he was enabled, from his knowledge of the
dip, to conceive the idea of so placing vertical bars of iron that they
produced an equal and opposite effect on the compass to that of the
ship in all latitudes, and thus invented what is now called the Flinders
bar, one of the most important correctors of compass disturbance in
the iron and steel ships of the present day.

In 1814 Flinders induced the Admiralty to have experiments made
on board men-of-war at Portsmouth, Sheerness, and Devonport, to
ascertain the amount of the magnetic disturbance of the compass
caused by the iron in each ship. The chief reason for making these
experiments was to show the necessity for ascertaining and applying
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 109

these errors to insure the safe navigation of the ships, but it had also a
direct bearing in enabling observers to eliminate the hitherto inexpli-
cable divergencies in the values of the declination observed in different
ships in the same geographical position. The results of these experi-
ments bore no immediate fruit, for with the death of Flinders the sub-
ject was temporarily neglected.

In 1819, Hansteen published his Magnetismus der Erde with an atlas
containing charts of the elements declination and dip for different
epochs between the years 1600 and 1787. These charts were in a large
measure compiled from observations made with imperfect instruments
and subject to the causes of error already mentioned attending both
land and sea results. Hansteen, however, considered them of sufficient
value to enable him to draw certain important conclusions with regard
to the cause of the secular change of the magnetic elements. Thus, he
not only concurred with Halley that the earth, considered as a magnet,
had four poles or points of attraction, but computed their geographical
positions. Further than this, he computed that to account for the
secular change these four supposed poles revolved round the terres-
trial poles, each pole occupying a widely different number of years to
complete the revolution.

If these theoretical results had been true, a great advance would
have been made not only in the science of terrestrial magnetism but
in its practical bearing on the requirements of the present day.

Although Humboldt had about the year 1800 shown that the intensity
of the earth’s magnetism varied with the latitude, the general distribu-
tion of that magnetic element was so little known that we may witl
our present extended knowledge consider that Hansteen’s conclusions
were based on insufficient data. In fact the idea of the earth being a
magnet with four poles has long since been abandoned in favor of there
being one pole with two foci of intensity in each hemisphere, and
reasons will be given further on which tend to throw doubt on there
being any revolution of these two magnetic poles round their adjacent
terrestrial poles.

Subsequently to Hansteen’s charts there appeared those of the
declination by Yeates, Duperrey, and by Barlow in 1836. These were
useful to navigation, but helped very little toward the solution of the
problem of the ever variable distribution of the earth’s magnetism.

Besides this, by the year 1835 the iron-built ship had appeared on the
ocean, and a correct knowledge of the three magnetic elements became
a necessity in solving the problems which the magnetism of different
iron ships presented.

With Gauss’s invention of the absolute horizontal force magneto-
meter in 1833, many hitherto unknown movements of the magnetic
needle of the highest interest were discovered, which with the coarser
instruments previously in use lay concealed. This discovery gave the
desired impetus to the scientific men of that epoch, and the period
110 GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

included in the years 1835-1845 was ‘a time of unparalleled activity
in the extension of systematic and accurate magnetical observations
over the earth’s surface.”

Whilst most of the continental nations joined in this movement, the
principal share in the work was divided between Germany, Russia,
and England in Europe, and the United States in America. But
before the splendid series of simultaneous observations made on the
continent, and four British colonial observatories were organized,
Gauss in 1839 published his general theory of terrestrial magnetism
coupled with a series of charts of the three magnetic elements for the
whole world, based upon observations made at ninety-two selected
stations distributed over the earth’s surface; and it may be remarked
that Gauss’s charts not only gave results in fair accordance with
observation in explored regions, but also as afterwards proved in
Antarctic latitudes hitherto unvisited by man.

The proof came in the years 1839-1843, when Koss’s Antarctic
voyage of exploration was carried out in the interests of terrestrial
magnetism. Besides the importance of a knowledge of the general
distribution of the magnetic elements in those regions, one great aim
of this expedition was to reach the south magnetic pole. This was
found to be impossible, but sufficient data were collected to give its
approximate position. Whilst this Antarctic magnetic survey was
being completed, that of British North America was also undertaken,
' with the result of the determination of the locality of one of the foci of
greatest intensity in the northern hemisphere.

The results of these surveys formed, as will be well remembered, a
valuable series of ‘‘contributions” to terrestrial magnetism by Sabine,
and, coupled with every available observation between the years 1818
to 1876, formed the materials for the series of charts entitled ‘“ The
Magnetic Survey of the Globe” for the epoch 1842-1845. Hach map
gave normal lines of equal values of the declination, inclination, and
intensity. Although it may be said that from the Arctic circle to the
Antarctic the direction of the lines was efficiently given by observa-
tion, the lines within those circles were largely taken from Gauss’s
computed lines modified to agree with observation.

Another difficulty in compiling these charts of Sabine’s with accuracy
lay in the uncertain knowledge of the secular change then available,
and which had to be applied to observations made so far apartin time.

Sabine’s charts are doubtless the best we have for the epoch 1842-1845,
but in the light of the requirements of modern science they leave much
to be desired as regards the Antarctic regions. Theobservations south
of 60° south were made entirely on board ships, where the errors of
the compass sometimes exceeded 50°, due to the horizontal forces in
the ship, thus rendering accurate observations of the declination very
uncertain and correction of the observed inclination very difficult;
besides which there are no records of the ship’s disturbing force in the
vertical direction.
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 1a oi!

Naval requirements, however, did not permit of any delay in pub-
lishing magnetic charts affecting navigation, for in 1846 the hydrog-
rapher of the Admiralty requested Sabine to provide charts of the
declination for the Atlantic Ocean from 60° north to 60° south. These
were largely used until Evans’s chart of the declination for the whole
navigable world was issued in 1858.

The excellent work of Flinders already referred to, of ascertaining
from his knowledge of terrestrial magnetism the chief cause of the
deviation of the compass in wood-built ships, and providing a corrector
for those deviations, had to be followed up on a much larger scale and
with more exact methods in the iron-built ship, which, in that period
of activity in terrestrial magnetic science—1835-1845—was rapidly
increasing in numbers on the ocean.

Thus in 1835 observations were made on board iron ships showing
that they acted as a magnet on their compasses, but there was nothing
to show in the results what the causes of this condition of the iron ship
were, until Poisson in 1838 published his celebrated ‘‘Memoir on the
deviations of the compass produced by the iron in a ship.” This was
a rigorous mathematical investigation of the subject, showing that the
deviations of the compass were due to induction in the ship by the
magnetic force of the earth.

If the iron ship had simply been built for service in one locality, a
limited knowledge of terrestrial magnetism would have sufficed te eluci-
date the causes of her magnetic condition; but she was destined to
traverse every navigable sea over large changes of magnetic latitude,
hence the necessity for an accurate knowledge of the distribution of
magnetism over the great parent magnet, in order to determine the
magnetic condition of her comparatively minute offspring the magnet-
ized iron ship; and this at all times and in all places in the interests
of navigation. Observations of the terrestrial magnetic elements were
therefore an absolute necessity if iron-built ships were to be substi-
tuted for those of wood.

The ability to predict the deviation of the compass on change of lati-
tude did not, however, satisfy Airy, for after a remarkable mathemati-
cal investigation of iron ship’s magnetism of a less rigorous character
than Poisson’s, but sufficiently accurate for his purpose, he in 1839 pro-
posed his methods of annulling the deviation of a ship’s compass by
means of magnets and soft iron, so arranged as to produce equal and
opposite magnetic effects to that of the ship. Provided with Airy’s
admirable and simple directions this method of correction was com-
paratively easy in one latitude, but experience at sea, especially in
voyages to the Cape of Good Hope, showed that every iron ship required
a different application of Airy’s correctors.

To discriminate between the amount that was to be corrected by per-
manent magnets, by horizontal soft iron, and by vertical soft iron, an
accurate knowledge of the magnetic elements dip and intensity obtained
from observations on land and at sea was essential.
nn? GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Before dismissing the subject of the above application of magnetic
observations, it may be remarked that we have now heavily armed
protected steel cruisers steaming over all parts of the world with less
change of deviation of the compass than the wood-built Hrebus and
Terror of Ross’s Antarctic expedition, and this remarkable result could
not have been achieved if the terrestrial magnetic observer had not
done his work.

Moreover, if magnetic observations are not continued, the secular
change of the magnetic elements will soon commence to mar the pre-
cision with which our rapidly-moving ships traverse the globe.

The voyage of the Challenger in 1872-1876 contributed the most
valuable series of observations of the magnetic elements in modern
times, when the large areas of the principal oceans traversed by that
vessel during three and a half years are taken into consideration.
These observations, combined with those taken from every available
source, both British aud foreign, between the years 1865-1887, formed
the materials from which the magnetic charts of 1880 were compiled
(see Vol. 11, Physics and Chemistry, part 6, voyage of H. M.S. Challenger).

The Challenger only crossed the Antarctic circle at one point in lon-
gitude 78° east, and, therefore, although we know large secular changes
to be going on south of 40° south, we have no measure of the amount,
nor anything like an accurate knowledge of distribution of the earth’s
magnetism in those regions. This points to the necessity for a new
Antarctic expedition.

In the year 1888 the late Prof. J. ©. Adams was provided with a
complete set of magnetic charts for the two epochs 1842-1845 and 1880
previously mentioned, and as it was known he had directed his pro-
found mathematical ability to the analysis of the results contained in
them, it was hoped that some new and important light might be thrown
upon the bare facts presented. His lamented death occurred without
his publishing any results.

If, however, reference be made to the report on the magnetical
results of the Challenger, a discussion of the secular change 1s con-
tributed, founded in a great measure on a comparison of those charts.
The outcome of this discussion is to throw considerable doubt upon
the theory that the motion of the magnetic poles round the terrestrial
is the cause of secular change; in fact, that the magnetic poles remain
fast, and we must look elsewhere for the cause, whatever it may be.

Magnetic observations have so far been considered in their all-
important bearing as necessary to safe navigation in wood-built ships,
and in a far higher sense as indispensable to that of the iron or steel-
built ships which now cover the ocean, the magnetic charts hitherto
generally required for these purposes being those on which normal
lines of equal values have been given; but something more is now
needed.

Observution in comparatively recent years has shown that not only

|
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. eke

are there large “regional” magnetic disturbances extending over large
areas of land, but that in moderate depths of water where the largest
ship can navigate freely, the land below is also found to have consider-
able areas of local magnetic disturbance which, if not allowed for,
may in thick or foggy weather lead ships into danger by seriously
disturbing their compasses. :

The United States has done excellent work in producing charts of
isomagnetic lines, or charts in which the chief local magnetic disturb-
ances are recognized, and the full results of observation recorded.
The magnetic surveys of Riicker and Thorpe in the British Isles, of
Moureau in France, of Rijckevorsel in Holland and elsewhere, have
thrown considerable light on the magnetic conditions of those countries,
but there remain whole continents to be covered by the observer.

The direction of the isomagnetics, too, from the deep sea to the dry
land of the coasts is an extension of the subject which the observer
has hardly touched as yet, but one affecting the safety of navigation,
as well as the question that has been raised, whether the water areas
of the globe are, as a whole, more or less magnetized than the land
areas. ;

To possess charts of isomagnetic lines for even a few countries is an
evidence of considerable advance in the knowledge of terrestrial mag-
netism, for if reference be made to Sabine’s lines of intensity in his
contribution on the magnetic survey of Northwest America it will be
found that he rejected certain observations he considered abnormal and
defective, which Lefroy, the observer, considered to be his best and
naturally retained in his map; the result being a considerable difference
in the form of the curves adopted by the two magneticians, Sabine giy-
ing normal curves, Lefroy isomagnetics.

Respecting the local disturbances of the needle which have been so
clearly proved, the question naturally arises, Whence the cause of these
disturbances? It is now believed by many, if not finally accepted, that
Riicker and Thorpe have answered the question by the results of their
laborious survey of the British Isles, coupied with Riicker’s elegant
investigations as to the permeability of specimens of the rocks taken
from the localities in which magnetic disturbances were found. Their
answer is to the effect that these disturbances, which have been found
to extend over a region 230 miles long by about 110 miles broad, are
due to induction by the earth’s magnetism in rocks of different per-
meability, either present as in the basalts on the surface or concealed
by superficial deposits.

These results are distinct from the extraordinary disturbances of the
needle when in the immediate vicinity of permanently magnetized
rocks, and when the radius of disturbance may be only as many feet
as the extent of the regional disturbance is in miles.

The points of interest in the question of regional magnetic disturb-
ance are not confined to the magnetician, for the geologist can not

afford to neglect the valuable information the magnetic needle affords.
Thus although Riicker and Thorpe have since made a second and more
elaborate survey of the British Isles, their remark of 1890 that “the
kingdom can be divided into magnetic districts in which the relations
between the direction of the disturbing forces and the main geological
characteristics are so suggestive as to be worthy of careful statement
and further investigation,” not only holds good, but has received
confirmation.

The mining engineer is deeply interested in a knowledge of the
declination. Charts of normal lines are of great use to him whether
above or below the earth’s surface, but especially below when he has
no other guide. To such an one a knowledge of regional magnetic
disturbance as deduced from surface observations is most important,
as it tells him that he is in the neighborhood of magnetic rocks, the
disturbing effect of which on his compass needle may be far greater
in the depths of his mine and turning it into a treacherous guide.

We have now considered magnetic observations in a measure from
the point of view of the immediate practical results which their scien-
tific treatment produces, but who will say in this great maritime nation
that the work of magnetic observers, even if solely to make navigation
possible, is not worthy of the fullest consideration?

There is besides a vast field of inquiry for the observer of terrestrial
magnetism in unraveling the secrets of the earth considered as a mag-
net, and the ceaseless change of its magnetic condition which the
needle tells us of, for which no immediate practical result can be fore-
seen, yet is worthy of the attention of the ablest physicists and most
advanced mathematicians.

Inquiry into the causes of the secular change is one requiring the
fullest attention, but observation has not yet done sufficient work.
It certainly has done much in certain countries, and for a large portion
of the world as regards secular change in the past, and data obtained
for predicting future changes for a few years, but only one expedition
has examined the Antarctic regions magnetically, and it is doubtful if
any substantial progress will be made until a second expedition is
made thither, one profiting by the experience of its precursor, and
equipped with possibilities for work hardly hoped for by Ross.

It may be remarked in passing that a remarkable alteration in the
amount of the secular change has been noticed in the declination and
inclination at the following observatories: Bombay, Batavia, and Hong
Kong about the period of the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. This may
be only a coincidence, but may it not also point to the possibility that
the changes below the surface of the earth which culminated in that
mighty explosion, and may still be at work, have had, and continue to
have, magnetic effects which are recorded by the needles at those
observatories ?

Critical investigations have for many years been directed to the elu-
cidation of the causes of the observed diurnal variations of terrestrial
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 115

magnetism. This work was long seriously retarded by the various
methods adopted at different observatories for recording their results,
obliging those who entered upon a comparison of such results to go
through a tedious conversion of them into a common method. It may
be said that the first large departure from this objectionable practice
occurred when the international polar inquiry of 1882-1883 was under-
taken by the various expeditions.

This was an important step in the right direction, but there remains
much to be done, as shown by the ten reports of the British Associa-
tion Committee on “the best means of comparing and reducing mag:
netic observations.” Their last report consists of an able and suggest-
ive paper by Dr. Chree, being the analysis of the results of five years’
observations on “quiet days” at Kew, and is well worthy of attention
as indicative of the present state of our knowledge as regards the diur-
nal variation of the three magnetic elements.

Such investigations only encourage one in the hope that the much
required observations in southern latitudes may be undertaken. The
observatories at the Cape and Melbourne could do invaluable work if
it were carried out on the lines of Kew, for example.

Lastly, what more is there to be said about magnetic observations
and their bearings? We do not know why the earth is a magnet, the
cause of the secular change of its magnetism, why it is subject to solar
diurna!l, lunar diurnal, sidereal diurnal, and the other variations and
disturbances, nor the cause of magnetic storms, although we can observe
connections between them, earth currents, and aurorae. Whether the
causes of all these exist below the surface of, or are external to, the
earth, or are a combination of the two, has still to be learnt, and it
seems hardly too much to hope that the restless needle will sooner or
later be the means of opening up sources of knowledge invaluable to
cosmical science, as well as to those only concerned with the planet
upon which they dwell.

When the causes of the secular change are understood, there will be
no difficulty in providing the navigator with magnetic charts for years
in advance, much as the tides can now be tabulated for his use. In
the latter case observation has done its work for several frequented
ports, in the former case a vast amount remains to be done, and the
word that goes forth is still, as Lord Kelvin thrice said on a kindred
subject connected with ships’ magnetism, ‘‘ Observe.”
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.!

By Prof. W. LECONTE STEVENS.

The reviewer who aspires to give an account of recent progress in
any department of science is met at the outset by two causes for
embarrassment. What beginning shall be selected for developments
called recent? What developments shall be selected for discussion
from the mass of investigations to which his attention has been called?
So rapidly is the army of workers increasing, and so numerous are the
journals in which their work is recorded, that the effort to keep up
with even half of them is hopeless; or, to borrow a simile employed
by the late Professor Huxley, ‘‘We are in the case of Tarpeia, who
opened the gates of the Roman citadel to the Sabines, and was crushed
under the weight of the reward bestowed upon her.”

I have selected a single branch of physics, but one which can scarcely
be treated rigorously as single. From the physical standpoint optics
includes those phenomena which are presented by ether vibrations
within such narrow limits of wave length as can affect the sense of
sight. But these waves can scarcely be studied except in connection
with those of shorter and of longer period. Whatever may be the
instruments employed, the last one of the series through which infor-
mation is carried to the brain is the eye. The physicist may fall into
error by faulty use of his mathematics, but faulty use of the senses is
‘a danger at least equally frequent. Physiological opties has of late
become transferred in large measure to the domain of the psychologist,
but he in turn has adopted many of the instruments as well as the
methods of the physicist. The two can not afford to part company.
If I feel particularly friendly to the psychologist, more so than can be
accounted for by devotion to pure physics, it may be fair to plead the
influence of oid association. If [ am known at all in the scientific
world, the introduction was accomplished through the medium of physi-
ological optics. But, with the limitations imposed, it is not possible
even to do justice to all who have done good work in opties. If promi-
nence is assigned to the work of Americans, it is not necessary to

emphasize that this association is made up of Americans; but, with
full recognition of the greater spread of devotion to pure science in
Europe, of the extreme utilitarian spirit that causes the value of nearly
every piece of work in America to be measured in dollars, we are still
able to present work that has challenged the admiration of Europe,
that has brought EKuropean medals to American hands, that has been
done with absolute disregard of monetary standards; work has been
recognized, even more in HKurope than in America, as producing defi-
nite and important additions to the sum of human knowledge.

In drawing ettention to some of this work it will be a pleasant duty
to recognize also some that has been done beyond the Atlantic—to
remember that science is cosmopolitan. The starting point is neces-
sarily arbitrary, for an investigation may last many years and yet be
incomplete. To note recent progress, it may be important to recall
what is no longer recent.

LIGHT WAVES AS STANDARDS OF LENGTH.

You are therefore invited to recall the subject of an address to which
we listened in this section at the Cleveland meeting in 18388, when
Michelson presented his ‘Plea for light waves.” In this he described
the interferential comparer, an instrument developed from the refrac-
tometer of Jamin and Mascart, and discussed various problems which
seemed capable of solution by its use. In conjunction with Morley he
had already used it in an inquiry as to the relative motion of the earth
and the luminiferous ether (American Journal of Science, May, 1886,
p- 377), and these two physicists together worked out an elaborate series
of preliminary experiments (ibid., December, 1877, p. 427) with a view
to the standardizing of a metric unit of length in terms of the wave
length of sodium light. By use of a Roland diffraction grating, Bell had
determined the sodium wave length with an error estimated to be not
in excess of one part in two hundred thousand (American Journal of
Science, March, 1887, p. 167). Could this degree of accuracy be sur-
passed? If so, it must be not so much by increased care in measure-
ment as by increase of delicacy in the means employed. The principle
applied in the use of the interferential comparer is simple enough; the
mode of application can not be cleary indicated without a diagram, but
probably all physicists have seen this diagram, for it was first brought
out eight years ago (ibid., December, 1887, p. 427). By interference of
beams of light, reflected and transmitted by a plate of plane parallel
optical glass, and then reflected back by two mirrors appropriately
placed, fringes are caught in an observing telescope. One of the mir-
rors is movable in front of a micrometer screw, whose motion causes
these fringes to move across the telescopic field. If the light be abso-
lutely homogeneous, the determination consists in measurement of the
distance through which the movable mirror is pushed parallel to itself
and the counting of the number of fringes which pass a given point in
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 119

the field of view. According to the theory of interference the difference
of path between the distances from one face of the plate to the two
mirrors should be small; beyond a certain limit interference phenomena
vanish, and this limit is smaller in proportion as the light is more com-
plex. In the case of approximately homogeneous light there are peri-
odie variations of distinctness in the fringes. For example, assume
sodium light, which in the spectroscope is manifested as a pair of yellow
lines near together. In the refractometer there are two sets of inter-
ference fringes, one due to each of the two slightly different wave
lengths. When the difference of path is very small, or nearly the same
for both of these radiation systems, the fringes coincide. The wave
length for one is about one thousandth less than that for the other. If
the difference of path is about five hundred waves, the maximum of
brightness for one system falls on a minimum of brightness for the
other, and the fringes become faint. They become again bright when
the difference of path reaches a thousand wave lengths. The case is
entirely similar to the familiar production of beats by a pair of slightly
mistuned forks.

The method of interference thus furnishes through optical beats a
means of detecting radiaticn differences too minute for resolution by
ordinary spectroscopic methods. Spectrum lines are found to be double
or multiple when all other means of resolving them fail; and the diffi-
culty of attaining truly homogeneous light is far greater than was a
few years ago supposed. By the new method it becomes possible to
map out the relative intensities of the components of a multiple line,
their distance apart, and even the variations of intensity within what
has for convenience been called a single component. Each of the two
sodium lines is itself a double whose components are separated by an
interval about one-hundredth of that between the long-known main
components; and an interval yet less than one-fifth of this has been
detected between some of the components of the green line of mercury.
Indeed Michelson deems it quite possible to detect a variation of wave
length corresponding to as little as one ten-thousandth of the interval
between the two main sodium lines (Astronomy and Astrophysics, p. 100,
February 1894).

This new-found complexity of radiation, previously thought to be
approximately if not quite simple, proved to be a temporary barrier to
the accomplishment of the plan of using a light wave as a standard of
length. It necessitated careful study of all those chemical elements
which give bright lines that had been supposed to be simple. The red
line of cadmium has been found the simplest of all those yet examined.
The vapor in a rarefied state is held in a vacuum tube through which
the electric spark is passed, and under this condition the difference of
path for the interfering beams in the refractometer may be a number
of centimeters. A short intermediate standard, furnished with a mirror
at each end, is now introduced into the comparer, and moved by means
120 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

of the micrometer screw. Its length is thus measured in terms of the
cadmium wave length. A series of intermediate standards, of which
the second is double the first, the third double the second, etc., are
thus compared, and finally in this way the value of the meter is reached.

The feasibility of this ingenious method having been made apparent,
Michelson was honored with an invitation from the International Bureau
of Weights and Measures to carry out the measurement at the obser-
vatory near Paris, with the collaboration of the director, M. Benoit.
After many months of labor, results of extraordinary accuracy were
attained. For the red line of cadmium at an air temperature of 15° C.
and pressure of 760 mm., two wholly independent determinations were
made. From the first a meter was found equal to 1,553,162.7 wave
lengths; from the second, 1,553,164.3 wave lengths, giving a mean of
1,553,163.5 the deviation of each result from the mean being very nearly
one part in two millions (‘Travaux et Mémoires du Bureau Interna-
tionale des Poids et Mésures,” Tome XI, p. 84, 1894). A determination
by Benoit from the first series gave 1,553,163.6, which differs but one-
tenth of a wave length from the mean of Michelson’s measurements.

The direct comparison of the lengths of two meter bars, though not
easy, is a sunple operation in comparison with the indirect method just
described, but does not surpass it in accuracy. Everyone knows that
the meter is not ap exact submultiple of the earth’s circumference, and
that the determination of its exact value from the seconds pendulum
is full of difficulty. It may perhaps be said that the optical method is
no more absolute than the pendulum method, for no human measure-
ments can be free from error; that there is no possibility of the
destruction of the original meter and all certified copies of it; and
that there is no proof or probability that molecular changes are grad-
ually producing modifications in standards of length. Even if we
should grant that for all practical purposes the labor of determining
the meter in terms of an unchanging optical standard has been unneces-
sary, the achievement is a signal scientific triumph that ranks with the
brilliant work of Arago, Fresnel, and Regnault. In preparation for it
much new truth has been elicited, and light waves have been shown to
carry possibilities of application that Fresnel never suspected.

The physicist is nearly powerless without the aid of those who possess
the highest order of mechanical skill. The interferential comparer
could never have been utilized for such work as Michelson has done with
it, had not Brashear made its optical parts with such an approach to
perfection that no error so great as one-twentieth of a wave length
could be found upon the reflecting surfaces (‘Travaux et Mémoires
du Bureau Internationale des Poids et Mésures,” Tome XI, p. 5, 1895).
In the conception, mechanical design, and execution the entire work
has been distinctly American.

The interferential refractometer has been used with much skill by
Hallwachs (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Band 47, p. 380, and Band 53, p. 1)
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. £21

for comparing the variation of refractive index of dilute solutions with
variation of concentration. The fact of solution brings about a change
of molecular constitution, affecting both the electric conductivity and
the refractive index; and the changes in optical density are measurable
in terms of the number of interference fringes which cross the field of
view for a given variation of dilution.

LUMINESCENCE.

While all work on the visible spectrum is confessedly optical, we can
no longer make an arbitrary division point, and declare that one part
of the spectrum belongs to the domain of optics and the other not.
Since the days of Brewster and the elder Becquerel fluorescent solu-
tions have enabled us to bring within the domain of optics many wave
lengths that were previously invisible. Stokes’s explanation of this,
as a degradation of energy quite analogous to the radiation of heat
from a surface on which sunlight is shining, has been generally accepted.
But whether the phenomena of fluorescence and phosphorescence are
in general physical or chemical, has for the most part remained unknown,
or at least very uncertain. E. Wiedemann, who suggested the term
luminescence to include all such phenomena, published in 1895 (Anna-
len der Physik und Chemie, p. 604, April, 1895), in conjunction with
Schmidt, a part of the outcome of an extended investigation under-
taken with a view to clearing up these uncertainties. He has shown
that it is often possible to distinguish between cases in which the
emission of light springs from physical processes and those in which it
is due to chemical action, or at least invariably accompanied by this.
We have here, as in photography, a transformation of radiant into
chemical energy, to which is superadded the retransformation of chem-
ical into radiant energy of longer period, and this either at the same
time or long after the action of the exciting rays. Indeed, between
this process and that of photography in colors, the analogy is quite
striking. What has generally been called phosphorescence is well
known to be the effect of oxidation in the case of phosphorus itself and
in that of decaying wood or other organic matter, which under certain
conditions shines in the dark.

Wiedemann has shown that the shining of Balmain’s luminous paint,
and generally of the sulphides of the alkaline earths, is accompanied
with chemical action. A long period of luminosity after the removal
of the source renders highly probable the existence of what he now
calls chemi-luminescence. A large number of substances, both inor-
ganic and organic, have been examined both by direct action of light
and by the action of cathode rays in a controllable vacuum tube
through which sparks from a powerful electric influence machine were
passed. Careful examination with appropriate reagents before and
after exposure was sufficient to determine whether any chemical change
had been produced. Thus the neutral chlorides of sodium and potas-
12? RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

sium, after being rendered luminous by action of cathode rays, are
thereby reduced to the condition of subchloride, so as to give a distinctly
alkaline reaction.

Many substances, moreover, which manifest no luminescence at
ordinary temperatures after exposure, or which do so for only a short
time, become distinctly luminescent when warmed. This striking phe-
nomenon is sufficient to warrant the use of a special name, thermo-
luminescence. Among such substances may be named the well-known
sulphides of the alkaline earths, the haloid salts of the alkali metals,
a series of salts of the zine and alkaline earth groups, various com-
pounds with aluminium, and various kinds of glass. Some of these
after exposure give intense colors when heated, even after the lapse of
days or weeks. That the vibratory motion corresponding to the
absorption of luminous energy should maintain itself for so long a time
as a mere physical process is highly improbable if not unparalleled.
That it should become locked in, to be subsequently evoked by warm-
ing, certainly indicates the storing of chemical energy, just as the
storage battery constitutes a chemical accumulator of electrical energy.
Other indications that luminescence is as much a chemical as a physical
phenomenon are found in the fact that the sudden solution of certain
substances is accompanied by the manifestation of light, if they have
been previously subjected to luminous radiation, but not otherwise;
that alteration of color is brought about by such exposure; and that
friction or crushing may cause momentary shining in such bodies as
sugar. There is no conclusive direct evidence thus far that such
luminescence as vanishes instantly upon the withdrawal of light is
accompanied by chemical action. But Becquerel demonstrated long
ago with his phosphoroscope that there is a measurable duration of
luminous effect when to the unaided eye the disappearance seems
instantaneous (Becquerel, Comptes rendus 96-121). Wiedemann now
shows that when this duration is considerable there is generally
chemical change. Since duration is only a relative term it seems
highly probable that even cases of instantaneous luminescence, com-
monly called fluorescence, are accompanied with chemical action on a
very minute scale, and that all luminescence is therefore jointly physi-
cal and chemical in character. We have thus color evoked by the
direct action of light, which disturbs the atomic equilibrium that
existed before exposure, and the manifestation of such color continues
only until the cessation of the chemical action thus brought into play.

The influence of very low temperature upon luminescence and pho-
tographic action has been studied by Dewar (Chemical News, LXX,
p. 252, 1894). The effect of light upon a photographic plate at the
temperature of liquid air —180° C. is reduced to only a fifth of what it
is at ordinary temperature; and at —200° the reduction is still greater,
while all other kinds of chemical action cease. Jn like manner, at —80°
calcium sulphide ceases to be luminescent; but, if illuminated at this
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 123

low temperature and then warmed, it gives out light. At the tem-
perature of liquid air many substances manifest luminescence which
ordinarily seem almost incapable of it; such are gelatine, ivory, and
even pure water. <A crystal of ammonium platinocyanide, on the other
hand, when immersed in liquid air and illuminated by the electric
light, shines faintly when this is withdrawn. If now the liquid air be
poured off so that the crystal rises rapidly in temperature, it glows
brightly.

LUMINESCENCE AND PHOTOGRAPHY.

Photography, like luminescence, is a manifestation of the transfor-
mation of energy, most frequently of initial short wave length. The
production of color by photography is nothing new. It was noticed
by Seebeck nearly a century ago that silver chloride becomes tinted
by exposure to ordinary light, with accompanying chemical change;
that if then subjected a long time to red light it assumes a dull red
hue, or a dull bluish hue if held in blue light. It is likewise possible
by proper selection of luminescent salts to produce a selected series of
tints during and after exposure to those rays which are most effective
in photography. But such colors can not be made fixed and perma-
nent. The problem of securing on the photographic plate a faithful
and lasting reproduction of the various tints of a spectrum thrown
upon it has baffled most of those who grappled with this subject.
That it has been fully and quite satisfactorily solved can not yet be
affirmed, but the last few years have brought a far nearer approach to
success than an equal number of decades previously. Viewed from
the scientific standpoint the goal has certainly been touched, even if
commercial demands are still made in vain.

STATIONARY LIGHT WAVES.

Two quite different methods are to be considered in tracing the recent
development of this interesting application of optical principles. The
first is originally due to Becquerel (Am. de Chimie et de Physique (3),
p- 451, 1848), but lately, in the hands of Lippmann, it has been improved
and brought much nearer to success than by its originator. It depends
upon the production of stationary waves of light. Every one is famil-
lar with the formation of stationary waves upon an elastic stretched
cord, and with the acoustic exhibition of stationary air waves in a closed
tube by Kundt’s method of light powders. That similar loops and nodes
must be produced under proper conditions by interference of waves of
light would appear obviously possible; and so long ago as 1868 Dr.
Zenker (“‘ Lehrbuch der Photochromie,” Berlin, 1868) of Berlinexplained
the photographic reproduction of. color, so far as it had then been
accomplished, by reference to stationary light waves. But no definite
proof of their production has been brought ferward. <A few years ago
124 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Hertz demonstrated objectively the electromagnetic waves whose exist-
ence had been foretold by Maxwell’s genius; and with suitable appa-
ratus stationary electric waves are now almost as readily made evident
as are those of sound. Hertz’s brilliant success stimulated his fellow
countryman, Otto Wiener, to undertake the apparently hopeless task
of producing and studying stationary light waves. Wiener’s admirable
work (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Band XL, 1890, p.203) excited great inter-
est on the continent of Europe, but it has been singularly neglected in
England and America. It is worth much more than a passing notice.

Assume a plane silvered mirror upon which a bundle of rays of mono-
chromatic light fall normally so as to be reflected back upon its own
path. The superposition of reflected and direct waves causes a system
of stationary waves, but under ordinary conditions these are wholly
imperceptible. The nodes are formed upon a series of planes obviously
parallel to the reflecting plane at successive distances of a half wave
length. If now we consider a plane oblique to the mirror, it will cut
these successive nodal planes in parallel lines, whose distance apart
will be greater in proportion as the oblique plane approaches parallel-
ism to the mirror. Although a half wave length of violet light is only
one five-thousandth of a millimeter, it is easy to conceive of the cutting
plane forming so small an angle with the mirror that the distance
between the parallel nodal lines shall be a thousand times a half wave
length. Such would be the case if the inclination of the cutting plane
is reduced to a little less than four minutes of are. The nodal lines
would be one-fifth of a millimeter apart, and readily capable of resolu-
tion if their presence can be manifested at all. Imagine a very thin
transparent photographic film to be stretched along the oblique cutting
plane, and developed after exposure to violet light as nearly mono-
chromatic as possible. Then the developed negative should present a
succession of parallel clear and dark lines, corresponding to nodal and
antinodal bands along the oblique plane, the photographic effect being
annihilated along an opteal nodal line.

The realization of a photographic film thin enough for such an
experiment is quite conceivable when we remember that under the
hammer gold is beaten into leaves so delicate that 8,000 of them would
be required to make a pile 1 millimeter thick. By electrochemical
deposit, Outerbridge (Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. CITI,
p- 284, 1877) has made films of gold whose thickness is only one-hun-
dred-thousandth of a millimeter, or one-sixtieth of a wave length of
sodium light. Wiener obtained a perfectly transparent silver chloride
film of collodion, whose thickness was about one-thirtieth of a wave
length of sodium light. This was formed on a plate of glass and
inclined at a very small angle to a plane silvered mirror which served
as reflector. From an electric are lamp the light was sent through an
appropriate slit and prism, so that a selected spectral band of violet
fell normally on the prepared plate in the dark room. The developed
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 125

negative presented the alternate bands, in perfectly regular order, more
than a half millimeter apart. Various tests were applied to guard
against error in interpretation, and the existence of such stationary
waves was proved beyond all doubt.

These waves, moreover, when polarized light was employed, furnished
the means of determining the direction of vibration with relation to the
plane in which the light is most copiously reflected when incident at
the polarizing angle, and thus of subjecting to experiment the question
as to whether the plane of vibration is coincident with this plane of
polarization or is perpendicular to it. The former of these views was
held by Neumann and MacCullagh, the latter by Fresnel. Let a beam
of polarized light fall upon the mirror at an angle of about 45°. If the
vibrations in the incident beam are parallel to the mirror, and hence
perpendicular to the plane of polarization, those of the reflected and
incident beams will be parallel to each other, and hence capable of inter-
ference. Butif the vibrations of the incident beams are in a plane ident-
ical with that of incidence, and hence in the plane of polarization, the
vibrations of incident and reflected beams are in mutually perpendic-
ular planes, and hence can not interfere. Wiener obtained interfer-
ence fringes when the light was polarized in the plane of incidence, while
the polarized in the plane perpendicular to this gave no trace of inter-
ference. The theory of Fresnel was thus confirmed experimentally.
Again, the familiar phenomenon of Newton’s rings shows us that on
changing media there is a change of phase of the incident light, else
the central spot where the two surfaces come into optical contact would
be white instead of black. But there has been difference of opinion
as to whether this change of phase occurs at the upper surface of the
air film, where the light passes from glass to less dense air, or at the
lower surface, where it passes from air to more dense glass. In the
latter event, there should be a node at the reflecting surface. Replac-
ing the silvered plane surface by a lens in contact with the photo-
graphic film, Wiener obtained circular fringes with no photographic
action, at the center, showing the nodal point to be at the point of
contact, and thus again confirming the theory of Fresnel.

COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

The conditions being now specified under which stationary light
waves are produced, let us imagine common instead of monochromatic
light to be transmitted normally through a transparent sensitive film.
Then a variety of stationary interference planes are produced. This
is the underlying principle of the process employed by Lippmann in
Paris, who, in 1892 (Comptes rendus, Tome CXIV, p. 961, and Tome
CXV, p. 575), succeeded in obtaining a photograph of the solar spec-
trum in naturalcolors. Upon a surface backed with a reflecting mirror

long and short period. After exposure and development the natural
colors are manifested with brilliancy. Apart from the fundamental
principle already expressed, it can scarcely be said that the rationale
of the process has yet been very fully and clearly explained. Lipp-
mann recognizes the stationary wave systems, with maxima and minima
of brightness in the film and corresponding maxima and minima of
silver deposit. If the incident light is homogeneous, a series of equi-
distant parallel planes of equal photographie efficiency are produced in
the film. If the plate after development is illuminated with white
light, then to every point within the film there comes from below a cer-
taih amount of reflected energy which is a continuous periodic function
of the distance from the reflecting surface. The total reflected light of
any color becomes then represented by the integral of this periodic
function for the entire thickness of the layer. The solution of this
integral brings the result that the intensity of the refieeted light
decreases with increasing thickness of the layer, approaching zero as
a limit, so long as this light is of different wave length from the homo-
geneous light employed for illumination of the plate. Only light of
the same wave length, or of an entire multiple of this, maintains a
finite value. A similar consideration applies to each of the hues com-
posing white light. By such mathematical considerations, Lippmann
(Journal de Physique, p. 97, 1894) reaches the conclusion that the light
reflected from the plate must have exactly the same relations of wave
length as that with which the plate was illuminated.

For the Lippmann photographs, which at first required a very long
exposure, and could even then be satisfactorily viewed at only a single
definite angle, it is now claimed that an exposure of only a few seconds
is needed, and that the colors are visible at all angles of incidence so
long as the plate is moist (Journal de Physique, p.84, 1894). But, like
the daguerreotypes of fifty years ago, they are incapable of multiplica-
tion, and, great as is the scientific interest connected with them, it
seems scarcely probable that they can long continue to hold an impor-
tant place practically. The problem of ascertaining definitely the cause
of the return of a color the same as that which falls upon a given sur-
face may seem to be solved mathematically, but the mastery of the
physical conditions required to produce a single colored negative, from
which may be had any desired number of positives with varied hues
accurately reproduced, is still in the future. From the very nature of
stationary light waves it does not appear probable that the Becquerel
method as improved by Lippmann will give the means of multiplying
copies of a single picture. Wiener has lately published an elaborate
research upon this subject (O. Wiener, Wiedemann’s Annalen, pp. 225-
281, June, 1895), in which he recognizes the necessity for the employ-
ment not of interference colors but rather of what he calls body colors
(K6érperfarben) due to chemical modification of the reflecting surface.

obtained a rose-colored form of silver photochloride which ‘in the violet
of the spectrum assumed a pure violet color, in the blue it acquired
a slate blue, in green and yellow a bleaching influence was shown, in
the red it remained unchanged.” But in the absence of any means
of fixing these colors. a promising prospect brings disappointment.

While it is abundantly possible that colored illumination upon suit-
able color-receptive materials can give rise to similar body colors, we
are still far from having these materials under control. There seems
at present to be greater promise in another and quite different applica-
tion of optical principles. The suggestion appears to have been first
named by Maxwell (Royal Institution lecture, May 17, 1861) in 1861
that photography in colors would be possible if sensitizing substances
were discovered, each sensitive to only a single primary color.

Three negatives might be obtained, one in each color; and three
complementary positives from these, when superposed and carefully
adjusted, would present a combination that includes all the colors of
nature. In 1873 H. W. Vogel in Berlin discovered that silver bromide,
by treatment with certain aniline dyes, notably eosine and cyanine
blue, can be made sensitive to waves of much longer period than those
hitherto effective in photography. In 1885 he proposed to sensitize
plates for each of a number of successive regions in the spectrum, and
to make aS many complementary pigment prints as negatives, which
should then be superimposed. This somewhat complicated plan proved
difficult in practice. In 1888 IF. EK. Ives (Journal of the Franklin Insti-
tute, January, 1889), of Philadelphia, adopting the more simple Helm-
holtz-Maxweil modification of Young’s theory of color, applied it to the
preparation of suitable compound color screens which were carefully
adjusted to secure correspondence with Maxwell’s intensity curves for
the primary colors. The result was a good reproduction of the solar
spectrum. But to reproduce the compound hues of nature it is neces-
sary specially to recognize the fact that although the spectrum is made
up of an infinite number of successive hues, the three color sensations
in the eye are most powerfully excited by combinations rather than by
simple spectral hues. Thus, according to Maxwell’s curves, the sensa-
tion of red is excited more strongly by the orange rays than by the
brightest red rays, but the green sensation is excited at the same time.
This fact has to be applied in the preparation of the negatives, while
images or prints from these must be made with colors that represent
only the primary color sensations. Properly selected color screens
must, therefore, be used for transmission of light to plates sensitized
with suitable aniline dyes, and the adjustment of ratios with this end
in view is not easy; but it has been successfully accomplished. From
three negatives thus made, each in its proper tint, positives are secured ;
and these are projected, each through its appropriate color screen, to
the same area upon a white screen. The addition of lights thus sent
from the triple lantern gives the original tints with great fidelity.
128 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Mr. Ives has devised a special form of camera by which the three
elementary negatives are taken simultaneously, and also an instrument,
the photochromoscope, in which a system of mirrors and Jenses brings
to the eye a combination similar to that projected with the triple lan-
tern. A double instrument of this kind forms the most perfect type
of stereoscope, bringing out with great vividness from the prepared
stereographs the combined effect of color, form, and binocular perspec- —
tive. It is only within the past year that these improvements have
been perfected. By further application of the same principles, Mr.
Ives has produced permanent colored prints on glass, which do not
require to be examined by the aid of any instrument. Each of these
negatives is made with a colored screen which transmits tints comple-
mentary to those which it is desired to reproduce. The three gelatine
films are soaked in aniline dyes of suitable tint and superimposed
between plates of glass. When viewed as a transparency, such a print
gives a faithful reproduction of the natural colors.

The problem of color reproduction is thus solved, not indeed so sim-
ply, but more effectively, than by the method of interference of light,
or by those body-color methods that have thus far been applied. To
the imaginative enthusiasts who are fond of repeating the once novel
information that “ electricity is still in its infancy,” it may be a source
of equal delight to believe that photography in colors, a yet more deli-
cate infant, is soon to take the place of that photography in light and
shade with which most of us have had to content ourselves thus far;
but so long as an instrument is needed to help in viewing chromograms,
the popular appreciation of these will be limited. We may take alesson
from the history of the stereoscope. Yet it is gratifying to recognize
the great impetus that this beautiful art has received during the last
few years. We may quite reasonably expect that the best is yet to
come, and that it will have an important place among the future appli-
cations of optical science.

THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.

Among the splendid optical discoveries of this century, probably the
most prominent are photography and spectrum analysis, each belonging
jointly to optics and chemistry. Photography was at first supposed to
be concerned only with the most refrangible rays of the spectrum, but
Abney and Rowland have photographed considerably below the visible
red. Beyond the range thus attained qualitative knowledge was
secured by Herschel, Becquerel, Draper, Melloni, Miiller, Tyndall, La-
mansky,and Mouton. But our quantitative knowledge of this region
began with the invention and use of the bolometer by Langley
(“Selective absorption of solar energy,” Am. Journal of Science, March,
1883, p. 169), whose solar energy curve has been familiar to all physicists
during the last dozen years. During this interval the bolometer has
been used with signal success by An gstrém, Rubens, Snow, and
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. : 129

Paschen, who have made improvements not only in the instrument itself
but in the delicacy of its necessary accompaninent, the galvanometer.
The work of Snow (Physical Review, Vol. I, pp. 28 and 95), particu-
larly, on the infra-red spectra of the voltaic are and of the alkalies, and
that done by him in conjunction with Rubens (Astronomy and Astro-
physics, March, 1893, p. 231), on refraction through rock salt, sylvite,
and fluorite, exhibited the capacities of the bolometer even better per-
haps than Langley’s previous work on the sun. But more recently
with the collaboration of several able assistants, and more particularly
the great ingenuity and mechanical skill of Wadsworth, the sensitive-
ness of Langley’s galvanometer has been so exalted, and the bolometer
connected in such manner with photographic apparatus as to make it
an automatically controlled system, by which an hour’s work now brings
results superior in both quantity and quality to what formerly required
many weeks or even months (Langley, ‘‘On recent researches in the
infra-red spectrum;” Report of Oxford meeting of British Association,
1894). Not only is an entire solar energy curve now easily obtained in
a single day, but even a succession of them. It becomes thus possible
by comparison to eliminate the effect of temporary disturbing condi-
tions, and to combine results in such a way as to represent the infra-
red cold bands almost as accurately as the absorption lines of the visi-
ble spectrum are indicated by use of the diffraction grating. It will
undoubtedly become possible to determine in large measure to what
extent these bands are due to atmospheric absorption, and which of
them are produced by absorption outside of the earth’s atmosphere.

With the diffraction grating, supplemented by the radiomicrometer,
Percival Lewis (Astrophysical Journal, June, 1895, p. 1, and August,
1895, p. 106), has recently investigated the infra-red spectra of sodium,
lithium, thallium, strontium, calcium, and silver, attaining results which
accord weil with the best previously attained by those who had
employed the bolometer, and which demonstrate the exceeding delicacy
of the radiomicrometer as an instrument of research.

THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM.

To follow out ail the applications of the spectroscope that have
resulted in recent additions to our knowiedge would carry us far
beyond the scope of a single paper. It is possible only to make brief
mention of a few.

For a number of years Rowland (ibid., January to August 1895) hais
been investigating the spectra of all the chemical elements, photo-
graphing them in connection with the normal solar spectrum, and
reducing them to his table of standards, which is now accepted every-
where. The work is of such magnitude that years more must elapse
before its completion. It now includes all wave lengths from 5,722 to
7,200, and of these the list already published extends as far as wave
lengths 5,150, or from ultra violet nearly to the middie of the green.

130 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Through the spectroscope chiefly has been established during the
present year the discovery of the new atmospheric element, argon, by
Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay (Proc. Royal Society, January
31, 1895)'; its remarkable property of green fluorescence when the
electric spark is passed through it in presence of benzine, by Berthelot
and Deslandres (Comptes rendus, June 24, 1895); and its association
in meteoric iron and various minerals with helium, now proved to be a
terrestrial as well as solar element, by Ramsay (Nature, April 4, May
16, July 4-and 25, 1895), Crookes, Lockyer, and others.

With the diffraction spectroscope Rydberg (Wiedemann’s Annalen,
1893--1894) and Kayser and Runge (ibid., 1888-1895) have discovered
interesting relations among the spectral lines of a large number of
terrestrial elements, arranging them into series whose distribution
manifests chemical relationship quite analogous to that indicated in
Meudelejeff’s periodic law.

By photographing the spectrum of Saturn’s rings and noting the
relative displacement of the different parts of a spectral line, Keeler
(Astrophysical Journal, May 1895, p. 416) has obtained a beautiful
direct proof of the meteoric constitution of these rings, a confirmation
of the hypothesis put forth by Maxwell in 1859, that the outer portion
of the rings must revolve more slowly than the inner portion, and yet
not satisfy the conditions of fluidity. His work has been repeated
and confirmed by Campbell (ibid., August 1895, p. 127) at the Lick
Observatory.

The spectroheliograph devised by Hale (Astronomy and Astrophys-
ics, March, 1893, p. 256) has enabled him to photograph, on any bright
day, not only the solar photosphere and spots, but also the chromo-
sphere and protuberances. He has made some remarkable attempts
with this instrument to photograph the corona without an eclipse,
unsuccessfully thus far, but not without promise of future success.

POLARIZED LIGHT.

In the domain of polarized light, there have been several noteworthy
recent researches. Nichols and Snow (Philosophical Magazine (5),
Vol. XX XIII, p. 379) have shown that calcite, though readily trans-
parent for the brighter rays of the spectrum, rapidly diminishes in
power of transmission for waves of short period, so that for the extreme
violet this power is scarcely half so great as for the yellow. The
transmissive power of this crystal for the infra-red rays, between the
wave-length limits of 1 micron and 5.5 microns, has been investigated
with the bolometer by Merritt (Physical Review, May-June 1895, p.
494), who reaches the interesting result that the transmission curve for

the ordinary ray is wholly independeut of that for the extraordinary,
the absorption being in general much greater for the former. Several
sharp absorption bands are found for each ray. For radiations whose
wave-length exceeds 3.2 microns, the absorption of the ordinary ray is
almost complete, so that calcite behaves for such radiation just as
tourmaline does for the rays of the visible spectrum. The independ-
ence of the two transmission curves is found to exist also for quartz
and tourmaline, these curves for the latter crossing each other twice
in the infra-red region.

The application of polarized light to the investigation of internal
Stress in transparent media was made more than forty years ago by
Wertheim (Comptes rendus, 32, p. 289, 1851), who demonstrated that
the retardation of the rays is proportional to the load. An extended
series of such experiments has been lately made in America by Marston
(Physical Review, September, October, p. 127, 1893), who, besides con-
firming Wertheim’s conclusion, shows that, ‘‘for small strains at least,
the colors seen in a strained glass body, when polarized light is passed
through it in a direction parallel to one of the axes of strain, are
measured by the algebraic difference of the intensities of those two
principal strains whose directions are perpendicular to the direction of
the polarized light.”

A new substance with double rotatory power, like quartz, has been
discovered by Wyrouboff (Journal de Physique (3), 3, 452, 1894), the
neutral anhydrous tartrate of rubidium, which is unique in one respect.
The rotatory power of the substance in the crystalline state becomes
reversed in solution. This wholly new phenomenon introduces some
perplexity in connection with certain molecular theories that have been
formulated to account for double rotatory power.

Crehore (Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers, October, 1894, p. 91) has ingeniously applied Faraday’s principle
of electro-magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization in carbon
bisulphide to the photographing of alternate current curves. Every
variation in the magnetic field causes variation in the amount of light
transmitted through a pair of crossed Nicol prisms. The combination
becomes a chronograph with an index as free from inertia as the beam
reflected from a galvanometer mirror. The same instrument has been
applied to measurement of the velocity of projectiles (Journal of the
United States Artillery, p. 409, July, 1895), with results of exceeding
interest to the student of gunnery.

PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS.

The temptation to dilate upon recent progress in physiological optics
has to be resisted. The revision of Helmholtz’s great book on this
subject was interrupted by the death of the distinguished author, but
the last part is now approaching completion under the care of his
pupil, Arthur Konig, who, in conjunction with Diederici, has done
ia RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

much important work in this domain. The selection of hues for the
three primary color sensations has been slightly modified. Young
selected the two extremes of the spectrum, red and violet, together
with green, which is about midway between them. The hues now
accepted by Helmholtz and those who follow his lead, including the
great majority of physicists, are a highly saturated carmine red, an
equally saturated ultramarine blue, and a yellowish green, correspond-
ing somewhat to that of vegetation. The red and blue agree with
those previously determined by Hering, but the rivalry between the
two schools on the subject of color sensation continues, and perhaps
will last through a period commensurate with the difficulty of devising
crucial experiments.

Independent theories of color sensation have been brought out by
Mrs. Franklin (Christine Ladd Franklin, ‘‘Kine neue Theorie der
Lichtempfundungen,” Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie und Physiologie der
Sinnesorgane, 1892), in America, and by Ebbinghaus (‘‘Theorie des
Farbensehens,” ibid., 1893), in Germany. The former particularly is
worthy of much more extended notice than can here be given. It may
perhaps be quite properly called a chemical theory of vision. Light is
always bringing about chemical changes in external objects, and the
eye is the one organ whose exercise requires the action of light, while
such chemical action is implied in the performance of most of the
bodily functions, such as the assimilation of food and the oxidation of
the blood. The bleaching action of light upon the visual purple, which
is continually formed on the retina, has been known ever since the
discovery of this in 1877 by Kiihne, who secured evanescent retinal
photographs in the eyes of rabbits. Mrs. Franklin considers that light
sensation is the outcome of photochemical dissociation of two kinds of
retinal molecules that she denominates gray molecules and color mole-
cules, of which the latter arise from the gray molecules by differentia-
tion in such a way that the atoms of the outer layer group themselves
differently in three directions, and the corresponding action of light
of proper wave length gives rise to the three fundamental color sensa-
tions. She develops the theory with much skill, applying it particu-
larly to the phenomena of retinal fatigue and color blindness. To the
objection that there is no direct proof of the existence of the assumed
gray and color molecules, it may be answered that Helmboltz himself
fully recognized the uncertainty of the assumption that three different
sets of nerves respond to the three fundamental color sensations, and
he admitted that these may be only different activities In the same
retinal cone. ‘The supposition of three adjacent cones, responding
respectively to the three fundamental sensations, is made only for the
sake of greater convenience in discussion.

Indeed, there is still much for us to learn regarding the nature of
color sensation. Among the yet unexplained phenomena are those of
simultaneous color contrast. The fact that a small brightly colored
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. oor

area on a gray background appears surrounded by its complementary
tint is familiar enough. For its explanation it has been common to
assume that there is unconscious motion of. the observer’s eyes, incip-
ient retinal fatigue, an error of judgment, or fluctuation of judgment.
This has been tested by A. M. Mayer (American Journal of Science,
July, 1893), who ingeniously devised methods for showing these con-
trast phenomena on surfaces large enough to match the colors with
those of rotating color disks, and thus to arrive at quantitative state-
ments of their hues. When viewed through a small opening in a
revolving disk, the subjective contrast color was unmistakably percep-
tible when the duration of passage of the opening was less than one-
thousandth of a second. The same effect was obtained in a dark room
with instantaneous illumination of the colored surface by the strong
spark of an electric influence machine. The duration of illumination is
thus almost infinitesimal, certainly not more than one ten-millionth of a
second. The hypothesis of fluctuation of judgment is thus shown to be
wholly untenable. I have performed most of these experiments, either
with Professor Mayer or separately, and my testimony can therefore
be united with his. The case is quite analogous to that of the pereep-
tion of binocular relief, which was once explained as the product of a
judgment, but was found to be always possible with instantaneous
Ulumination. Professor Mayer has devised a disk photometer based
on color contrast, with which the error of a single reading was found
much less than with the Bunsen photometer.

The rotating color disk has been applied by O. N. Rood (American
Journal of Science, September, 1893) to the determination of luminosity
independently of color, by taking advantage of the flickering appear-
ance on a rotating disk upon which two parts have different reflecting
powers. An extreme case of this is that of a white sector upon a black
disk. Ata certain critical speed the retinal shock due to momentary
impression by white light becomes analyzed into the subjective impres-
sion of spectral colors, the duration of the retinal sensation varying
with the wave length of the incident light. The law of this variation
has been studied by Plateau (‘‘ Dissertation sur quelques propricétés des
impressions produits par la lumiere sur l’organe de la vue,” Liege, 1829),
Nichols (American Journal of Science, October, 1884), and more
recently with much precision by Ferry (ibid., September, 1892), who
showed that retinal persistence varies inversely as the logarithm of the
luminosity. For a given source of light separated into its spectral
components, the yellow is the brightest. For this hue accordingly the
retinal impression is shortest, and for violet it is longest.

Under appropriate conditions the after-effect on the retina has a cer-
tain pulsatory character, as first noted by C. A. Young (Philosophical
Magazine, Vol. XLIII, p. 543, 1872) in 1872, and carefully studied
within the last few years by Charpentier (‘Oscillations rétiniennes,”
Comptes rendus, Vol. CXIII, p. 147, 1891) in France, and Shelford

Bidwell (‘On the recurrent images following visual impressions,” Proc.
Royal Society, March 27, 1894) in England. A disk with properly
arranged black and white sectors, if brightly illuminated and looked at
while revolving at a moderate rate, becomes apparently colored, just as
a momentary glance at the sun causes the perception of a succession
of subjective spectral hues which may last a number of seconds. The
phenomenon in relation to the disk was known as early as 1838 (Fech-
ner, Poggendorff’s Annalen, 1838), and explained by Rood (American
Journal of Science, September, 1860) in 1860. The rediscovery of
what has been long forgotten arouses all the interest of novelty. The
‘artificial spectrum top,” devised by Benham (Nature, November 29,
1894, p. 113) last autumn, excited interest on two continents, and was
promptly copyrighted by a prominent firm of opticians (ibid., March
14, 1895, p. 463) in England. It would perhaps be equally enterprising
to copyright the solar spectrum.

The limits of a single address forbid my touching upon the large
and practically important subject of color blindness. Indeed, in both
physieal and physiological optics much has been omitted that is abun.
dantly worthy of attention. In behalf of my hearers it may be wise to
take heed, once more, of the fate of Tarpeia, who was overwhelmed
with the abundance of her reward.

INTRODUCTION.

A great chemist, J. B. Dumas, once said that living organisms are
nothing but “condensed air.” He thus expressed, in terse terms, the
result of the investigations pursued by himself and others into the
relations of the atmosphere to living beings.

My purpose, in the following pages, is to show how closely Dumas’s
statement agrees with ascertained facts, even more closely than he
himself supposed. It is also desirable to briefly instance and illustrate
the varied ways in which air influences the general life of the globe.
If the ordinary definition of the word were not an impediment to its
use in the present case, I would say that I purpose making a general
sketch of the “‘ biology” of the atmosphere. More exactly and appro-
priately I may use a quite similar term, and say that the subject-
matter of this essay is the “natural history” of the air—taking the
term in the sense given to it by Geoffroy St. Hilaire—an essay upon
the properties of air considered in its relations to living beings, upon
its composition, its contents, its origin, its varied modes of action.

While I shall especially and particularly consider air in its relations
to life, I shall also refer briefly to its relations to other subjects, point-
ing out those which it would be useful to investigate further in order
to increase the scope of our knowledge.

The study of the atmosphere is truly one of great magnitude; ‘its
relations to the remainder of the universe are so varied and impor-
tant, the subjects which it suggests are so numerous and take us through
so many fields of inquiry, that a comparison suggests itself forcibly—
just as the atmosphere surrounds our whole planet and forces itself
into the clefts and fissures between its elements and rocks to the depths
of the soil, in the same manner does the study of air pertain to all
departments of science, to geology as well as astronomy, to physics no
less than to chemistry, and to biology in the largest sense of the term

While it would be a hazardous enterprise to undertake a complete
review of so important a subject, it may prove useful to give a rapid
sketch of some features, and that I shall endeavor to do, by showing
what air is, physically and chemically considered, what is its origin,
what it contains, and of what use it is to life. Doubtless this is but

a small part of the subject, but this sketch may contribute to show
how vast and varied is that chapter of science that goes under the
name of the “study of the atmosphere.”

I.—AIR CONSIDERED FROM THE PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW.

Vast as are the proportions of the atmosphere it is none the less invis-
ible. It surrounds us on every side; we are bathed in it, and we do
not see it; when it is not in motion we do not feel it. Although having
material existence and creating material effects, for evil or for good, it
is immaterial to our senses. This fluid, this gas, may, however, be
weighed. Jean Rey' and Otto von Guericke? were the first who gave
positive proot of this, and showed that a glass receiver in which a
vacuum had been made—even imperfectly—weighed less than the same
receiver in normal and free connection with the surrounding atmos-
phere—that is, full of air—and, on the other hand, a receiver into which
air is forced and maintained under pressure weighs more than the
same receiver full of air at the normal pressure pro loco et tempore.
One liter of air, pure and dry, under the pressure of 760 millimeters,
at 0° temperature, and at the latitude of Paris, weighs 1.293 grams
(Regnault). It weighs more if the pressure is higher, less if it is
lower; and hence a liter of air has more weight at the bottom of a
shaft in a mine than at sea level, and less on top of a hill or moun-
tain. The higher the altitude at which air is weighed the less it
weighs, because it expands, the same weight of air occupying a larger
space or volume. Air is more dense at low stations, less dense in the
higher strata of the atmosphere, so that when the weight of air is men-
ticned it is always given with reference to a certain altitude, to a cer-
tain pressure, and also to acertain temperature and hygrometrie state,
because these different conditions exert a considerable infiuence upon
the matter.

As 1n the case of other gases, air is made up of molecules, and these
are considered as being in a state of perpetual motion. It has been
reckoned that the number of impacts or collisions to which each mole-
cule is subjected during each second. in the tremendous turmoil which
takes place in the air, amounts to something like 4,700,000,000! These
molecules are exceedingly small, and Sir William Thomson (Lord
Kelvin), Clerk Maxwell, and Van de Waals give their dimensions as
being less than a fraction of one-millionth of a millimeter, 1 cubic cen-
timeter of air, at 0° and 760 millimeters pressure, containing, in round
numbers, some 21,000,000,000,000,000.000 of these molecules.

I have referred to the fact that the weight of the air is not the same
in all localities. It also varies in the same locality. The sum total of

1Jean Rey, French physician and physicist, said, in 1630, that if tin is burnf in
contact with air, it increases in weight, and this increase is due to air which has
been absorbed by the metal during the combustion.

2 Otto von Guericke, born 1602, died 1686. He also demonstrated atmospheric pres-
sure by means of the instrument called the Magdeburg hemispheres—two hollow
hemispherical cups which it is very difficult to separate when a vacuum has been
created in the interior.
AIR AND LIFE. 139

the weight of the atmosphere, wherever considered, varies every day
more or less, often appreciably within the limits of a few hours and
even minutes. This could not happen, of course, if the weight of the
strata of air did not vary also. The weight of the whole atmosphere
increases or decreases because the weight of the air, considered at
any region vertically above the point where the observation is made,
increases or decreases. These variations of weight, or pressure, are
indicated by the barometer—devised in 1643 by Torricelli, pupil and
friend of Galileo—and the oscillations of that instrument are only indi-
cations of the differences of the weight or pressure of the air.

Now, as the pressure is increased at low stations, and diminished at
high ones, and, as there is a very definite and regular connection between
differences of altitude and barometrical indications, it is conceivable
that the barometer may, to some extent, and with certain limitations,
yield information as to the altitude at which an observer finds himself.
It is sufficient to mention the fact; the methods by which it is estab-
lished would require too long an exposition.

Since air is material and has a weight of its own, however varia-
ble, if must press upon all organisms. If is not difficult to estimate
with some precision the weight of the superincumbent air. Tor each
Square centimeter of our skin, the pressure exerted is exactly that
of a vertical column of mercury 1 square centimeter in section, and
of the same height as the barometrical column at that moment. If
the barometer stands at 760 inillimeters, the pressure is exactly that
of 76 cubie centimeters of mercury, and as each cubie centimeter
weighs 13.6 grams, the sum total, per square centimeter, is 1 kilo-
gram 33 grams, or about 15 pounds per square inch. Taking the skin
surface of the average adult to be something like 15 square meters
(15,000 square centimeters), the weight with which the atmosphere
presses on each of us amounts to 15,450 kilograms; but under ordi-
nary circumstances we do not feel this enormous load, because the
pressure is exerted in al] directions; from within outward as well
as from without inward, from below upward as well as from above
downward. To perceive this pressure, it must be removed from one
side, as when the hand is placed over the open end of a cylinder in
which a vacuum is being formed; then one feeis the strong pressure
pushing the hand toward the opposite end of the cylinder. Of course
the pressure exerted upon the body and all objects, is lessened as
the altitude increases, or the barometer falls; and, reciprocally, if the
barometer rises, or if the body be at a low station—in a mine for
instance—the pressure is higher. The total weight of the atmosphere,
at sea level, under normal circumstances, averages some 5,000,000,-
000,000,000,000 kilograms—that is, the millionth of the weight of our
planet itself; or, to use other terms, the weight of a continuous
Stratum of mercury 76 centimeters high, and covering the entire sur-
face of the globe, both sea and land. This is a fairly high figure for a
140 AIR AND LIFE.

substance so nearly immaterial that it escapes our vision. However,
air is not always invisible; it may be seen very clearly; it may also be
touched and handled, although no one would undertake to do so, or to
recommend the feat. Whilst it is gaseous under normal pressure and

circumstances, it may be made to assume the liquid form when subjected .

simultaneously to the influence of considerable cold and very high pres-
sure. High pressure alone is not sufficient. Undera pressure of 3,000
atmospheres, 3,000 times that of ordinary sea-level pressure, oxygen
and nitrogen remain gases (Natterer); but if at the same time the
temperature is lowered, they immediately assume the liquid condition.
MM. Cailletet and Pictet have obtained liquid air by means of pressures
of 300, 500, or 1,000 atmospheres cooperating with intense cold, with the
cold corresponding to 100° or 200° below zero (Celsius or centigrade).
Under such circumstances air may even assume the solid form; the
liquid air freezes into a solid block.!

No one could venture to touch this liquid or solid with the bare skin,
for two reasons; one being that, of course, air can be kept liquid or
solid only under the circumstances of its production, and instantly
becomes a gas under normal pressure or temperature; the other, that,
even if the transformation were not instantaneous, the intense absorp-
tion of heat (production of cold) which accompanies the passage from
the liquid or solid to the gaseous state would be more than sufficient
to kill instantly all living tissues in the vicinity.

It is enough for our present purpose to simply mention the impor-.

tance of air as an elastic fluid, and the part played by this gas in
luminous, thermic, acoustic, and electric phenomena, where it is an all-
important medium. It is also sufficient to remind the reader of the
temperature of the atmosphere and its varied movements, from the
light breeze that cools the hot summer days to the cyclones and
tornadoes which destroy buildings and tear up the strongest giants
of the forests. Lastly, the atmosphere is very far from being unlimited.
It ceases at some distance from our planet, becoming very thin and rare
even at altitudes that are not exceedingly great, such as 5,000 meters
(Mont Blane, 4,813 meters; Gaurisankar 8,840 meters), and while we
are not prepared to state the exact distance from the earth at which
all traces of air disappear, it is generally admitted that above 320 or
309 kilometers (1 kilometer=1,000 meters) height, vertically, there is
no atmosphere worth mentioning. Of course, at such altitudes, the air
must be exceedingly thin and rarefied, asit is in the exhausted receiver
of the air pump.

It is commonly said that air is tasteless and odorless. Pure air

‘The gas is first cooled down to 30° below zero, and then compressed under 200 or
300 atmospheres. It remains fluid; but if a small amount of it is then allowed to
escape, the sudden expansion—which is accompanied by a production of cold, while
compression causes heat to be evolyed—cools down the remainder of the air, the
temperature falls to 200° below zero, and the air immediately assumes the liquid con-
dition. Lower down it freezes and becomes a solid block.

AIR AND LIFE. 141

may be unable to affect the olfactory membrane; but this is not the case
with the atmosphere generally. The air that surrounds us is full of
scents and odors, but we are so accustomed to them that we take no
notice thereof. But after we have spent some time in an atmosphere
where most ordinary odors can not conveniently gain access, and then
return to our ordinary surroundings, the case is altered, and we perceive
a very powerful odor. This has been noticed by different observers
after a considerable sojourn in deep caves, such as the Mammoth Cave
in Kentucky. The air in these caves is nearly odorless, and when,
after a few hours spent in this scentless environment, the visitor
emerges again into the open, the atmosphere seems powerfully, even
violently, scented or odoriferous, and some persons may even be tempo-
rarily affected by the intensity of the sensation. During the sojourn
in the unscented air the olfactory cells have rested, but the renewal
of their activity, generally unconscious, is accompanied by a very strong
sensation which however soon fades.

The atmosphere does not stop at the surface of the seas, nor does it
cease at the surface of the soil. It penetrates both, the former espe-
cially. In the latter the access of air is very soon arrested by the
compactness of the rocks or strata, and, generally speaking, the pro-
portion of air in the soil is very small in all cases where there are no
clefts, fissures, or deep underground galleries. In the superficial layer,
however, the case is different; airis always present in appreciable pro-
portions in the less compact parts where plants push their roots and
seek their nutriment; and in the deepest shafts, caverns, caves, and
other natural or artificial excavations of the soil, air exists. It should
not be expected to find there as pure a gas as that which surrounds the
exterior of the planet. In the soil many slow but continuous chemical
reactions are going on between the air and the solid constituents, and
the result is an alteration of both sets of elements; some chemicals of
the earth and rocks are transformed, and while the air loses some part
of its constituents new elements are added to it, and thus its normal
composition is soon altered. This is the reason why great care should
alivays be exercised to ascertain the condition of air in all deep cavi-
ties, and even in normal excavations if they are rather secluded. The
air may have been so much altered in its composition as to have be-
come unfit for the maintenance of life, and cases are on record where
it consisted almost entirely of carbonic acid. Among the investigators
who have specially concerned themselves with the chemical composi-
tion of “ground” air, Boussingault has obtained interesting results,
showing that while 1 cubic meter of normal atmosphere contains
about 4 deciliters (or 0.216 gram) of carbon, 1 cubic meter of ground
air contains 9 liters (or nearly 5 grams), which is twenty-two or twenty-
three times more. In recently manured soil the proportion is much
more considerable, and the amount of carbonie acid may be twenty-
four times as great as in atmospheric air. This considerable amount

142 . AIR AND LIFE.

of carbonic acid in ground air fully explains a number of accidents,
inasmuch as while the proportion of this gas is considerably increased
that of oxygen is greatly diminished.

Air penetrates to a great depth in water, whether fresh or salt. This
is shown by the number of living forms found, not only at the surface
or in its neighborhood, but at the greatest depths to which man has
yet been abie to lower his nets, dredges, and sounding apparatus.
Since living organisms exist in the depths of the ocean, and since
they are physiologically, in their most important features, constructed
on the same principles as those which live near the surface, it is obvi-
ous that in the waters of the deep, air must be dissolved of which they
take advantage for their respiratory functions. Direct and precise
observation fully confirms this inductive reasoning. Many instruments
have been devised for the purpose of obtaining water from different
depths. One of the first was the bottle, which was used by the Kiel
committee. This bottle, firmly stopped and empty, was lowered to the
required depth, and a sudden pull was enough to cause it to open, the
surrounding water filling it in a few seconds. Many similar imple-
ments have been since invented by Bunsen, Meyer, Mill, Buchanan
(Challenger), Ellman, Sigsbee (Blake), Richard, Villegente, and Paul
Regnard. The description of these instruments is given at length in
many works—for instance, in T. Thoulet’s Océanographie ( Vol. 1), Paris,
1890, and P. Regnard’s La vie dans les eaux, Paris, 1891—where the
reader who desires full information on the matter may find it, and it
will saffice fur our purpose to give a general summary of the results
obtained, without detailing the methods by which water is brought to
the surface from different depths, or those, familiar to all, by which
the gases contained in water are extracted and submitted to chemical
analysis. In short, the results of these experiments fully and com-
pletely confirm the opinion above expressed, that even at the greatest
depths water does contain air; that the atmosphere extends down to
the nearly unfathomable abysses of the ocean.

As to rivers and lakes, or other shallow waters, the demonstration is
most easy. Their water contains oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid.
But it is a noteworthy fact that these gases are not to be found in the
proportions in which they exist in the atmosphere. Strictly speaking,
one can not say that there is any air in water. What we find are the
elements of air, the latter being all present, but their proportions
being different from those in the normal atmosphere. For instance, 1
liter of river water contains from 4 to 8 cubic centimeters of oxygen;
from 12 to 18 eubice centimeters of nitrogen, and from 2 to 20 or 25 cubic
centimeters of carbonic acid. These proportions differ greatly from
those which these three constituents have in normal air, and it must be
noted that the variations are different in different rivers or even in
the same river when examined in different places. Take the Seine
River, for instance. Each liter of water contains 32.1 cubic centimeters
AIR AND LIFE. 143

of gas, of which 3.9 are oxygen, 12 nitrogen, and 16.2 are carbonic acid.
Take the Rhone River, on the other hand, and you find 34.8 cubic centi-
meters of gas, of which 8.4 are oxygen, 18.4 nitrogen, and 8 carbonic acid.
These differences are less surprising after reflection. Each river may
and does differ in chemical constitution from other rivers, and even
from itself, at different times and places, because of the difference in
the nature and quantity of the chemical operations going on in the
water. The chemical composition of the banks varies, and the activity
of living organisms within the waters also varies. Such differences
must exert their influence upon the chemical composition of the latter,
and we have abundant proof that they do so. If the water of the same
river, taken at different places at the saine moment, is tested chemically,
differences are observed which are sometimes considerable. For in-
stance, the Thames, above London, contains 7.4 oxygen, at Hammer-
smith 4.7, at Somerset House 1.5, at Woolwich 0.25. Whence arise
these considerable variations? They are easily explained by the fact
that the river receives a large quantity of organic débris, vegetables,
dead animals, and a large number of dead or dying substances or
organisms; the débris combines with oxygen, and thus the amount of
this gas is greatly diminished. The consequence is that the fish often
perish through asphyxia, the amount of oxygen being inadequate. The
same occurs in Paris. After its passage through. the city, the Seine
is generally quite unfit to support the life of most aquatic animals.
Many species are not to be seen in the river at Paris, nor below it for
some distance, although found above, where the water is sufficiently
pure and aerated, and some 10 or 20 miles below, where aeration has
been sufficient to make up for the loss, the water having absorbed
enough fresh oxygen from the atmosphere.

So much for one series of differences in aeration. But another series
exists which is even of greater interest. The aeration of waters, or
the absorption of gases by water, varies according to general external
conditions, among which temperature and pressure rank highest—not
only general pressure, but, so to speak, individual pressure, or, to put
it in other terms, the proportion of any given gas ina mixture. Under
identical conditions, each gas, moreover, has its own special coefficient
of solubility. While nitrogen is feebly soluble, ammonia is highly so.
This fact helps us to understand why it is that the gases which
spontaneously dissolve in water in contact with the atmosphere do not,
when extracted from the water, yield a mixture even distantly compa-
rable to air: how itis that the elements of air are not found in water
under the proportions they bear to each other in the atmosphere.
While water contains the constituents of air, it contains such propor-
tions of these constituents as are peculiar to it. However, the latter
are provided in sufficient quantity, and normal river water is quite
adequate to maintain the life of aquatic animals. This applies to fresh
waters generally, for ponds and lakes have the same conditions as
rivers.
144 AIR AND LIFE.

Some special points are to be noted concerning salt water. Of course
the constituents of atmospheric air are met with in sea water. But,
generally speaking, the variations in the proportions of these constit-
uents are less numerous and of less importance. The seas, generally
considered, make up amore homogeneous whole than any river of large
dimensions. Between the south Atlantic and the north Atlantic less
differences are to be expected, and less found, than in the Thames or
the Seine, below and above London or Paris. A prioriit is obvious that
there are less causes of difference in aeration in the two parts of the
Atlantic than there are in any of the two rivers in two points not 10
miles apart. It is quite obvious also that local differences, such as
exist at the mouth of a great river that has just passed through a
large town, as is the case with the Hudson, the Thames, or the Gironde,
must be very soon dissipated in the enormous mass of the ocean
through the agency of tides, currents, and -winds. Upon the whole,
generally speaking, none of those local differences are of any real
importance. There are, however, differences which should be noticed,
but their causes are quite different from those which obtain in the pre-
ceding case. The most important are observed when we compare speci-
mens of water obtained from different depths. Carpenter noticed the
fact and comparing specimens of water obtained in the same vertical
line, at depths of 750, 800, and 862 fathoms, he observed the following
composition of the air extracted:

While the proportion of oxygen decreases with increasing depth, that
of carbonic acid increases in a marked manner. No very satifactory
explanation of this fact has been yet provided.

We have now sufficiently dwelt upon this topic, and none will doubt
that air—that is, the constituents of air, to put it in exact terms—inti-
mately mingles with the waters that cover three-fourths of our planet.
While waters do not contain atmospheric air as such, and while the
gases dissolved in them do not make up normal air, they contain the
elements of the latter, and the proportions are sufficient to maintain
aquatic life. Wemay consider that these elements are found in water,
even at the most considerable depths, although we have no positive
proof of it.

Now, itis quite clear that since tho mass of the waters contains
organisms that breathe and live, and since life goes on notwithstand-
ing the unceasing production of carbonic acid and the destruction of
oxygen, both necessary consequences of their life and respiration, there
AIR AND LIFE. 145

must exist Some unceasing agency by means of which new oxygen is
added and carbonic acid carried away. Otherwise aquatic life would
soon cease. In other terms, there must exist a perpetual exchange
between the gases dissolved in the waters and those which make up
the atmosphere, just as there goes on a perpetual exchange between
the air of any place where the atmosphere is vitiated—a town, a manu-
factory, a room—and the air of the streets or surrounding country.
And the exchanges which go on between air and water, and between the
general atmosphere and those multitudinous centers, great or small,
where the normal proportions of the gases of air are being constantly
altered, must indeed be most nicely adjusted, since by no method have
we yet been able to detect any alteration in the composition of the
atmosphere. The equilibrium must be unceasingly maintained. That
equilibrium is a very interesting matter. Interesting in two senses—
practically, since life depends upon it, and from the scientific point of
view, as itis the consequence of a general established law.

How, then, is that exchange effected between air and water, without
which life would soon extinguish all life, without which the living
organisms of water would soon render life impossible to themselves and
to their congeners? By means of what may be termed “the breathing
of the waters.” The waters breathe—that is, expire obnoxious gases
and inspire those that are useful; they expel carbonic aeid and collect
oxygen. Diffusion is the main agency of this grand function of waters,
and it is enough that both air and water be in presence and contact to
insure the operation. But diffusion is not alone at work; another
agency cooperates. It does not at first seem that dust would have
any influence, and few would suppose that it plays.any part here. It
does, however, and the enormous quantity of it which, imperceptibly in
most cases, is carried from the land over the seas, where it falls and
slowly sinks to settle at the bottom as a soft red or gray mud—the first
stage of new strata of rocks—is a great help toward the respiration of
the seas. As J. Thoulet has shown, every particle, however small and
minute, carries some air which adheres to it and does not escape when
submerged; this air slowly dissolves in the surrounding water. The
experimental proof is easy. Bring some water to the boiling point, in
order to expel the gases dissolved in it, and then add some potash and
pyrogallic acid. This mixture turns black when in presence of oxygen
by reason of the action of the latter on the acid. Under ordinary con-
ditions, the experiment being thus prepared, what one witnesses is
this: The surface of the water blackens and the black color extends
slowly toward the bottom, according to the ratio of diffusion of atmos-
pheric oxygen in the mixture. The rapidity, or rather slowness, of the
change of color is the measure of the slowness of diffusion. Now, throw
some fine dust into the vessel containing the water so prepared. What
_ happens then is that each grain or particle, while falling through the
; liquid, leaves behind it a black line which marks its path exactly, and
sm 95——10

146 AIR AND LIFE.

there are as many vertical streaks in the colorless solution as there
were particles of dust thrown into it. Each particle’s atmosphere of
air acts upon the pyrogallic acid, and instantly causes the change of
color. The experiment is a very elegant one, and provides a very con-
vineing demonstration, and when one thinks of the number of dust
particles (either of terrestrial origin or coming from the interplanetary
spaces under the form of microscopical meteorites) which uninterrupt-
edly pour down on the oceans like some paradoxical dry rain, it is
conceivable that the importance of these infinitesimal particles to all
aquatic organisms is great. From this point of view, a catastrophe
like that of Krakatoa becomes a blessing, and each volcanic outbreak
with its concomitant cloud of dust and cinders, which often spreads
over hundreds of square miles, and gives forth a soft slow rain of solid
particles which fall through the air to the water and thence to the
underlying abysses, is doubtless a benefit to aquatic organisms. It
may seem absurd to speak of the beneficial influence of volcanic catas-
trophes upon the denizens of the ocean; the fact is nevertheless incon-
testable. Nature abounds in such curious and unexpected interactions.
Most of these, as yet, escape us, but some now and then become apparent,
and go to show how difficult and complex is the study of life or biology,
in its real sense, and how essential is the knowledge of circumstances
and surroundings.

The experiment which has just been referred to suggested to Paul
Regnard the means of measuring, so to speak, the rapidity of the ocean’s
respiration, the rapidity of diffusion of the aerial gases in water, and
especially that of oxygen, which is the most important for organisms.
The method is very simple. AI] that is required is a large glass tube,
some 3 yards long, closed at the lower end, placed vertically, and filled
with water holding Coupier blue in solution, saturated with hydrosul-
phide of soda. This solution, a pale yellow in color, turns blue under
the influence of oxygen. The tube thus filled is left to itself and each
day an observation is made of the point to which the blue layer has
extended. The first day the mere surface only is blue, but by degrees
the underlying strata also turn blue, according to the rapidity with
which atmospheric oxygen diffuses and is absorbed. Under such cir-
cumstances, P. Regnard noted that in the course of three months oxygen
diffnsed no farther than about a yard from the surface, and the rate of
propagation is hardly a centimeter per day. If such is the normal
ratio, air penetrates water at the rate of 4 meters per year, and if, “at
the beginning”—of which so much is said, and so little known or know-
able—the sea was entirely devoid of oxygen, no less than a thousand
years were required to allow atmospheric oxygen to penetrate to the
depth of 4,000 meters, a depth which we all know is not uncommon in
the ocean.

It is thus seen that the respiration of waters is very slow—at least it
is very slow so far as diffusion alone is concerned. But, as already
AIR AND LIFE. ee

noticed, diffusion is not the sole agency, and it is quite clear that the
white crested waves, all foam and sparkling with air bubbles, that the
winds, the currents, the tides, and lastly the dust particles have done
and are doing much to hasten the process, and accelerate the execu-
tion of the great respiratory function of the deep. No method, unfortu-
nately, has yet been devised for measuring the rapidity of this process;
and before it can be done, some manner by which the approximate
number of dust particles falling into the seas can be ascertained should
of course be discovered. The problem is a difficult one, truly.

IJ.—AIR FROM THE CHEMICAL POINT OF VIEW.

Considered by the ancients, and even by modern philosophers till
a very recent period, as one of the four initial elements (earth, air,
water, and fire), air was unable to keep this position after the birth of
modern chemistry. Like most other substances it has had to reduce
considerably its pretensions. They were of no avail in presence of
the methods of chemistry. Instead of being, as formerly supposed, an
element, a homogeneous matter out of which no known method of
reduction can obtain two or more differing substances, air has shown
itself to be nothing more than a mixture of different elements. A mix-
ture, a mechanical mixture; not a compound. Aijr is not like water, in
which two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, are combined and make up a
third body exceedingly different in properties from those out of which
it is made, nor like the enormous number of compounds known to
chemistry in which two or more elementary substances are combined
in definite proportions and form new substances more or less pecul-
iar, but invariable, and possessing properties which neither of the
elements possesses; it is a mixture only. This may be demonstrated
in various ways. When nitrogen and oxygen, the fundamental elements
of the air, are mixed together, no heat is evolved, no heat is absorbed,
as is the case in the preparation of most compounds. Again, the
refringency of air is equal to the mean of the refringency of oxygen
and nitrogen when experimentally mixed in the proportions in which
they occur in the atmosphere; and the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen is
not a simple one; lastly, when in presence of air, water dissolves differ-
ent proportions of the different constituents of the former; it dissolves
each gas according to its own proper coefficient of solubility.

These four proofs are considered as more than sufficient to show that
air is a mixture, not a compound. It may be added, moreover, that
while the composition of the atmosphere is fairly uniform as a whole,
it is not absolutely so; the one or the other constituent is more or less
abundant according to circumstances. No chemical compound offers
such variability in composition; its constituents are constant, always
the same, and in the same ratios, while in a mixture every variation is
possible, and may be expected.

a
are
148 AIR AND LIFE.

And now, what are the constituents of this mixture? Our knowl-
edge of these elements, as well as that of air itself, considered as a
whole, is of recent date. While it would require more space than we
can spare to give a full historical account of the chemistry of air, the
principal facts may be briefly summarized.

As has been previously stated, a French physician, Jean Rey, was
the first who proved the materiality of air, and his experiment was
repeated and confirmed by Galileo in 1640, and by Otto von Guericke
in 1650. Jean Mayow, in 1669, was the first to prove that air is not an
element, a homogeneous substance. He suspected the fact that air
contains two different gases, of which the one, which he called ‘nitro-
aerial,” niaintains combustion or fire and respiration, while the other
does nothing of the sort. In short, he suspected the presence of the
two different gases which are now named oxygen and nitrogen. Had
he lived longer, Mayow might have discovered the facts which are the
basis of Lavoisier’s fame.

In 1774 Priestly’ made a great step in the right direction when he
succeeded in obtaining the separation of the two principal gases which
make up air, and on the same date Scheele” did the same, going some-
what further, as he discovered the ratio of what he called ‘‘dephlo-
gisticated air” (or oxygen) to ‘‘phlogisticated air” (or nitrogen). Both,
however, fell into the same error. Both considered the two gases as
identical, but possessing different properties. No doubt the properties
are different, but the differences are inherent to the gases themselves;
the one is not a form of the other and can not be transformed into the
other, and the differences are much more numerous than these two
pioneers of chemistry perceived.

To Lavoisier was reserved the honor of providing precise and unas-
sailable knowledge concerning the nature and composition of air. To
prove that air, aS already demonstrated, is made up of two elements,
the one adequate the other inadequate to maintain combustion and
respiration, was no difficult task. But he went farther on his road by
means of the following experiment, one that is fundamental in the
history of chemistry: He placed a known amount of mercury, caretully
weighed, in a retort whose long curved neck opened into an inverted
glass tube placed on a mercury trough. By means of a curved pipette
he sucked out part of the air in the tube, and consequently the mercury
rose within it to some height. The point to which the mereury rose
was carefully marked, and then the retort was submitted to the influ-
ence of heat. The temperature was 360° C., and on the second day
he perceived that small red pellicles were forming at the surface of the
mercury. During a week, the heating being continued, the pellicles
kept forming, and then no more appeared. He kept up his fire during
four days more and then put it out. When the apparatus was cooled

down, he saw that in the glass tube the mercury rose higher than
before the experiment, and he observed that the remaining gas was
unable to maintain respiration and combustion. In it small animals
died and a light went out. He then collected the red pellicles, weighed
them, put them in a retort whose neck opened under a glass tube
filled with mercury, and heated the retort to 400° ©. The pellicles
melted away; they yielded a certain amount of mereury which was
deposited in the neck of the retort, while in the glass tube some cubie
inches of a peculiar gas had accumulated at the top. The volume of
this gas corresponded exactly with the volume of air which had dis-
appeared in the preceding experiment, and this gas was fully able to
maintain combustion.

Thus was performed the first analysis of air, and Lavoisier came to
the conclusion that that fluid contains two gases—one which forms
one-sixth of the whole volume and is favorable to combustion and
respiration, while the other, amounting to five-sixths of the whole
volume, is favorable to neither. The first was oxygen; the last azote,
or nitrogen.!

It is now more than a century since these facts were discovered, and
became the corner stones of modern chemistry. Up to that time it was
mere empirical alchemy, and a fabric of erroneous notions. A number
of methods, much superior as far aS precision is concerned, have been
devised for the purpose of air analysis, and of gas analysis generally.

The eudiometric method, propounded by Gay-Lussac and Humboldt,
is one of the best known. It is based upon the fact that if hydro-
gen is added to air, and the electric spark passed through the mix-
ture, the oxygen of the air and the hydrogen added to the mixture
combine in definite and constant ratio and form water. A very simple
caleulation gives the amount of oxygen contained in the mixture. The
weighing method of J. B. Dumas and Boussingault, invented in 1841,
is quite different. It is based upon the fact that when air, deprived
of aqueous vapor and carbon dioxide, is made to pass through a tube
containing metallic copper reduced by means of hydrogen, and heated
to redness, it yields its oxygen to the copper, and if the copper is
weighed before and after, the amount or weight of oxygen contained in
the volume of air experimented upon is at once known. If the remain-
der of the gas, that portion which has not combined with the copper,
be collected in an empty receiver weighed before and after the experi-
ment, the increase in weight of the receiver shows the quantity of
nitrogen contained in the original volume of air. Twenty other meth-
ods, more or less similar to the preceding one, have been devised by
Brunner, Regnault and Reiset, Doyére, Bunsen, Williamson, Russell,

1These names were given by Lavoisier. Oxygen is derived from 0év¢, acid, and
yvevva, to produce, because one of the properties of oxygen is to form acids when
combined with many other substances. Azote is derived from privative aw and Ca,

ete., but this is not the place to describe them, and all text-books of
chemistry give a full account of them.

It is enough for our purpose to know that it is fully established that
atmospheric air is a mixture; that this mixture is principally made up
of oxygen and nitrogen, and that we are provided with methods and
implements by means of which air may be analyzed, and the least
traces of its constituent elements detected.!

These elements are numerous, but they differ greatly in importance.

Fundamentally, air comprises 20.81 volumes of oxygen, 79.19 volumes
of nitrogen, and some ten-thousandths of carbon dioxide. In some
localities or under certain circumstances a few other’ gases may also
be found in air, in very small quantities. _

We must now consider in turn each of these elements.

Oxygen comes first. Not that itis present in the greatest abundance,
but from many points of view it is a most important part of the
atmosphere.

This gas is heavier than air as a whole (while nitrogen is lighter),
and in 1,000 liters of air there are 208 liters of oxygen against 792 of
nitrogen. This ratio seems to be constant, although Dalton and Babi-
net, arguing theoretically, supposed that oxygen is less abundant in
the air at high altitudes, and that the proportion of this gas decreases
as the distance from the sea level is increased—oxygen being rather
more abundant in low regions, and near the surface. Of course, if such
were the case, the reverse would obtain for nitrogen. This gas should
be more abundant at high levels, and less near the sea level. Accord-
ing to the views of Dalton and Babinet, at 10,000 meters above the sea
level, 1,000 liters of air should contain only 184 liters of oxygen against
816 of nitrogen. These speculations may be interesting, but as they

1In view of recent facts this is too positive a sentence. Great was the surprise of
the chemists when they heard that Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay had discoy-
ered anew element in atmospheric air. This should inspire them with some caution,
and induce them not to put so much faith in the infallibility of their methods.
More of this hereafter. [Note added to proofs in 1896].

2To the normal constituents of atmosphere one remains to be added, and that is
argon, discovered in the year 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay, to
whom, on this account, the $10,000 Thomas Hodgkins prize has been most deservedly
awarded.

Argon, thus called because it seemed to be an inert and inactive gas, slow to
combine with other substances, was certainly contained in Cavendish’s test tubes,
but Cavendish considered it as nitrogen, and thus failed to ald this substance to
the list of chemival elements. Argon is present in the atmosphere in the proportion
of somewhat less than 1 per cent; M. Th. Schloesing obtains 0.935 argon for 100
air, in volumes. MM. MacDonald and Kellar have in vain endeavored to detect
argon in the chemical constitution of animals and plants (mice and pease), but Mr.
Ramsay has found it in meteoric iron. Argon liquefies at —128° under 38 atmos-
pheres pressure, and freezes at —189°. It is not as inactive as at first snpposed,
as Berthelot has been able to combine it with benzine under the influence of the
electric discharge. This gas does not seem to play any active part in respiration ; it
is inert and useless, like nitrogen. [Note added to proofs, 1896. |
AIR AND LIFE. 151

are in direct contradiction with positive facts and observations we may
dismiss them as “ children of fancy.” The chemist Thénard analyzed
air collected at 7,000 meters height by Gay-Lussac, and found no trace
of such difference. Similar observations, due to Dumas and Boussin-
gault, prove that these theories are not sustained by stern reality, and,
in brief, chemists are agreed that, as far as oxygen and nitrogen are
concerned, the composition of atmospheric air is uniform and constant,
with very slight exceptions. This is the result of numerous observa-
tions made in different and distant places, at different heights, at dis-
tant epochs, and Dumas and Boussingault, who have devoted much
work and time to the matter, have always obtained similar ratios, or at
least ratios so nearly identical that the differences are not more con-
siderable than may occur in the best-conducted experiments—they keep
within the limits of unavoidable errors. So we may consider air as
being as perfectly uniform in composition, as it might be expected to
be in view of the circumstances.

Now, where did this oxygen originate?) Whence does it come? From
what source is it supplied? A complete answer to this question can
only be given by those who know how things stood in the beginning,
and who understand the origin of matter, force, life, and some other of
those troublesome and perplexing problems. Oxygen must be a very
anciently established inhabitant of our planet, and its origin, like that
of the ‘‘old” families, is lost in obscure mystery. At all events there
if is, and wherever it comes from, howsoever it has been evolved, one
thing seems positive, and that is the fact that there are at present,
as far as we know, no important sources whence a considerable amount
of this gas may be derived and added to the current stock. In view
of this, the stability of its normal ratio in the air, notwithstanding the
enormous quantity of it consumed by living beings and in combustion,
becomes a riddle well worthy of some attent.on.

We know that the entire atmosphere contains over one million billions
of kilograms of oxygen; that nearly one-half of the weight of the
minerals of our globe is oxygen; that eight-ninths of the weight of
water consists of this same gas, which is, moreover, abundantly present
in the tissues of all living organisms. On the other hand, we know
at present of but one source of oxygen, discovered by Priestley, and
further investigated by Perceval and Senebier. I refer to plants. It
is a fact familiar to all that plants are endowed with the faculty—
ascribed to the chlorophyll contained in their tissues'—of breaking up
carbon dioxide into its elements; that is to say, into carbon which goes
to the repair or increase of the tissues, and oxygen, which, on being
freed, diffuses itself throughout the surrounding atmosphere. There
certainly is one source of oxygen. Are there any others? Their
existence is doubtful. Of course we know that a number of chemical

'The fact is probable but not certain, for chlorophyll has not yet been satisfactorily
separated from the tissues in order to investigate its chemical powers.

152 AIR AND LIFE.

reactions effect the liberation of oxygen, water electrolysis, the decom-
position of chlorate of potassium, or of sulphuric acid under the influ-
ence of heat, for instance; but do any of these chemical processes, or
any others similar in result if not in method, occur in nature on any
important scale? We do not know, but it seems doubtful. At all events,
since the composition of the atmosphere remains fairly constant, there
must be some agency by means of which the enormous mass of oxygen
which is daily, hourly, at every moment, absorbed in consequence of
the organic and inorganic combustions occurring over the whole globe,
is, sooner or later, returned to the atmosphere. Plants are the only
agency at present known by which this process is effected. At all
events they effect part of it. But are they equal to the task of effect-
ing the whole? The question has not been yet answered in quite
satisfactory terms. Mr. T. L. Phipson has recently endeavored to fill
this gap, and to show that plants are even a more important source
of oxygen than is commonly admitted. He cultivated a convolvulus
plant in an artificial atmosphere, entirely devoid of oxygen, but con-
taining some proportion of carbon dioxide, with the result that a part
of the latter gas disappeared, its place being taken by oxygen, which
can only have been evolved by the plant. Mr. G. Meyer had previously
expressed the opinion that oxygenis thus generated, but Mr. Phipson’s
experiment is of great interest. The whole matter is very important,
for, if. the oxygen contained in the atmosphere has been evolved by
plants, one may ask whether there has not been some time when the
atmosphere was very poor in oxygen and very rich in carbon dioxide,
and whether some time may not arrive when, conversely, the atmos-
phere will be well provided with oxygen and very deficient in carbon
dioxide. If such were to be the case, the equilibrium and homogeneity
of air, as far as its composition 1s concerned, would be very unstable
and temporary matters. But no answer of a satisfactory character can
yet be given to such questions.

It may be added that, according to less recent data, 1 heetare (a
little over 2 acres) of forest exhausts each year the atmosphere of some
11,000 kilograms, or 5,596 cubic meters, of carbon dioxide, while in
return it yields nearly as much (5,594 cubic meters) oxygen. A field
of oats, similarly, returns about as much oxygen as it absorbs carbon
dioxide. Perhaps other agencies are at work and make up for the enor-
mous consumption of oxygen effected by human, animal, and plant res-
piration, and by inorganic combustions generally, and it does not seem
to us that adequate proof has yet been furnished that plants alone are
able to return to the atmosphere the oxygen which they, with all other
living beings, take from it. Leaving out of the question the subject of
the origin of oxygen, it is very difficult to ascertain the methods by
which, notwithstanding an enormous consumption, the ratio of this
gas remains fairly constant at the present time.

While the proportion of oxygen in air is constant, or tolerably
AIR AND LIFE. 153

uniform, it must not be forgotten that certain local conditions may
tend to increase or decrease its normal ratio. Nor could it be other-
wise. However rapid the diffusion of gases, it is reasonable to suppose
that when one of the constituents of the atmosphere is being rapidly
subtracted or added in great quantities, the normal ratio in that vicin-
ity must be more or less altered. In a crowded room where ventilation
is inadequate the ratio of oxygen decreases, and the same happens in
places where intense combustion is going on—in mine shafts, where
slow oxidization of materials is a nearly constant phenomenon. In
brief, where the destruction of oxygen is not compensated by rapid
ventilation, the proportion of this gas to the remainder of the air must
decrease. Under the same conditions, of course, the ratio of carbon
dioxide must and does increase, as repeated observations have shown.
But such local accidents, such limited alterations of the composition
of the air, have no influence on the general atmosphere; they are
temporary, very slight, and therefore rapidly obliterated. Hven the
respiratiou of some two, three, or four million inhabitants, as in a large
city, does not affect the composition of the air of the streets; and
London, Chicago, or Paris exert no more influence on the surrounding
atmosphere, into which they pour torrents of carbon dioxide, than any
forest, for instance, where the case is reversed, and where oxygen is
produced in abundance. Diffusion takes place immediately, and no
appreciable alteration can be detected, save in very limited spaces and
for a short period. And while the one gas is being removed in one
place it is being added in another, and thus a compensation is rapidly
effected.

Little need be said concerning nitrogen. This gas, as already stated,
was discovered by Priestley, and Lavoisier showed that it is one of the
elements of air. Its weight is lighter than that of air as a whole, and
in 100 liters of air there are 79 of nitrogen. It neither burns nor main-
tains combustion; it plays no part in respiration; it can not help to
maintain life. Not that it has any toxic properties, assuredly; but it
is inert, indifferent, inactive. Little is known concerning its origin.
We know that some mineral springs, sulphurous springs particularly,
yield a certain amount of nitrogen, and the air ejected from the lungs
of animals contains about as much as the same air when inspired. As
is the case with oxygen, nitrogen seems to occur in the atmosphere in
the same ratio everywhere. |

The two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, are the main constituents of
air, and compose the greater part thereof. They are the essentials, the
other components, which must now be noticed, occurring only in very
limited quantities, some in variable and small proportions. We might
almost say that they are accessory components, judging from their quan-
tity, had not experience shown that one of them at least plays a very
important part in biology, one no less essential, in fact, than that of
oxygen, for instance. This latter component is carbonic acid or carbon
dioxide. It occurs only in very small quantity, 4 or 5 liters in 10,000

154 AIR AND LIFE.

liters of air. This gas is comparatively heavy, and Priestley was cog-
nizant of the fact that it is unable to support combustion or respiration.
The proportions in air are not uniform and constant; they vary according
to circumstances and places much more than is the case with the other
gases. As early as 1527 DeSaussure discovered very marked differences,
obtaining as extreme figures 3.15 and 5.74 per 10,000. More recently,
Boussingault and Lévy, comparing the proportion of carbonic acid in
the air of Paris with that in the air of Andilly (a small village some
12 miles from Paris, near Montmorency), found also a notable difference
between the two, there being 3.19 (per 10,000) in Paris and 2.99 in
Andilly. Again, a somewhat smaller difference has been noticed by
Roscoe and McDougall between the air in Manchester and that of the
surrounding country; but at Clermont-Ferrand, in central France,
Truchot found 3.15 per 10,000 and but 2.03 at the top of the Puy-de-
Dome, a neighboring mountain, and 1.72 at Pic de Sancy, another peak
of the same group.

These instances are enough, we presume, to show that the ratio of ear-
bonic acid to the total volume of the air varies considerably. much more
than that of the two previously mentioned gases, and that this com-
ponent is more abundant in cities than in the country.' This should not
occasion wonder, as the amount of carbonic acid varies according to
various circumstances of time and place. For instance, De Saussure
noted that it increased during the night and during cloudy weather;
its ratio changes with the season, from one year, and even from one
month, to another, irregularly, and, in fact, from day today. Above the
ocean the variations are less, and in mid ocean the air is purer than
over the continents. The same obtains on high mountains.

If, instead of considering the composition of air collected in the
streets, in the country, or on mountains, we compare rather that which
we breathe in dwellings and in all confined spaces where ventilation
is more or less deficient, and where organic and inorganic combustions
take place, with that which obtains in the open, the differences are still
greater. Of course, it should be so. We must not forget that the air
which each one of us expels through mouth or nose, at this very
moment, contains nearly a hundred times more carbonic acid than was
contained in the same air when we inhaled it a few seconds ago. This
being the case, it is sufficient to imagine a confined room where one or
many persons are sitting; there most certainly, provided the experiment
lasts long enough, we shall find many different and increasing propor-
tions of carbonic acid. That is, we might were the experiment not
self-limited. For though, as Daron kent: has observed, the 0.40 or 0.50

In Austria, the ean tof eaeponte nial is Avan bd, 3 liters per 100 cubic meters of
air; in econ it varies between 32 and 34; in the desert of Lybia, Von Pettenkofer
found from 44 to 49. These are rather high figures. During the expedition for the
observation of the transit of Venus, analyses made in different countries gave the
following results: Florida, 29.2; Mexico, 27.3; Martinique, 28; Haiti, 27.8; Santa
Cruz, 26.6. At Cape Horn, Hyades observed 23,1 and 28.5 as extreme figures.

AIR AND LIFE. 155

per 1,000, which is the normal proportion of carbonic acid, may rise in
a tolerably well-ventilated room to 0.54 and 0.70, or to 2.4 in an ill-ven-
tilated sick room, and reach to 3.2 in a lecture room, 7.2 in a school-
room, and even 21 in a stable in the Alps where men and beasts are
huddled together in winter, the chinks being stopped against the cold,
there occurs a limit which can not be passed; if the ratio increases, men
and animals must soon die, and the experiment is over, the production
of carbonic acid having come to anend. When the composition of the
surrounding atmosphere is the same as that of the air which each of us
expires (over 4 per cent carbonic acid, and less than 16 per cent oxygen),
death must soon result, because there is too much carbonic acid in the
air to allow that in the system to escape, and not enough oxygen for
the needs of the body. More will be said on this point later on. It is
enough here to show how considerable the ratio of carbonic acid may
become in confined space, and how much greater are the variations in
earboni¢e acid than in oxygen or nitrogen.

The cause of these variations is obvious. They are in close relation
to the variations in the production of the gas under consideration, and
upon this matter information is abundant.

Carbonie acid is produced in many ways; it has many sourees. One
of them has been referred to—animals and mankind. Bipeds and
quadrupeds, in fact all animals, indeed, all living organisms, are sources
ot carbonie acid. All beings, from mere yeast cells to the lords of
creation, breathe; all or nearly all take oxygen from the air and return
carbonic acid to it. It is a familiar fact that fermentation in most
cases—in the case of sweet substances particularly—is accompanied by
a considerable production of carbonic acid. In wine-producing countries
cases of asphyxia often occur in the cellars where fermentation 1s going
on, owing to the amount of carbonic acid produced. All higher organ-
isms, plants, and animals have the respiratory function, and one of the
acts of respiration is the elimination of carbonic acid through the lungs.
This unceasing production of carbonic acid by living organisms, whether
plants or animals, is very variable in its activity, even within the limits
of the same species and of the same individual. It 1s well known that
the male produces more than the female, the adult more than the very
young or the very old individual, the strong more than the weak, etc. It
is well known, also, that this production of carbonic acid is increased by
exercise, movement, hght, and food, while it is decreased by rest, dark-
ness, inanition. On the average each man exhales 20 liters of this gas
per hour, and nearly 1 kilogram per diem (of twenty-four hours). The
production is more considerable in sheep, and a buli exhales between
7 and 8 kilograms during the same lapse of time. However, in order
to well appreciate the ratio of carbon dioxide exhalation, instead of
considering the whole amount produced by any individual, it is better
to refer this amount to the weight of the individual animal or person,
to ascertain the quantity evolved per kilogram of weight. Viewing the

156 AIR AND LIFE.

matter in this light, we perceive that birds are the animals that give
out the greatest quantity of carbonic acid. While 1 kilogram of ox
excretes from 3 to 7 grams of carbon per twenty-four hours, 1 kilogram
of fowl or turkey excretes 20 grams on an average, | kilogram of young
chickens 56 grams, and 1 kilogram of sparrow nearly 60 grams. These
facts quite agree with the exceedingly active respiratory function of
birds, especially small birds.

Boussingault many years ago established the fact that the town of
Paris alone, taking into consideration men and horses only, exhales
nearly half a million cubic meters of carbonic acid per twenty-four
hours (at present three-quarters of a million would be nearer the
mark, but still even below it), and estimating the whole population of
the globe as being one billion and a half, we find that mankind alone
pours into the atmosphere one billion and a half kilograms of carbonie
acid per diem (1,500,000,000 kilograms); that is to say, 720,000,000 cubie
meters. Per annum the grand total is, in round numbers, 547,500,-
000,000 kilograms, or 262,800,000,000 cubic meters. So much for man-
kind only. If we wish to take into account the production of carbonie
acid by animals, the difficulties are certainly great, and we can only
proceed inferentially, and with less certainty. Girardin puts the pro-
duction of carbonic acid by animals at something like double that of
mankind, if not treble—iet us say double, which means 1,095,000,000,000
kilograms per annum. but there remain other sources of carbonic acid:
all plants which, although decomposing carbon dioxide as part of their
method of nutrition, breathe in the same manner as animals, and exhale
carbonic acid; all the combustions going on in our houses—fires, lights—
in our factories and works, ete. (in Europe alone 559,000,000 tons of coal
are burned each year, which means 80,000,000,009 cubic meters of carbon
dioxide); the slow but uninterrupted production of the gas which is
going on over the whole globe through the gradual combustion of
decaying vegetable matter; the mineral springs—those of Auvergne
only in France, giving off, according to Lecoq, some 7,000,000,000 cubic
meters of gas; voleanoes and their surroundings—Cotopaxi alone being
considered by Boussingault as giving off more carbonic acid than a
whole city like Paris; the natural sources of gas, such as the Grotta del
Cane! near Naples, etc. Under such circumstances, it is very difficult
to form any idea of the total amount of carbonic acid discharged into
the atmosphere. Armand Gautier, however, comes to the very probable
conclusion that this amount can not be very far from 2,500,000,000,000

1The air in this grotto contains more than half its volume in carbonic aeid. It
derives its name from the fact that, in order to illustrate the noxious effects of the
inferior stratum of air (where carbon dioxide, heavier, accumulates), it is the custom to
introduce a dog into it, which soon falls, affected by asphyxia, while the visitors, owing
to their higher stature, breathe the normal air, and feel nothing unusual. The dog,
it must be added, is at once taken out into pure air, and soon revives, going through
the experiment several times a day. Jts health is very good, but its temper becomes
anpleasant when a visitor appears. The animal knows what is coming.
a AIR AND LIFE. 157

cubie meters per annum, which means over 5,000,000,000,000 kilograms,
the weight of the total atmosphere being 5,000,000,000,000,000,000—that
is, one hundred thousand times greater. At all events, this is certainly
below the mark.

Such being the enormous rate of production of carbonic acid, one
may well wonder that the ratio of this gas in the total atmosphere
remains as small as it is, it being easy enough to reckon what the ratio
would become in the course of ten, twenty, or a hundred years, if there
were not some agency at work by means of which it is destroyed or com-
bined, and without which life would soon become extinct. That such
agencies do exist and are in operation is a positive fact, and though we
may not be acquainted with all of them, there are three at least which
deserve notice. These agencies are plants, animals, and oceans.

Plants occupy the first place; for, while producing carbonic acid which
they breathe, they absorb it in the course of the process of nutrition,
taking its carbon into their tissues and yielding its oxygen to the
atmosphere.!

Animals should be considered next; not all, to be sure, but all those
which have a calcareous skeleton, internal or external. Such are corals,
such are shellfish generally, and all aquatic and terrestrial animals,
which, having a calcareous skeleton, must necessarily contain some

amount of carbonic acid combined with lime. This compound seems

to hold good for a long time, and if there are cases where the skeleton
after death slowly decomposes, so that the carbonic acid has some
chances of getting free again, there are a great many more in which it
is preserved, and we know of considerable geological strata which are
nothing else than enormous accumulations of the remains of animals that
died centuries and hundreds of centuries ago. This process, by means
of which a considerable amount of carbonic acid becomes fixed and
imprisoned, so to say, was exceedingly active in earlier times; it is also
very active at the present period, and the great space taken up by coral
reefs in the mid Pacific and other oceans is but a gigantic laboratory of
nature where carbonic acid is being, if not destroyed, at least hoarded
and put by under a compact form, and, for a time at least, withdrawn
from the general circulation of matter. To appreciate the importance
of the storing process, it is only necessary to measure the thickness

1A writer in the Belgique Horticole, Vol. XXXV, 1885, p. 227, gives the following
evaluation: One hectare of forest (1 hectare equals 2.471 acres) produces yearly
3,000 kilograms of carbon—1,600 kilograms under the form of wood and 1,400 under
the form of leaves (weighed dry and exclusive of other substances). During one
hundred and fifty days (on the average) of active vegetation, the trees must draw
from the atmosphere 5,596 cubic meters (11,000 kilograms) of carbon dioxide. In
exchange they give nearly as much oxygen (5,594 cubic meters). With a field of
oats the same proportion obtains—as much oxygen is given off as carbonic acid
is taken in. Thirty-two persons give off as much carbonic acid as is taken in by 1
hectare of oats or of forest, and they burn as much oxygen as the said surface of
field or forest produces.
158 AIR AND LIFE.

and extent of such masses of organic remains. All know that in every
geological formation calcareous strata of great thickness are found,
which are merely agglomerations of skeletons, and Van Dechen has
endeavored to form some idea of the quantity of carbonic acid which
may be contained in suchstrata. Theresult is very striking. Hecomes
to the conclusion that in thelime strata of the Carboniferous epoch alone
there is an amount of carboni¢ acid imprisoned which is six times more
considerable than that at present contained in the whole atmosphere.
The problem has been carried further by Sterry Hunt. Taking this
result into consideration, and forming an estimate of the whole quantity
of carbonic acid combined with lime in the whole geological series, he
finds that the amount of carbonic acid thus imprisoned in the calcareous
rocks would, if entirely liberated, form an atmosphere two hundred times
more considerable than that which at present surrounds the planet. In
such a case the pressure would be so much increased that the gas wouid
necessarily become liquid. The inference which he draws (Brit. Asso-
ciation for the Adv. of Science, 1878) is that the enormous amount cf
carbonic acid at present stored in the depths of geological strata has
never been simultaneously, even for a short time, present in the atmos-
phere, but that it must have reached the latter in small quantities and
eradually. Mr. Sterry Hunt is of opinion that all this carbonic acid
has come to our planet from celestial regions in the course of hundreds
of centuries. Whatever may be thought of this interpretation as to the
origin of the gas, one fact remains unassailable, and that is the enormous
quantity of the latter stored up in the earth’s crust; and if in the course
of time organisms have been able to accumulate such a provision and
are still operating as they undoubtedly are under our very eyes, we cer-
tainly can not help coming to the conelusion that we have here one of
the most important agencies by means of which the atmosphere is being
unceasingly kept sufficiently pure for maintaining life.

Lastly, come the oceans. Few are aware that the salt waters play a
most interesting and important part in the general regulation of the
atmosphere, and are one of the agencies which by absorbing carbonic
acid prevent it from overaccumulating in the air. Mr. Schloesing’s
remarkable investigations have shown that the seas contain a large
amount of dissolved carbonic acid, a much larger amount, in fact, than
is to be found in the whole atmosphere. The equilibrium is preserved
as follows: When carbon dioxide becomes more abundant than usual in
air, in consequence of an increased production of this gas, and no com-
pensatory destruction or withdrawal is effected by plants or animals,
part of it dissolves in the salt waters, and combines with the insoluble
and neutral carbonate of lime, always present there, producing a soluble
bicarbonate of lime which dissolves immediately, and, inversely, if the
amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere decreases, the soluble bicar-
bonate is decomposed into carbonic acid, which is set free and diffuses
AIR AND LIFE. 159

a

throughout the atmosphere, and neutral carbonate, which remains in
the water. Briefly, so long as the tension of carbonic acid in the waters
and that of carbonic acid in the atmosphere is the same, nothing is pro-
duced, but as soon as this equilibrium of tension is destroyed the sea
restores it by the very simple process just described. This chemical
adjustment works automatically at the moment it is needed, and to the
extent and in the direction required. It must be added that this equi-
librating function is possible mainly through the circumstance that
the ocean contains a much larger amount of carbon dioxide than the
atmosphere; according to Mr. Schloesing, about ten times as ruch.
However great, then, the production of carbonic acid may be on the
surface of the globe by all the agents we have enumerated, it would
seem that the proportions of this gas in the atmosphere as a whole
ean vary but slightly, owing to the power of the sea to absorb it and
maintain the equilibrium.

We have now exhausted the list of the agencies through which the
amount of carbon dioxide in the air may be and is reduced when
necessary, and they are important and powerful enough, as we have
seen, to be equal to probable emergencies. Without them the globe
would soon become uninhabitable. Poggendorf, in fact, has found that
if all carbon dioxide produced could accumulate in the air the propor-
tion would be doubled in eighty-six years. A few centuries would see
the last of life as far as superior organisms are concerned.

Oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, such are the main coustituents of
air, Those which follow are of less importance, but deserve a passing
notice.

We nay begin with ozone. This gas, discovered in 1840 by Schoen-
bein, has been made the subject-matter of many investigations by
De Marignac, De la Rive, Becquerel, Frémy, Andrews, Tait, ete.
Ozone is oxygen under a peculiar form—condensed oxygen, so to say,
oxygen of high potency. It possesses strong oxidizing properties,
and the amount which 1s found in the atmosphere varies considerably
according to circumstances and places. This amount is on the average
of 1 milligram per 100 cubic meters of air; 34 milligrams are a maxi-
mum. This gas is generally wholly absent from the atmosphere of
cities, and in the air which has passed through large centers of popula-
tion. Paris offers good opportunities for illustrating this fact. When
the wind is northerly, no ozone is found in the air at the Montsouris
Observatory, situated in the south of Paris, while, when the wind is
southerly and comes over the country without having yet crossed the
town, ozone is found in the air. Generally speaking, then, the healthi-
est part of all towns is that which lies in the direction from which the
prevailing wind comes; the air is purer and fresher and contains more
ozone. In western Europe, where the prevailing winds are westerly
and northerly, the northwestern and western parts are the most eligible.

The cause of the difference in the amount of atmospheric ozone is

160 AIR AND LIFE.

»

to be sought in the fact that cities contain a much larger quantity of
oxidizable organic material than is the case with the country and
small villages, and the result is that more ozone is absorbed from the
atmosphere over and around cities than from the atmosphere over the
country, over the fields, and especially over the oceans. Generally
speaking, ozone is more abundant near forests and the sea; the atmos-
phere in mid ocean is particularly rich in it. May we not attribute the
cause of the beneficial effects of life in the open air, of a residence in
the country, near the sea or in the mountains, and of long sea voyages
to the larger proportions of this gas found in those regions? Schoen-
bein thought so, and after him many have adopted the same view—
among them an English physician, Cook, according to whom a definite
relationship prevails in India between cholera and other zymotie dis-
eases and the proportion of ozone in the air, the diseases increasing
when ozone decreases, and decreasing when the latter becomes more
abundant. In consequence of the greater abundance of ozone in the
atmosphere over the country and in proximity to living plants, it might
seem advisable to advocate the presence of plants in apartments,
instead of excluding them as some feel meclined to do, arguing that
plants are living beings, that they breathe, and that, accordingly, they
increase the ratio of carbonic acid. ‘The view in favor of plants has
been strongly advocated by T. M. Anders (House Plants as Sanitary
Agents, 1887, Lippincott); but the most important point which should
be established in rejation to this matter, the fact that plants do really
produce ozone, does not seem placed on a satisfactory basis. Proof is
still wanting. And this brings us to face the fact that very little is
known concerning the origin of ozone. We do not know whether any
agencies are at work now in nature evolving ozone to any important
‘extent. In the laboratory ozone may be produced by the electric spark,
and when so evolved causes the particular smell perceived in the vicinity
of electrical machinery; ozone is aiso evolved during the electrolysis
of water. Are we then to assume that in nature ozone is produced by
thunderstorms, those gigantic counterparts of our electrical discharge,
and under the influence of the electric currents so frequently in opera-
tion in the atmosphere? Many chemists think so, and if this is the
case it should be easily shown that the ratio of ozone to air is in fairly
exact relationship to the proportion of thunderstorms, or to their recent
oceurrence. Ozone should be most abundant under the Tropics, should
decrease in high latitudes, where thunderstorms are least frequent,
and should be more abundant just after a thunderstorm than before.
But none of these points have been satisfactorily established.
Without attempting to solve the riddle and to ascertain the origin
of ozone, a French chemist, M. Hautefeuille, who ascribes the blue
color of the heavens, or of the atmosphere, to ozone, asserts that this
gas 1s more abundant in the higher than in the lower strata of our
atmosphere. It may be so, at all events we are not much the wiser for
:

AIR AND LIFE. i161

the assertion. While we know that ozone is nothing more than oxygen
in an altered and allotropic condition, we are quite in the dark as to the
methods by which this alteration is effected. We know that the ratio
of ozone is very variable; that it is more abundant in May than in any
other month; more abundant in the morning, from October to June,
and in the evening, in July, August, and September, so that, upon the
whole, it seems to follow fair weather and heat; but this hardly helps
to solve the question, and much remains to be discovered.

Concerning ammonia, our information extends somewhat further than
in the case of ozone. Ammonia is constantly present in the atmosphere.
In 1857 Boussingault and, later, Schloesing, did good work in reference
to this subject. They have shown that ammonia generally exists in
combination with carbonic or nitric acid; only a small proportion is free.
Its origin is easily ascertained, for ammonia is one of the by-products
of organic putrefaction. Considering the amount of putrefaction which
must take place on our planet, it is clear that this source is a fruitful one;
and it must be added also that ammonia could not exist in an atmos-
phere where life was absent, nor in one where putrefaction was impos-
sible, nor in an entirely aseptic atmosphere, the organisms themselves
being aseptic. Although ammonia is a constant component, it is a very
small one; air does not contain more than a few millionths of it; but
water of atmospheric origin, rain, vapor, fog, ete., holds a larger propor-
tion. M.Schloesing has devised ingenious apparatus and methods for
ascertaining the proportions of ammonia in air and in rain water, as the
matter is one of importance, particularly to agriculture, in view of the
interchange of ammonia that occurs between air, rain, and ground water.
One of the results has been to show that each hectare in France (some-
thing over 2 acres) receives yearly through rainfall, or from the atmos-
phere, 9.801 kilograms of nitrogen under the form of ammonia. This
will be again referred to further on, when we come to consider the uses

of this compound and its role in nature.

Other nitrogen compounds are also present in air—nitrous and nitrie
acids, for instance, both in very small quantities. It may be that they
are formed under the influence of atmospheric electricity, as some experi-
ments by Cavendish seem to show, and as indicated by some observa-
tions of Liebig, who detected nitrate of ammonia in the rain that falls
during thunderstorms. It may be also, as Schoenbein suggests, that
nitrous acid is formed by the action of nitrogen on water during the
different oxidizations or combustions which goon rapidly in our works,
factories, and so forth, and slowly in the field of nature. Nitric nitrogen
iS more abundant in-and during winter, and it is more especially in rain
water that its proportions have been ascertained. Generally some 0.75
milligram are present in each liter of rain water, and in France each
hectare receives about 3.986 kilograms of this nitrogen through the
rainfall. Added to the nitrogen received under form of ammonia, this
gives us a total of 13.787 kilograms of nitrogen received by the soil.

162 AIR AND LIFE.

Much of it is borrowed by plants. It has been observed in England
and in France that rain water collected in cities or in their immediate
vicinity contains more nitrogen (especially under the form of ammonia)
than that collected in the country some distance away. Towns where
industrial pursuits are thriving and active, where factories and furnaces
keep their chimneys constantly at work, produce a large quantity of
ammonia. London, Glasgow, and Manchester are specially noted for
this. Some amount of carbureted hydrogen exists in the atmosphere
(one ten-thousandth), and its name, marsh gas, gives a clue to its origin.
Sulphureted hydrogen, also present in very small quantities, has its origin
in some volcanoes and in the disintegrative processes going on in dead
‘bodies or other lifeless organic materials. It is therefore often found in
the vicinity of graveyards and of fecal matter. It is enough to merely
mention the presence of a very slight proportion of boric acid, which is
ejected into the atmosphere by volcanoes—by some at least.

Iodine has been detected in small quantities by Chatin, who is of the
opinion that its presence or absence in the air and waters bears some
relation to the occurrence of goiter in the human species. Very little
can be said in support of this view. The atmosphere undoubtedly con-
tains saline particles, and all observers who use the spectroscope have
been more or less annoyed by the fact. But these particles are present
under the solid form. They are positively in suspension in the air, and
not under the form of vapor nor of gas. No very considerable mental
effort is required to ascertain the origin of such particles. Dust per-
vades the whole atmosphere—that is, the lower strata at least—dust
which has been torn from the soil in all countries of the world, in the
deserts of Sahara, Kalahari, Gobi, or Atacama, in the lowlands, from
the flanks of the mountain ranges, dust that has been poured out from
the bowels of the earth by Cotopaxi and Kilauea, Vesuvius and Colima,
Erebus, and Terror, and all this dust contains a large number of saline
particles. ‘The seas also contribute their share. The wind sweeps off
the crest of the waves, blows the foam and brine inshore, often to
considerable distances, with the result that the atmosphere contains a
proportion of the salts of the sea, which often cover with a perceptible
coating plants fairly distant from the shore. [Farther inland the pro-
portion of sea salts is decreased, but while not themselves apparent
they exert apparent effects upon plants.’ Another curious influence
is exerted by these particles in quite a different direction. It is well
known that aqueous solutions of salts may, under peculiar cireum-
stances, be supersaturated; that is, may contain a larger proportion of
dissolved salt than is consistent with theory. If air is allowed to come
in contact with the surface, such a solution often suddenly crystallizes.
M. Gernez, who has thoroughly investigated these phenomena, comes
to the conclusion that the sudden crystallization is due to the presence

1Cf. P. Lesage: Influence du bord de la mer sur la structure des plantes.
AIR AND LIFE. 163

in the atmosphere of a few particles of the corresponding salt, for it is
a familiar fact that if the very smallest amount of a salt is dropped
into a supersaturated solution of the same salt, the latter instantly
crystallizes, just as a loaded gun goes off when the trigger is pulled.
If this interpretation be correct, certainly air contains a large amount
of sulphate of sodium, for supersaturated solutions of the latter crystal-
lize very easily when not protected from contact with the general
atmosphere. A fact that favors this explanation is that when the air
in contact with a supersaturated solution is carefully filtered through
a plug of asbestos or cotton it has no longer the power of inducing
crystallization. It has been deprived by the plug of those particles -
which, by their conformity to the composition of the solution are able to
induce the phenomenon referred to. If this explanation of M. Gernez
is correct, the constant refusal of a supersaturated solution to crystallize
when in contact with the general atmosphere would prove that the salt
which it contains is not to be found free in the air. At all events, the
interpretation is quite plausible and the fact is of interest.

Before dismissing this brief review of the main chemical constituents
of the atmosphere, a word must be said concerning the volatile organic
matters which Brown-Séquard and @Arsonval thought they had found
in expired air a few years ago. These two physiologists, collecting air
expired by men or animals, and condensing, by means of cold, the
aqueous vapor always present in such air, obtained a liquid to which
they ascribed toxic properties. If such liquid is injected under the skin
of an animal, it kills more or less rapidly, the results varying according
to dose, the species experimented upon, and other circumstances. The
inference was that expired air contains certain volatile substances
excreted or exhaled by the lung surface and dissolved in the water
derived from.the condensation of pulmonary aqueous vapor, and from
which they may be isolated by analysis. A very tempting inference,
to be sure, for it seems clear that confined air vitiated by respiration,
even after it is deprived of carbon dioxide, remains heavy, unpleasant,
unhealthy, and even injurious, and if it has an unpleasant smell, the
reason is probably because it contains peculiar organie matters. Do
these matters—whose existence is suspected, not proven—accumulate
in the liquid condensed by Brown-Séquard and @Arsonyal, and impart
to it its toxic properties? The one great difficulty in answering this
question is the fact that the different physiologists who have endeay-
ored to repeat and confirm the above experiments in France, Ger-
many, and Italy, have been unable to obtain the same results. They
have not succeeded in obtaining from the breath any condensed
liquid which had a toxic infiuence, and the most probable explanation is
that some mistake was made by the original observers. When care is
taken to exclude all elements except those derived from the breath no
ill effects are observed on animals. It may very well have happened

164 AIR AND LIFE.

that Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval did not take pains enough to pre-
vent the contamination of the liquid, either by solid, and probably
living, particles of nasal or buceal origin, or by impurities belonging
to the apparatus and receiver in which condensation was effected. We
can not, therefore, accept their original statement although there is a
probability in favor of its truth. Further experiments are required
to settle the matter.

IIl.—BioLtoGicAL ROLE OF THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE.

Having now considered the constituents of the atmosphere, their
relative proportions in the aerial mixture, their mode of production and
distribution—that is, their mode of equilibration—and taking it as an
established fact that the composition of air varies but slightly, remain-
ing constant within the limits previously mentioned; having also briefly
reviewed the part played by animate life in maintaining the composi-
tion of the atmosphere, we may now proceed to consider the chemical
and physical influence of the atmosphere on the life of organisms.

For the sake of convenience and clearness, we shall begin with the
chemical influence, and review in turn the influence of each separate
constituent.

The life-maintaining gas of atmosphere, par eacellence, is, to all
appearances, oxygen—and we shall deal first with this element.

That its presence in air is indispensable for the proper execution of
the respiratory functions is a fact familiar to all. Physiology has most
clearly demonstrated, for a century past, the great importance and use-
fulness of this gas. It is essential to respiration. Man consumes large
quantities of it.!

Inspired air, containing on the average 20 or 21 per cent of oxygen
by volume—expired air containing only 16 per cent—4 per cent have, in
consequence, been absorbed by the organism, and in twenty-four hours

11¢ should be noticed that neither men nor animals ever breathe pure air, nor
can they do so under normal and natural circumstances. The reason is obvious.
The lungs are never totally emptied. Even after the deepest expiration, there
remains in the lungs and air passages a residue of air that can not be expelled
(owing to the anatomical impossibility of total pulmonary contraction), and
such air is vitiated and unfit for respiratory purposes. The next inspiration brings
a certain amount of pure air, but, as a matter of course, it mixes with the impure
residual air, and therefore becomes vitiated to some extent. The only parts
which receive strictly pure air are the superior air passages. At the end of expira-
tion they are full of impure air; but the very first result of inspiration is to return
all this impure air to the lungs, and to fill the air passages with pure air. A part of
this goes to the lungs, and all that remains in the nose, trachea, ete., is pure. All
mucous membranes haye some respiratory functions, so that a proportion of this
pure air is used; but the most important of the respiratory organs is bathed in
a vitiated atmosphere, and one may truly say that neither men nor animals eyer
breathe really pure atmospheric air. A very simple and ingenious experiment has
peat tts

AIR AND LIFE. 165

an average adult retains over 740 grams, or 516,500 cubic centimeters, a
total amount of 500,000,000 cubic meters per day for the whole of man-
kind. The amount of oxygen required varies somewhat according to
sex and age within the limits of the same species. During childhood
and old age less is needed than during the prime of life. An adult may
require 910 grams in twenty-four hours; an 8-year old child is content
with 375. Various circumstances, such as vigor, health, temperature,
rest, exercise, and so on, increase or diminish oxygen consumption,
This oxygen is absorbed in our tissues, which it reaches chiefly through
the agency of the lungs and blood; a small proportion, however (one-
eightieth of the amount absorbed by the lungs), is absorbed by our
skin, which has, therefore, some respiratory importance.' All our
tissues need oxygen; all breathe. Tor it must not be forgotten that the
lung is nothing more than an instrument in the respiratory process; the
chemical operation which is the essential part of this function takes
place elsewhere, in the tissues themselves. The lung is only the door
by which oxygen enters the system. Physiologists held quite different
views a century ago, and:Lavoisier himself supposed that the main
act of respiration takes place in the lung. What really happens is
that oxygen, introduced into the lung, filters through the very thin
walls of the pulmonary capillaries, where it finds in the red blood ecor-
puscles a substance called hemoglobin, with which it unites to form a
compound which bears the name of oxyhemoglobin. A very unstable
compound it is, for throughout the tissues, in the capillary vessels of
the whole body, oxygen is allowed to escape and effect its work among
the cells. Numerous and complex reactions take place, and one set
of them results in the formation of carbonic acid. The blood, therefore,
is nothing more than a vehicle; it carries oxygen to the tissues and
brings back to the lungs carbonic acid, which, if not allowed to escape,
would soon cause death. The ‘‘organic combustions” do not occur in
the lungs, as was thought a century ago; their seat is in the tissues,
throughout the whole body.

While respiration is common to all animals, it is not equally active

been devised by Prof. Charles Richet in order to give an experimentai proof of the
soundness of this inference. All that is required is an india-rubber tube, some
2 or 5 yards in length, of rather wide bore. This tube is so adapted to the respira-
tory apparatus of a dog or rabbit, that by some means or other he is made to
breathe through it. Under such conditions death from asphyxia soon results.
This experiment merely exaggerates the normal conditions; adding the tube
amounts to nothing more than lengthening the air passages, and putting a greater
distance between the lung and the atmosphere. The result is not a matter of sur-
prise—external air can not reach the lungs. Inspiration is not sufficient to draw to
the lung the whole of the air contained in the tube, plus a sufficient amount of pure
air. Hach inspiration introduces some fresh air in the end of the tube, each expi-
ration expels it, and none reaches the animal, which is unceasingly breathing the
Same air over again and perishes from asphyxia, although in appearance breathing
as freely as possible.

Cutaneous respiration is quite sufficient, in winter, to maintain life in some
animals; the frog, for instance.

166 AIR AND LIFE.

in all; it is more intense in birds than in mammals; more intense in
mammals than in reptiles and mollusks. An active animal will consume
more oxygen than one that is slothful, sleeping, lethargic, or hibernat-
ing. Yet all animals breathe; none can dispense with oxygen, and if
that gas fails them they die.

It is the same with plants. While for their nutrition they exhale
oxygen (chlorophyllian function) during the day, under the influence
of light, they breathe at all times, absorbing oxygen and exhaling ear-
bonie acid, as Priestley has shown. Here, also, the intensity of the
function may vary. Plants need a great amount of oxygen during
germination, and this explains why many seeds can not germinate
under water, where the access of oxygen is retarded and inadequate, or
in compact soil, where air—oxygen—is also deficient. One sort of seed
requires the hundredth of its weight in oxygen, another is quite satis-
fied with ten or twenty times less; but all need oxygen, as De Saus-
sure proved nearly a century ago.

Plants also need oxygen for their growth, and at the flowering period
they use a large amount of it, chemical operations being then so very
rapid and intense that a quite perceptible heat is given ont. During
all moments of their life, from birth to death, plants breathe. Sepa-
rate parts, such as leaves, twigs, flowers, fruits, need and use oxygen
also—they are not dead; and a nosegay in a room plays its part in
the withdrawal of oxygen as well as the person sitting at the table, the
cat sleeping near the hearth, the lamps, the fire. <A fruit or a leaf,
in any closed receiver full of air, alters the composition of the latter,
withdrawing oxygen and giving carbonic acid in its place.

In brief, without oxygen there would be no life, no animals, no
plants; the whole planet would be one desolate landscape of rocks and
sand, from which the solar heat would in vain strive to elicit the merest
blade of grass, the smallest insect.

Such being the case, some might incline toward ine opinion that life
is abundant and intense in proportion to the amount of oxygen, while,
where air is deficient, life also is wanting. Logical extremes are, how-
ever, almost invariably absurd, and the researches conducted during the
last twenty years, by Paul Bert and Pasteur especially, go to show
conclusively that both opinions are equally erroneous,

Living beings, as they are at present, are adapted to life in an atmos-
phere containing one-fourth oxygen and three-fourths nitrogen. Hxpe-
rience shows us that if the ratio of oxygen is decreased even by
one-fourth, life can no longer be maintained. The adaptation of organ-
isms to the atmosphere is thus very close, and this suggests the idea
that perhaps a change in reverse direction might also be injurious;
that an increase in the ratio of oxygen might prove harmful. Paul Bert
has thrown much light on this question, and his experiments have
amply proven a fact which at first sight seems most improbable, but
is less surprising to those who always keep in mind the faet that living
7)

beings are adapted to their environment, and that the adaptation is
often very strict. He has shown that oxygen—the vivifying gas par
excellence, that which is essential to life—is also a violent poison; a
poison for plants as well as for animals, for the cells and the whole
organism. All that is required is for oxygen to acquire a certain ten-
sion in the atmosphere or—what amounts to the same—be present in
a certain ratio above the normal, and it becomes an agent of death.
This can be demonstrated in two ways. Animals or plants may be
made to live in a normal atmosphere, but under higher pressure than
the average; or, again, they may be placed in artificial air where the
ratio of oxygen has been increased. In both cases the phenomena are
similar; in both, death is the result. While a satisfactory explanation
has not yet been proposed in the case of plants, Paul Bert has been
able to show that animals die in a superoxygenated atmosphere as
soon as their blood contains one-third more than the normal ratio of
oxygen, because, in such an atmosphere, the hemoglobin of the red
blood corpuscles is saturated with oxygen—a fact which never occurs
under normal conditions—and a proportion of this gas then dissolves
in the serum of the blood itself. The oxygen dissolved in the serum
does all the harm. ‘The tissues can not withstand the presence of free
uncombined oxygen; they are killed. This is the quo modo of the
phenomenon. The guare is yet wanting: Why do the tissues require
combined oxygen, and why does free oxygen kill them? Here is a
riddle for physiologists; it is one worth their pains and trouble.

Now, it must be said that while a certain increase in the ratio of
oxygen results in death, lesser increases of a temporary character may
be beneficial. Every poison kills, doubtless, but there are doses which
not only do not kill, but even confer benefit and improve health. This
toxicity of superabundant oxygen is undoubtedly one of the most
curious facts that recent years have brought to light, and it is a very
positive and demonstrable one.

On the other hand, to say that without free oxygen there can be no life
would be incorrect. Pasteur’s investigations have shown that if some
micro-organisms can live only where air and oxygen are present, others,
which have been termed anaerobic, much prefer an environment where
air is wanting. Such is the case with those which cause fermentation.
They induce fermentation only when in a medium devoid of oxygen,
and, as Pasteur put it, fermentation is a consequence of life without
air. What then occurs in a fermenting medium? <A particular kind
of microbe—each fermentation is due to a particular sort or species of
microbe—is conveyed, by air, by water, or is purposely introduced, into ~
that medium. During a time it lives there upon the oxygen which it
finds. At last oxygen fails; all the provision has been expended, and
diffusion has not taken place rapidly enough to meet the needs of the
micro-organism. The latter has then to shift for itself in some manner.
Free oxygen is wanting, to be sure, but nevertheless there is oxygen

168 AIR AND LIFE.

to be had—oxygen in combination with one or the other of the sub-
stances dissolved in the liquid under consideration. This the micro-
organism uses for its wants. It withdraws this oxygen and releases it
from its fetters—not for the benefit of oxygen certainly, but for its own
advantage. As this release can not be effected without releasing also
at least one and often many other constituents which were combined
with the oxygen, they also are freed, and their escape is one of the
characteristic phenomena of fermentation. Let us take an instance,
that of alcoholic fermentation. This requires water in which cane or
grape sugar is dissolved (cane juice or grape juice). The microbe
removes from the sugar a portion of its component oxygen, thus decom-
posing it into free carbonie acid and alcohol. This is one instance
among a hundred. In all the process is fundamentally the same. In
all processes of fermentation a microbe is present which, unable to
otherwise obtain its requisite supply of oxygen, takes it by decompos-
ing the surrounding substances, changing them into new compounds,
containing in part the same elements as the original but differently
united. So we see that, upon the whole, anaerobic micro-organisms,
which seem more or less to shun free oxygen and air, do really breathe
oxygen, aS other organisms are wont to do. Thus, so far as some
organisms are concerned, life is not impossible where free oxygen is
wanting; and, on the other hand, wherever life is present, some method
exists by which oxygen may be secured. While anaerobic micro-organ-
isms seem to be exceptions, they fall under the general law that living
organisms must have oxygen.

Between such anaerobic organisms and those which need free oxy-
gen many transition forms exist. It will be sufficient to recall the fact
that vegetable cells are aerobic and anaerobic simultaneously, since
they can produce alcoholic fermentation. ‘Let us place a beet root
in carbonic acid,” says Duclaux, ‘‘we shall see it produce alcohol.
Cherries, plums, apples, all fruits containing sugar, entire saccharif-
erous plants, under the same circumstances do the same. Their sugar
is in part broken up into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The only differ-
ence between these cells and those of yeast is that the former are less
suited for anaerobic life, and the fermentation which they effect is
less complete than that effected by yeast, and they stop or die before
all the sugar has been transformed. But such differences are only
differences in degree.” If we now turn to animal cells, we find that
they are also, in fact, anaerobic. Have we not seen that free oxygen
dissolved in the serum of the blood is toxic, and that it kills? That
the tissues Go not breathe pure or free oxygen, but require to have it
offered to them combined with hemoglobin? And what is this, if not
true anaerobiosis?! Hence we must draw the inference that while all

1The notion that animal cells are anaerobic was propounded by Pasteur. A.
Gautier, in 1893, took if up with some valuable arguments and experiments. These
experiments have shown that quite a number of well-known disassimilation products
AIR AND LIFE. 169

living organisms require oxygen, and must have it, a large number at
all events require to have it offered to them in a combined form. All
animals seem to prefer combined oxygen. As to plants, we are in the
dark. Certainly free oxygen enters the stomata; but is the oxygen
used as such by cells, or does it previously form some compound with
some liquid in the plant? We do not know. What we do know, how-
ever, is that on our planet and under the present laws of organization
and life where oxygen is wanting life is also wanting, and that where
oxygen is in excess of the normal ratio life is impaired and after a
time destroyed. Such is the main conclusion to be kept in mind.

We will now consider nitrogen, or azote. Thename is significant. It
means that this gas is not adequate to maintain life, for we all know
that if an animal or plant be placed in an atmosphere containing nitro-
gen only, death ensues in a very short time. It should not be inferred
that nitrogen is toxic. We inhale a large proportion of it without the
slightest inconvenience; but it is inert, and neither burns nor maintains
combustion. Its only function in respiration seems to be that of a dilu-
ent or moderator. Pure oxygen would be certain death, while, diluted
with some amount of nitrogen, it is absorbed only in the requisite pro-
portion. Nitrogen here plays the part of water added to wine—a useful
part, most certainly, since we could not do without this diluent—but a
negative one. But what more could be expected of an inert gas?

There is, however, a much more important part played by nitrogen
in the economy of nature. It is abundant in organisms. It forms a
large proportion of our frame and tissues and is most abundant in the
atmosphere. Lastly, as shown by Magendie, when animals are deprived
of tood containing nitrogen, they die. Let us start from this well-
established fact, that nitrogenous food is necessary to maintain life in
animals—in higher animals at least. This nitrogenous food is, in the
long run, provided by plants. While a few plants—lentils, for instance—
yield fruits containing a large proportion of nitrogen, the greater num-
ber furnish nitrogenous food only by undergoing the transformations
which animal digestion effects upon vegetable food—erass, hay, leaves,
etc. Some animals require nitrogen in the form of meat, while a greater
number are content with that contained in plants; but, upon the whoie,
nitrogen is always primarily provided by plants. Now, as nitrogen is
essential to all animals, how do the plants which provide it manage to
incorporate it? Where do they get it?

The soil contains some amount of nitrates, a preportion of which

it is quite certain that plants absorb, for cultivation always impov-

erishes the soul, deprives it more or less of nitrogen, as chemistry shows,
and in order to restore its fertility nitrogen must be added to it under

which are found in the blood, in the urine, etc., are produced by the cells of
the tissues after circulation has entirely ceased, when air and oxygen are no more
brought to them. ‘The inference is that animal cells are, according to circum-
stances, aerobic or anaerobic.

170 AIR AND LIFE.

the form of nitrogenous manures. But notice must be taken of the fol-
lowing facts. In the first place, forests—whose age is often very great—
goon growing, although for centuries no manure has been added to the
soil on which they grow, and the same is true of pasture land. Again,
it is a well-known fact that if soil is manured with any nitrogenous
manure, it yields more nitrogen in the crop than was given to it in the
fertilizer. These facts, ascertained by Boussingault many years ago,
suggested the idea that atmospheric nitrogen might play some part in
the nutrition of plants, and that in some way or other they might borrow
nitrogen from the atmosphere which contains such an amount of this
substance.

To be sure, the atmosphere contains some ammonia (nitrogen and
hydrogen combined), but the amount is very small. Mayer, of Heidel-
berg, while cultivating in the open air plants whose roots were immersed
in nutrient solutions from which nitrogenous compounds were excluded,
and protecting them against rain so as to exclude the influence of such
nitrogenous compounds as exist in rain water, obtained a crop contain-
ing exactly the same amount of nitrogen as the seeds from which the
plants grew—not a milligram more. This shows that the amount of
ammonia, or other nitrogenous compounds, which may be borrowed
from the atmosphere by plants in a direct manner is quite insignificant.
But while plants may obtain very little or nothing from the atmosphere
by direct process, the case is entirely altered when indirect processes
are allowed to operate. Under such circumstances atmospheric ammonia
when combined with the elements of the soil, plays an important part,
as shown by Berthelot. Instead of remaining useless, as when con-
tained in the atmosphere, it then becomes useful, and is utilized by
plants. This process by which atmospheric ammonia combines with
soil elements is not a Spontaneous one such as that by which hydrogen,
burning in oxygen forms water—there is no unavoidable chemical reae-
tion—it is effected by the agency of definite micro-organisms. Whilea
specimen of soil left to itself under normal circumstances acquires more
nitrogen, the same specimen remains unaltered (neither loses nor
acquires nitrogen) when it has been previously sterilized by subjecting
it to a heat above 105° or 110° C., by which all micro-organisms are
killed. Again, M. Schloesing and Muntz have shown that it is by dif-
ferent micro-organisms that the nitrogen contained in nitrogenous
organic matters of arable land is made to combine with other matters,
and to form nitrates. One generates ammonia; another transforms
ammonia into nitrous acid, which forms nitrates by combining with
basic elements, and lastly a third micro-organism transforms the nitrites
into nitrates; aud this triple process is what is called nitrification—an
operation fully investigated by Munro, Winogradsky, and Frankland.

Thus, by one means or another, atmospheric ammonia may be put
within reach of plants and be used by them. But ammonia is however
a very small proportion of the nitrogenous contents of the atmosphere.
AIR AND LIFE. 171

Is there no other supply, and especially, is there no method by which
pure atmospheric nitrogen may be also utilized by plants? In view of
the considerable amount of nitrogen contained in atmosphere, the mat-
ter is one of great importance to plants.

The question has been answered by Hellriegel.t After twenty-five
years’ investigation, the learned director of the agricultural station of
Bemberg has finally proved conclusively that certain plants at least
have the power of assimilating atmospheric nitrogen. These plants
belong to the leguminous family. While cereals, for instance, need to
be provided with nitrogen under the form of nitrogenous compounds
mingled with the soil, or under the form of nitrates or ammonia Salts,
lupines, pease, clover and such plants do very well without such com-
pounds. And yet they contain nitrogen; moreover, agriculturists know
that they not only do not require nitrogenous manure, but that after
they have been grown on a soil they contain more nitrogen than the
soil could possibly have furnished; hence the name of ‘bettering
plants.” If they are buried in the soil, they not only restore the
amount of nitrogen which they may have derived from it, they add to
it an excess which they have obtained elsewhere; that is to say, from
the atmosphere. Plants grown im a soil totally deficient in nitrogen
contain much more of it than the seeds from which they spring—pro-
vided, however, one condition is fulfilled. This condition is that the
roots possess certain peculiar outgrowths or small tumors—nodules, as
they are commonly called—in which a special sort of bacteria is found.
If the bacteria are wanting, the plant does not grow well; it remains
puny and deficient in nitrogen, but if watered with water to which has
been added a culture of the requisite species of bacteria it becomes
thrifty and yields an amount of nitrogen amounting to a hundredfold
the weight contained in the seed.

It seems that in different species of leguminous plants the active
and important species of bacteria are different. That which is adapted
to acacia, for instance, although it does not suit pease, works well
with beans, and vice versa. Are we to draw the inference that each
species of this family has its own special bacterium? Nobbe is not of
this opinion; he thinks there is only one species, which he calls Bac-
terium radicola; but that within this species a number of races or
varieties has been evolved, each one specially adapted to a sort of
communalism with a particular species of plant. For instance, if one
individual of this bacterium lives in the nodosities of one particular
plant, its progeny becomes specially adapted to life on the same species,
and does not thrive on another species. Such is Nobbe’s view briefly
summarized, and it would explain many curious facts noticed by

Wermann Hellriegel, born 1831, died September, 1895. This important work was
accomplished with the cooperation of Mr. Wilfarth, and was made known in 1886 at ©
the Naturforscher-Versammlung in Berlin. Varro and the old Roman farmers had
noticed that beans, Inpines, and vetches render the soil more fruitful, but Hellriegel
and Wilfarth discovered the reason.

agriculturists and horticulturists concerning sympathies and antipa-
thies between plants, and like matters.

The quantity of nitrogen which leguminous plants can obtain from
the atmosphere by means of the bacteria which live on their roots may
be very considerable; it may amount to 100 or 150 kilograms per hee-
tare (24 acres). Hence, it is an exceilent plan with soils deficient in
nitrogen to grow and turn under leguminous plants. It follows also
that if a given soil seems unfit for the culture of a particular legumin-
ous plant, this may be because it does not contain the necessary bac-
teria, and under such circumstances all that is required is to inoculate
it. A culture is not required; it is enough to sprinkle some earth
taken from a field in which leguminous plants of the same species have
grown and thriven. The bacteria abound in that earth, and at once
multiply in the field. This is no matter of mere laboratory experiment;
the process has been tested on a large scale at Meppen in Germany,
by M. Salfeld, with the best results, the crop having been then doubled
and trebled.

This inoculation may be performed in another manner. M. Bréal,
of the Paris Museum of Natural History, grows two lupines in sepa-
rate pots, filled with sterilized earth. He inoculates the roots of the
one with a needle dipped previously in a culture of the appropriate
bacterium, while the other is not inoculated. The result is that the.
former thrives, while the latter remains puny and perishes.

Besides, Schloesing and Laurent have shown that if different legu-
minous plants are cultivated in a confined atmosphere the amount of
nitrogen in the air decreases.

The general result of the very important labors of Hellriegel and
Wilfarth, of Nobbe, of Sir John Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert is, then,
the discovery that different plants of the leguminous family—belonging
in particular to the papilionaceous division—are endowed with a very
special mode of nutrition, quit» different from that of other phanero-
gams. Bv means of the cooperation of a few micro-organisms which
dwell in and on their roots, they are enabled to draw free nitrogen from
the air; not ammonia, nor any other form of combined nitrogen, but free
nitrogen, which is used as anutriment. And thusit happens that that
enormous quantity of nitrogen which goes to make a large propor-
tion of the atmosphere, instead of being useless as it seemed at first,
is of very great importance to plant life. The probabilities are that it
is even greater than it now appears. We feel it difficult to conceive
that only a small proportion of plants are able to avail themselves of
this souree of nitrogen, and physiology teaches us that so far as the
principal functions of life are concerned there reigns great similitude
in the processes by which they are effected. That papilionaceous
plants only, of the whole host of the vegetable world, should be able
to acquire nitrogen in the manner described seems unlikely, and thence
the opinion that a similar process and a similar function must obtain

among other families of plants. This is but an hypothesis, however,
and no definite statement can yet be made concerning this attempted
generalization. Some facts, indeed, go against it, and show that cer-
tainly not all plants have the functions which we have noted in the
papilionaceous family. Messrs. Schloesing and Laurent infer from
experiment that some species at least are unable to make use of
atmospheric nitrogen, and require to have it provided to them under
the form of different compounds contained in the fragments and débris
of other plants, which thus play the part of manure and food. While
the lion and tiger eat-the sheep and deer, some plants eat, so to say,
their congeners, and exhibit a form of cannibalism. The latter obtain
nitrogen from the atmosphere, and after death their remains serve as
food for other plants. Such is the case with mosses and many crypto-
gams. So, observe the gradation: Inferior plants! draw nitrogen from
the atmosphere; superior plants feed upon the remains of the lower;?
and, lastly, animals feed on other animals or plants. Man eats both
animals and plants, and crowns the edifice of life, as he supposes; but

the solid substructure upon which all the building rests is merely an

agglomeration of humble unnoticed forms, often invisible to the naked
eye, whose functions are to provide the animal and vegetable king.
doms with an essential part of their food. Whether there is here a
plan is not for me to decide, but most assuredly the connections and
interactions are of interest.

This exposition may seem somewhat long, but it was necessary. It
shows that certain plants, at least, can either directly or indirectly fix
atmospheric nitrogen without having recourse to the nitrates of nitrog-
enous manures. Here again it is shown that air is indispensable to
life. <A gas that at first seems inert and useless is found, after careful
investigation, to play a most important part in the nutrition of living
organisms. Without nitrogen there would be no plants, no food,
no animals, no mankind, in brief, no life at all. And if atmospheric
nitrogen were to disappear, life would soon be extinguished. Who,
then, will consider this element of the air as useless?

We now come to carbonic acid.

We all know that it is an essentially noxious compound, and doubt-
less there is little in its history to redeem its reputation. One-half of
our respiratory function is concerned especially with the task of ridding

1And some superior plants also, such as those of the papilionaceous group; but
even with them the process is indirect, as it is through very low organisms (bacteria)
that nitrogen is brought to them.

*When Melchior Treub visited Krakatoa after the disaster of 1884, in order to
investigate the floral repopulation of the island—seeds being brought by currents
and winds from the surrounding parts in abundance—he noted that the first plants
to appear were algw and lichens. And it was only some time after the latter had
taken a foothold, and, so to say, prepared a suitable soil, that higher plants were seen,
and lastly phanerogams. This progression is quite in accordance with physiological
facts.

174 AIR AND LIFE. ji

our body of this substance, which is unceasingly generated in our
tissues. It is not fit for breathing purposes, and all animals aid plants
perish in a confined atmosphere when the proportion of this gas rises
above a very limited ratio. An atmosphere which contains one per cent
carbon dioxide has evil effects upon most organisms, and when the
ratio is ten per cent, life isendangered and death only a matter of time.
Carbonic acid is of no use at all to the tissues, and when we breathe
in an atmosphere where this gas is abundant, the blood corpuscles are
not able, in the lungs, to get rid of the carbon dioxide they have col-
lected in the body; so they keep it, and, keeping it, they can not take
with them the amount of oxygen necessary for the cells and tissues.
it may be asked why tiey keep the former. The reason is that gas
exchanges between the blood and the atmosphere depend upon the
amount or tension of the gas in both media. As soon as the tension of
carbonic acid in the atmosphere is greater than that of the same gas
in the blood, the blood corpuscles retain their carbonic acid. If the
amount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere is increased, its tension
becomes at some point superior to that of the same gas in the blood
corpuscles. These, then, retain the noxious gas which takes the place
which should be abandoned to oxygen. The result is death by
asphyxia. Before death supervenes a condition of anzthesia is induced,
which Bichat specially investigated by means of an ingenious experi-
ment, through which the venous blood—well provided with carbonie
acid, of course—of one animal was made to pass into the carotid and cer-
ebral arteries of another, so that the latter had its brain irrigated with
asphyxie blood, and was brought to a condition of anesthesia. Even
when applied locally to the surface of the skin, carbon dioxide induces
a state of local and temporary insensibility, a fact which seems to have
been long known and frequently utilized. Pliny relates in his Natural
History that marble (carbonate of lime), when mixed with vinegar and
placed upon the skin, puts the latter to sleep, i. e., renders it insensible,
so that it may be cut and burned without inducing pain. In this case
the anesthetic agent is carbon dioxide, which is set free by the action
of the acetic acid of the vinegar upon the carbonate of lime.

When carbon dioxide acts upon the entire organism, aS when it is
inhaled by the lungs, it induces general anesthesia. This has been
investigated by a number of physiologists, and one among them, M.
Ozanam, has found it so satisfactory that he feels no hesitation in
commending it as a substitute for ether or chloroform. His advice has
never, tomy knowledge, been followed by surgeons or physiologists,
and some doubt may be expressed as to the expediency of using for
surgical or other purposes so dangerous an agent. Some cases are
known in which man has been deeply under the influence of carbon
dioxide without fatal results. In such circumstances, anesthesia has
been complete. The patients relate, at least some of them, that before
becoming unconscious there occurs a delightful condition during which
AIR AND LIFE. 175

they seem to be surrounded by a host of very brilliant lights, while
exquisite music is played by some invisible orchestra. But this state
is of short duration, and total unconsciousness soon occurs, which, if
the toxic gas keeps on accumulating in the blood, is rapidly converted
into eternal sleep. Cases of death by carbonic acid are not infrequent;
they are met with particularly in the vicinity of fermenting liquids,
such as brewers’ vats or wine cellars; in places where carbon dioxide is
naturally exhaled by “gas springs;” by thermal springs in some caves
or grottoes, and in all ill-ventilated rooms where a proportionately large
number of men or animals are gathered. In lecture and assembly
rooms, which are often crowded, air vitiates rapidly; in theaters, in
schools, in lecture halls, as much as 10 parts per thousand of carbonie
acid has been observed, and in Alpine stables, as before referred to,
where animals and men were crowded together, each seeking some
warmth in the close vicinity of his neighbor, the ratio of 21 parts per
thousand has been recorded.t. Such atmosphere is toxic,’ and proofs
thereof are not wanting.

IM. G. H. Richards, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has, during
nine years past, made some 5,000 analyses of the air of lecture rooms. ‘The nor-
mal average proportion of carbonic acid in external-air is between 3.7 and 4.2 per
10,000. In buildings, the proportion increases according to circumstances. For
instance, in empty rooms it is higher by 0.5 on the average in consequence of the
decomposition of organic.matter, which always remains after the passage of any
number of human beings, in the cracks of the floor, on the walls, ete. In the parts
of the building where people come and go, without stopping for any considerable
time, the ratio is a little higher, and becomes 5 per 10,000. In lecture rooms things
are at the worst, as might be expected, and the ratio is 6 or 8 and occasionally 10
or 12 volumes of carbonic acid per 10,000 of air. If such proportions are exceeded,
work becomes difficult and unprofitable. Each adult exhales, on an average, accord-
ing to Andral and Gavarret, some 22 liters of carbon dioxide per hour, so that a
man breathing in a confined space 3 meters long, 2 meters high, and 2 meters wide
would in twenty-four hours transform the whole of the air of this space into an
air having exactly the composition of that exhaled from the lungs. It must not
be forgotten that each gaslight, on an average, produces 128 liters of carbon dioxide
per hour, and 10 grams of candle produce 14 liters. Under such circumstances no
one can wonder that the atmosphere becomes so soon vitiated in rooms where any
considerable number of persons are assembled.

“It is toxic in its natural condition, by which is meant, if oxygen is present in it
only in the usual proportion. But, experimentally, such atmosphere may be pre-
vented from becoming dangerous if its composition is altered by an addition of
oxygen. Regnault and Reiset have seen dogs and rabbits live in an atmosphere con-
taining 25 per cent carbon dioxide, 30 to 40 per cent oxygen, and about 40 per cent
nitrogen. Kven without increasing the ratio of oxygen, animals may live a short
time in an atmosphere containing a Jarge proportion of carbon dioxide—30 per cent,
for instance, oxygen being 16 per cent (Le Blanc); and Snow has seen birds withstand
some time the effects of an atmosphere containing 21 per cent oxygen, 59 nitrogen
and 20 carbonic acid. But these experiments can not have any considerable dura-
tion, and the average limit of respirable atmosphere is set by the composition of
expired air. An atmosphere containing 4 per cent carbon dioxide, 16 per cent
oxygen, and 80 per cent nitrogen is inadequate to long maintain life. A lamp is
soon extinguished in such an atmosphere, but man may live in it for a short time.

To avoid any danger of the vitiation of air, hygienists are agreed that more is
176 AIR AND LIFE.

For instance, during the wars in India, 146 prisoners were one even-
ing at 8 o’clock shut up in a small room. Out of the number only 50
were still living at 2 o’clock next morning, and at daybreak only 23, all
dying. Again, after the battle of Austerlitz, out of 300 prisoners con-
fined in an ill-ventilated cellar, 260 died in a few hours through
asphyxia, induced by an excessive proportion of carbon dioxide. And
at the celebrated Oxford assizes (the ‘‘ fatal” or “black” assizes in 1557),
the high sheriff and 300 other persons died suddenly in court from
asphyxia induced by the same means. It may be that in these cases
some other influence was also at work, and that some exhaled substance
similar to that which Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval thought they had
detected, added its influence to that of carbonic acid; but the existence
of this substance has not yet been proved, although it seems probable.

Other cases of poisoning by carbonic acid are met with in natural con-
ditions. Men and animals are occasionally killed by such gas, exhaled
by neighboring springs and accumulated in hollows or small valleys.
Such ‘‘death valleys” have been described by many travelers. No
plant is seen, not a blade of grass, not a shrub or tree. The soil is
bare, stony, and as if struck with death. Here and there a skeleton is
perceived bleaching in the sun—a skeleton of bird, mammal, or even
man. Ignorant of the fatal properties of the valley, animals or men

required than the 16 to 20 cubic meters of air per individual per hour, that was
formerly considered as sufficient. In the best ventilated hospitals of Paris 100 cubic
meters are provided, but under normal conditions 60 are quite enough for persons in
good health. As arule, the atmosphere of a room may be considered as vitiated as
soon as it begins to smell close. When this happens. however, it must not be con-
sidered as due to the smell of carbonic acid itself, which is scentless. The smell of
close air is due to organic substances—hitherto undefined, or only partly known—
which are exhaled by men and animals, and probably more by the skin and its
impurities than by the lungs themselves, and generally the amount of these sub-
stances is considered as roughly proportional to the amount of carbon dioxide met
inthe air. Smell is considered as indicating approximately the unhealthiness of the
atmosphere as regards respiratory purposes, and is a safe enough criterion. When
a room becomes close, it should be thoroughly ventilated, and in such case a draft
should always be established, two doors or windows, on different sides of the room,
being opened. One is not enough; both are required in order to completely expel
the close air and replace it by pure. Generally servants—and masters as well—are
content with imperfect ventilation. Such is especially the case in winter, when air
is often vitiated by the presence of a gas, carbon monoxide, which is given off in very
small quantities by different heating apparatus, stoves especially. Although this gas
is never present in any great quantity, it is a source of considerable danger; and in
countries where slow-combustion stoves are used, it is each year the cause of many
deaths, Carbon monoxide has even greater affinities for hemoglobin than has oxygen,
it therefore combines with it and thus there 1s no place left in the blood corpuscles for
oxygen, and the blood then carries no more of the latter gas to the cells and tissues
of the body. ‘This gas is also found in the air of mines, but in the open air is not
met with, or exists in such small quantities that it can not be detected by present
methods.

have wandered there while in pursuit of food, and in the lower part,
where the influence of wind is the least and where the heavy gas nat-
urally accumulates, asphyxia rapidly ensues. None who enter come
ont alive, and the bird of prey soaring in the heights, whose keen eye
perceives the victim in the death struggle, and who pounces down
upon this welcome opportunity, is vanquished in turn and rises no
more.

Fatal to animals as well as plants, expeiled by both from the organ-
ism as soon as it is produced, carbonic acid appears to all under the
feature of a death-dealing agent, as a gas whose toxicity is unquestion-
able. The only word that can be said in its behalf is that at the

moment of death it may act a kindly part. Death in the majority of
cases, aS a consequence of disease, is induced by asphyxia. During
the death struggle respiration fails gradually, becomes slower and more
superficial, with the inevitable result that carbonic acid accumulates
in the blood, It is probable that when man is about to fall into his
last slumber, when the body is on the point of entering that final stage
of dissolution and disintegration which we call death, carbonic acid
intervenes and plays its part, slowly drawing the curtain, gently put-
ting intelligence to sleep, rendering it unconscious, deaf to sound,
insensible to pain, and by beneficial and kind anesthesia easing the
final act of physical life. This may well be so, and this gas which
some physiologists consider one of the agents by which each of us is
brought into the world by stimulating the contractions of the mater-
nal womb, thus also assists us out of it.

This function, however, is not the only beneficial one which carbonie
acid fulfills, and concerning that very unwholesome and toxie constitu-
ent of the atmosphere much remains to be said. The unfavorable fea-
tures have been put in full light; it is but fair to do the same for the
redeeming traits, and this shali proceed to do.

All animals directly or indirectly feed upon plants, and plants draw
from the soil the greater part of their mineral constituents. Nitrogen
and oxygen they borrow from the atmosphere. But what about ear-

' bon? The matter is important, as their frame and tissues contain a
large quantity of this substance. Two sources are available. Carbonic
_ acid—carbon combined with oxygen—is present in the soil, where it is
to be found combined with different substances in the form of carbon-
- ates, and in humus, the superficial layer of the soil, made up of frag-
ments of leaves, of branches, of roots dead and decomposed, of mosses,
dead ferns, etc. But we can not take into account the carbon which
' exists in humus, as the first plants which appeared could not have made
use of it. There remain the carbonates of the soil, and it would seem
~to follow that this must be where plants obtain the larger amount of
the carbon they use, as Mathieu de Dombasie and many other agricul-
turists after him supposed. A number of experiments by Sprengel,
Seem 9512

178 AIR AND LIFE.

De Saussure and others, have shown, however, that the part played by
carbonates is less important than was thought, and more recently Liebig
has established the fact that plants grow and thrive quite well in a soil
whence all carbonates have been expelled. Where then do they get
their carbon? We know now that they take it from the atmosphere.
It is their privilege to decompose the carbonic acid contained in air
and to liberate its elements; that is, oxygen which is exhaled and carbon
which is retained in their tissues. And the cultivated area of France—
some 41,000,000 hectares—absorbs by this means some 60,000,000 tons
of carbon each year. This important operation can, however, be per-
formed only under three conditions. As only green parts are capable
of taking carbon from the air, the plant must be provided with chloro-
phyll—that green substance, which is the cause of the color of leaves, and
must be exposed to the rays of the sun and to a favorable temperature,
Chlorophyll can decompose carbonic acid only under the influence of
light and moderate heat; in darkness and under too great or too low
heat it no longer acts, and the result is that plants suffer and die,
victims of inanition. For it must be clearly understood that the chloro-
phyllian function is one of nutrition, quite distinct from the respiratory
function. In the latter function plants, like animals, absorb oxygen
and exhale carbonic acid; in the former the reverse obtains. The one
goes on during night and day, the other is in operation by daytime only,
and the function of nutrition lasting less time must necessarily be more
active than the respiratory process; otherwise the equilibrium would
be destroyed and the plant would lose more than it acquires and con-
sequently suffer.

Itis by the leaves mainly, and by the roots in a lesser degree, that
atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed; but in both cases the gas must
be brought to the leaves, to the parts containing chlorophyll, because
these parts only can use it—can take the carbon and expel the oxygen.

Hence it follows that this violent poison, this gas which is harmful
for aJl organisms, and which kills them as soon as it accumulates in
the atmosphere even in small proportions, is essential to all terrestrial
life. If it were to be destroyed, if air were to contain no more of
it, all plants on the surface of the earth would die within a short
period—some weeks at most. After this, as a matter of course, herbiv-
orous animals would die, and this would not require more than a month.
Carnivorous animals would hold out a little longer, as the stronger
would feed upon the weak, but after a few weeks they also would
go in turn, and only a few miserable, half-starved specimens of mankind
would be seen feebly struggling from one rotting carcass to another,
amidst as barren scenery as can be observed by looking at the moon
through a telescope, and they, too, would have to die soon after, notwith-
standing cannibalism or such other extreme methods which dire neces-
sity might suggest. In afew months all nature would be dead.

While carbonic acid is a poison, a substance which endangers life
AIR AND LIFE. 179

ereatly, it is also a necessity for life, and in the proportions in which it
exists in the atmosphere it is just as much a necessity as it would
become a fatal danger if it were to be present in larger quantity.

Such are the relations between air considered from the chemical
standpoint and life as it exists on earth; between air in its normal,
unvitiated, average constitution and life as it manifests itselfunder the
present circumstances.

IV.— BIOLOGICAL INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE CONSIDERED
FROM THE PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW.

We must now discuss another side of this complex question, we must
deal with air considered as a physical substance, and especially as a
substance having weight which presses upon all living organisms. ‘This
point of view is not less important than the preceding, and deserves
some attention, by reason of the relations which exist between life and
atmospheric pressure.

The atmosphere, as previously noticed, being a physical substance,
possesses weight, and exerts a pressure upon the earth and all beings
that inhabit it.’

As long aS men or animals keep near sea level, or do not climb to
exceedingly high altitudes, the normal average variations of pressure,
as indicated by the barometer, are of small influence, and the much
more considerable variations which are encountered when one ascends
mountains or goes up in a balloon are not harmful as long as they do

1The average pressure of the atmosphere varies, as before stated, according to the
altitude of the locality, and also in the same locality at different times. At the sea
level this average pressure amounts to a little over a kilogram per square centi-
meter, hence the total weight supported by an average man is about 18,000 kilograms.
At Mexico the average weight per square centimeter goes down to 793 grams; at
Quito, to 752; at Antisana, to 639; and it is no difficult matter to obtain the figure
which represents the weight supported by man in such localities, when one knows
that the skin surface of an average adult is somewhere between 1,400 and 1,500
square centimeters. The physicist Haiiy, explaining and commenting upon the cal-
culations by means of which the average pressure exerted upon the body is ascer-
tained, remarks: ‘‘And thatis the weight which those philosophers of old had to
bear and resist who denied weight to the atmosphere.”

This weight or pressure is considerable, but we do not feel it, as all the interior
parts of our body exert the saine pressure and therefore resist successfully that from
the outside. It does not crush us any more than it crushes the soap bubbles, how-
ever thin they may be, because in both cases the resistance of internal air or tissues
exactly counteracts that of external air. There are very few places in the body
where the pressure from within outward does not exactly counteract the opposite
pressure, in order to leave all movements perfectly free. Two exceptions, however,
must be referred to—that of the pleure, between which no counter pressure exists, so
that they are compelled by atmospheric pressure to keep strictly in contact, and that
of certain articulations, where the head of a bone so exactly fits into a correspond-
ing cavity that there is place for no air between, with the result that the atmospheric
pressure forces the former into the latter and keeps it there with sufficient force to
resist the counteracting weight of the limb.

not exceed certain limits. But beyond these limits danger exists for
both animals and man, and while the effects are not exactly the same
for all species, arid do not occur at exactly the same altitude with all
species, or even individuals of the same species, the general fact remains
that at high altitudes, or under very low pressures, life is more or less
endangered from different causes. In order to ascertain these causes
it is not convenient to take men or animals into high altitudes, as the
experimenter would be apt to be also influenced by the diminution of
pressure, li consequence of which the value of his observations might
be considerably reduced. A better method, easily available, is that
used in laboratories, of providing large or small air-proof chambers in
which the pressure may be increased or diminished at will, so that,
without going out of the laboratory, the same patient or animal may
be subjected by turn to the pressure which reigns at the bottom of the
deepest mine, or even to far higher pressure, amounting to 800 or 1,000
atmospheres, and to that met on the top of the highest peak of the
Himalayas, or at twice or three times that height in the lightest of
balloons. With such instruments observation becomes easy, and is
effected under the most favorable circumstances, as the operator is able
to obtain at a few moments’ notice exactly the amount of pressure he
wishes to have.

The influence of those extreme pressures, high or low, where life

becomes endangered, was very fully investigated by Jourdanet, and
afterwards by Paul Bert, and those investigations have taught us by
what means they become dangerous. The limits of pressure within
which no harm occurs are variable according to species. AI terres-
trial and aquatic animals may and do resist certain variations in pres-
sure, whether above or below the average. Man, for instance, can
work at a kilometer below the sea level without any injury, and he can
travel to the height of 5 or 6 kilometers in the atmosphere without being
necessarily affected by the decrease of pressure. It is the same with
birds and mammals, and surface or shore fishes may go pretty deep in
the seas without experiencing any unpleasant effects, while deep-sea
fish may travel upward for some time before reaching the danger line,
so to speak. But for all organisms there are limits in the variation of
pressure which can not be transgressed with impunity; there are limits
_ beyond which life is destroyed.

How is death induced in such cases? We must consider the two
different cases in turn, and shall begin with the effects of diminished
pressure. 5

Four hundred years have now elapsed since a Jesuit missionary,
Acosta, left us an excellent description of the accidents which attend
ascensions in high mountains, or important diminution of pressure.
“While ascending a mountain in Peru,” writes Acosta, “I was sud-
denly affected by so strange and so mortal an evil that I nearly dropped
from my horse to the ground. * * * JI wasalone with an Indian, and
AIR AND LIFE. 181

asked him to help me to keep on my animal, and I was taken with such

pain, sobbing, and vomiting, that I thought I should die, and, moreover

after having vomited food, phlegm (mucous matter), and bile, yellow

first and afterwards green, | even threw up blood, such pains had I in
my stomach; and I am sure that if it had lasted longer I would cer-
tainly have died. As it was it lasted only three or four hours, till we
had reached a much lower region. And not only men, but animals also
were affected.” And further on, ‘‘I feel confident that the substance of
the air in such places is so subtle and thin that itis unsuitable for human
respiration, which requires it thicker and better adapted.” This was
written three hundred years before the time of Priestley and Lavoisier,
and yet the expressions used by Acosta are really most happy. Atmos-
pheric air in the altitudes is too thin, too rarefied, too subtle for the
respiration of superior organisms. The evil described by Acosta is
that which, in different. countries and places, is named puta, soroche,
eta, mal des montagnes, mountain sickness, balloon sickness. It has been
more recently and fully described and investigated by Tschudi, Lortet,
and many others; each has noticed the vertigo, vomiting, anxiety, and
fainting which characterize it; and exact experiments—those of Lortet
and Chauveau, among others—have shown that respiration is dimin-
ished and at the same time accelerated; intense muscular pains have
been noticed, and also circulatory and nervous symptoms, which end
in paralysis and death if the perturbations continue, as in case of the
Zenith catastrophe.

While it would be quite superfluous for our present purpose to re-
view the opinions which have at different times been entertained con-
cerning the cause of these dangerous perturbations, we may briefly
summarize the explanation thereof recently given by Paul Bert and
others. — :

This is quite simple. The symptoms and death are due to a diminu-
tion in the tension of oxygen, which is itself due to the rarefaction of
that gas. As everyone will understand, if the same volume contains
in high altitudes less weight of air than in low altitudes or at the sea
level, it follows that in the former condition there is less air avail-

© able, less of each constituent, less oxygen. In the heights of the
' atmosphere air is made up of the same elements as below, but they are
less in quantity although the proportions are the same; air is dilated,
: rarened, thinner, less dense, and of the essential element—oxygen—
a smaller quantity is inhaled at each respiratory movement, although
the volume of inspired air is the same. Under such circumstances, as
' Paul Bert’s investigations go to show, decrease of pressure kills, not
- mechanically, but by a chemical process. High altitudes ‘kill because
4 they induce a state of anoxyhemia, a state in which the blood is
_ deficient in oxygen.. The animal—or man—in rarefied air, dies for the
same reason that one dies in a confined atmosphere; in both cases
_ there is an insufficiency of oxygen.

182 AIR AND LIFE.

Another cause also operates, in the case of fishes or other aquati¢e
animals that live at great depths, when they happen to rise too near
the surface, thus coming from high to low pressure. The gases of the
body, dissolved in the liquids (blood, etc.), have a higher tension than
the outside pressure, and the result is that these gases expand and
burst the tissues within which they are contained when the exterior
pressure becomes less than that which reigns in the interior. The case
is exactly that of a bladder inflated with air placed in the receiver of
an air pump; if the air of the cylinder is gradually exhausted, the blad-
der swells until it explodes. This is an extreme case, which hardly
occurs under natural conditions, but other accidents of a similar
nature, which are explained by the same mechanism, often do occur
in man or animals, as we shall show further on.

We can not leave this subject without adding a few words concern-
ing mountain sickness. It is a well-known fact that at the same alti-
tude different aeronauts or tourists are not equally affected. Of course
this statement refers only to moderate altitudes, between 3,000 and
4,000 meters. At the very same place, on the same day, one person is
a victim to mountain sickness and another is not. As only individuals
of the same species are compared, the reason of the difference can only
lie in personal or individual peculiarities; no specific physiological
differences can exist such as those met with when one compares the
influence of one and the same agency or poison, etc., upon individuals
of different species; there is no evident and tangible cause such as
that which one detects when comparing the resistance of the duck and
of the common fowl to submersion, when the greater resistance of the
former is due to its greater amount of blood, and consequently more
- considerable provision of oxygen. There are doubtless physiological
differences of real importance between different individuals belonging
to the same species, and between different varieties of the same spe-
cies; considered in toto those differences are more important and more
frequent than commonly supposed, and probably more important than
those external morphological characters which are the bases of classi-
fication at present. But such important differences can not obtain
between two individuals belonging to the same species, and the fact
that they may occur one day and be wanting a week later, shows that
they are merely accidental and temporary.

Mountain sickness is due to a condition of asphyxia, as already
noticed, and this fact explains the differences referred to, as an ingen-
ious experiment performed by M. Paul Regnard amply shows. ‘This
experiment was suggested by the proposal, made by a company, to
build a lift by which to reach the top of the Jungfrau, the well-known
Alpine peak. Before setting to work,.it was desirable to ascertain
whether the passage from low to high altitude would not produce
unpleasant symptoms in the tourists using the lift,’ and to show that

1The lift was to bo established in vertical shafts from a horizontal tunnel at the
base oy the mountain to the top.
AIR AND LIFE. 183

under the circumstances attending the excursion, mountain sickness
was not to be feared. M. Regnard’s experiment answers this question.
As far as physiologists are concerned, the question was settled, but the
general public required to be satisfied upon this point. The experi-
ment is easily repeated in any laboratory, and it is quite unnecessary
to ascend Mont Blanc or the Himalayas for the purpose. All that is
required is a glass bell jar, an exhausting pump, and a pair of guinea
pigs. The bell jar must be rather wide, and it is placed—inverted—
upon a smooth and even surface, such as that which can be afforded by
a thick pane of glass.

The edge of the jar is smeared with tallow, so that when placed upon
the pane the access of air is entirely prevented. Under it are the two
guinea pigs. One is free and does as he chooses; the other 1s placed
in a small treadmill where he is compelled to exert himself somewhat
in order to preserve lus equilibrium, as the treadmill is made to turn
round by meaus of electricity. The two animals represent, the first,
an aeronaut, or a person quietly sitting in a lift where no exertion is
required; the other, a mountain climber, who has to expend energy,
and to work if he wants to get to the top; and now both must be
placed in acondition similar to those which obtain in high altitudes. A
few strokes of the air pump connected with the bell are enough to bring
the pressure to correspond exactly with that which exists at 2,000, at
3,000, at 4,000 meters height, and a manometer shows the pressure pro-
duced. So this experiment begins, and the atmosphere within the bell
is slowly rarefied, as would happen in the case of a slowly ascending
hift or mountain climber, and because, also, rapid decrease of pressure
would be most dangerous. Up to the decrease of pressure which cor-
responds to a 3,000 meters altitude both animals remain quite well,
the one who works his way up, So to say, as well as the other who
keeps quiet or only walks a few paces to the right or left. The process
is continued and the rarefaction increased. Before the pressure corre-
sponding to 4,000 meters altitude 1s attained, however, the “ working”
guinea pig manifests evidence of physiological discontent. Now and
then he stumbles, and does not exactly keep pace with the treadmill;
he even rolls over and is clearly out of breath. When the manometer
shows the pressure to be that which corresponds to a 4,600 meters alti-
tude (210 meters less than the altitude of Mont Blanc), this guinea pig
is entirely disabled. Hecan walk no more; rolls on his back, and is
rolled by the treadmill; he moves no longer. In fact, he seems quite
dead. Life is not extinct, though, and the animal moves when air is
again let into the jar. The other animal is in an excellent state of
health. At no moment has he presented the slightest symptoms; he
nibbles at cabbage, and seems quite unconcerned with the experiment.
It does not affect him in the least.

It may then be considered as settled that the quantity and quality of
the air contained in the jar are quite sufficient; that they are adequate
184 AIR AND LIFE.

to maintain life. And if one of the guinea pigs exhibits symptoms —
of asphyxia, these are not ascribable to the nature of the atmosphere.
If the experiment is pursued and air further rarefied, it is not until
the decrease of pressure corresponds to that which obtains at the top
of some peaks of the Himalayas (8,000 meters, the altitude attained
by Glaisher, but in a state of unconsciousness) that the hitherto
unaffected guinea pig shows symptoms of asphyxia. Such symptoms
were certain to occur, since the quantity of air was decreasing all the
time and must at some moment become insufficient. And now the
experiment has proceeded far enough, as there is no necessity at all for
killing the animals, and death must surely be the result if the experi-
ment is allowed to continue; air is now let in slowly. Both animals
recover entirely, the latter in shorter time than the former.

Now, what does the experiment show? It shows that in itself alti-
tude or the decrease of pressure corresponding to altitude within the
limits of 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 meters or even more (under 8,000 meters)
is not sufficient to induce asphyxia and the symptoms of mountain
sickness. The proof thereof lies in the fact that the inactive guinea
pig exhibited no asphyxic symptoms at such altitudes. At 8,600 meters
these made their appearance. They were unavoidable. They might
have begun a little earlier, they might begin a little later—that is, at
rather lower or rather higher pressure—according to the species and
individual; but it is certain that for all organisms there is a limit in the
heights of the atmosphere above which air is too rare and tenuous to
maintain life, and asphyxia must ensue. This first fact, however, was
already known, and M. P. Regnard’s experiment proves nothing new in
that line. Whatit shows is that muscular effort hastens the produc-
tion of asphyxia or mountain sickness, and of this the active guinea
pig provides an excellent demonstration. Now, muscular effort hastens
asphyxia or mountain sickness because it is itself a cause of relative
asphyxia. The organism that works and expends energy uses more
oxygen, and therefore needs more than that which keeps quiet. The
panting which follows running, or is the consequence of rapid mus-
cular work with the arms, legs, or whole body, of violent exercise,
proves that the body requires more oxygen, and if the expired gases
are analyzed it is Shown that carbonic acid exhalation is increased, and
it is clear, therefore, that more oxygen is required, since the oxygen ~
contained in carbonie acid is borrowed from the inhaled air.

M. LP. Regnard’s guinea pigs are exact representations, the one of the
aeronaut or of the person in the lift, the other of the Alpine climber;
aud since muscular exertion alone induces a state of incipient asphyxia
it is to be expected that in rarefied air, which itself tends to the same
end, that condition should occur quicker in the organism which by its
activity goes, as one may say, to meet it.

Practical conclusions are easily drawn from this demonstration. There
is no reason for the persons who may be carried up the Jungfrau in the
|

projected lift to fear the effects of altitude. The example of the inae-

tive guinea pig assures them of immunity, and except in some almost

impossible cases of anemia or weakness they will experience no dis-
comfort. On the other hand, incipient alpinists must perceive that
the advice commonly given by guides has a solid foundation. The
example of the active guinea pig shows them that ascensions must
be performed slowly, without haste, without great exertion, without
getting out of breath. To be out of breath means incipient asphyxia,
and asphyxia means mountain sickness. So the excursionist must
learn to climb slowly, with careful and measured step.

In brief, high altitudes must unavoidably bring on asphyxia and
mountain sickness, but at moderate altitudes both are avoidable by
reducing the exertion; they may be brought on by increasing one’s
efforts, and it is only by assuming the nearly perfect immobility of the
aeronaut that one can hope to attain without discomfort the highest
altitudes, since it is during such immobility that the organism needs
least air.

Having considered the case where an animal or man passes gradu-
ally from a low to a high level, we must now turn to another, that in
which the change is sudden or extremely rapid. This is not exceptional,
but does not occur in the course of mountain climbing, for obvious
reasons; and in the case of balloon ascents, where it would seem to
be of common occurrence, we rarely hear of any serious inconvenience
experienced, although the balloon often seems to rise very rapidly.
The truth is that it rises rapidly to a moderate altitude only, and
that it gets into really high altitudes only after a lapse of time quite
sufficient for adaptation. To encounter cases of rapid decrease of
pressure, we must turn in another direction, and we find examples
where men work under high pressure, for instance, in diving bells,
under the surface of the sea or of a river, to explore a wreck or build
the foundations of a pier or bridge. Here, in order to counteract the
great pressure overhead, that of the water added to the normal sea-
level pressure—and every ten meters in depth of water adds the pres-
sure of one atmosphere—air must be forced into the bell or diving appa-
ratus, and the men are subjected to a total pressure amounting to three
or four atmospheres. As it sometimes accidentally happens that the
passage from this high pressure to the normal air is very rapid, the study
of the results is instructive for the present purpose. These are often
most unfavorable and death not uncommonly ensues. The same occurs
when an animal in a bell jar is rapidly subjected to a decrease of pres-
sure, or when, in a bell jar, where an animal has been placed and the
pressure gradually increased by forcing air into it, the pressure is sud-
denly decreased merely by allowing the air to escape into the atmos-
phere. In both cases, and in fact in all cases where the passage from
relatively high to comparatively low pressure is rapid or quite sudden,
Symptoms arise which are generally fatal. The animal falls on its side
186 AIR AND LIFE.

and dies, even if the final pressure is one which, if brought on slowly,
would not be injurious to life. The danger lies only in the rapidity of
the change.

Post-mortem examination of the victim affords a clue to the cause of
death, and makes all symptoms clear and intelligible. We find gas or
air in free condition under the skin, in the tissues, in the blood vessels;
this we never observe under normal conditions. These gases are the
cause of death. AIl tissues, and the blood, of course, contain at all
times gaseous matters—oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid—either dis-
solved in the liquids or combined with hemoglobin in the blood, and
the amount of these gases varies according to external pressure,
according to the tension of atmosphere. Now, if the atmospheric
pressure decreases gradually, the tension of the gases of the organism
decreases accordingly; and they escape gradually into the atmosphere
without making any trouble. But if the decrease is sudden, this grad-
ual escape can not be effected; the liberated gases have no time to
escape; the result is that they accumulate in all parts of the body,
and in the circulatory system they obstruct small vessels and paralyze
the heart.! Such accidents are not uncommon among the workmen
referred to, and this is the reason why they are always advised to
come up slowly to the surface, and the deeper they have been the
slower the change should be. They have little to fear from working in
compressed air at 2, 3, or 4 atmospheres; the danger lies in the
decrease of pressure, which, if sudden, is generally fatal. As they say
in their own language, ‘* You have to pay only when you come ont.”

So much for decrease of pressure, rapid or slow. In the one case
it injures by a deficiency of oxygen, by anoxyhemia, and the only
way to counteract its effects is to be provided with a supply of oxygen
of which small amounts may be inhaled now and then. Aeronauts
intending to attain very high altitudes can not do without such a pro-
vision, and it is their custom now to always take with them a supply
of oxygen. In the other, the injury is the result of a quite different
process, purely mechanical, the sudden liberation of gases in the tis-
sues and especially in the blood, where they immediately interfere with
the circulation, and stop the heart’s action. When moderate pressure
suddenly follows high pressure, anoxyhemia plays no part, and only
the mechanical effects occur; if low pressure follows moderate and
sufficient pressure, anoxyhemia alone occurs if the passage is slow;
anoxyhemia and the mechanical liberation of gases ensue if the pas-
sage is rapid and sudden. In both cases, decrease of pressure inter-
feres with life.

Let us now consider the reverse case, that of an increase of pressure.
Under normal circumstances such increase is always unimportant.

‘Just as air, even in very small quantity, drawn in the circulatory system through
some lesion of the venous system near the heart induces death in a few seconds, as
all physiologists know.
AIR AND LIFE. 187

Even at the bottom of the deepest mines, although pressure is appreci-
ably increased, this increase can not be considered as exerting the
slightest evil influence, and its physiological effects are practically nil.
The increase of pressure is much more important in the case of diving
bells, and it is among workmen who are engaged in the building of
piers and wharves, or in the exploration of wrecks, that we must search
for information concerning the effects of high atmospheric pressure,
unless we turn to animals experimentally subjected to such condition
in bell jars connected with forcing pumps. When the increase is
Slight, the effects are also slight. Some buzzing in the ears, some
bleeding at the nose, and a slight numbness in the limbs are those
which are most appreciable. But, at the same time, the respiration
and circulation are slower. In some cases there occurs an abnormal ex-
citation of the nervous system similar to that observed during acute
alcoholism. Such accidents are quite naturally ascribed to an increase
in the tension of carbonic acid, which accumulates in the system and
determines incipient asphyxia. This interpretation is correct as long
as the increase of pressure is moderate. But when the increase of
pressure is considerable, when we have to deal with pressure of six or
more atmospheres, the case 1s altered, and the cause of the symptoms
is different. This is shown by Paul Bert’s various experiments. In
order to delay the effects of increase of pressure, he added pure oxygen
to the atmosphere inspired by the animals experimented upon, expect-
ing by this means to prevent the toxic influence of carbonic acid. He
was, therefore, considerably surprised when he perceived that this
had no other result than to hasten the fatal issue. He then proceeded
to a careful analysis of the symptoms and phenomena, and perceived
that when the pressure is over 6 atmospheres the oxygen contained
in the atmosphere, acquiring a high tension, becomes a poison. And
none can wonder at this. An increase of the proportion of oxygen
under normal pressure is attended by toxic symptoms; an increase
in the pressure of oxygen, which amounts to the same thing, must
exert the same influence. And the proof that oxygen is the only cul-
prit lies in the fact that an animal can perfectly well endure a pres-
sure of 20 atmospheres if the air is poor in oxygen, if oxygen,
being less in quantity, has, in the mixture, a tension which does not
exceed that which the normal amount of oxygen, in normal air, pos-
sesses under normal pressure. Under increased tension, as well as in
increased proportion—for both conditions are identical as far as physi-
ology is concerned—oxygen is a poison, and a very dangerous one, and
this is the reason why man and animals die in a normal atmosphere,
when the pressure exceeds certain limits. Be it rapid or slow, consid-
erable increase of pressure kills through the agency of oxygen and of
its toxic properties, by reason of oxygen being dissolved in the blood
serum. If we leave out of consideration those cases where the varia-
tions of pressure are rapid, and where, as is the case with rapid decrease
188 AIR AND LIFE.

of pressure, a purely mechanical element comes into play, one sees
that gradual variations operate, not physically nor mechanically, but
in a purely chemical manner, by putting the organism under the influ-
ence of an atmosphere too rich or too poor in oxygen.

It must be added that in this case, as well as in many others, adapt-
ive phenomena occur. The Indians and animals of the South American
Cordilleras are unaffected by mountain sickness which attacks the
unaccustomed traveler, and animals of the abysses of the sea live and
thrive under pressures which no terrestrial or shore animal could endure.

This fact of adaptation to altitude, which is confirmed by the other
fact that there are villages or cities permanently inhabited by man at
3,080 and 4,000 meters above sea level, has long been well known.
It has especially attracted the attention of a French physiologist, Dr. —
Jourdanet, who discovered most of the facts which Paul Bert investi-
gated later, but the mechanism of the phenomena has been only
recently explained. Jourdanet supposed that the inhabitants of low
levels, when transferred to high levels, meeting with low pressure and
consequently a smail proportion of oxygen, became affected by anoxy-
hemia, a state characterized by the inability of the red blood cor-
puscles to absorb a sufficient preportion of oxygen—in brief, incipient
asphyxia. .

In that he was right; he also thought that adaptation is effected in
the following manner: If the evil is not unbearable, the system begins
to produce a larger supply of blood corpuscles; these can absorb only
aSsmall proportion of oxygen to be sure, but then they are more numer.
ous and by this means the balance is restered, and the system may
absorb a sufficient quantity of oxygen. Here, again, he was right, but
he did not succeed in establishing his hypothesis on a firm basis. The
latter task was achieved by Paul Bert, who examined specimens of
the blood of Peruvian lamas and vieunas, and proved that the blood of
such of these animals as live on the highlands contains a larger pro-
portion of hemoglobin and of oxygen than that of those of the same
species living on the plains at lower levels. For instance, 100 cubic
centimeters of blood of llamas or vicunas living on the highlands con-
tain between 19 and 21 cubic centimeters of oxygen, while the same
amount of blood in animals of the same species living on the lowlands
contains only 12 te 15 eubiec centimeters.

These results have been very positively confirmed by the investiga-
tions of MM. Viault, Muntz, and Regnard. M. Muntz has shown that
in common domestic rabbits allowed to go wild upon the heights of
the Pic du Midi, in France, the blood, after ten months’ sojourn in the
mountain, contains much more hemoglobin than that of rabbits belong:
ing to the saine breeds released for the same length of time in the plains
at Bagneéres de Bigorre. But it may be objected that this experiment
is not as conclusive as it seems to be, owing to the fact that the rab-
bits of the Pic du Midi may have been surrounded there by different
AIR AND LIFE. 189

environmental conditions other than those of altitude which may have
produced the observed effects. In order to meet this argument M. Paul
Regnard has devised an experiment which affords a very precise and
unassailable demonstration. In this experiment the only difference is
a difference in pressure. If the increase in the respiratory capacity of
the blood that occurs in consequence of life at high altitudes is ocea-
sioned solely by diminution of pressure, it is clear that such diminution
ought to produce the same effect at any altitude whatever. So M. Paul
Regnard took two guinea pigs belonging to the same litter, placed one
in a bell jar, where a special apparatus not only provided the necessary
decrease of pressure (by exhausting the atmosphere to the requisite
degree), but effected the necessary ventilation, while the other lived in
the same laboratory under normal pressure. The decrease of pressure
in the bell jar and the density of the atmosphere corresponded exactly
to those which obtain at Santa Fe de Bogota, at 3,000 meters above
sea level. Both animals were killed after a month, and the result was
that the blood of the guinea pig under decreased pressure absorbed
21 cubic centimeters of oxygen (per 100 cubic centimeters blood), while
that of the other animal living under normal pressure absorbed only
14 to 15 eubie centimeters of oxygen at the most. The fact is quite
clear; the experiment most convincing. By some means not yet ascer-
tained the blood of creatures living at high altitudes, and able to with-
stand the first unpleasant sensations, acquires the power of accumulat-
ing a large proportion of oxygen, and thus their systems are enabled
to resist that incipient asphyxia which is the result of a smaller pro-
portion of oxygen in the atmosphere.

This is an important point, from the practical side. It explains the
beneficent influence of high-level stations (such as St. Moriz, in Switz-
erland) upon anzemic or tuberculous patients. It shows that in cases
where the organism is weakened and physiologically impoverished, and
particularly where the blood has lost some of its vitality, the patient
will be benefited by living for some time in mountain resorts, even
at comparatively high altitudes, his blood will acquire new life, and
become more apt to fulfill its functions, owing to the increase of
respiratory capacity that results from decrease of pressure.

It is evident, however, that the patient should begin with moderate
altitudes, 1,500 meters, for instance; with altitudes which do not over-
task the system, which do not palpably increase the physiological ten-
dency toward asphyxia, and one should not forget that decrease of
pressure which, if moderate, is beneficent, becomes invariably fatal if
it exceeds certain limits. Man does not seem to be adapted to live per-
manently at altitudes over 4,000 or 5,000 meters, and if other animals
are able to do so, it is quite certain that even for these also there is a
limit upon which they can not trespass without dangerous results. The
differences are only of degree, and upon the whole they are of small
amount.
190 AIR AND LIFE.

MOVEMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

We must now consider another side of the general topic of the phys-
ies of air. I refer to the movements which unceasingly occur in the
vast ocean of gas which surrounds our planet. They are familiar to
all. Itis these that swell the sails of vessels and carry them across the
oceans, that give the impulse to the old-fashioned windmill, that lift
the waves and send them rolling from continent to continent; these,
also, that, with cyclones and tornadoes, uproot trees, blow down houses,
destroy crops, snap the giants of the forests like mere twigs, raise
clouds of dust, and spread ruin and death on every side. Breeze or
tempest, it always is air in motion, and in this case as well as in others
air is both beneficent and maleficent. Concerning the cause of this
motion, be it gentle or be it violent, it is enough to remind the reader
that the main if not exclusive cause is in difference of calefaction, and
that the wind blows from cool areas to warm ones.

What part can these movements of the atmosphere play in the life of
our planet? What is their influence? A superficial glance is enough
to show that this is manifold.

In the first place, they help to intermingle the constituents of the
atmosphere. To be sure, the general constitution of air is the
same everywhere, no considerable difference existing. But we have
referred more than once to the numerous local causes of alteration.
Consider, for instance, a large industrial town or a voleano. Both
exhale an enormous amount of obnoxious gases which are poured
into the atmosphere—carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and a hundred
other substances, toxic or inert; at all events undesirable for breath-
ing. A few figures have been given above concerning the amount
of such gases produced by mankind, by combustion, etc., and we all
know that in cities the composition of air is less pure than in the
country; that Manchester, Birmingham, Chicago, Pittsburgh, etc., are
less healthy than their surroundings. If there were no winds, most
certainly things would be much worse than they are, and, the very fact
that city air is inferior to country air, substantiates this assertion.
Without winds all these gases would accumulate about the place
where they originated. Of course some diffusion would take place,
but the process would be a slow one, and a much too great proportion
of unhealthy gases would at all times be found in the air of such places,
which would thus be more insalubrious than they now are. Without
winds locally vitiated air would remain such, just as is the case with
the atmosphere in a closed room where men or animals are assembled ;
wind is the cleanser of the atmosphere, the great purifier, which mixes
and purifies it, which chases it over lands and seas, over fields and
forests, from pole to equator, and from equator to pole, thus dissipating
in the whole mass those elements which, for one reason or another, are
produced in greater abundance at some points; it maintains the purity

of the atmosphere, or at least its homogeneity. If the atmosphere
were motionless, the air in cities would be perpetually vitiated, and all
the carbonic acid which originates there would be delayed in its travel
toward the country, the fields, and the forests, in whose biology it plays
soimportanta part; the vicinity of volcanoes, and even of cities, would
be uninhabitable, and life in cities impossible.

Again, from a biological standpoint, the movements of the atmos-
phere are useful in another way. They prevent the air from remain-
ing excessively dry in some regions and inordinately damp in others.
The air which has accumulated a large amount of humidity while above
an ocean, a lake, a river, a forest, does not remain there. It travels
farther, and carries the aqueous vapor it contains inland, up moun-
tains, and over plains. It transports the clouds, and carries the water
drawn from the Pacific Ocean to fall in rain on the American con-
tinent; through the same agency the water drawn from the Atlantic
falls on Europe, and the water of oceans is carried through the atmos-
phere to enormous distances to provide the continents with the rain
essential to plants, animals, and man, both that immediately used and
that which, sinking through the soil, comes to light again, sometimes at
considerable distances, under the form of springs, which help to make
the streams and rivers. If winds did not occur as they do, if the aerial
ocean were motionless, the vapors which arise above the oceans and
masses of water would not travel so fast, so far, nor in such quantity,
and a great part of our globe would be condemned to drought and
sterility. The other part would hardly be pleasanter; in an atmosphere
saturated with vapor, as that would be, perspiration evaporates most
slowly, and if the temperature were even moderately high, man would
lead a sluggish life, shunning effort as inducing an uncomfortable con-
dition, and living in a laziness and far niente which have never conduced
to moral, mental, or physical advancement. Truly wind is no unimport-
ant agency in civilization and in the general evolution of mankind.

Again, the movements of the atmosphere play an important part in
the regulation of temperature, as they do in the regulation of humidity.
If they did not occur, air would be perpetually warm in some places
and perpetually cold in others, the radiation and diffusion of heat acting
but slowly. The wind is beneficent in that it carries warm air to cold
regions and cold air to warm ones, tempering the climate of each.

To end this chapter, a word must be said of the part which wind
plays in the biology of many species of plants, by providing them with
important means of dispersion. Many plants possess light seeds, which
are, moreover, provided with appendages in the form of wings, or of
feathery hairs, and such seeds are very easily carried to considerable
distances over plains, over rivers, and even over narrow sea channels.
Through the wind’s agency, these Species are transported to new habi-
tats, where they may settle and thrive, spreading gradually over large
tracts. Numbers of insects and birds are thus carried to great distances
192 AIR AND LIFE.

by storms, and are thus enabled to obtain a foothold upon islands or con-
tinents to which their own forces could not have brought them. And
micro-organisms, last but by no means least, as far as importance, not
size, is concerned, make great use of atmospheric movements. They
possess no means of locomotion, and have no limbs to carry them to a
distance; but the wind makes good this deficiency, and takes good
eare to scatter them far and wide. There are many epidemics prop-
‘agated from city to city, from country to country; there are death-
working as well as beneficent microbes scattered over the whole face
of the earth, and thus air is again an agent of death and of life
by its contents, no less than by its essential constituents. But air
contains also a large proportion of non-living matter, of dead dust
as contrasted with the living dust just referred to. Such dust also
is scattered far and wide, and there is no doubt but that it may be
earried from China to North America, and from the New World toe
Europe or Africa. This dispersal of dust may be of some importance
in agriculture; at all events it plays no insignificant part- in geology,
and all have heard of the influence of winds in the formation and
migration of dunes on theseacoasts. This influence is often important.
In France, in the region at the south of Bordeaux and in certain parts
of Brittany, the wind has brought so much sand from the dry shores
at low tide that man has been compelled to retreat and to desert his
villages. These, gradually covered by the particles carried by the
winds, have finally been entirely engulfed and buried, as were Hereu-
laneum and Pompeii of old under the cinders of Vesuvius, and the only
remnant of a once inhabited and prosperous hamlet is a spire which
sticks out of the plain of sand. Analogous phenomena are to be
observed in all countries. In 1889, according to Mr. George P. Mer-
rill, a storm occurred in Dakota during which the soil was torn up
to the depth of 4 or 5 inches, and the particles accumulated easily in
recognizable sand dunes. In the western plains of North America,
also, the same event occurs, and these dunes, when once formed, travel
and migrate from place to place. Some miles north of Lake Winne-
mucea (Nevada), Mr. Russell found a series of such dunes, 40 miles
long, 8 miles wide, some of which were 75 feet high. Near Alkali Lake
other dunes are 200 and 300 feet high, and on the eastern shore of Lake
Michigan similat dunes have advanced upon forests, which they have
invaded, smothered, and destroyed, and the tops only of the trees, dead
as a matter of course, emerge above the hillocks of sand.

It should be observed that particles of sand driven by the wind exert
an erosive influence. They act as files, and gradually wear away the
rocks which they unceasingly batter, and thus the wind works in two
ways toward the leveling of the globe; indirectly cooperating with
water and with frost it helps to disintegrate the elements of rocks;
and when they are broken down it carries the particles, which are the
ultimate result of such disintegration, to the plains and to the sea.
AIR AND LIFE. 193

If one observes that besides this work wind is capable of tremen-
dous effort; that it wrenches from the soil the strongest trees; that it
scatters to the ground in crumbling ruins the most solid monuments or
buildings; if one considers that it could also effect a much greater
amount of work than that which is at present effected, by driving sail-
ing vessels or windmills, one can not forego the conclusion that in wind
we have an enormous source of energy which is hardly utilized from
the industrial point of view.

This is undoubtedly true. Wind isa most powerful force, whose limits
can not possibly be estimated; that it could be utilized for man’s benefit
could hardly fail to suggest itself. Many centuries have passed since
the first endeavor, and although some progress has been made, and
has been satisfactory enough during a long period, no one will venture
to assert that nothing more can be done.

Wind has been used on land and on sea; windmills have been
invented in most lands, and few savage tribes have failed to become
aware of the great help sails are to navigation. Tor centuries civilized
nations were content with sailing vessels, and some of the latter were
truly splendid achievements, able, it must be remembered, to cross the
Atlantic—under favorable circumstances—in eleven days, which is still
the duration of the trip for average steamships. But for three-quarters
of a century steam has been used and defeated sails for long distances.
The best steamers of the transatlantic lines are able to run from Queens-
town to New York in five days and a half, and from New York to
Havre in six days and a fraction. Wind has been defeated by steam
on land also, and coal has taken the first place as a source of energy.
But coal supplies are not inexhaustible, and thoughtful minds are
concerned with the important problem of drawing upon those other
resources which the movements of the atmosphere still provide, and
which are by no means used as much as they might be. Coal is decreas-
ing, and no fresh strata of the precious store are in process of forma-
tion as far as we areaware. It is burned at the rate of millions of tons
each year, and mines are being steadily emptied of their contents.
Forethought demands that future generations be not caught unawares,
and that even now the problem of providing fresh sources of energy
be considered. These are not wanting. The application of electricity
to general uses has developed important possibilities, and provided us
with a method by means of which energy may be obtained, transformed
and carried to a distance with the result that with proper apparatus
the energy of rivers, of winds, of tides, of solar heat, may be utilized.
Some important steps have been made in the required direction, and
much has been done to utilize the energy contained in rivers under the
form of falls, in Europe as well as in the United States, where the
Niagara Falls are the best known instance. But concerning the power
contained in wind, little has been done to take advantage of it. Sail-
ing vessels are always numerous, to be sure, but windmills are, on the

SM 95 13

194 AIR AND LIFE.

contrary, on the decrease, and no new method has been devised of late
to increase the quantity of force derived from this source. M. Maxi-
milian Plessner, however, has done good work in trying to call publie
attention to the matter.’ Wind is doubtless very irregular, by turns
strong or even violent, and a short time afterwards very gentle, and
even ceasing. But a great deal depends upon localities. There are
places and large regions where the wind is quite regular enough, as
far as strength and constancy are concerned, and near the seashore it
seldom fails. In the subtropical regions, also, trade winds are very
constant, and in most parts of the globe the regularity of the wind
increases with the altitude. The latter fact has been well shown by
a continuous series of observations made at the Hiffel Tower, in Paris,
since 1889. This amounts to asserting that, upon the whole, a consid-
erable part of the globe is perfectly suited for investigations upon the
best methods of deriving power from the winds. M. Plessner has eal-
culated that a wall or curtain 1,000 meters high placed upon the fifty-
fourth parallel between the twenty-fourth and thirty-eighth degrees of
longitude, would receive, through the impact of the wind, a total
sum of 100,000,000 horsepower, and 130 such walls would provide
13,000,000,000 horsepower, which means the power of 1,000 Niagaras.
Of course no such apparatus could be erected and used, as the first
storm would destroy the whole fabric; but this helps us to realize the
» tremendous amount of energy which speeds over our heads. The first
requisite is some sort of motor driven by the wind, and an accumulator
to store the energy and yield it at the required moment. M. Plessner
has no admiration for the old windmill; ,.he does not find therein the
motor which engrosses his thoughts or dreams. The eolian wheel
would be more suitable, but this also is below his requirements, and
he is rather inclined to look upon sails as affording a possible solution
of the problem. ‘The utilization of the power of winds,” he writes,
“and its transformation into mechanical work, are possible only by
means of sailing vehicles, driven by wind upon a cireular railway, the
power generated by such rotation being transmitted to an axle, and
thence to machinery.” He therefore proposes a circular railway, at
ground level, or, better still, elevated upon trestles. On this railway
a circular or annular train, ade of small cars coupled together, each
carrying a mast and two sails at right angles with each other, is driven
by the wind. ‘These sails are automatically trimmed, and automatically,
also, they expand or contract, or rather take in the wind or withdraw
from it. As long as the wind blows, the train continues rotating, and if
it is connected with a central axle, the latter may work dynamos and
charge electric accumulators. A similar apparatus might be arranged
in water, boats taking the place of the cars, and since the wind power

derts—Die Dienstbarmachung der Windkraft fiir den elektrischen Motoren-Betrieb,

AIR AND LIFE. 195

is transformed into electricity the latter may be stored and kept in
reserve, or transferred to a distance to perform 10, 20, 50 miles away
any work that may be required.

Such is, in its main features, M. Plessner’s project. Whether it be
this or some other which is accepted, there is no doubt as to the neces-
sity of trying to utilize a small fraction of the tremendous energy that
produces the movements of the atmosphere, and is one of the results of
the action of solar heat on our planet. There are certainly many ways
in which the problem may be solved. For instance, a very simple
method would be the using of wind power to force water into a reser-
voir at some height from which it might, at will, be let out to work tur-
bines. In mountainous regions, and near the sea, in all places where
water and wind are available, this system might be of service, however
imperfect it may seem. At all events a great field is open to inven-
tors, and a great harvest may be reaped by those who will work it
with patience and skill. M. Plessner’s investigations will prove very
suggestive, and they may also find much that is useful in Mr. 58. P.
Langley’s memoir on The Internal Work of the Wind. The facts re-
ferred to by Professor Langley are perhaps of more importance for the
problem of aviation, or flight, and for the explanation of the soaring of
the larger birds, which all have oftentimes seen sustaining themselves
during whole hours, without apparent fatigue, or effort, but they are
certainly very suggestive in the realm of aerodynamics. Mr. 8. P.
Langley has succeeded in proving that the force of the wind is not by
any means as constant and uniform as is commonly supposed. It does
not impart an approximately uniform movement, but a succession of
short, rapid waves or pulsations of varying intensity, and fluctuating
in direction on either side of the general course of the wind. He con-
siders it as certain that an inclined or suitably curved surface, heavier
than air, and free from all attachments whatsoever, may be uplifted and
indefinitely supported in the air by means of ‘internal work,” without
any further expense of energy than that which is demanded for chang-
ing the inclinations of the plane according to the pulsations. It seems
quite certain that under special conditions such a plane might advance
against the wind, not only comparatively, but in the absolute sense.
These data are very valuable, and may prove most useful for practical

purposes.
* * * * * *

Having considered the general relationship between living organ-
isms and the elements, pressure, and movements of the atmosphere, we
must now proceed to illustrate the relationship between the physical
contents of the air and living beings.

Air contains many elements that are accidental, temporary, and of
minor importance. Some are gases; such as, for instance, carbon
monoxide, carbureted hydrogen, and many others, for the most part
obnoxious and toxic. Of these substances we shall say nothing here,
because of their scarcity and irregular occurrence, They are not normal

196 AIR AND LIFE.

constituents of the atmosphere, and we may say that every substance
known to chemistry may at some time or place be accidently present in
the air. Only such bodies deserve notice as are normally present in
the whole atmosphere, although they may be of minor importance.
Under this head must be mentioned aqueous vapor and different solid
materials, inanimate or animate, excluding those which are of voleanic
origin, and dust, natural or artificial.

Aqueous vapor is always present in the atmosphere under the form
of fog or clouds, and also in an invisible form. We will especially
refer to the latter. It has a dual origin. The one part comes from
evaporation, under the influence of heat, of the water of oceans, rivers,
lakes, and moist soil. The amount of vapor produced depends upon
the amount of heat, and also upon the amount of vapor already con-
tained in the air. Foreach degree of temperature air can only contain
a quite definite amount of vapor. The other part comes from living
organisms, by transpiration through the skin and pulmonary surfaces
of animals, by the evaporation which occurs from the leaves of plants.
This production of aqueous vapor by living beings is very variable,
and circumstanees affect it greatly. An animal or man in dry air pro-
duces a large amount, since the expired air is quite saturated with it,
but in moist air hardly any is produced, and that which is expired
hardly does more than restore to the atmosphere the moisture taken
from it. The whole of mankind pours into the atmosphere a total
amount of some 15,000,000,000 kilograms of water per twenty-four
hours, but a large proportion of this is merely returned; it has not
been generated by man. Similarly, plants yield but a small amount of
moisture if the air is already nearly saturated; they yield a very large
amount if itis dry. It has been calculated, for example, that a wood
of 500 adult and vigorous trees yields nearly 4,000 tons of aqueous
vapor during the twelve hours of daylight. By night the amount is
less considerable, and is only about one-fifth of the diurnal evapora-
tion. This instance is enough to show that plants are most important
producers of vapor. And if one only considers that in the United
States, as an example, the total surface of plant leaves is at least four
times that of the soil surface, one perceives how important must be
the part of plants in the function we refer to. Physicists have esti-
mated the total quantity of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere at
72,000,000,000,000 tons or cubie meters of water.

This vapor, which is very unequally diffused (since the maximum
amount depends upon the temperature of air),and which varies in quan-
tity according to the time, locality, and other circumstances, plays an
important biological part. Air, when too dry irritates the respiratory
organs; when too moist it impedes transpiration and its beneficent
effects: in medio virtus, and the best condition is that in which air is
neither very dry nor very moist.

Another more important partis played by this aqueous vapor in that
AIR AND LIFE. 197

it forms a sort of protecting screen, that, by day, tempers the solar
heat by absorbing a portion of it and preventing it from scorching the
vegetation and the soil, and at night, conversely, prevents excessive
cooling of the earth’s surface by radiation. It does not prevent the
passage of luminous calorific rays, but absorbs a large amount of the
dark thermic rays—whatever their souree—and experiments by Tyn-
dall, and especially Pouillet, and others, have shown that the atimos-
phere, by reason of the vapor it contains, absorbs about a quarter of
the sun’s heat, so that only three-quarters reach the earth proper. If
this screen did not exist, our summer days would be much hotter and
also much cooler. In the full glare of the sun the thermometer would
stand higher than it does, and in the shade the temperature would
be lower. We have an exact illustration of what would happen in
what occurs on high mountains, or in balloons at great height. The
higher we ascend the thinner becomes the layer of vapor interposed
between the sun and ourselves. Under such circumstances the sun is
scorching; its rays, nearly unopposed, exert a stronger influence upon
persons and things and heat them highly, while the surrounding air is
cold, as there is hardly any vapor to absorb solar heat. This fact has
been well observed by Professor Langley during his ascent of Mount
Whitney, and all alpinists have had experiences more or less similar.
Tf, then, there were no vapor in the atmosphere, our summer days would,
as is the case in high altitudes, be torrid an frigid at the same time
torrid in the sun, frigid in the shade, where the thermometer would
certainly fall very low.

At night atmospheric vapor moderates radiation. During the night
the earth gives off part of the heat it has received during the day,
and this heat radiates into interplanetary space. When the sky is
very clear and dry, radiation is considerable, and at all seasons a clear
night is colder than a cloudy one, and night is colder in high altitudes
where the overlying sheet of air and vapor is thin and rare, than in the
lowlands, with a thicker atmospheric layer overhead. Kadiation is
unavoidable, because the temperature of celestial space is exceedingly
low, probably inferior to 100° below zero (centigrade); but it is more
rapid, and offers greater intensity when the air is dry and contains but
a small quantity of vapor, because then the absorption by the atmos-
phere (by vapor, to be precise) of dark calorific rays radiated from the
earth’s surface is very slight. If there were no aqueous vapor in the air,
a considerable cooling would begin as scon as the sun set, and such
cooling does occur on high mountains and at high levels—in Thibet,
for instance, which is both high and dry, and also in deserts, where the
atmosphere is generally dry. In Sahara, after the hottest days under
a scorching sun, the nights are generally very cool, and the thermom-
eter runs down some 30° or 40° in a few hours. Such radiation and
cooling must be very harmful, and most animals and plants could
certainly not endure it. Vapor thus exerts a most beneficial influence,

198 AIR AND LIFE.

as it moderates the heat of day and the cold of night, and acts as a
sort of regulator, by means of which some uniformity is established
under antagonistic and conflicting conditions, and in spite of contrary
influences. Quite certainly, if vapor did not exist, the physiology of
the animals and plants of the lowlands would be different, or they
would perish.

The parts played by the numerous solid particles found in the atmos-
phere are as varied as is their nature. Physically pure air is a myth
and can only be obtained artificially, in laboratories, and when great
care is exercised. Even at the greatest heights, where micro-organisms
as well as vegetable or animal fragments are few and often totally want-
ing, mineral dust is always found. These particles are very small, to
be sure, and their origin varies; some are of volcanic origin, and after
important eruptions, such as that of Krakatoa, volcanic particles are
very abundant in the atmosphere and may be years in settling or fall-
ing on land or sea; others are merely dust which the wind has swept
off the surface of the planet, and a large proportion consists of minute
fragments of aerolites which have fallen into the earth’s sphere of
attraction from interplanetary space.

Professor Newton has attempted to form some estimation of the
number of such aerolites, and he comes to the conclusion that our
atmosphere receives the enormous total of some 20,000,000 meteorites
per twenty-four hours, each of which is large enough to produce the
phenomenon known under the name of ‘shooting star.” However
small these fragments may be—and yet in order to become visible
because of the heat evolved by friction against the atmosphere they can
not be so very minute—they certainly bring to our planet a consider-
able amount of foreign matter, a large proportion of which remains
some time suspended in the atmosphere before falling. In all places
where the requisite observations have been made, and where instru-
ments have been placed for collecting the mineral contents of the air,
there has been obtained an abundant harvest of meteoric particles,
easily recognizable by their form and structure, and the mud which
slowly accuinulates at the bottom of the sea contains a large number of
these extra terrestrial bodies. As a matter of fact, mineral particles
of foreign source are constantly pouring through our atmosphere in
the form of a dry and invisible rain. A large amount of terrestrial dust
is also found in this rain. Von Richthofen speaks of the particular
aspect of the atmosphere in a part of China, where the sky is yellow
and opaque. When the wind comes from the direction of Central
Asia, all things are covered with a yellow dust which is brought
by the wind from vast regions whose soil is covered with a layer of
ochreous dust, which is driven to great distances over the Pacific. In
Australia, rains of a sort of red mud have been observed—rain made
into mud by the admixture of dust, the latter having been transported
by the wind and storm from considerable distances. Such a rain has

AIR AND LIFE. 199

been noticed to fall over an area of 2,500 square miles. In the United
States, a similar phenomenon has been observed. Prof. 5S. P. Langley,
during the ascent of Mount Whitney, noticed that the middle strata of
the atmosphere contained a large amount of red dust which was visible
from above the level of these strata, while below, from the plains, no
trace of it was detected by the eye. This dust had, perhaps, its source
in China. The Krakatoa voleanic dust remained many years in the
atmosphere and traveled many times entirely around our planet.

All this dust becomes easily perceptible to the naked eye, when we
look at aray of light in a dark room. But in order to well ascertain
its origin, to know exactly what it is, microscope and aeroscope are
wanted. By means of these instruments a very interesting microcosm
is revealed. All sorts of particles are to be found in the air—small
desiccated animals, such as worms, rotifers, vibrios, infusoria, frag-
ments of insects, of wool, scales from the wings of butterflies, particles
of hair, feathers, vegetable fibers, spores of fungi, pollen grains, flour,
dust from the soil, and microbes. From our present standpoint many
of these particles are of but slight interest to us, although it is a curi-
ous fact that voleanic dust may remain for years in the atmosphere at
considerable altitudes, and travel around the earth with the winds,
inducing those curious phenomena of light and color at sunrise and
sunset which physicists and the public at large observed after the
Krakatoa eruption. It is also a very curious fact, well illustrated by
T. Aitken’s investigations, that these particles are favorable to the pro-
duction of rain. Under certain circumstances they play the part of a
nucleus around which the vapor of the atmosphere condenses, and each
particle becomes then the central part of a drop of rain.' What is of
interest to us, from the biological point of view, is the presence of pollen
grains, which explains how an isolated female plant may bear fruit even
at a great distance from male plants of the same species; the presence
of spores of fungi, which favors the dispersal of species; the presence of
light seeds, which may be carried very far, and then fall to the ground,
and develop an individual in a region where the species was never seen
before. Again, the presence of microbes, to which we have previously
referred, and which explains how many diseases are carried far and wide
by the agency of the winds, such microbes being specially abundant in
cities and in the vicinity of dwellings. Atthe Montsouris Observatory in
Paris, M. Miquel finds between 30 and 770 microbes per cubic meter of
air, according to winds, seasons, ete.; in the center of the town, Rue de
Rivoli, the air contains 5,500 per cubic meter; in hospital wards, between

‘Such being the case, 1n order to induce artificial rain, instead of trying to change
the state of the atmosphere by means of explosions it would seem more rational to
send dust into the heights. Butat all events, the essential requisite is the presence
of vapor, and this feature seems to have been sadly neglected in recent experiments.
Nature provides rain by means of vapor and changes in temperature, not by explo-
sions which can hardly have any influence.

200 AIR AND LIFE.

40,000 and 80,000, while at 7,000 meters altitude, and above the sea at
some distance from the shore, none at all are found. These figures are
enough to show how the air under certain circumstances is a dangerous
agent, and serves as a vehicle of death.

As we have seen, air is fraught with life as well as with death. Hach
of its constituents is essential to life, and each is also a cause of death.
The one that appears to be the most vivifving of them all, becomes under
certain conditions and doses, a fatal poison; the most useless, the most
harmiul is, when carefully investigated, an essential basis of the whole
structure of life. And the general conclusion is that none could disap-
pear, none could exist under a different form or in markedly different
proportions, without soon altering the features of our planet and chang-
ing it into a naked and barren globe on whose surface no living being,
of the present type, could be found.

If we study the subject more attentively we become aware of another
fact. We perceive, to use again J. B. Dumas’s very happy phrase.
that all living beings are, at last analysis, nothing but condensed air,
Plants exist mainly by reason of the existence of air, and animals and
man can not exist without plants. The elements of plants are air,
and animals live upon plants; the connection is direct and intimate,
and man, therefore, is also only condensed air. And as this air, since
the centuries during which mankind has existed, has been unceasingly
migrating from generation to generation, from individual to individual,
now part of some of our human ancestors, later returning to the atmos-
phere, and thus perpetually pursuing its cycle, our present organism is
made of the same elements as that of our ancestors. Their substance
isalso ours. And this substance, which is also that of past animals and
plants, goes on through space as an untiring wave. To-day or to-mor-
row a flower or a fruit, it will unite at one time to form a portion of a
sluggish mollusk, at another to help build the brain of a Descartes, a
Newton, a Pascal, a Shakespeare, a Helmholtz, a Joan of Arc. The
cycle is never interrupted. No human eye witnessed its beginning;
none will witness its end. It seems to be infinite and eternal—
although, doubtless, it is neither—and alternating from life to death, as
old as the world and yet as young as the newborn; if consciousness
were among its attributes it would have gone through all that life
may give—the highest joys, the deepest sorrows, and all emotions, the
noblest as well as the basest.

The breeze which gently moves the leaves, the wind which moans
through the high forests, is the sum total of all life that has been. It
is the material of all that has had existence, of those that came before
us, of those that are no more and for whom we weep. Now it becomes
part of ourselves and to-morrow, perhaps, it will go on, pursuing its
way, unceasingly metamorphosed from organism to organism without
choice or favor, according to law, till the time comes when our globe,
no longer heated by the cooling sun, shall slowly die. Then all the
AIR AND LIFE. 201

substance of past living organisms will rest and return to earth; mortal
cold and darkness will reign; the curtain will drop upon the tragedy
of life, and that which remains will be a frozen and gigantic tomb,
rolling suent and desolate through the unfathomable depths of the
darkened heavens.

PART JI.—CONSTITUTION AND CONDITIONS OF THE AIR.

The atmosphere has been compared to a great ocean, at the bottom
of which we live. But the comparison gives no idea of the magnitude
of this ocean, without definite bounds, and varying incessantly in den-
sity and other important qualities from depth to height and from place
to place.

Uninterrupted by emergent continents and islands, the atmosphere
freely spreads high above all mountains and flows ever in mighty cur-
rents at levels beyond the most elevated regions of the solid earth.
Whatis the composition of this encompassing fluid, and what its char-
acter? The work of the present century has gathered in a rich store
of knowledge to answer the inquiry.

The atmosphere consists in the main of two gases, oxygen and nitro-
gen, and these are intimately mixed in the proportion of about 20.9
of oxygen to 79.1 of nitrogen by volume, and 23.1 of oxygen to 76.9 of
nitrogen by weight.” These gases, which are each of them chemical ele-
ments, are not chemically combined with one another, but only mixed;
each preserves its qualities, modified only by solution in the other.
Gases have the property of diffusing among each other so completely,
that no portion which could be conveniently taken, however small,
would fail to represent the two gases in a proportion corresponding
with that which they maintain in the whole atmosphere.

Another valuable constituent of the atmosphere, though varying
greatly in amount at different times and places, is of no less impor-

and Boussingault give the density of nitrogen as 0.09725. (Comptes Rendus, 1890.)

tance to mankind than the two elementary gases which make up by far
the greater part of the volume and weight of the whole. This is vapor
of water, the result of the process of evaporation of those vast watery
surfaces which are always in contact with the lower strata of the air.

Deprive the air of any one of these three main constituents and
human life becomes impossible.

Next in rank from the human point of view is carbon dioxide, or car-
bonie acid gas, which, though comparatively very small in amount,
exists throughout at least all the lower ranges of the atmosphere, and
has the same close and necessary relations with plant life as oxygen
has, or rather as food has, with the life‘of animals. It presents on a
great scale an example of the wonderful law of gaseous diffusion; for,
though much heavier than air, in the proportion of about 2 to 1, it
diffuses under natural conditions nearly equably through every part,
whether the region of its origin be near or distant.

Stated in tons, the following are the calculated weights of the chief
substances composing the whole atmosphere:

In addition to the above, we find in the air a variable and very small
quantity of ammonia, chlorides, sulphates, sulphurous acid, nitric acid,
and carburetted hydrogen, but some of these depend, where detected,
to a great extent on manufacturing operations and on aggregations of
men and animals.

Liquids and solids in great variety are also very important, widely
diffused, and constant ingredients in the atmosphere. The solids are
everywhere present in the condition of very minute microscopic or ultra-
microscopic motes or dust, composed chiefly of sea salt, or chloride of
sodium, sand, or fine silicious particles, various dusts derived from
volcanoes, factories, towns, and the remains of meteors set on fire in
their passage through the upper air. Some of the most beneficent
functions of these microscopic and invisible motes will be considered
later. Other solids present in the upper air over a large part of the
globe and in the lower strata, especially in the Arctic regions, are
small particles of ice, condensed either in clouds or in air which appears
nearly clear. Explorers in high latitudes relate that on fine cold days
the air is frequently sprinkled with shining crystals of ice which seem
to fall from a blue sky, and,on the other hand, in heavy gales and
stormy weather the lower air is filled with a fine icy dust, resulting
from the freezing of the spray torn from the sea waves. In temperate
climates very much of the rain which falls on the surface of the earth
has existed previously at high levels in the state of snow or ice particles.
The experience of mountaineers and balloon voyagers, and, in a moun-
tainous country, the sight of peaks covered with fresh snow after a
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 205

day’s rain on the low ground, prove how commonly rain is melted ice
or snow.

Other solid particles always present in great numbers in the lower air,
and of great importance in relation to human, animal, and plant life, are
various kinds of microbes, fungi, molds, and spores. At certain sea-
sons the pollen of plants is very abundant. In some countries the air
is thick in the dry and windy season with the dust of the soil. Agri-
cultural fires cause a thick haze over parts of Germany, the United
States, and other countries at certain times of the year. After great
volcanic eruptions the air over many thousand square miles has been
affected by a dense haze. This was notably the case in the summer
of 1783, when, after an eruption in Iceland, terrestrial and celestial
objects were dimmed by “dry fog” in western and central Europe dur-
ing several weeks. In 1883, 0n the other hand, after the eruption of
Krakatoa, near Java, the upper air, between 40,000 and 120,000 feet in
altitude, was overspread with a semitransparent haze of a very remark-
able character, consisting mainly of finely divided, glassy pumice.
This haze stratum in the upper sky extended over all known countries
and remained visible for several months.

Cloud globules are the most obvious and widely present liquid ingre-
dients of the atmosphere. They possess properties of great interest
in connection with the recently discovered ubiquitous atmospheric dust,
with optical phenomena, and with the formation and distribution of
rain.

The other familiar forms of water in the air are dry and damp fogs,
mist, and rain. Haze is in most instances, at least so far as the pres-
ent writer’s observations go, in the south of England, a phenomenon
depending on very small particles of water and on the presence of dust
particles as nuclei.

Ozone, an allotropic and unstable form of oxygen, has been found to
be constantly present, in very small quantities, in the open air in nat-
ural conditions, but can not be traced in the impure air of great towns,
and is no doubt always greatly diminished where dwellings are thick
together. Ozone consists of molecules, each supposed to contain three
molecules of oxygen.

Peroxide of hydrogen is also supposed to exist in slight traces in the
general atmosphere.

Minor impurities, arising from animal life, from manufacturing
processes, and from the combustion of coal, are mostly not perceptible
to the senses, except in the neighborhood of places where they are
given off very abundantly.

The principal functions of all these various elements and substances
of which the atmosphere is composed, may now be regarded in detail
with special reference to their influence upon human life and welfare.

OXYGEN.

Oxygen, that wonderful element which constitutes very nearly half
of the solid crust of the globe, combined as most of it is with the
206 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

metallic and other elements of the earth, forms also, in union with
hydrogen, the great body of water which covers three-fourths of the
terrestrial surface. Water consists of two volumes of hydrogen and
one volume of oxygen chemically combined. Stated by weight, out of
nine parts of water eight are oxygen. But water, as we know it, always
contains other matter, and chiefly atmospheric air, which is dissolved
in it, and to a considerable extent changes its character. For the sery-
ice of man, water, deprived of air, would have lost several important
characteristics. Oxygen is dissolved in water to the extent of 2.99
volumes to 100 of water at 15° C., an amount sufficient to support the
existence of fishes and hosts of other aquatic creatures, and to oxidize
and render innocuous some of the common impurities which result from
animal and vegetable processes and decay. Probably its power when
dissolved in the liquid is greater than in the atmosphere, and it must
be compressed into a smaller space. [Fresh charcoal absorbs eighteen
times its volume of oxygen, and a much larger bulk of organic vapors,
especially ammonia; in this condensed state the oxygen acts so power-
fully as to unite with hydrogen to form water vapor, and with sulphur
to form sulphur dioxide. We may thus assume that water, as we use it
and drink it, has important effects upon the body which would not take
place if robbed of its contained oxygen. As an instance of the value
of the air contained in water for many domestic purposes, its assistance
in the making of tea may be mentioned; if the air be allowed to boil out
of the water the beverage is spoiled. Recent observation, however,
shows that oxygen is not altogether removed from good water by the
process of boiling.'

Oxygen has a very strong chemical attraction for the elements; only
one is known with which it does not combine. Hence, “to burn” in
common language means combination with oxygen, and most sub-
stances in the crust of the earth are already burnt, or combined with
oxygen. In its ordinary form it has no color, taste, or smell, according
to most observers, but recently a faint blue color has been detected as
belonging to it, when seen in sufficient quantity. It has a small
refracting influence on light, and exhibits a magnetic property, espe-
cially strong in the liquid form, to which it has recently been driven by
intense cold and pressure. The degree of cold required was — 140° C,
under a pressure of 320 atmospheres.

The proportion, by weight, of oxygen in the air has been determined
by Ledue as 23.58 per cent.’

The volume of oxygen in the air in different localities and conditions
has been tested by various observers. On the western seashore of
Scotland the percentage was found to be 20.991; on the tops of hills,
20.98; in a sitting room (close), 20.89; at the backs of houses, 20.70;
at the bottom of shafts in mines, 20.44.

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 207

The accurate determinations of Bunsen of the oxygen in the general
air gave a mean of 20.93 per cent. Two hundred and three analyses
by Reiset gave nearly the same result. Hempel found the amount at
Tronso to be 20.92; at Dresden, 20.90; at Paris, 20.89. These amounts
must be received with qualification, because in comparing one town
with another more depends on the position in the town than on the
situation of the town.

The average proportion of oxygen in the open country or at sea
may be stated at about 20.95 per cent. In large, open spaces in Lon-
don the amount of oxygen is nearly normal; in the streets, about
20.885; in Manchester, in fog and frost, 20.91; in the suburbs in wet
weather, 20.96 to 20.98. These figures are merely approximate.

In the air of mines an average of 20 has been observed, and in
extreme cases the amount was no higher than 18.6.

In the midst of vegetation on open ground, especially in the daytime,
there is an excess of oxygen.

Angus Smith and others found the following quantities of oxygen in
air in different situations:

Recent experiments by Messrs. Smith and Haldane on impure air
contained in a leaden chamber showed that with oxygen 20.19 and
carbon dioxide 3.84 two men instantly got headaches on entering.

Oxygen is the breath of life, the element without which no human
being could exist for a single hour. Brought into contact by every
inhalation of the lungs, it revivifies the loaded blood, spreads over the

208 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

body the warmth resulting from its combustion with the carbon con-
tained in the blood and tissues, and gives to the whole physical being
a vigor and freshness which is impossible where the element is
deficient. Thus to mankind it is life-giver, warmth-maker, and puri-
fier. Unlike food, which may be taken irregularly and at long inter-
vals, oxygen is a necessity at all times and in all conditions, in every
hour of the day and night; and upon its reaching or approaching the
normal quantity in the air around us, our health and enjoyment directly
depend.

By the law of diffusion of gases, which causes the interchange of
position of gases separated by a thin porous partition, the carbonic acid
gas brought by the blood to the lungs passes out and is then exhaled,
while the oxygen breathed into the air cells passes in through the
walls of these cells to the blood. The heart sends the impure blood
derived from the circulation through the body to the lungs; this dark
blood is loaded with carbonic acid gas; the lungs return the aerated
and purified red blood through their blood vessels to another division
of the heart, which again drives the vivifying blood through the sys-
tem. Experiments have shown that a similar change in appearance
from dark to bright red blood can be caused by passing a stream of
oxygen through the dark venous blood of an animal. That a process
of combustion, or, otherwise put, chemical union, goes on at the same
time, is shown by the fact that the blood is raised one or two degrees
by its contact with oxygen. The oxygen in its course through the
body combines with the effete or waste products presented to it by the
tissues, and so the heating eifect of combustion maintains the tempera-
ture of the whole body at the normal, about 98.6. The waste gases
given off by the lungs consist of carbonic acid gas, water vapor, and a
very small quantity of ammonia and other organic matters.

The average volume of air breathed in at each breath is about 30
cubic inches, and the volume of air which may be easily breathed in by
an effort, and by expanding the chest, is about 130 cubic inches, or
about four times as much. After avery full inspiration about 230 cubic
inches can be expired by a man of average height and in good health.
The total capacity of the lungs, however, is much more than this—about
330 cubic inches. Thus in ordinary quiet breathing we only fill about
one-tenth of the available air space of the lungs. After every outbreath,
or expiration, a quantity of air is left in the lungs. This residual air
amounts to about 100 cubic inches.

An adult at rest breathes about 686,000 cubic inches in the course
of twenty-four hours; a laborer at full work, about 1,586,900 cubic
inches—more than double. The amount of air passing into the lungs
has been estimated at 400 cubic feet in a state of rest, 600 in exercise,
1,000 in severe exertion. The number of air cells in the lungs is esti-
mated at 5,000,000 or 6,000,000, and their surface at about 20 square
feet. The epithelium or membranous film between the blood and air is
exceedingly thin, and in many parts the capillaries are exposed, in the
a

dividing walls of cells, to air on both sides. The weight of air inhaled
in the course of the day is seven or eight times that of the food eaten.
The mechanical work of breathing represents energy expressed by the
lifting of 21 tons 1 foot in 24 hours.!

From every volume of air inspired about 44 per cent of oxygen is
abstracted, and a somewhat smaller quantity of carbonic acid gas is at
the same time added to the expired air.

Experiments on animals show that the amount of oxygen absorbed
is very little if at all increased by an excess in the air surrounding
them.

OZONE.

Ozone is an important constituent of the atmosphere, greatly con-
tributing to its purity and freshness and to the vigor of human life.
It is a form of oxygen in which the molecule is considered to be
composed of three molecules of the gas.

Although existing in small quantity in the air, rarely exceeding 1
part in 10,000, the activity of ozone is so great and its function so
beneficial that its presence in normal quantity is, in ordinary sur-
roundings, a fair guaranty of the purity of the air and of healthy con-
ditions so far as breathing is concerned. No ozone is found in the
streets of large towns, in most inhabited rooms, near decomposing
organic matter, and in confined spaces generally. In very large, well-
ventilated rooms it is sometimes, though rarely, detected. Ozone is
found in very small quantity a little to leeward of a large town. Even
at Brighton, a town of about 110,000 inhabitants, ozone was barely
discoverable on the pier when the wind blew from the town, but
abundant when the wind was from another direction.

Ozone has the power of oxidizing to a much higher degree than oxy-
gen, and vigorously attacks organic matter in a fine state of division.
It is therefore a strong disinfectant. Its oxidizing power is the reason
of its absence from confined spaces where organic “ysio dust, or smoke
is present, for such matter quickly uses up the small portion of ozone
which enters with the fresh air. The walls, furniture, etc., are also
covered with fine dust, which the ozone attacks. The difference we
feel in going from a furnished room, however large, into the open air,
is thus partly accounted for. There is somewhat more ozone on moun-
tains than on plains, and most of all near the sea. Water is said by
Carius to absorb 0.8 of its volume of ozone. An examination of sea
water with a view to detect the amount contained in it would be diffi-
cult, but might give interesting results. A great excess of ozone is
destructive to life, and oxygen containing one two hundred and fortieth
part of ozone is rapidly fatal. The ordinary quantity even has bad
effects in exacerbating bronchitis and bronchial colds and some other
affections of the lungs.

210 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

Ozone is formed by the passage of the electric spark, and especially
of the brisk discharge through oxygen, and is therefore found in
unusual quartity after thunderstorms. It may also be formed by the
slow oxidation of phosphorus, and of essential oils in the presence of
moisture; also by the decomposition of water by a galvanic current.
When formed by electric discharge in air, it is quickly turned back
again into oxygen, either by further discharges or by the action of high
temperature, about 230° C.; at the temperature of boiling water it is
slowly decomposed in moist air. Its pungency of odor is said to make
it easily perceptible when only present to the extent of 1 volume in
2,500,000 volumes of air, and the smell may sometimes be noticed on
the seabeach. It has been liquefied at 100° C. under 127 atmospheres
pressure. In this form it shows a dark indigo-blue color; gaseous
ozone looked at in a tube 1 meter long also shows a blue color. Thus
there can be little doubt that, in conjunction with oxygen and fine dust,
it contributes to the azure hue of the sky.

NITROGEN.

Nitrogen, the gas which constitutes four-fifths of the volume of the
atmosphere, takes no direct part in the sustenance of human life, but
has two great functions to perform: first, the dilution of oxygen to the
proper and tolerable strength for respiration, and secondly, the supply
of food material to plants.

Although life is possible for many hours in pure oxygen, it is hardly
conceivable that the human constitution could be so modified as to
endure for long an atmosphere of so actively combustible a character.
At any rate, nitrogen is indispensable in present conditions to the
human race. Plants, with few exceptions, do not absorb nitrogen from
the air, and, indeed, in the case of most of these exceptions the supply
of nitrogen is in a transitional compound form. Nitrogen is brought
to the plants in general by processes of decay, and by the action of
microbes in the soil, which rearrange organic elements, forming nitrates
and nitrites. These nitrogen compounds are largely applied to the
roots of plants as manure. Only one or two classes of plants can take
up nitrogen from the air. Certain low alge, freely exposed to light and
air, seem to absorb nitrogen directly. Leguminous plants, such as
peas, vetches, lupins, beans, clover, etc., absorb nitrogen from the. air
in a very curious way. Nodules or swellings are found on the roots;
these contain minute fungi or microbes; the bacteria absorb nitrogen
from the air, and, probably at the expense of the energy of the carbo-
hydrates, ete., which they oxidize, supply this nitrogen in the form of
compounds to the plant. These recently discovered facts open out the
prospect of obtaining scientifically from the air, in some cases at least,
the nitrogen which is now applied in combination with oxygen, soda,
etc.,as manure. If by the aid of special bacteria parasitic upon the
plant we can systematically obtain the chief element of manurial
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 211

stuffs from the atmosphere itself, a great advance will have been made
in agriculture and in the cheapening of food.

CARBON DIOXIDE.

Carbonic acid gas, or carbon dioxide, is found in small quantities
everywhere in the air, and in about the same proportion at 11,000 feet
as at the sea level. Itisacolorless, transparent gas and does not sup-
port combustion or animal life. At 0° C. it may be liquefied under a
pressure of 38.5 atmospheres. When liquefied and then allowed to
escape it freezes into a snow-white solid in the air, and in a vessel
under the vacuum of the air pump freezes into a transparent mass
like ice.

One liter of carbonic dioxide at 0° C. and 760 mm. pressure weighs
1.97714, nearly double the weight of air, taken as 1.

At the ordinary temperature and pressure water dissolves about its
own volume of the gas. Dissolved in rain it exerts in the course of time
avery powerful disintegrating effect on rocks and minerals, so that
the crust of the earth is greatly modified by the constant action of the
solution.

The chief sources of carbonic dioxide in the air are the respiration of
animals and the burning of fuel. A large quantity emerges from the
earth in certain places, as in the Poison Valley of Java, and in many
mineral springs, where it effervesces out of water escaping from pressure.

Saussure found the amount per cent in a wood near Geneva to be
0.0504 in the day and 0.0576 at night; in January, 0.0423; in August,
0.0568. In Geneva he found an average amount of 0.0468, compared
with 0.0437 in the wood.

Schulze, Reiset, Levy, Armstrong, and Muntz, in different places,
made several thousand observations, and the mean of all these shows
during the day 0.0299, and during the night 0.0317. Reiset’s long con-
tinued observations in the country 4 miles from Dieppe gave an average
of 0.02942; and in June, above the crop of red trefoil, 0.02898; in July,
above barley, 0.02829; near a flock of sheep, 0.03178.

Thorpe’s very carefully conducted experiments agree well with the
above values, and give for the air over the sea 0.03011. Armstrong, at
Grasmere, obtained during the day 0.0296, and during the night 0.033.
At the Montsouris Observatory the mean during 1877-1882 was 0.03.

In an unventilated barrack the following amounts have been re-
corded as the result of careful observations: 0.1242, 0.189, 0.195; in
a hospital at Netley, 0.06 to 0.08; in the General Hospital, Madrid,
0.32 to 0.43; in a boys’ school, 4,640 cubic feet and 67 boys, 0.31; in a
crowded meeting, 0.365; in a schoolroom at Madrid, 10,400 cubic feet
and 70 girls, 0.723; in a stable at Hilsea, cubic space 655 feet per
horse, 0.1053. |

It is not easily explained why the normal amount of carbonic dioxide
in the free air has been so long assumed in scientific articles and text-
books as 0.04 per cent, or 4 volumes per 10,600, when the best recent
212 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

observations show an average not exceeding 0.0317 per cent, even at
night, and a general mean of about 0.0308, or 3.08 volumes in 10,000.
All the most recent works on hygiene, however generally accurate,
repeat this error.

Considering the value of small quantities in these measurements,
especially where they affect human life, it is most desirable that the
standard should be taken rather as 3 than 4 volumes per 10,000.

Although earbon dioxide does not itself support animal life, and we
could do very well without it in the atmosphere so far as breathing is
concerned, it is necessary to the growth of plants, and therefore through
them an indispensable substance for the existence of the human race.
The vegetable world not only needs a supply of this gas for its own
sustenance, but by the selective action of its leaves keeps the air con-
tinually pure enough for the life of animals. Under the influence of
sunlight every green plant absorbs the carbonic dioxide at its surface,
breaks it up into carbon and oxygen, and returns some free oxygen to
the atmosphere. In this way the two great kingdoms, the vegetable
and the animal, mutually contribute, each to the other, the elements
of life. The carbon drawn from the air, together with hydrogen and
oxygen, forms the wood of the tree, the stalk of the plant, and the
flesh of the fruit, and these, when burnt or eaten, again result in carbon
dioxide and water.

The change from tie compound gas to carbon and oxygen is brought
about by small openings or pores filled with a green substance,
chlorophyll, which during the daytime has the power to extract the
carbon and set free the oxygen. At night, on the contrary, there is a
slight expiration of carbonic dioxide, so that there is a real reason
against keeping large green plants in a bedroom during the night.
But the amount is very small compared with that exhaled by one
person.

It is now known that plants, like animals, breathe oxygen from the
air, while they use the carbonic acid as food.

About 1,346 cubic inches of carbonic dioxide are exhaled by a
healthy man per hour. An adult gives off in repose about 0.7 cubic
foot, and in active work about 1 cubic foot per hour. (Pettenkofer.)

It is a remarkable fact that this amount is much reduced when the
air is already fouled with this gas; experiments showed that where
the same air was rebreathed, as it often is, the reduction was from 32
to 9.5 inches per minute. Thus it appears that the elimination of
waste products from the system is seriously checked by the presence
in the air breathed of an excess of carbonic dioxide. Otherwise
stated, air in crowded places may continue to sustain life while it fails
to remove any but a very inadequate portion of the poisons with which
the blood is charged.

The general surface of the skin of the body also gives out a consid-
erable quantity of carbon dioxide, though, of course, very much less
than the lungs.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 213

About 67,200 cubic feet of carbon dioxide! are given off by the burn-
ing of every ton of coal. Since about 405,480 tons are burnt daily in
Engiand on an average (the quantity is much larger in winter), the air
over the country receives daily about 24,728,256,000 cubic feet of the
gas, or 1,200,000 tons.

The perfect burning of ordinary coal gas gives rise to 200 cubic feet
of carbonic dioxide for every 100 cubic feet of gas consumed. Practi-
cally every cubic foot of gas burnt vitiates as much air as the respira-
tion of one person. So that in a large town during the evening hours
in winter the vitiation of the air is in main streets and in rooms many
times larger than during the daytime.

Angus Smith, whose methods were not quite so precise as those later
in use, found the following amounts of the gas in air in the situation
described:

It appears from these figures that hill air, like that of the open coun-
try and of the seaside, contains little carbonic acid, but is not superior
in this respect to the air of the central parts of large parks in towns.
In the streets of a town the amount is decidedly larger by about 1 in
10,000 than the average amount of the country. During the preva-
lence of fogs, streets and confined places in towns often contain double
the natural amount. The condition of the air of workshops, theaters,
and crowded places generally is evidently foul and dangerous to health.

In the central parts of London, within the city, Dr. W. J. Russell
found a mean of 0.0422 for three winters, and 0.0379 for two summers.
During fogs the amounts were much higher, giving an average of 0.072,
and on one occasion a measurement of 0.141 was recorded. The lifting
of a fog was followed by a rapid decrease in the excess. On still dark
days the amount was large. On fine days, in strong winds, and on
holidays, the quantity was below the average.

The deficiency of oxygen and excess of carbonic acid, which are
common to nearly all rooms, schools, churches, theaters, and workshops
where many persons are gathered, are very favorable not only to the
spread of various infectious diseases, but to the maintenance of a number

‘Reduced to about the average temperature of the air in England, 50°.

a
2914 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

of minor ailments; and where the exposure to foul air is prolonged,
as in workshops, offices, and mills, to a continued depression of vitality.
Various artificial means have been tried for improving the air of
crowded rooms, and some are successful, but, on the whole, the direct
admission of plenty of fresh air in currents directed upward and the
removal of bad air by flues of sufficient diameter give in the long run
the most satisfactory results.

The worst condition of air to which people are often exposed would
probably be found in closed railway carriages. The capacity of an
ordinary third-class compartment in England may be put at 240 cubic
feet; it is certainly not greater. Containing 10 persons, it provides for
each person 24 cubic feet of air at the beginning of a journey. Sup-
posing the air to be unchanged, in the course of one hour each person
will have breathed 17.7 of these cubic feet. Therefore, at the end of
one hour 177 cubic feet out of 240 in the compartment will have been
breathed out of the lungs of its occupants. Since an average man
breathes out 0.6 cubic feet of carbon dioxide per hour, the amount of
excess of this gas in the compartment at the end of an hour is 6 cubic
feet; or otherwise stated, the amount in the air, instead of the normal
proportion of 0.03 per 100 cubic feet, is 2.53 per 100 cubic feet. At the
same time the oxygen is reduced and a quantity of organic poison and
vapor is taken in with every breath. Practically, however, we must
take into account the facts that from the first minute every person in
the compartment breathes not a fresh parcel of air at every breath,
but an already contaminated product, and that an excess of carbon
dioxide has the effect of at once diminishing the quantity expired.
Thus the amount of carbon dioxide would not be so large as that eal-
culated, but may be estimated at one-half—1.26 per cent. But the defi-
ciency in the carbon dioxide breathed out tells of carbon and other
matters remaining unoxidized in the human system. The case of the
compartment supposed air-tight is an extreme one and not quite exem-
plified in practice, but some approach to the condition described occurs
in thousands of railway compartments on every calm, cold, winter
morning and evening. Again, in traveling to the south of Europe in
the winter of 1895 it was noticeable that 48 persons were shut up in one
long carriage with a communicating passage between the compartments
and without any efficient ventilation even through a hole or chink, the
windows and doors all being made to fit closely. Twelve hours of
breathing the same air would be likely to bring the occupants to a
worse condition than where ten persons sleep in one small bedroom,
which is about the worst case actually occurring in large towns. More-
over, these carriages are largely used by invalids and consumptives, and
must become sources of infection to delicate persons.

Experiment by means of the sense of smell has shown that air in a
room seems fresh when the carbon dioxide does not exceed 0.05999 per
cent, a little unpleasant when the proportion is 0.08004 per cent, offen-
sive and very close at 0.12335, and extremely close, when the sense of
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 215

smell can no longer differentiate, at 0.12818. In a railway compart-
ment this amount is often greatly exceeded.

It is recognized by the best authorities that in order to keep the air
in a room in a state good for respiration every person should be supplied
with 3,000 cubic feet of fresh air in every hour. Thus, in an unventi-
lated railway carriage occupied by one person, the whole of the air
would require to be changed thirteen times an hour, and if occupied
by ten persons, one hundred and thirty times an hour. Plainly, the
ventilation provided by ventilators or by 2 or 3 inches of open window
is incompetent to do this, and falls very far short of what is required
when the wind blows in the same direction as that in which the train
is moving, virtually resulting in a calm.

A space of 750 to 1,000 cubic feet in a room is properly required for
each person, when the whole of the air is renewed by imperceptible and
even ventilation about three times an hour. This standard is commonly
not approached when several persons occupy a small room and windows
and doors are closed. In a railway compartment the space for ten per-
sons should be on the same scale—7,500 cubic feet, at least—and the
air should be changed completely three times an hour, at least. Asa
matter of fact, the space is only one-thirtieth of this desirable quantity,
and the whole air may in many cases be changed not more than three
times an hour. Since the space can not well be increased, the alterna-
tive must be taken of largely increasing the flow of air through the
compartment. Small, fixed openings above the windows and a venti-
lator in the roof would be the most efficient means of replacing foul air
by fresh. The openings might be made to diminish in size in propor-
tion to the strength of the wind encountered, and should be so situated
as not to cause a perceptible draft. In rooms there is no better cheap
ventilation for a mild climate than that obtained by thickening the
lower part of the frame of a sash window so as to leave a space between
the two sashes by which air enters and diffuses itself through the room,
escape being provided by the chimney. Tubes of rather large size com-
municating directly with the outer air, and with their interior openings
directed upward about 4 feet above the floor, are very satisfactory, and
by means of a valve or damper can be regulated so as to admit more or
less air, according to weather.

For large houses and cold climates, where more expensive apparatus
may conduce to ultimate economy, a thoroughly satisfactory arrange-
ment is the provision in the basement of a coke boiler with a system of
hot-water tubes contained in a chamber into which fresh air passes, and
is thence led through flues into the upper parts of the various rooms,
where it becomes cooled and flows away with the products of respira-
tion through openings near the floor into pipes connected with a shaft
next the kitchen chimney, and so upward into the open air. But the
boiler and stove require much attention, and the substitution of gas for
solid fuel would sometimes be preferable.

Gas fires are good if the products of combustion are not permitted to
216 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

mingle with the air in the room, but carried off by the chimney, as with
coal fires. The poisonous gases, ete., generated by combustion are
very apt to cause sore throats, headache, and other ailments, and may
favor the incidence of diphtheria. Carbon monoxide, which is given
off by charcoal, coke, and gas fires in small quantities, is a strong
poison.

VAPOR OF WATER.

The atmosphere of vapor of water coexisting with and interpene-
trating the atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen is of no less impor-
tance to human life. Its physical properties are very different and its
characteristic is variety of state, while that of the dry air in which it
floats is uniformity of state. Air is solid at —328° I’. under a pressure
of 1,000 atmospheres; vapor of water is solid at 32° F. under a pres-
sure of 1 atmosphere. Recent researches have proved that cohesion,
the force by which bodies are held together, increases as temperature
is reduced. At the exceedingly low temperature of 328° F. metals
and other solids are firmer than at any higher degree. Heat is there-
fore a force by which the molecules of substances in general are driven
further asunder in the whole range of temperature. The force of cohe-
Sion is less in gases than in liquids and solids; and, indeed, is not
manifested at all at ordinary temperatures and pressures. By great
cold and great pressure, however, all gases but one have been brought
to the liquid condition, wherein cohesion obtains the advantage over
heat, and it is almost certain that by still greater cold all gases would
be enabled to exist as cohesive solids. The habitable state of our globe
depends on the adjustment of temperature and atmospheric density so
as to permit the elements of life to maintain their appropriate gaseous
and liquid forms. It is the large diversity of melting and boiling
points in different substances which makes life possible. Uniformity,
or even an approximation to it, would be fatal.

Water vapor, instead of being nearly homogeneous and of equal den-
sity at equal heights above the earth, varies greatly in quantity at dif-
ferent times and in different places. Like a gas, it tends to diffuse
itself uniformly through the atmosphere as in a vacuum, but the resist-
ance of the air has the effect of retarding the rate of diffusion. Owing,
moreover, to the never-ceasing operation of unequal condensation and
evaporation, the distribution of vapor is very unequal, both in time
and place. The average quantity near the sea level in most countries
is from 60 to 75 per cent of that required for complete saturation.

While air is always a mixture of gases in a fixed proportion, very far
beyond any possible cause of liquefaction or solidification, vapor is
never far from its condensing point; that is, however high the tempera-
ture and however low the pressure, a moderate amount of cooling will
always bring it into the condition of water or ice. The repulsive force
in the perfect gas, or in air, is sufficient to keep it gaseous at the lowest
conceivable temperatures in natural conditions; the cohesive force in
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 217

water is sufficient to keep it, except to a comparatively small amount,
in the state of a liquid. Yet this small proportion which flows through
our atmosphere reaches the enormous weight of 54,460 billions of tons.
Lighter than air, transparent, almost impalpable, vapor has an immense
work to do in the sustenance of all that grows and breathes upon the
surface of the earth. Like a good genius, it enables the air, the sun-
shine, the earth, to bring forth their riches, to cover the globe with
verdure and gladness, and truly to make the desert blossom like the
rose. Without vapor in the air, there would be no streams, no lakes, no
wells. The land would be uninhabitable by man, except so far as fresh
water might be condensed from sea water by machinery, and plants for
his use be grown by the seashore. Even then the human system would
hardly tolerate the parching influence of a perfectly dry atmosphere.

Water vapor, having a low temperature of condensation, was one of
the last substances to fall, during the cooling of this globe millions of
years ago, from the vaporous into the liquid condition, and consequently
remains as a covering between the rocks, which were early solidified,
and the air, which was not solidified at all. Water covers about three-
fourths! of the whole area of the terrestrial ball. It has the remark-
able property of being capable of existing in the gaseous, liquid, and
solid states within a small range of temperature, and even of existing
in all three states under ordinary conditions at temperatures which are
common in winter over a large area, and which are easily borne by
human beings.

In every cubic inch of water are many thousands of millions of mil-
lions of molecules, and all of these vibrate more or less rapidly under the
stroke of heat. Some molecules, as a result of collisions among them-
selves, which are very numerous in every second, and as a result of
their situation on the surface of the sea, are propelled with such
velocity that they Jeap above the general surface, get beyond the
retaining power of cohesion, and are taken up by the wind or by rising
currents and carried aloft. The vapor rising from the water surface is
warm, has in fact become vapor owing to being in more energetic
vibration than the average of the particles of water. Moreover, vapor
is lighter than air. So the lowest stratum of vaporous air near the
tropical sea becomes lighter than the air above it for three reasons:
First, by being in contact with the warm water which has absorbed the
sun’s rays; secondly, by being mixed with vapor which is lighter than
the air it displaces, and thirdly, by this vapor coming from the warmest
or most strongly vibrating molecules on the water plane.

The force of gravitation, it should be observed, is often of very little
account where small particles such as these molecules of water are to
be considered. A slight charge of electricity would be enormously
more powerful in directing the motion of a single molecule. - The reason

_1The proportion of water to land is about 145,000,000 square miles to 52,000,000
Square miles.
218 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

of this is that gravitation diminishes regularly with the size of par-
ticles of the same substance; but electricity, since it resides on the
surface, diminishes at a much slower rate. It is likely that electricity
would often cooperate with heat differences in driving the vapor from
the surface in an upward direction. Evaporation is increased by low
barometric pressure, so that an area of depression to some degree on
this account tends to maintain itself.

By the beautiful law of the diffusion of gases, according to which
each gas spreads itself through a space as if that space were a vacuum,
subject only to retardation of the rate of diffusion by another gas
already permeating the space, vapor diffuses itself through air, not
with great rapidity, but so as to produce a fairly equable mixture in
the same locality. The molecules of vapor have to encounter thou-
sands of molecules of air in every inch and millions in every second
of their progress, and if weather depended on diffusion, without the
bodily transferences of large quantities of air horizontally and verti-
cally owing to perpetually changing distributions of heat, the condi-
tions of climate would be extreme and intolerable.

A very common form of exchange set up where the heat and mois-
ture are not excessive by contrast with neighboring masses is by thin
streams, filaments, or spirals of lighter vaporous air rising into the
upper region, while colder filaments descend toward the earth or sea.
This movement occurs under placid conditions, with cloudless sky, and
when observed in temperate climates may be taken as a sign of consid-
erable stability in the disposition of the atmosphere.

At other times, also commonly in fine weather, the warmer, lighter
strata below break during the daytime into the upper strata by means
of small columns, of a good many yards in diameter. These are often
capped with rounded cumulus clouds where they attain an elevation
and refrigeration beyond their dew point.

Occasionally, but rarely, the lower air breaks suddenly in a large
torrential eddy, which may be several furlongs in diameter, into the
upper region. The disturbance may give rise to a cyclone, whirlwind,
or tornado. This occurs when the condition is abnormal, the lower
strata being very moist and warm and the upper relatively cold and
dry, and when from some cause, such as the prevalence of superposed
winds, the interchange of differing air volumes has been delayed. The
conflict of currents from different directions near the surface may then
give rise to an eddy, and this will be a favorable occasion for a rush of
light air, as through a chimney, toward the high level. Air flows in
from all sides, but can not easily reach the center, owing to the earth’s
rotation, the onward movement of the whirl, and centrifugal force. In
the present writer’s opinion, a cyclone may be started or maintained
by the strong wind, of 100 miles an hour or more, which often blows at
a great elevation in the tropics and neighboring parts. At one obsery-
atory in the United States a velocity of 180 miles an hour has been
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 219

registered. The effect of a strong horizontal wind on a ‘‘chimney” of
hot vaporous air would be to increase greatly the force of the upward
torrent, as has been proved by anemometric experience with tall chimney
shafts and domestic fires. The effect of the violent wind is exceedingly
destructive, especially when the tornado is of small diameter. Some
towns in the United States are particularly subject to these storms,
and, as they generally come from one direction, the effect of building a
perpendicular wall of 200 or 300 feet high on that quarter near the town,
in order to break or divert its course, would seem worth trying.
Returning to the more normal conditions of the atmosphere, we may
imagine the vapor, whether from land or sea, to have mixed much but
not uniformly with the overlying air. The differences in the humidity
of different masses or parcels of air, and the viscosity, friction, or
resistance of the lower strata, where the pressure is 15 pounds to the
Square inch, prevent the interaction from being continuous and uni-
form, and consequently the ascending currents are local and variable,
but when once fairly started, generally persist for a considerable time,
moving all the while with the prevailing wind. When the vapor
streams reach a certain height, they begin to condense, first and chiefly
because they expand, and in expanding cool themselves, according to
the laws of heat, and, secondly, because they mix with cooler strata.
If the vapor be supposed to have ascended to a height of 3,000 feet,
the pressure upon it has diminished from about 30 to 27 inches of
mereury, or by about one-tenth, so that it swells, allowing for contrac-
tion by cold, to a bulk nearly one-tenth more than it had at the sea
level. This is sufficient to produce a large diminution of temperature
and the molecules vibrate so much less rapidly that some of them cease
to maintain the condition of vapor. The vapor must condense, accord-
ing to recent discoveries, not in contact with mere air, but upon very
minute solid particles, motes, or dust, which may consist of ultramicro-
Scopic sand, sea salt, or other material. So acloud takes form. For
each amount of curvature of a liquid surface there is a definite vapor
pressure, and the pressure necessary for precipitation is greater as the
surface becomes more convex, so that precipitation takes place more
easily the larger the water globule in the presence of vapor. And so
great is the pressure required for the condensation of vapor in free air
that condensation can not take place except upon those small nuclei of
dust which, more or less, are present throughout the lower atmosphere.
Solid surfaces exposed to gases contract a film of gas upon their sur-
faces. Now, the dust of the air, owing to its minuteness, presents an
enormous surface, and is moreover largely hygroscopic, so that the
tendency to gather a film of vapor of water upon its surface becomes
very important and effective. Without this fine dust in the air the
world would hardly be tolerable or even habitable by the human race.
The vapor would condense, not in the sky and in the form of clouds,
but on the earth, on mountains, trees, houses, and clothes, so that the
220 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

sun’s rays would strike down upon us oppressed with an air cloudless
and saturated, and all objects would be perpetually streaming with
moisture. An approach to such a state of things sometimes actually
occurs on high mountains when the air is saturated and at the same
time remarkably free from dust.

Clouds are often caused and maintained by mixture of winds or cur-
rents at different temperatures, the colder current reducing the tem-
perature of the other below the dew point. Such clouds may be very
wide in extent, but are not often dense, except in sudden and violent
disturbances.

Radiation from a stratum of highly vaporous air may produce a
cloud, and, when once formed, every cloud which has a clear sky above
it radiates strongly and tends to maintain its existence by the conse-
quent deposition of vapor upon its particles which it induces. The
intensity of radiation into space depends largely on the dryness of the
air above; and since dryness increases rapidly with height, the radia-
tion from a high cloud is much more rapid than from a low one. Other-
wise high clouds would dissolve much faster than they do in the rather
dry air about them. If the heat of the sun’s rays falling upon a cloud
exceeds the loss by radiation, the cloud diminishes in bulk and density.
Thus a fog frequently dissipates toward the middle of the day. But
the farther the fog or cloud lies from the surface of the earth, the less
is the heating effect of the sun, for loss by radiation proceeds faster
and is not compensated by terrestrial warmth.

Sometimes, but rarely, cumulus clouds may be seen to precipitate
fine rain suddenly, about sunset, owing to the sudden, uncompensated
loss of heat by radiation. The appearance may be compared to a veil
suddenly let fall which does not reach the ground. An example of this
phenomenon occurred in the south of England on April 13, 1894.

The edges of clouds are always changing, and, in fact, a cloud is in
constant process of formation and solution. Sometimes, especially
in fine weather, or with a strong wind, the edges are hard, rounded,
and well marked. This may be owing to a property which has recently
been discovered to belong to aggregations of very small drops when
moderately or slightly electrified—they attract one another. ‘The higher
regions of the air are strongly electric, especially in stormy weather,
and the particles are held in proximity by mutual attraction and by the
attraction of the mass of cloud.

Fog and clouds of a stratiform character, and cumulus clouds, and
cirrus may commonly exist without rain, and in most countries there are
many days in the year wholly overcast but rainless. This happens most
often in quiet and uniform conditions of weather. There is no strong
disturbance in the upper air; horizontal currents of somewhat differing
temperature give rise to a stratum of cloud about their borders, and
this soon evaporates when carried into the drier air above or falling
into the warmer air below. Cumulus may often be seen to sink and
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 221

vanish at sunset, and stratiform cloud by itself is commonly the expres-
sion of moderate condensation under quiet conditions insufficient to
precipitate vapor rapidly.

A cloud layer may continue for some days with strong wind, being
caused by (1) a gradual ascending movement of the lower air so as to
precipitate a small quantity of vapor continuously by expansion; (2)
by contact of the upper surface of the lower current with a colder cur-
rant at a higher level; (3) by radiation from a rather moist stratum
through dry upper air; or (4) by a warm, moist wind arriving, after a
long passage, in cooler latitudes, and gradually becoming cooler by
radiation and mixture.

In showery weather cumulus clouds are very often seen to consist
of two or more masses at levels wide apart, and the upper mass,
which is harder and firmer-looking than the lower, seems to move
much less fast. Such clouds, even though heavy-looking, may pass
over without rain, and it is generally, only by the appearance of rain
in the air and landscape under them that they may be distinguished
as actually shower-laden. Rain is, however, far more probable in
these cases when the clouds are in tiers or separate layers; indeed, a
single cumulus mass, simple and uncillified, seldom precipitates at all.

What, then, are the causes of rain; and why does it fall from some
clouds more than from others?

The simplest and a very common cause of rain is the sudden eleva-
tion of moist air to a higher level, with the consequent chill by expan-
sion. Standing on a mountain between the west and east ends of a
loch in Perthshire, when a west wind is blowing, one may see showers
frequently falling among the mountains westward, and failing to reach
the flatter ground toward the east. The wind, even before it reaches
the mountains, is tilted upward by the pressure of air in front of it, is
consequently cooled, and precipitates moisture upon their western slopes.
When the air descends in a drier and warmer condition toward the
lower ground, the clouds quickly dissolve and thin out. The cloud-
forming and the shower-forming effect is in general roughly propor-
tional, between certain limits, to the height and steepness of the
mountains. The great cliff called Slheve League, on the coast of
Donegal, and the cliffs of Hoy, in the Orkneys, both about 1,800 to
2,000 feet high, cause clouds to be thickly formed sometimes fully half
a mile to windward. Whether rain falls, and how heavily, depends
chiefly on the moisture of the air and the coldness of the stratum into
which it is forced.

A similar but little recognized effect is caused by opposing masses
of air. Thus, let a moist warm southwest wind meet a cold northeast
wind; the southwest wind is forced upward, especially over certain
localities, and flows over the northeast wind, expanding very largely
and rapidly and precipitating moisture heavily. The production of
heavy thunderstorms may be fully accounted for by the local eddies
222 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

and conflicts between opposing winds, which occur in summer when
the moist warm air-mass is lifted to great heights.

Generally, we may state the formation and amount of rain to be
dependent on the following conditions:

(1) The height to which the lower air is forced upward.

(2) The amount of vapor in the lower and upper air, respectively.

(3) The relative coldness of the stratum into which the lower air is
projected.

(4) The freedom from vapor strata and from cloud of the upper air,
allowing free radiation from the rain cloud.

(5) The electrical condition of the air and cloud.

Where mountains are high, the air warm and moist and blowing
toward steep slopes, very heavy rain falls either continuously at certain
seasons, or in thunderstorms, according to the character of the winds,
the heat of the sun on the earth, and to a less degree the temperature
of the upper air.

The ranges of hills south of the Himalayas, the Himalayas them-
Selves, the mountains of eastern South Africa, and the Andes give
examples of such effects. High mountains have the power of precipi-
tating as rain or snow even the rather small quantity of vapor which has
passed over a continent, and thus the central areas of countries remote
from the sea are provided with perennial fountains which flow down
from the high ground and pass through the land as fertilizing rivers.

Another cause of rain is the radiation into space of the heat of vapor
and of water particles at a height. Recent discoveries have revealed
the fact that vapor does not condense into cloud globules in ordinary
conditions without the presence of a very fine dust which floats in the
atmosphere. When this dust radiates freely and moisture is deposited
upon it, and when a cloud is formed, the upper surface of the cloud
parts with more heat than the surrounding air, and the cloud globules
erow in size by contact with vapor. .

Now, throughout the process of increase in size, electricity is accu-
mulated more and more densely on their surfaces, for the electricity of
each molecule or particle resides on its surface, and the relative surface
of a globule diminishes as the size of the globule increases. If the con-
densation be rapid, the particles formed are very unequal in size.
Since surfaces only increase at half the rate of bulk, electricity is
much denser on the large drop. Now, it has been found by experiment
that large drops attract small ones when similarly electrified, and each
addition further increases the attractive power of the drop. The large
drops fall through a cloud at a much greater rate than the small par-
ticles and collide with many more droplets in the same time. In the
course of a fall of 10,000 or 15,000 feet through cloud, the drops may
greatly increase in size.

The sizes of drops vary from 0.0035 inch to about 0.1 inch. An
ascending current of 3 miles an hour would sustain small drops;
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 223

only a very strong upward wind would sustain the largest. A hail-
stone of 2.58 inches in diameter would be kept at a height of about
15,000 feet by an upward blast of hurricane force, 100 miles an hour.
Drops can never reach the size of a hailstone, for the resistance of the
air has the effect of breaking them up. The smallest drops would take
about six hours and forty minutes in falling from a cloud 10,000 feet
high, but we know that this scarcely ever, if ever, happens. In reality
the smallest drops falling on the earth are nearly always derived from
a slight elevation and very small drops falling from a great height
would, except in an extraordinarily saturated state of the air, evapo-
rate in their course. Ordinary small raindrops take about six minutes
or soinewhat less in falling through 10,000 feet.

Raindrops are perfectly globular in form. This we know in two ways—
first, from the rainbow, which can only arise from the regular disper-
sion of white light by transparent globules; and, secondly, by means
of instantaneous photographs. The sphere is the figure of smallest
volume which can be assumed, and consequently we find that free
liquids under the influence of cohesion, surface tension, or gravitation,
are always spherical.

Since a raindrop is an aggregation of cloud particles it contains a
number of solid particles or invisible motes, and generally a very small
quantity of sea salt. Besides this “dust” it attaches to itself soluble
gases contained in the air, the result chiefly of animal life, of decom-
position of organic matter, and of manufacturing processes. Thus,
ammonia, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphurous acid, and a little
air and carbonic acid, are found in rainwater. Brandes found an aver-
age of 26 kilograms of residue in every million of rain evaporated,
the amount being greatest in January (65) and least in May (8). The
residual substances were chlorine, sulphuric acid, soda, potash, mag-
nesia, ammonia Salts, organic matter, lime, carbon dioxide, oxide of iron,
and oxide of manganese. The solid matter amounts in France to about
1474 to 156 kilograms per hectare. The importance of these minute
traces of gases and other substances in rain is enormous, especially in
relation to the nutrition of plants and the disintegration of rocks. But
no less important to mankind is the function of rain in clearing the
_ atmosphere of these ingredients. Clouds and rain are at the same time
purifiers, filterers, and nourishers. In the words of the ancient declara-
tion, ‘“‘the clouds drop fatness,” and “the water returns not void.”
The upper layers of earth have a remarkable power of purifying water,
so that what is useful to vegetation is retained near the surface and
the purified water passes down into deeper ground, where it may be
drawn from wells or emerge in springs. The process, first of wash-
ing the atmosphere and then of self-purification, is so complete that
though the mold swarms with organic life the water which has passed
through this upper earth may be described as practically pure and free
from organisms.

Not only is the raindrop a composition of solids, liquids, and gases,
but it is of unequal consistency if the inner be compared with the outer
part. Every drop surrounded by air is compressed into the spherical
shape by an outer film of water which partakes of the character of an
elastic skin. In the free air cloud globules and small rain can not easily
coalesce on account of this elastic film enveloping them. They may
impinge against each other, but unless the concussion be forcible they
rebound. Similarly the drops falling from a fountain may be seen to
run along the surface of the water like pearls before they unite with it.
So also small drops of water falling from an artificial jet rebound and
do not unite on collision. But let a stick of sealing wax be rubbed on
flannel and held at a distance of several feet from the thickly falling
drops; they at once cease to rebound, they unite into large drops, or
else the jet keeps falling as a continuous stream and does not separate
into drops as before. Again, let the drops be strongly electrified, they
do not unite but repel each other.

Large drops attract small drops similarly electrified, and drops
unequally electrified attract each other. The weak charge of similar
electricity, which causes the globules to approach each other forcibly,
is sufficient to break the enveloping film, but a stronger charge pro-
duces repulsion of the drops. In these observed facts we have what
seems a very Satisfactory explanation of some of the phenomena of
thunderstorms; for example, the sudden heavy downpour and sudden
cessation, and the apparent effect of flashes of lightning on the rain or
hail. Finely divided water exhibits another property which is of great
importance in the formation of rain, hail, and snow. Down to a very
low temperature, 10° to 20° or more below the freezing point, according
to the size of the particles, it resists congelation. This property is of
immense effect throughout nature, and the life of plant and animals to
a great extent depends upon it. When globules of water below the
freezing point are touched by a frozen drop or by a snowflake they are
instantly frozen. <A erystal of ice is the most powerful of all sub-
stances in congealing water below the freezing point. Very many falls
of rain, hail, and snow are due to this cause. The minute crystal as it
descends through dense cloud gathers particles on its way until it has
grown to be a large snowflake; and whenever the lower air is warm
enough, snowflakes thus formed melt and fall as rain. Rain is much
more often than we suppose melted snow. The minute flakes which
would melt and evaporate if they did not meet with the water cloud,
erow rapidly in the cloud, which would of itself be incompetent to
precipitate.

When a flake of snow or kernel of ice falls through dense cloud, such
as the towering cumulus which stacks itself to a great elevation in a
thunderstorm, it electrically attracts the particles of unfrozen water,
below the freezing point, through which it passes, and every particle
attached and instantly frozen adds to the electric charge, so that more

particles are attracted with ever-increasing strength. In this way, in
addition to mere impact, in the course of a fall of 10,000 or 15,000 feet,"
are formed those large hailstones which devastate crops and kill animals
Taking Aitken’s observations of the number of particles of water or
droplets of fog, falling upon a square inch in a minute in a dense fog,
as a criterion—say, namely, an average of about 10,000 droplets—and
assuming that these drops fall at the rate of not more (it is probably
much less) than 10 feet a minute, a hailstone falling through 10,000 feet
of dense cloud would encounter if it began as a snowflake, 1 inch
square, about 10,000,000 droplets, by mere impact. Some hailstones
may result from the attraction of small spicules of ice and particles of
water alternately as the nucleus passes through different strata, and
these show concentric bands alternately opaque and clear. Similar
bands may be formed by the passage of the hailstone through alternate
spaces of thick cloud and of clear, unclouded, but saturated air. The
latent heat brought into the sensible condition by condensation and
congelation has been supposed to make such an accumulation in clear,
saturated air impossible, but actual observation indicates that the rapid
passage of the hailstone through very cold air speedily and continuously
dissipates the heat thus set free. The appearance of spaces between
successive tiers of dense cumulus cloud and the almost invariably
excessive display of electric phenomena are characteristic of great
hailstorms. It is very probable that between the dense clouds lie
masses of saturated, or even supersaturated, almost dust-free air. A
cold hailstone falling through these would accumulate ice in clear,
alternate zones surrounding the nucleus. Large hailstones are gen-
erally spheroidal, small ones conical, with icy bases and a softer apex.
The large hailstones are probably more dependent on electric attrac-
tion, and the small on the impact of descent, for their form and icy
accumulations.

In a thunderstorm or shower, the lower clouds are generally nega-
tively and the upper positively electrified. Before a hailstorm clouds
of great significance may be observed, which may be described as tur-
reted cumulus or cumulo-stratus. They are quite distinctive of hail-
storm weather, though of course the hailstorm may not occur in the
district where they are seen. They consist of hard-looking, sharply
defined, generally white, and rather small masses of cloud, with pro-
jections towering upward and rather broader at the top than at the
base, or equally broad. These peculiar clouds are worthy of note with
the view of forecasting the probable occurrence of hailstorms.

Vapor, when it ceases to exist aS a gas in the air, assumes several

1The height of cumulus cloud may often be well observed and measured not
only from the plain, but on mountains. The tower of cumulus cloud often exceeds
10,000 or 15,000 feet, and in great storms may be 25,000 to 40,000 fect from base to
summit. Both observations from the earth and balloon ascents supply evidence to
this effect.

different forms which are only obscurely understood. There seems to
be a stage between the gaseous and the misty in which vapor is
condensed into very minute transparent motes or into a condition
corresponding to the critical state, the viscous interval, observed by
Andrews in carbon dioxide under great pressure. Just above this
critical point this gas behaved to some degree like its vapor and liquid
below it with regard to pressure. The behavior of water vapor under
varying pressure and when near saturation at different temperatures
would be an interesting though difficult subject for research. Dry
vapor is regarded by some experimental observers as diathermanous,
like air; yet we certainly find that what seems to be invisible trans-
parent vapor does largely arrest radiation from the earth. Therefore,
it would seem much of the vapor of the air, when near saturation, must
be in a condition bordering on mist or finely divided water. Only
beyond a certain size, maybe, or when dust is thick, do the particles
become large enough to give the effect of haze. It often happens that
a thermometer freely exposed to the sky on a fine night suddenly ceases
to fall, and rises several degrees without any apparent cloudiness or
diminution of the luster of the stars, but this rise, in the present writer’s
experience, is a good indication of approaching rain after dry weather.
Whether the screen in the upper air which reflects the radiation from
the earth be a thin cloud or else vapor in a state of inchoate condensa-
tion, has not yet been ascertained.

Haze, fogs, and clouds are caused by the tendency of vapor to con-
dense upon solid particles below a certain temperature. A change of
state from vapor to liquid or liquid to solid occurs much earlier in the
presence of ‘‘free surfaces” of other bodies than where these are absent.
Saturated air, as we call it, can hold no more vapor in ordinary condi-
tions, but apart from solids and dust particles it could contain much
more vapor without precipitation. Similarly, if water could be heated
by itself apart from solids and contained gases, it would rise high
above the boiling point without boiling, and would evertually explode; ~
so also the droplets of a cloud do not freeze, though many degrees
below the freezing point, until they touch a solid object. Dust in the
air offers the free surface which is required for condensation. Differ-
ent kinds of dust differ greatly in the power of compelling deposition.
Sulphur, magnesia, and common salt are, in the laboratory, at any rate,
powerful fog producers. In the open air sulphur seems to have little
appreciable effect; but salt, which is hygroscopic, or damp-attracting,
and pervades the atmosphere, plays an important part. Smoke, again,
or finely divided tarry matter, greatly favors fog formation, owing,
probably, to its strong radiative capacity and to its coating the water
globules so as to prevent evaporation.

Suppose the motes of dust or salt in heterogeneous air to be radiat-
ing freely, and therefore to be colder than the air, and suppose each of
them to be frequently brought in contact with filaments of air and
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 227

vapor at a higher temperature than the average, then it is conceivable
that momentary deposition and reevaporation may occur. The result
would be haze. With fairly homogeneous masses of air, as with a
west wind, the contact of warm and cool air occurs here and there on
a much larger scale and at once produces massive clouds, owing to the
quick growth of particles in a moist air brought in block below the
dew-point by ascent or otherwise. The interchange between differing
air masses is in this case by large columns instead of by infiltration
and filaments. The steam leaving the escape valve of a boiler at high
pressure is at first invisible, then bluish and semitransparent, like haze,
then opaque and white, like cloud. The influences which cause haze
maintain the vapor in the second stage; it passes perpetually from
molecular invisibility to the verge of particulate visibility and back to
invisibility by swift evaporation. Clouds, on the contrary, result from
cooling in large masses, as by ascent, and the humidity is too great to
permit so rapid a return to the condition of vapor within their borders.
When they evaporate they become invisible at the edge without per-
ceptibly passing through the stage of haze.

Why the process of change of size of the particles differs so much
in different states of weather is by no means clear.

Haze has long been a meteorological problem. If it be vapor, why
does it so frequently occur in the driest weather?. If it be dust,
why should dust continue to affect the atmosphere in such excessive
quantities during particular periods, often in calm weather, and with a
gentle wind from uninhabited areas, either sea or land? The moistest
winds are generally the clearest, the driest are the haziest.'_ More-
over, there is a thick haze which sometimes persists for many days in
spring or Summer in England, and neither increases nor diminishes per-
ceptibly during the night, when radiation is active. In such weather
the air is dry, and the wind, if any, commonly a light air from between
east and north. Since neither the sun’s heat nor the nocturnal cold
affects it, we must ascribe it to one of two things—the presence of a
large quantity of dry dust in an unusual state, or the development of
vapor condensation in some unusual way, so as to depend little on the
general temperature. On the top of Snowdon, 3,300 feet, the present
writer has observed haze as thick as on the ground level, and extend-
ing 1,000 or 2,000 feet above the summit. It was similar, though less
in degree, to the obscuration described in the annals of last century
aS jiaving covered Europe for months after the great eruption of a
volcano in Iceland in 1783. Mr. Conway has recently observed high
above the Himalayas a sudden haze overspreading the sky like the
smoky haze seen near a large city in England. The explanation prob-
ably is that the haze depends on the relative temperature of mixed
portions of strata of air, and much less on the general air temperature.

Aitken has shown that when the wind blows from inhabited places

1In England.

228 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH,

there is both more haze and more dust than when it blows from the sea
or from uninhabited country, and in Switzerland a thick veil of haze
seemed to hang in the air between the observer and the inountains
on all days when the number of particles was great, and it became
very faint when the number was small. When the wind blew from
the plains the air was thick; when from the Alps, clear. Similarly, at
Ben Nevis, on the northwest coast of Scotland, a northwest wind was
clearest, a southeast wind haziest, and the dust particles were gen-
erally more numerous according to the amount of haze. ‘Of ‘ purify-
ing areas’ the Mediterranean gave for lowest values 891, the Alps 381,
the Highlands 141, and the Atlantic 72 particles per cubic centimeter.
Dampness of the air was found to increase the effect of dust, so that
nearly double the number of particles are required to produce the same
amount of haze when it is dry than when it is dampish.” When the
depression of the wet-bulb thermometer below the dry bulb was 2° or
more the transparency was roughly proportional to the wet bulb
depression; that is, to the dryness of the air. ‘‘The nearness of the
vapor to the dew-point seems to enable the dust particles to condense
more vapor by surface attraction and otherwise, and thus by becoming
larger they have a greater hazing effect.”. The number of dust parti-
cles in square centimeter lengths of 10 to 250 miles required to pro-
duce complete haze in air giving different wet-bulb depressions was
calculated to be as follows:

2to 4 | 12,500, 000, 000
4to 7 17, 100, 000, 000
7 to 10 22, 600, 000, 000

Since more particles are required to produce haze in dry than in
dainp weather, it becomes the more remarkable that thick haze is so
common in dry weather and generally absent in a moist atmosphere.

The observations of the present writer for many years have shown
that haze is most apt to occur when there is infiltration or mixture of
differing air currents, and indeed that it generally expresses the juxta-
position and mixture of winds. A steady wind extending to the
upper clouds is very seldom hazy, and, on the other hand, hazimess may
be taken as a sign of the existence of another wind above that pre-
vailing near the ground, or of variable currents. So much is this the
case that in southern England a hazy or misty east wind signifies gen-
erally a rather short period of its prevalence, but a clear east wind
means continuance. Of course care must be taken to be situated on
the windward side of thickly inhabited districts in making such fore-
casts. It seems, therefore, that when haze is not due to a large amount
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 229

of dust, it must arise from some effect of the mixture of different cur-
rents. A wind from the Atlantic on the west coast of Great Britain
generally has a west wind above it, and is fairly homogeneous, but
an east wind generally has to encounter and drive back a westerly or
southerly wind, and has an opposing current within 3 to 7 miles above.
There must in these cases be a great deal of mixture of portions of air
of different humidity, temperature, and electrical tension. The contig-
uous parcels of air produce at a number of points momentary deposi-
tion of vapor on dust particles, and the resulting effect is haze. The
dew point is attained in the molecular environment by momentary
contact of cold, dry, dust-bearing with moist, warmer, less dusty air.

It' is well to bear in mind the large extent and small depth of the
whole of the lower region of winds. Currents of air, say within 25,000
feet of the surface, extended over a territory 400 miles square, would
be represented by a layer of water an inch deep in a basin 80 inches
square.

On the east coast of Scotland an east wind often brings a thick haze
which may last two or three days, and is followed by rainy weather.
But a much less thick blue haze prevails during fine weather, with hght
or variable easterly breezes, both in Scotland and England. The
density of the haze in these conditions depends less on the number
of dust particles than on the mixture of differing currents and on the
moisture and warmth of the one current, the coldness and moisture of
the other. There is no reason for supposing that a wind blowing from
the polar regions and over the breadth of the North Sea is heavily
charged with dust, yet the haziness is as great looking seaward as over
the land of Berwickshire or Fife.

The clear air of continental climates, such as the European and North
American, is partially explained by the moderate amount of dust, the
infrequency of a condition approaching saturation in the lower air, and
the absence generally of local winds such as are produced by a varied
distribution of land and sea. Haze is very often the result of the pas-
sage of air over water of a lower temperature, and the difference of

the temperatures may decide whether the obfuscation shall be haze,

fog, mist, or fine rain. No amount of dust is in general competent in
a dry, uniform air to produce apppreciable haze beyond what is due
to its own particles. Thus in Colorado there is often a great deal of
dust in the air, but the air is clearer at such times than it commonly is
in England; in the Punjaub dust winds obscure the air for a long dis-
tance; in the Sahara Desert there is often thick dust, but the hazing is
not great except with strong wind; when, however, this dust is blown
far out over the Atlantic, the haze becomes very considerable, and is a
common phenomenon about the Cape de Verde Islands. Towns, again,
such as Paris and Pittsburg, which produce a great deal of dust, by
the test of the dust counter, are not affected by haze in clear, dry
weather, and even London, in some states of the air and very often at
230 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

night, is only covered by a barely perceptible light haze. But coal
smoke, commonly has the effect of causing a very persistent haze, and
this, in the case of London, spreads conspicuously with the wind to
places distant 100 miles or more. Coal smoke, we must remember, is
accompanied by a good deal of water vapor and sulphurous acid. Gas
and wood, when burned in large towns, produce no fog and very little
haze, though the dust counter might show as many particles as where
coal is burned. Dustin general may therefore be acquitted of taking
an important part in producing any but a light, thin haze, except where
there is a mixture of currents at different temperatures, and then some
haze would in most instances be produced in any case by the normal
average amount of very fine dust which exists everywhere in the atmos-
phere. In clear, homogeneous air, even near saturation, much dust or
smoke may be added to the air without causing haze; in dry, hazy air
much dust may be added without much intensifying the haze. In cer-
tain conditions of wind and weather much haze may exist without an
abnormal quantity of dust, and, except on rare occasions, there is
always enough dust, maybe of almost molecular dimensions, in the
lower strata of the air to admit of precipitation of moisture where con-
ditions are otherwise favorable.! A great deal of this dust probably
consists of chloride of sodium, or sea salt.

The following instances may serve to show how haze and cloud are
successively formed by a conflict of differing currents of air. St. Fil-
lans Hill is a small, steep, isolated, conical hill about 300 feet in height,
standing in the middle of the valley of the upper Harn, in Perthshire,
about 2 miles from the lower end of Loch Earn, and flanked by moun-
tains about 2,000 feet high on each side of the valley. The author was
on the summit about 5 o’clock one evening in August,” when the breeze,
which had been blowing freshly from the west, with a clear air, sud-
denly began to slacken, and in about five minutes dropped altogether.
Then down the valley, eastward, a blue haze began swiftly to climb the
glens tributary to Strathearn, and the whole air eastward grew obscure.
The calm only lasted a little more than two minutes, and then suddenly
a strong wind from the east set in, and soon the air westward as well
as eastward had turned thick. The east wind continued, and in a few
minutes the tops of the hills rising precipitously from Strathearn to a
height of about 2,000 feet were obscured with cloud banners which
grew continuously, and descended till in about two hours not only the
hills above alevel of about 1,000 feet, but the whole sky, was covered with
gray clouds. The duration of the neutral calm corresponded with the
time usually occupied, according to my observations in the neighbor-
hood of London, by a moderate east wind in driving back the opposing
current. At Richmond, and between Richmond and London, such a

prevalence of haze and fog in and near London.

change is signalized in the neutral band of calm by a dense yellow
haze, producing great darkness in winter, the result of a banking up of
smoke to some altitude, together with the condensation of vapor by the
mixture of currents differing in temperature. The darkness in such a
band lasts much longer with lighter winds, and I have known a west
wind to prevail at Richmond simultaneously with an east wind in
London, both without fog, while at Wandsworth a calm continued
for many minutes with dense, almost nocturnally black smoke fog, the
pressure in each direction being apparently equal.

FOG, SMOKE, GASEOUS AND SOLID IMPURITIES IN THE AIR.
FOG.

Fog is the result of one or both of twe principal causes. The first is
active radiation into space from the earth and from the air contiguous
to it, and the second is a mixture of winds and currents, or of vapor
and air at different temperatures.

1. Radiation fogs occur commonly when the atmosphere above the
lowest stratum is cold, dry, and nearly still, and when the lowest
stratum is greatly cooled by contact with the cold radiating earth, and
therefore precipitates vapor into the form of minute globules of water.
These globules themselves have a large radiative capacity, so that they
tend further to reduce the temperature of the air in which they float,
which has no such capacity. The stratum of fog so formed, not extending
very many feet above the ground, fails to reflect much of the heat radi-
ated from below, and quickly disperses, by radiation into space, what-
ever heat it absorbs. Thus earth and fog continue rapidly to part with
their heat through the clear sky into space. The stratum of fog often
grows in height and density through the night, and continues till about
noon of the following day, or disperses in the late hours of the morn-
ing. If extended over a plain and watched from a height above the
upper level, a fog of this character, in somewhat damp and not typical
radiation weather, may be seen gradually to move irregularly upward
under the influence of the morning sun, and in various directions to
present prominences like those of the upper edge of cumulo-stratus.
Smoke issuing from a tall factory chimney rises through and above the
fog, but in a very short time falls back upon its surface and meanders
like a dark river on a white ground.! The persistence of the fog
depends upon the coldness of the ground, which is shielded from the
sun, and upon the very large difference of temperature, sometimes 10
degrees or more, between the fog and the stratum of air a few feet
above it. When, however, the sun’s heat absorbed by the water
particles exceeds the heat lost by radiation, the fog lifts, that is, its
uppermost stratum rises, owing to diminished specific gravity, and

'These observations were taken during the prevalence of a ground fog, in the
country surrounding the Malvern Hills, in February, 1890.

232 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

either clears at once or remains for some time as a light blue haze.!
The strata below it, submitted to the same influence, successively rise
and take its place, and the evaporated moisture mingles with the gen-
eral air.

Fogs of this kind locate themselves in low-lying valleys, basins, and
plains, for the air, chilled by contact with the radiating ground, sinks
by gravitation into such situations and in them is least likely to be
disturbed. Sometimes a white fog may be seen pouring down an epen
and rather steep ravine like water.’ Slopes of hills, especially their
southern sides, some hundreds of feet above the plain, are comparatively
free from these fogs, and are much drier and warmer during their
prevalence than lower places in the neighborhood. Such an elevation
is more favorable on this account to the human constitution; both the
daily and yearly thermometric range is much smaller. Dense fog and
frost often remain throughout the day on the northern side of hills
when the southern slope is bathed in sunshine. This has been observed
on several occasions on Hindhead, Surrey, the air in the fog keeping
much colder than the air above it and on the southern slope.

In the still air which precedes and accompanies radiation fogs the
number of dust particles is high above the average, owing partly to
their becoming gathered by undisturbed precipitation into the lowest
strata. On several occasions when the dust particles were counted
they amounted to between 45,000 and 80,000 per cubic centimeter.
Each of these is a nucleus for the deposition of vapor. The water
particles are so small that they evaporate before touching solid objects
during the daytime, the objects being warmer than themselves. For
this reason these fogs have no wetting effect. In a fog, when objects
were invisible at 100 yards distance, 19,350 droplets sometimes fell on a
square inch per minute, but the average was much less than this, and
the smallest number about 1,900 per minute? The large number of
particles favors the formation of fog. Considerable numbers of living
organisms no doubt exist among the water particles of the fog, but are
not known to be a cause of ill-health in the country remote from towns.
Nor is great cold combined with fog productive of much illness in the
country. In smoky towns the case is far different. Thus, in London
the death rate was raised in a single fortnight, from January 24 to
February 7, 1880, from 27.1 to 48.1 per thousand. The fatality and
prevalence of respiratory diseases were enormously: increased. The
excess of deaths over the average in the three weeks ending February
14 was 2,994, and in the week ending February 7 the deaths from
whooping cough were unprecedentedly numerous—248—and from bron-
chitis numbered 1,223. At least 30,000 persons must have been ill

1This haze may be taken to be caused by the aggregated nuclei of dust left after
evaporation of the water which condensed upon them.

‘This was seen by the author with remarkable distinctness near Alum Bay, in the
Isle of Wight.

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 233

from the combined effect of smoky fog and cold. The present author
was in London during the whole period, and noted especially the unus-
ual number of days during which the darkness and stillness continued,
and the tenacity with which the fog clung to the cold ground on the
shady sides of squares and streets, when a warm, gentle current from
the south improved and cleared the air above a height of 20 or 30 feet.!
The large excess of carbonic acid, of sulphurous acid, and of micro-
organisms and effete organic products was partly concerned in these
ill effects, but the factor of greatest importance was the finely divided
and thickly distributed carbon or carbonaceous matter, which irritated
the breathing passages and lungs. The results corresponded rather
closely with the more gradual ill effects of dusty trades. The lungs of
aman who has spent his life in London or Manchester are found, post
mortem, to be choked with black matter. In some parts of London
there is sometimes no more light at noon than in the darkest night.
After a fortnight of dense fog the deaths in London for one week, end-
ing January 2, 1892, exceeded by 1,484 the average number, being at
the rate of 42 per 1,000. Increases took place in the following diseases:
Measles, 114 per cent; whooping cough, 173; phthisis, 42; old age, 56; -
apoplexy, 58; diseases of the circulatory system, 106; bronchitis, 170;
pheumonia, 111; other respiratory diseases, 135; accidents, 103.
These results are in the main attributable to the concentration of the
ordinary constituents of London air, with moisture and intense cold to
help their deadly work. The majority of the fatal cases were in
weakened constitutions, though many were among the robust. The
experience of large towns always is that the power of recovery after
illness is much less within their confines than in the country. In the
fog the evil influences of town air are many times multiplied. The
blackest fogs, which are local, are the result of variable or opposing
currents which carry up the discolored mass to a height of hundreds
of feet, where they condense their moisture in a stratum of unusual
thickness or height. By a converging flow of currents, a huge column
of blackened fog particles rises vertically to a height where it may
remain or whence if may move slowly from place to place. A fog need
not always be resting on the ground, but may hang after the manner
of stratus cloud at some level, often a few hundred feet above it. This
happens when the ground is not much colder than the air. The smoke
of a steamer may be seen sometimes thus to form a dark streak, remain-
ing about the same level for an hour or more. That domestic fires at
least rival manufacturing works in the production of dark fogs is
proved by the intense darkness which has prevailed in London on Sun-
days, and once on Christmas Day. Factory fires are out on Sundays,
but domestic fires are larger and more numerous. Smoky fogs invade
houses and even warm rooms, showing that many of the nuclei are
solid particles large enough visibly to obstruct light even when dry.

234 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

At a distance of 10 miles from London, the smoky particles are small
and show quite a thick haze in a room with a fire, when a gentle cur-
rent is moving from the town. Professor Frankland has shown that
if a little smoky air be blown across the surface of water evaporation
is retarded 80 per cent. The water globules may be similarly coated
with tarry matter, which hinders the warmth of the sun from evaporat-
ing them. Moreover, every particle of carbon is a good radiator and
in the early morning tends to increase the cold in the air around it;
moisture is deposited upon it, in the opinion of the present writer, and
can only with difficulty evaporate, so long as radiation is active and
while the heat and light of the sun are stopped by smoke. The effect
of finely divided carbon in stopping light may be tested by holding a
piece of glass for a few moments above the flame of a candle; the
black film deposited enables us to look at the sun easily, and it appears
well defined, like a red orange, as in a fog.

The imperfect combustion of coal is the cause not only of fogs being
specially dangerous to life, but of their persistence in duration far beyond
those of the surrounding country. The removal of coal smoke would
Inean much less fog and much less evil in that which remained. Cities
which use wood as fuel, or anthracite, or gas, or oil, are no more visited
by fogs than the surrounding country, although the fine “dust” above
them is, according to Aitken, very greatly in excess of the normal.

Pittsburg had a black climate till it used natural gas, and thencefor-
ward has had a clear air, and no special liability to darkness and fog.
In London, of 9,709,000 tons of coal used annually, about 1 per cent
escapes into the air unburnt and 10 per cent is lost in other volatile
compounds of carbon. The bright sunshine, compared with that of
Kew, 9 miles distant, was, in the four years 1883-1886, 3,925 hours,
against 5,713 at Kew, and about 6,880 at St. Leonards, about 80 miles
distant. From November, 1885, to February, 1886, inclusive, the sun-
shine in London was 62 hours, at Kew 222, and at Hastbourne 300.

Town fogs contain an excess of chlorides and sulphates, and about
double the normal, or more, of organic matter and ammonia salts.

During the last fortnight of February, 1891, the previously washed
roofs of the glass houses at Chelsea and Kew, the former just within,
and the latter just outside, London, received a deposit from the fog,
which was analyzed and gave the following results:

The weight of the deposit was at Kew 30 grams in 20 yards. At
Chelsea the same area gave 40 grams, which is equivalent to 22
pounds to the acre, or 6 tons to the square mile. <A large proportion of
the deposits of fog in smoky towns clearly arises from the imperfect
combustion of coal. On plants the deposit is sticky, like brown paint,
and is not washed off by water. A country fog is harmless in a green-
house; a town fog most destructive, killing soft-wooded plants, and
greatly damaging others. A very large number of plants will not
thrive in smoky towns. In Manchester, the deposit collected from
aucuba leaves gave 6 to 9 per cent of sulphuric, and 5 to 7 per cent of
_ hydrochloric acid, mostly in a state of combination. Three days’ fog
deposited per square mile 14 hundredweights of sulphuric acid and 15
hundredweights of blacks.

Among the results of smoky air in towns may be mentioned: The
discouragement of cleanliness and ventilation; the constant deficiency
of light; the damage to plant life, so that only a few trees and plants
can live; the destruction and disfigurement of stone, cement, iron,
paint, wall papers, clothing, etc., and the depressing effect of dirt and
blackened streets on the people; losses to artists of all kinds who
depend on light; the lowered vitality of a large portion of the popula-
tion, and a contributory influence toward the rapid degeneration and
extinction of town families. —

In London the extra expenditure entailed is about £1 a head, er
more than the value of all the coal burnt in houses. The extra wash-
ing, painting, and repairs, and the loss of unburned carbon, etc., are
among the principal items in the account.

The intensity of the ground fog depends largely on the amount of
cooling which the earth has previously undergone. At the beginning
of February, 1880, the ground in London was hard frozen with the
intense frost which had prevailed for some days. <A moist southerly
current supervened and the temperature rose several degrees above
the freezing point. On the shady side of squares the fog then pro-
duced between the ground and 10 or 20 feet above it was so dense that
at 10 a. m. a lamp-post 44 yards distant was invisible. In an ordinary
thick fog, such as that of January 11, 1888, objects are visible at thir-
teen times that distance. Above the shallow stratum of ground fog the
air was nearly clear and the smoke escaped.

Such fogs are due partly to radiation into space, but also largely to
the mixture of the warm current with air which has become cold by
contact with the ground, and to radiation toward the ground.

All radiation fogs disperse or greatly diminish when the sky becomes
clouded and reflects some of the warmth radiated from the ground.
They are not formed under a cloudy sky.

2. Fog is frequently produced, sometimes on an enormous scale, cov-
ering an area exceeding that of the British Isles, by the mixture of
opposite currents of small velocity. The condition of atmosphere often

236 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

resembles that which produces haze in summer; a slow infiltration of
currents of different temperatures brings different lamine into contact.
A cold earth and a sky clear above the low clouds increase the inten-
sity of such a fog, but are not necessary to its existence. A southerly
wind is too warm to produce fog by itself unless it meets with a cold
surface, and a northerly wind is too dry by itself to be reduced below
the dew-point. When, however, two opposite currents, one of which is
colder than the other, diffuse into each other slowly, as when the colder
current over an extensive area sinks into the warmer current below it,
a fog may be produced which is less thick than a radiation fog, but
may continue with little change through several days and nights, and
commonly declares its character by the height to which it extends
and by its moisture. It deposits much more moisture on trees, etc.,
than most radiation fogs, and, though no visible mist or rain may fall,
the ground under trees often becomes very wet. Thus precipitation of
moisture is increased in forests. In cold climates or at high levels
every exposed object accumulates ice. A wet or mixture fog disap-
pears under cover, and is thinner in large towns than in the country,
for the particles of which it is composed are almost pure water and
evaporate when the air is a little raised in temperature. On moun-
tains in Great Britain wet fogs are very common, and may occur with
strong wind; moisture or ice is deposited on the windward side of all
objects. Continuous damp mist may be produced in Great Britain by
a northeast wind blowing beneath a damp southwest or south current,
and such mists produce very disagreeable weather. In September and
the first half of October, 1894, southern England was immersed for
weeks in a mist so produced. The northeast wind was not of very
distant origin, and, not being dry, its mixture with the very damp
southerly current overlying it produced dense mist, cloud, and occa-
sional rain.

Many fogs, such as those over rivers or valleys, and over the cold
ocean current near the Bank of Newfoundland, are due partly to mix
ture and partly to radiation. The sea fog originates in the cooling of
air by contact with the colder surface of water and by mixture with
the cold air which lies near the water. At many coast places on a hot
summer day a sea fog frequently comes up on a cool breeze which
mixes with the warm air above it from the land. On the other hand,
when a sheet of water is much warmer than the air above it, a thick
mist or fog may be formed, which is largely condensed steam.

Fog is less common in summer in the interior of continents or of large
islands than on the coast, but in winter, owing to the greater loss of
heat by the surface of the earth than by the surface of the sea, fog is
more common inland. In many countries in the temperate zone the
stratum of cloud or fog does not lie often upon the ground, but at a
height of hundreds or thousands of feet; the sky remains quiet and
overcast for days and weeks together. The elevation of the cloud,
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 237

which would be fog on the ground, depends on the height at which the
dew-point of the air is reached, or else on the height of the boundaries
of a lower and upper current differing in temperature. The lower air
is too dry to permit the condensation of vapor within its borders. A
warmer and moister upper current condenses vapor by contact with
the cold upper boundary of the lower air. The cloud canopy prevents
excessive loss of heat from the surface of the earth.

A mist, in the usual meaning of the term, is the name given to very
small rain, or to a cloud of which the globules are large enough to fall
perceptibly. Near the surface of the earth it seldom, if ever, grows
from radiation fog or from the haze of anticyclonic conditions, but
very frequently is a result and direct growth from wet or mixture fogs.
It may be considered as fine rain, which falls from a cloud undergoing
cooling and consequent aggregation of particles. In hilly country
near the sea, where the wind arrives after having blown over a large
breadth of warm ocean, misty rain is very common.

At Kingairloch the number of dust particles was always very low in
such weather, showing that the majority were being used up by the
mist. The transparency of the air, or ‘‘ visibility,” so often preceding
rain is due first to the paucity of dust particles brought by an ocean
wind which is made purer than it otherwise would be by the clouds
and rain of the area from which it blows; secondly, to the homogeneity
of the air and the tendency to form large cloud globules or drops of
rain when near saturation, the proportion of vapor to dust particles
being high.

In quiet winter weather, a long-continued damp mist or else a very
fine steady rain has, in the present writer’s experience in England,
preceded intense cold, and may be supposed with great probability
to be caused by the gradual descent of very cold air upon the lower

strata.
PARTICLES SUSPENDED IN THE AIR.

The atmosphere contains an immense number of substances sus-
pended in it in the form of visible and invisible dust, but only a small
proportion of these require attention as affecting human life. Deserts,
dry and sandy tracts, and wind-swept plains yield a continual supply
of fine motes of silica, aluminium silicate, calcium carbonate, calcium
phosphate, ete. Volcanoes pour forth sand, fine mud, sulphur, sul-
phurie acid, silicon glass, etc., into the upper air, by which they are
carried over all quarters of the globe. Meteors and small aerolites
burn up as they daily pass through the high and rare atmosphere at
heights from 30 to 200 or even 300 miles, and the products of their
combustion, iron oxide, magnesia, silica, or other fine dust, fall impal-
pably toward the ground. Clouds of unburnt carbon perpetually rise -
from towns, factories, steamships, and scattered houses; in manufac-
turing districts and towns particles of iron, steel, stone, and clay are
abundant; so are fragments of vegetable tissue, cotton, hair, wool,

a
238 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

skin, and starch. Even coal gas, which shows no smoke in its com-
bustion, fills the air where it is burnt with millions of particles in
every cubic foot. The whole atmosphere is pervaded by particles of
salt derived from the spray of the seashore and of ocean waves. In
summer, pollen seeds, odors of earth, trees, flowers, and hay, and the
spores of an immense variety of fungi float on every breeze. Most of
these have no special interest, but some of the spores and pollen are
capable of setting up great irritation in the human system, almost
amounting to diseases. Hay fever is the result of the action of grass
pollen on the breathing passages.

LIVING GERMS IN THE ATR,

Much more important are the living germs, the microbes, bacteria,
fungi, and molds, which are found very unevenly distributed, and
especially abundant at low levels in populous places and habitations.
Miquel found in a cubic meter at Montsouris Observatory, near Paris,
85 of these organisms in spring, 105 in summer, 142 in autumn, and 49
in winter. On other occasions the numbers were 70, 92, 121, and 53,
respectively.

In the Rue de Rivoli, in Paris, the number was about 5,500. In air
collected at 2,000 to 4,000 meters high (about 6,300 to 13,600 feet) no
bacterium or fungus spore was found. Pasteur exposed 20 flasks of
clear broth in the open country of Arbois, 20 on the Lower Jura, and 20
near the Mer de Glace, at a height of over 6,000 feet. Of the Arbois
flasks, 8 developed organisms; of the Jura, 5; and of the Mer de Glace,
1 only.

Miquel’s experiments proved that microbes were much more abun-
dant in the town than in the country. In rooms the number was eight
times, and in hospitals twelve times the number in the open air. These
experiments refer to hospitals in Paris only. In hot countries, after a
prolonged period of dry hot weather, microbes diminish. In M. Miquel’s
view the places where there are most microbes are centers of infectious
disease; the curves of mortality to a great extent correspond with the
curves of the number of microbes and follow them after a short interval.
In 1 gram of the dust of his laboratory he found 750,000 germs, and
in that of a room in Paris 2,100,000. In the air of hospitals microbes
of suppuration have been found. Devergie found an “immenseamount”
of organic matter in the-air in the vicinity of a patient with hospital
gangrene. Dr. Dundas Thompson found, in the air of a cholera ward,
starch, woolen fibers, epithelium, fungi, or spores of fungi, and vibriones.
Sealy and small round epithelia are found in most rooms, and in large
quantity in hospitals. The dust of a hospital ward at St. Louis con-
tained 36 to 46 per cent of organic matter, largely epithelium cells.
Parkes similarly detected large quantities of epithelium in the air of
barracks and hospitals. In 1 gram of dried earth Miquel found
800,000 to 1,000,000 microbes. Recent research shows the number is
Yi

especially great on the surface near dwellings, and rapidly decreases
with depth, so that at 1 meter down there are few. Ninety per cent of
these soil microbes are bacteria, chiefly in the form of spores. It is
easy to understand how these may be carried into the air, especially in
dry weather, as dust by wind and by evaporative forces.

It has been calculated that in a town like London or Manchester, a
man breathes in during ten hours 37,500,000 spores and germs.

In Berlin an investigator found 3 colonies of bacteria and 16 molds
in 25 liters from an open square, and 37 colonies of bacteria and 33
molds from a schoolroom just vacated. Professor Tyndall exposed for
a short time 27 flasks containing an infusion of turnip, etc., to air on a
ledge of rock above the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland, an altitude over
8,000 feet, and then carried them to a kitchen stove with a temperature
of 50° to 90° F. In the same way 23 flasks were exposed to the air of
a hayloft near the same altitude and placed with the others in the stove,
due precautions being taken in all cases to prevent the kitchen air from
contaminating the flasks. Of the 27 flasks opened in free air not one
showed a sign of organic life; of the 23 opened in the hayloft, 21 were
invaded. Many other experiments in London and elsewhere convinced
him that the air of an ordinary room s;warms with germs of life, and
that if infusions of flesh, fish, or vegetable be exposed even for a short
time to the dusty air they become turbid and putrid within a few days.
Exposed for months to air “optically pure,” that is, deprived of dust,
they remain clear and sweet for months, in fact, do not putrefy at all.
Some of the germs or spores in the air have a very remarkable resisting
power and will germinate after several hours’ boiling; others are killed
in five minutes. The spores of bacillus subtilis, which is common in
hay or in the air of haylofts, is not killed by prolonged boiling. But
bacilli themselves, which are soft and unprotected, are killed by boiling
water within a few minutes. The small size of the germs and bacilli
may be to some degree realized when we note that in Tyndall’s estima- -
tion the number in a single drop of turbid infusion is probably 500,000,000
“many times multiplied.” The evaporation of such a drop would then
conceivably permit the launch into the atmosphere of move than one
thousand million organisms. The natural processes of decay in most

places on the surface of the earth must be incessantly nourishing

immense numbers of microbes in very great variety, and wherever dry-
ing or heating takes place quantities of colonies of all sorts which can
flourish in daylight must be raised into the air and widely disseminated.

Percy Frankland counted the number of microbes falling on a square
foot in one minute in several situations, with the following result:

In experiments made with the object of finding the number of
microbes in a certain volume of air, he found at a height of 300 feet on
Norwich Cathedral, only 7 in 2 gallons; on the gravel near the cathe-
dral, 18; at the top of Primrose Hill, 9; at the foot, 24.

Dr. Fischer found, in experiments made at sea, that at 120 miles
from land, in eleven out of twelve experiments, the air was quite free
from germs; that at 90 miles from land, in seven cases out of twelve,
there were germs, but very few. Practically it appears that at 120 sea
miles distant from land the air is pure and free from microorganic life.

Angus Smith roughly calculated the amount of organic matter, living
and dead, to weigh, in pure air on high ground, i grain in 209,000 cubic
feet; in a bedroom, 1 grain in 64,000 cubic feet; in a closely packed
railway carriage, 1 grain in 8,000 cubic feet.

He obtained some curious results by shaking up air in different places
with water. The air of a cowhouse gave an effect only produced by
fifty to one hundred times the quantity of good air, and contained a
mass of débris, hairs, etc. The air behind houses in streets was worse
than in front of them.

Moisture collected from the air above marshes has been found by
Italian observers to contain multitudes of seeds of alge and of micro-
scopic infusoria. The condensed dew exhibits a surprising quantity of
spores and sporangia.

Other observers agree in noting decaying organic matter in abun-
dance, vaporous and solid, together with living minute forms of animal
and vegetable life, floating in the air; these consist of alge, diatoms,
fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.

The subtilis, or hay bacillus, is always present in the open air, but
the bacilli generally keep to low levels and do not extend so high as
the mold fungi.

Cunningham, at Calcutta, found spores and other cells constantly
present in the free air, usually in considerable numbers. The majority
were living, capable of growth, and seemed independent of moisture
and direction of wind.

Mr. Greenleaf Tucker found that outside the City Hospital of Boston
10 liters of air contained on an average 10 colonies of bacteria, 7 of
molds, in November; 13 of bacteria and 3 of molds in January. ‘The
number of bacteria was less on rainy days. The hospital itself con-
tained few bacteria, owing to constant care and cleanliness, but the
number was much increased after sweeping and bedmaking.

Carnelley found in clean one-roomed houses 180 bacteria per 10 liters;
in dirty houses, 410; in very dirty, 930; in schools, from 300 to 1,250,
according to ventilation; in the Royal Infirmary, Dundee, 10 to 20.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 241

The greater part of the dust of clean habitations, consisting of motes
derived from mineral, vegetable, and animal substances, has little
apparent effect upon health. But it certainly tends to reduce vitality
by some small amount, and gives extra work to the breathing organs.
Consequently, to invalids and delicate persons it is important to reduce
this dust by all reasonable means. A beam of strong light, sunlight
or the electric lamp, shows the air of most inhabited rooms to be so
crowded with dust as to be almost opaque to vision. Aitken found
41,000,000 particles in the cubic inch in a room where gas was burning.
Rooms with polished wooden floors, painted hard plaster, glazed paper,
or wood-paneled walls, and not containing fluffy fabrics, evolve much
less dust. They are more healthy not only on this account, but chiefly
because they provide much less pabulum and protection for the growth
of noxious microorganisms.

De Chaumont found in the air at Paddington and in University Col-
lege Hospital particles composed of the epidermis of hay, of pine wood,
linen, cotton, epithelium, charred vegetables, and minerals.

Tichborne, of Dublin, found in a street 45.2 per cent of organic matter,
and at the top of a pillar 29.7 per cent. Most of it was finely ground
manure.

The spores and mycelium of Achorion schonleinii and of Tricophyton
tonsurans have been found in the air of a hospital for diseases of the
skin.

The surface of the ground in streets, squares, courts, and gardens,
and the sweepings of dwellings and stables; contain swarms of the
germs of the bacillus of tetanus, a disease fatal to man. These chiefly
infest the droppings of various domestic animals, and may be carried
through the air to wounds; commonly they infect by contagion and
not through the air. Drying, light, and putrefying matter do not kill
the bacillus, nor does a temperature of 80° to 90° C. Tetanus has
caused great mortality among soldiers who have lain wounded at night
on the field of battle, probably owing to the lifting of the bacillus by
emanations from the ground and its deposit on open wounds.

SEWER AIR.

Sewer air contains molds, fungi, bacteria, and animal and vegetable
débris. The microbes do not exceed about 6 per liter in a good sewage
system. In ordinary drains, however, they are much more numerous,
and are borne into the interior of houses in company with highly
poisonous gases. The gases of sewers are sulphuretted hydrogen,
ammonium sulphide, carbon bisulphide, a very little marsh gas, com-
pound ammonias, with traces of ptomaines and leucomaines.

AIR OF MINES.

The air of mines contains only a few molds, fungi, and bacteria.
sm 95——16
242 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

GROUND AIR.

Ground air contains microorganisms in abundance, according to
locality and conditions, but has hitherto been little examined. It con-
tains an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide, which is atits maximum
from July to November. The foul air of cesspools is sometimes drawn
into houses through 20 feet of earth.

When organic substances decompose in the air, they are first attacked
by molds, then by bacteria. These last cause odorous gases to be
emitted, which are oxidized by the air. If the air has access to the
substances, aerobic organisms multiply; if only slight access, as in
masses of filth in a drain, anaerobic multiply, such as those of putre-
faction, of tetanus, and of malignant cedema.

ORGANISMS, ETC., IN THE OPEN ATR.

The open air in populous places contains much dust of suspended
matter and many living organisms. Débris from wool, silk, fibers, hair,
feather particles, dried epithelial cells, epidermic scales from the skin,
pus cells, pyogenic microorganisms, fragments of insects, and fecal
particles are among the former, and living minute ova or infusoria,
minute amcebiform organisms, etc., which may even grow in the atmos-
phere, are among the latter. All these are of animal origin. Of vege-
table origin are the following: Soot, fibers, hairs, cells, starch, straw in
powder, spores of molds, fungi, diatoms, and bacteria; living pollen
seeds, spores of fungi, molds, diatoms (which may live and grow in
the atmosphere), and, rarely, mycelium of fungus, alge, bacteria, and
their spores. In woods in September basidiospores are abundant. Of
mineral matter, sodium chloride, or common salt, is always present.

MICROORGANISMS IN ROOMS.

Many living microbes float in the air of all dwelling houses, but in
rooms which are old, overcrowded, and dirty, the numbers are very
much higher. ‘These come for the most part from the sides and floor,
and not from persons, but they are much more numerous when the dust
is disturbed than when the room has been quiet for a short time. In
schools, large numbers of microbes find a nidus under and between
the boards of the floor if these are not close-joined. Bacteria chiefly
abound, but many mold and yeast fungi are also present. The latter
belong more to the external air, the bacteria to the internal air, and
since the bacteria are the heaviest, the air of a room which is left quiet
contains a preponderance of molds and yeasts. Pathogenic or disease
germs are nourished to a great extent by the floors and walls of rooms,
and for this reason the material should be smooth and easily washed.
In schools and places which are frequently crowded, cleansing should
be trequent, and no opportunity of extensive growth of bacterial col-
onies should be tolerated. An inquiry into the relative impurity of air
in differently constructed buildings would be useful.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 243

The clothes of scholars should be clean and washable, and there
should be no crowding together in the class rooms,

SEWER AIR.

Sewer air in sewers of good construction, in good order, and at ordi-
nary temperatures, contains very few living organisms discoverable by
the usual methods. Microbes are not easily given off from sewage
unless it be in a state of fermentation, and those which escape soon
attach themselves to the wet surfaces of the sewer and drains. Yet
there may be microorganisms which are not capable of cultivation
and observation by means hitherto tried, but which are the agents
concerned in the putrefactive and disease-causing changes set up in
organic substances exposed to sewer air.

Moreover, the presence of a very few pathogenic microbes may be
sufficient, when inhaled with the noxious gases in which they float, to
set up typhoid and other dangerous disorders.

It is well to guard against the assumption that negative evidence
proves anything in these cases. The bacilli or organisms of smallpox,
measles, whooping cough, malaria, ete., are either undiscovered or very
difficult to see and to identify. Drinking water which may be clear,
bright, and pronounced by microscopic analysis to be pure and excel-
lent, may poison by the invisible germs of typhoid which it contains.
Analysis of water and of air is sometimes a less trustworthy arbiter
than the senses, or than knowledge of suspicious circumstances.

Often a family lives in a badly drained house for a long time without
suffering anything worse than headaches, diarrhea, sore throat, or loss
of appetite. These ailments may be due either to habitual inhalation
of the poisonous gases, or to the gases joined with slightly virulent
microbes. Depressed vitality gives a strong presumption, if other
conditions are wholesome, that drain air enters the house.

When drains and sewers are out of order, or fermentation is going
on, or where there is old sediment, it is probable that a large number
of microbes of a disease-producing kind are evolved and carried by the
gases and air into houses. The process of decomposition and fermen-
tation sets free small bubbles of gas in the liquid and on the wet surface,
and these bubbles in bursting scatter a number of small particles into
the air. The force with which liquid particles are scattered upward
may be observed in the breaking of minute bubbles such as those
which rise to the surface of a glass of effervescing water. Experi-
ments on various drying and putrefying liquids could hardly fail to
furnish interesting results. There seems to be great probability that
bacteria or their spores are thrown in quantities into the air from
viscous putrefying or fermenting liquids. Certainly a fermenting.
brewer’s vat scatters multitudes of yeast germs into the air, and the
case seems strictly comparable. Ee ot

VAPOR AND ORGANIC MATTER FROM LIVING BODIES.

The lungs and skin together give off about 30 ounces of vapor in the
day, or about 550 grains an hour, enough to saturate about 90 cubic
feet of air at 63° Ff. Estimates naturally differ as to average amounts,
but Professor Foster states that the water given off from the lungs in
the day is about 1.5 pounds and from the skin 2.5 pounds. Vapor in a
room ought not to exceed 4.7 grains per cubic foot at 63° F., or 5 grains
at 65°. This vapor is practically not pure, for it is associated with
minute portions of organic gases and solids, and condenses with them
upon the walls, ceiling, and furniture, whence it emerges again with
organic dust when these are warmer than the air of the room.

Organic matter is given off from the lungs and skin, of which neither
the exact amount nor the composition has been hitherto ascertained.
The quantity is certainly very small, but of its importance there can be
no doubt. It darkens sulphuric acid, decolorizes permanganate of
potash, and makes pure water offensive when drawn through it. Col-
lected from the air by condensation of vapor in a hospital, it is found
to blacken platinum and to yield ammonia; it is therefore nitrogenous
and oxidizable. It has a very fetid smell and is only slowly oxidized
by fresh air. It is molecular or particulate; it contains epithelium and
fatty matter from the mouth and pharynx, sometimes effluvia from
tie stomach. Damp walls, moist paper, wool, and feathers are capable
of largely attracting or absorbing it. Experiment shows that it bears
a nearly constant proportion to the carbon dioxide in inhabited rooms,
so that this gas is conveniently taken as an indicator of the amount of
the organic matterin the air. Since this organic matter has been proved
to be highly poisonous,! even apart from carbon dioxide and vapor, we
may safely infer that much of the mischief resulting from the inspira-
tion of rebreathed air is due to the special poisons exhaled from the
body, their fatal effect being accelerated by the depression of vitality
caused by the gaseous products of respiration and by the want of
oxygen. Air thus organically vitiated and confined in places long
inhabited, which are subject to continual condensation on their sur-
faces, without proper cleansing, appears to play a very large part in
the propagation of disease in man and animals.

The quantity of particulate organic matter given off has been esti-
mated at 30 to 40 grains for each adult. This is certainly sufficient
for the nutriment and sustenance of a very large number of micro-
organisms, which may grow, in the presence of moisture, upon it and
upon other dust deposited upon the walls, floor, and ceiling. Water
through which breath has been passed, and kept at rather a high
temperature, gives off an unpleasant smell, and putrefaction is set up.?
It does not appear to be definitely ascertained whether the breath and

skin actually and normally emit in good health living microorganisms,
either pathogenic or harmless, but the probability is considerable when
we remember that the mouth and air passages are inhabited by various
species, and that warm evaporating surfaces exercise a repulsive force
on minute particles. Foster states that the aqueous product from the
breath is very apt to putrefy rapidly, owing to the presence of micro-
organisms. It is not generally assumed, however, that living microbes
are exhaled to an appreciable extent. The subject is an important
one and demands inquiry, but the ultra microscopic minuteness of the
germs may defeat direct observation. Asto the frequent emission of a
deadly particulate poison, however, no doubt whatever can exist.’ It
is a dangerous and pernicious element in all aggregations, and, com-
bined with carbon dioxide, produces, when in moderate quantity, depres-
sion, headache, sickness, and other ailments; when in large quantity,
as in the Black Hole of Calcutta, and in various prisons of which there
is record, rapid death in the majority and fever in the survivors. Its
action upon the development of living germs when deposited upon
outside objects has not been ascertained. Probably it may be favor-
able to some and unfavorable to others. Some of the most deadly
human and animal diseases certainly are capable of virulent growth in
their presence, and of passing’ more easily in a potent condition through
air in which they are abnormally concentrated.

ORGANIC EMANATIONS FROM THE SICK,

Hospitals, when not well ventilated, contain a very large quantity of
organic matter floating in the air and deposited on walls and floors.
This gives rise, in the most impure air, to hospitai gangrene and ery-
Sipelas, increases the severity of many diseases, and prolongs conva-
lescence. Gangrene having once appeared, is very difficult to get rid
of. Thorough ventilation and hygiene of the building where the sick
are received and treated prevents these evils from arising.

ORGANIC EMANATIONS FROM THE SKIN.

Sweat contains salt, lactate, butyrate, and acetate of ammonium; cal-
cic phosphate, ferric oxide, volatile fatty acids, e. g., sometimes valeri-
anic and caproic acid, and sometimes leucin. Perspiration gives off
into the air a large quantity of vapor, about 2 pounds in the twenty-
four hours and _ a little over 1 per cent of this quantity of solid organic
matter. latty acids, inorganic salts, neutral salts, ammonia, and par-
ticles of epidermis are constantly passing from the skin into the air.
In the sick the matter emanating from the skin is often largely
increased and is very offensive.

1Some recent experiments of Smith and Haldane seem to show that carbon dioxide
is the only element of mischief, but the conditions of ordinary life are so various and
so difficult to imitate in experimental investigation that the inquiry needs to be
widely extended.

246 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The poisonous matter emanating from the skin of healthy people
and animals, if thrown back upon the body by accidental or artificial
means, causes death in a short time, not only in the case of rebreathing,
but in cases where the pores of the skin are stopped, as by gold leaf or
plaster of paris. Sheep have died in large numbers after being dipped
in a resinous compound. The poison returned upon the body by the
stoppage of the pores by finely divided soot may be a cause of the
excess of cancer in chimney sweeps. Dirty bedding used after having
been rolled up for two months has given fever.

The relation of the organic matter of respiration to disease can not be
doubted, and, indeed, it seems probable that much of the mortality of
infant and adult hfe may be due to the rebreathing of poison excreted
by breath and skin. These are known to be, mediately or even some-
times directly, a great cause of consumption, pneumonia, and bronchi-
tis. The recent-experiments on the development of typhoid fever by
the respiration of sewer gas lead naturally to the inference that other
poisons besides that of sewer gas may play a very important part in
laying the system open to the attack of disease germs either from
within or from without the body. The chemistry of the expired breath
deserves full investigation in many different cases and circumstances.

Gaseous emanations from sewers, drains, cesspools, and foul refuse
cause diarrhea, vomiting, and prostration, or a low state of health.
Children are more susceptible than adults, and when they breathe the
gases largely diluted may suffer from languor, sore throat, and diar-
rhea. These results may be due simply to chemical or inorganic poi-
soning. Where the specific organism is present, typhoid, epidermic
diarrhea, or diphtheria may result. Well-managed sewage farms do
not seem to cause illness in their neighborhood. Sodden and neglected
farmyards, on the other hand, are both common and pernicious. A
great deal of illness, affecting both man and animals, arises from them.
Thus ‘ circulation,” as in sewage farms, versus ‘‘stagnation,” as in farm-
yards, shows its great superiority, even where other circumstances are
apparently adverse.

The air close to certain crowded burial grounds has had a very bad
effect on people living near them; it has greatly aggravated any disease
from which they suffered.

The effluvia from decomposing corpses produces dysentery, diarrhea,
or a low fever, and in some circumstances diseases of a more severe

character.
SULPHURIC AND HYDROCHLORIC ACIDS.

Sulphuric and hydrochloric acids exist to a small amount in the atmos-
phere, but are not easily discovered except when brought down to the
ground dissolved in mist or rain. Hydrochloric acid is one of the most
soluble gases known, water at ordinary temperature absorbing five
hundred times its volume. At Rothamsted, about 23 miles from Lon-
don, the sulphates in rain were 0.0027 in the summer and 0.0032 in the
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 247

winter; the chlorides were much less in summer than in winter. The
average of sulphates in a certain period of thirteen months was 0.004,
of chlorides 0.0033. Seven samples collected near Horsham, in Sussex,
gave sulphates 0.0048, chlorides 0.0041. A sample collected on Dart-
moor during a gale from the southwest gave the following results:
Sulphates 0.0005, chlorides 0.0087. Proximity to the sea evidently
increases the chlorides and reduces the sulphates. At St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, in central London, the sulphates were 0.0388, the chlorides
0.0179, and the amounts were greater in summer than in winter. The
quantities of these impurities in the air of a large town are much above
the average of the country. The rain does not give acid reaction, but
wherever it is contaminated with soot it becomes distinctly acid after a
few hours. Soot, then, being acid and becoming moistened by rain,
must play an important part in the corrosion of buildings and other
materials on which it has been deposited. MHxperiments were made by
Dr. Russell by means of a conical vessel filled with ice, to ascertain the
amounts of impurities condensed from air in London. The results were
remarkable; sulphates 0.1344, chlorides 0.0506, ammonia 0.006; and in
fogs the amounts were 0.2480 sulphates, 0.1215 chlorides.

ARSENIOUS ACID IN RAIN.

A gallon of rain in the city of London has been found to contain
0.00021 grain of arsenious acid.

AMMONIA IN THE AIR.

Ammonia is always present in the air in minute traces, either free or
combined. It is a chemical compound of 14 parts by weight of nitro-
gen and 3 of hydrogen, and arises from the decomposition of organic
matter. Itislighterthan air in the proportion of 8.5 to 11.47. Although
the quantity rarely exceeds 54 parts in 10,000,000 of air, this is suffi-
cient to be of very high importance to the growth of vegetation, for the
gas is soluble to quite an extraordinary amount in water, and is thus
continually being brought down from the atmosphere in rain and dew.
Brandes found, by evaporation of rain, in each million kilograms from
8 (May) to 65 (January) kilograms of residue, of which ammonia
salts formed a considerable portion.’ Rain, according to Roussingault,
contains about three-fourths of a milligram of ammonia per liter, equal
to 7 kilograms per hectare per annum. Dew contains about 6 milli-
grams, equal to about 29 kilograms per hectare per annum; fog, about
50 milligrams, and in Paris, 138 milligrams. Water dissolves from
700 to 1,000 times its volume of ammonia, according to the temperature.
Representing the quantity of ammonia in rain at Valentia, in Western
Ireland, by 1, the quantity inland in England was 5.94, at Glasgow
60.55. The albuminoid ammonia was: Valentia 1, Manchester 7.38,
London 6.23.

248 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

In summer the amount in the air is highest, in winter lowest. In
large coal-burning towns it is considerably more abundant than in the
country, and is deposited with carbonaceous, sulphurous, and organic
matter on exposed surfaces during the prevalence of fogs. Foggy air
in these towns contains an excess of sulphates and chlorides, but a
still greater excess of organic matter and ammonia salts, often double
the normal. The ammonia contained in the deposit on glass roofs in
Chelsea and Kew after fogs was respectively 1.4 and 1.1 percent. The
processes of combustion, both in manufactories and in domestic fires,
of coal and of coal gas, give rise to ammonia.

Only traces of ammonia are evolved from the lungs, and a little from
the skin and in perspiration.

The smell of ammonia is distinguishable in most stables, but where
strong we may be sure that ventilation is deficient. Main streets,
especially where wooden pavements are used, often smell offensively of
ammonia; on still, dry days the ammoniacal dust is thick in the air,
and in windy weather is biown about in clouds. Analysis has shown
that 95 per cent of the dust from wooden pavements in main London
thoroughfares, consists of horse dung. This is breathed into the lungs
and often produces sore eyes and sore throat. Such pavements should
either be kept scrupulously clean throughout the day or be properly
watered, in order to reduce harmful dust, and an oceasional coating of
tar would not only prevent the emanation of noxious matter, but would
preserve the wood.

Ammonia, being everywhere present in the air and extremely sone
in water, may truly be said to be attached to all exposed surfaces where
moisture is also present; in the neighborhood of human habitations
and decaying animals or vegetable matter it has been found on all
objects; in a room, if a perfectly clean glass be suspended, traces of it
appear after an hour and a half. Evolved in small quantities from the
skin and lungs, it must be deposited with condensed vapors on the
walls, ceilings, and floors of dwelling houses.

NITRIC ACID IN THE AIR.

Nitric acid also pervades the air in minute quantity, and, with ammo-
nia, plays a great part in the development of plants. It results partly
from the combination of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere caused

by thunder storms and partly by the oxidation in loamy soil of the
- ammonia of decomposing organic matter. It seems probable that many
forms of bacteria or molds may be favored in their growth by the
presence, with moisture, of these two nitrogenous substances. Within
human habitations, cow sheds, etc., we must regard the walls, and all
surfaces as covered with a thin top-dressing of moist organic dust and
ammonia. Within the soil ammonia appears to be oxidized to nitrites
by one set of microorganisms, while another set oxidizes nitrites to
nitrates. To the latter the presence of ammonia is a hindrance.

LOCAL GASEOUS IMPURITIES—SULPHURETED HYDROGEN—SEWER AND DRAIN AIR.

When certain animal and vegetable matter undergoes decay, the
small quantity of sulphur which it contains combines with hydrogen
and forms the gas, sulphureted hydrogen, which, even in mere traces,
is very offensive to the sense of smell. It also forms some offensive
organic sulphides. The sulphureted hydrogen gas set free often bears
with it germs of disease, so that it has been treated as a danger signal.
Drain or sewer air, however, does not always contain the gas in appre-
ciable amount, when dangerous germs are being given off, and the
faint smell of an old filth deposit may exceed in morbifie effects the
unpleasant odor cf fresh putrefactive processes. Nor does sewer air,
even if it be poisonous, often contain virulent germs of disease. Dogs
and horses are rapidly prostrated by 1.25 to 4 volumes of sulphureted
hydrogen per 1,000 of air, but men can breathe a larger quantity. In
large doses, nausea, headache, convulsions; in small doses, low febrile
symptoms follow its inhalation. The frequent inhalation of small doses
produces chronic poisoning; 1 per cent is at once destructive of life.

The air over some of the most pestilential marshes in Italy contains
an unusually large quantity of the gas. In mines it produces convul-
Sive, narcotic, and tetanic symptoms.

SULPHUROUS ACID.

Sulphurous acid in the air of cotton and worsted manufactories appar-
ently tends to produce bronchitis and anemia. It destroys vegetation
in the neighborhood of copper works.

CARBURETED HYDROGEN.

Carbureted hydrogen, breathed in small quantities, as in the air of
some mines, does not seem to cause ill effects, and experiment has
shown that for a-short time it can be breathed in the proportion of one
volume to four of air.

HYDROCHLORIC ACID.

Hydrochloric acid vapor is very irritating to the lungs. In some
processes of making steel this gas, with sulphurous and nitrous acids
and chlorine, cause bronchitis, pneumonia, destruction of lung tissue,
and eye diseases among the workers. It destroys vegetation for a long
distance when given off in large quantities from manufactories.

CARBON BISULPHIDE.

Carbon bisulphide vapor, given off in vulcanized india-rubber facto-
ries, produces, in those exposed to it, headache, giddiness, pains in the
limbs, nervous depression or excitement, and complete loss of appetite.

Carbon monoxide is a very poisonous gas arising from the consump-
tion of coal, coke, coal gas, and especially charcoal. Less than 0.5 per
cent is fatal to animals. Fatal consequences from the use of charcoal
Stoves where ventilation is defective are common in some countries.

250 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

Carbonic oxide is given off by iron works, brick fields, copper furnaces,
and cement works. It is dangerously present in the cheap illuminat-
ing gas known as “water gas.”

ORGANIC VAPORS.

Organic vapors of various composition are given off by marshes, wet
forest ground, ‘‘made soil,” soil containing organic matter under warm
sand, and by many manufactories for the conversion of animal refuse,
etc. The effluvia from tanneries, glue and soap works, slaughter-
houses, pigstyes, etc., are apt to lower the health of people living
near them and to aggravate disease.

SOLID ARTIFICIAL IMPURITIES,

Many severe forms of disease, especially of the respiratory organs,
are caused by the dust inhaled in various trades and occupations.
These are generally proportionate to the sharpness and angularity of
the dust and its quantity. Coal dust is among the least harmful.
Among lead miners, bronchitis and lead poisoning; in copper mines,
gastric disorders; in pottery works, in stone cutting, steel grinding, in
flax and cotton factories, in shoddy works, and in metal polishing, lung
diseases are common, and the death rate is high.

Thus the comparative mortality of file makers was 300 compared with
108, that of gardeners; of earthenware .makers 314, compared with
139, that of grocers; of cutlers and scissors makers 229, compared with
129, that of paper makers. The dust of soft woods and of flour seems
to have little bad effect.

As regards phthisis and lung diseases the figures of several trades
are as follows, when compared with fishermen, 100: Carpenters, 170;
bakers, 201; cotton workers, 274; file makers, 396; stone and slate
quarrymen, 294; pottery makers, 565; northern coal miners, 166. The
injuriousness of the dust in cotton mills is increased by the use of
mineral substances for sizing. The mortality of cutlers, etc., from
these diseases is almost as great as that of fishermen from all causes
put tegether, including accidents. The comparative exemption of col-
liers in well-ventilated coal mines deserves investigation, for there
would appear to be some ground for the supposition that it may be
owing to an inhibitive action of this particular dust upon the develop-
ment of tuberculosis; on the other hand, it may be simply through
living in fairly good air of an even temperature, where the specific
germs of phthisis are few or absent. The homes of the men are gen-
erally comfortable, and much larger fires are kept up than in the south,
so that their rooms are dry and well ventilated.

PaRT I1.—CLIMATE, AIR, AND HEALTH.

MALARIOUS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: THEIR CONNECTION WITH
AND DESTRUCTION BY THE ATMOSPHERE —THE INFLUENCE OF
CLIMATH ON NATIONAL HEALTH.

The spreading, infectious, or epidemic diseases in the animal world
and in mankind depend to a very great extent upon aerial influences.!
Microscopic fungi or microbes, the prime causes of these disorders, are
sensitive to dryness, moisture, heat, cold, and sunlight, and a study of
their relations to the atmosphere has led and will lead to results of the
very highest importance to human welfare. Many of them reach the
living body, upon which they lodge, through the air; many are partly
nourished outside the body by the gases and moisture which the air
brings to the seat of their growth. But asa whole the pure atmosphere
works energetically and unceasingly for their destruction; dry air and
sunlight deprive most species of disease organisms of their vitality.
This great generalization may best be appreciated by a brief review
of the principal endemic, epidemic, and pandemic maladies to which
the human race is subject, dealing especially with the manner in which
they are developed, restrained, diffused, or annihilated by the qualities
of the air.

Microbes have been divided into two main classes, aerobic and
anaerobic, the first growing best in the presence of air and the second
growing best in substances and in positions to which free air has no
ACCESS.

Some of the first class, such as the hay bacillus (subtilis), grow best
only with a copious supply of air; some grow better when the air sup-
ply is not large than when free air is admitted; some of the second
class can grow in the absence of free air, but thrive more when some
air is admitted; and others, which are fully anaerobic, grow only when
free air or oxygen is shut off. Hxamples of these last are the bacillus
of symptomatic anthrax, of tetanus, and of the malignant cedema of
Koch.

A large class of bacilli or bacteria are killed by dry air, by light, by
artificial heat, and by prolonged intense cold, but are capable, when
adverse influences act upon them, as by deficiency or inappropriate-
ness of the nutritive medium, of forming spores, minute germs which
are scattered abroad in a condition of far stronger defense, and capable
of resisting for some considerable time prolonged exposure to sun-
light and even to boiling water, to drying, to various antiseptic chem-
icals, and to any possible natural cold. The spore-bearing faculty
belongs to a variety of species of bacilli, both pathogenic and harmless.

1“The atmosphere is the most universal medium or vehicle” of their poisons to
the breathing organs and intestines. (Professor Corfield, medical officer of St.
George’s, Hanover Square, London.)
252 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

Spore formation takes place at temperatures between 16° and 45° C.,
and these are in general the extreme limits. Bacilli which do not
form spores—for instance, those of typhoid fever, glanders, and fowl
cholera—are easily killed outside the body by a number of natural and
artificial agencies. Among these agencies the most efficacious are
drying, exposure to dry air and oxygen, high temperature, sunlight,
the presence of other species of microbes, the poisons evolved by
themselves or by other species, cold weather, exhaustion of their
appropriate nutriment, and various inimical substances which inhibit
growth or actually kill. In the very fatal diseases of cattle known as
anthrax, and when transferred to mankind, as wool sorter’s disease, the
bacilli which infect the blood of the dead animal are killed by mere
drying, without exposure to air; but if the blood be for some little time
exposed to the air, spores are formed which may remain upon the pas-
ture, or upon wool, or hides, or elsewhere, and infect fresh cattle or
human beings at some distant date. The putrefactive process in the
carcass also kills the bacilli, but will not kill the spores if these are
allowed to be formed.

Anthrax is known to be in many cases communicated through the
air from one animal to another or to man, and among wool sorters,
butchers, and others enters the body through a wound, or by the lungs,
or by the alimentary canal.

Spore formation is generally favored by a copious supply of oxygen.
It is a process by which the degeneration and destruction which takes
place in a colony of nonspore-bearing bacilli is prevented, and by which
the seeds are set adrift, to be planted and grow again into bacilli in
more favorable surroundings.

The process of growth from a spore into a bacillus has been experi-
mentally observed in favorable conditions to be completed in periods
varying from half an hour to two hours. The bacillus introduced into
an appropriate medium multiplies by fission at an enormous rate, so
that, for instance, 248 microbes of the pathogenic species Staphylococcus
pyogenes aureus in a cubic centimeter increased to 20,000,000 in twenty-
four hours, and 20,000 bacilli of fowl cholera multiplied in the blood of
a rabbit to about 1,200,000,000 in twenty hours.

Microbes vary greatly in size not only between classes and species,
but between individuals, according to the medium and circumstances
of growth. Ordinary dimensions lie between about 0.5 and 5 micro-
millimeters in length and 0.1 to 0.5 in breadth. The spores are in
many cases much smaller. Clearly, an organic living dust of less than
one thousandth of a millimeter in diameter is capable of existing in
great numbers on very small areas, even on small, almost invisible, dust,
and of being wafted long distances by gentle aerial movements with-
out sinking. In perfectly still air inclosed in a box in the laboratory
Tyndall found that all visible dust sank within three days, and nutri-
ent media then exposed were unaffected by bacterial growths, so that

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 253

the microorganisms originally present must have settled down. Butin
nature not only is such a calm unknown, but processes are continually
taking place which launch fresh organisms into the atmosphere. More-
over, there is good reason to suppose that several disease microbes or
their spores are still lighter than those which have been subject to
similar experiments. The influenza microbe is extremely light. Its
length has been given at 55355 and its breadth at 5:;555 of an inch.
Disease microorganisms have in the laboratory passed from room to
room through the air, and accidentally infected animals inoculated with
other kinds. Light dust falls at so slow a rate through the viscous air
that even in a room the downward motion is scarcely perceptible; yet
in a few hours all the grosser particles are deposited if drafts, move-
ment, and shaking of the room are prevented. Most pathogenic
microbes are carried down with this dust or sink of their own gravity,
and soon subside, but in ordinary conditions there is too much dis-
turbance to permit effective purification by subsidence. The light dust
of the voleano Krakatoa, which was visible as a haze, took a year to
fall even out of the rare upper strata, and many disease microbes are
equally small, and fall still more slowly through the dense strata near
the ground. Particles of smoke may perhaps be compared with the
spores of bacteria, and tobacco smoke not only floats long in the air of
a room, but passes through passages and through chinks into rooms
above and below.

Among animal diseases of an intensely infectious character and dis-
astrous to agriculture, cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia, and foot-and-
mouth diseases are perhaps foremost. Two, at least, of these are com-
municated not only by infected articles, but by transmission through
air for a short distance of particles derived from an actual or previous
case. These diseases, or some of them, have formerly been widely held
to come from some unusual epidemic constitution of the air, but they
are now thoroughly proved to be preventable by the admission of
plenty of external air and rigid precautions against contact or prox-
unity of infected articles. They are frequently spread by attendants
passing from one herd to another without complete systematic disin-
fection; frequently also by imperfectly disinfected sheds. No animal
plague has been proved to be capable of passing effectually through a
long stretch of atmosphere, and the free atmosphere in all cases tends
to diffuse and destroy the poison. There is reason to regard certain
low alluvial lands and swamps as the original breeding grounds of the
saprophytic microbes which cause some of the worst animal plagues,
for these plagues have followed immediately the subsidence of floods
and the drying up of marskes. Since the neighborhood of these places
is not exempt, the organisms concerned must be capable of transport
in a potent state for a short distance by moist air. The filthy condi-
tion and foul, unventilated air in which cattle are kept have also been
Shown to be the cause of their gravest maladies. Tuberculosis in

woe
254 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

animals depends to a very high degree upon the absence of proper ven-
tilation and upon proximity to each other. In the open air and wild
life it does not seem to occur. It has been well ascertained that the
microbes of cattle plague may cling so persistently to infected places
that whitewashing, scraping, and ordinary disinfection may be insuffi-
cient. Similarly, tuberculosis of cattle occurs again and again in par-
ticular stalls, showing that the infective matter remains in a virulent
condition on the walls, floor, or ceiling, and probably infects not only
by contact, but through air. The breath of the animal condensed on
the walls would no doubt form pabulum for the increase of any rem-
nants of a former multitude which might light upon them or emerge
from the pores of the material. In France, epizootics greatly increased
after the introduction of railways, owing to emanations from and con-
tact with incompletely disinfected cattle trucks, yards, sheds, ete., and
the diffusion of infectious cases by increased movement.

INSUFFLATION OF ANTHRAX, ETC.

The inbreathing of the bacilli of cowpox, anthrax, clavelee, and sup-
puration is sufficient to give each of these diseases to sheep and cattle.
But there is no evidence to show that any animal plague is transmissi-
ble through any long distances of air or by the general atmosphere; on
the contrary, animals are in thousands of instances kept within a mile
or less of others which are stricken, and with due precautions remain
well.

. TUBERCULOSIS.

Many of the epizootic diseases which occur in animals may be trans-
mitted to men, but they often occur in a modified form and are either
more or less severe. Some may have been originally human maladies.
Fifteen at least are said to be thus interchangeable. The most im-
portant, widespread, and fatal of these is consumption, phthisis, or
tuberculosis. The bacillus tuberculosis kills about 1 in 8 of the
population of Great Britain and America, and about an equal propor-
tion, one-seventh, according to a very high authority (Hirsch) of the
people of the majority of other civilized countries. It is the greatest
and most constantly present plague of man. It has been considered
ineradicable, constitutional, hereditary, and attributed by many author-
ities to some vice in the atmosphere. Now, we know that it is a nation-
ally self-inflicted, unnecessary, and preventable pestilence, of which the
great and certain prophylactic is pure air in plenty; no foul air, foul
dwellings, andovercrowding. Overcrowding, the rebreathing of expired
air, dirty, dusty dwellings, moist or organically polluted walls, floors,
ceilings, and furniture, and the careless habit of spitting account for a
very large part, perhaps the majority, of cases of consumption. The
breath in fetid air, the emanations from cultures of the bacillus on the
walls, curtains, carpets, etc., and, most potently, the dust of the dried
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 255

sputum itself of consumptives, may infect healthy persons, but mostly
those who have some tissue delicacy or predisposition. But another
very common cause, especially in the largely fatal tuberculosis of infants,
is the use of milk from infected cows. Now, these cows are themselves
diseased through media very similar to those which disarm the human
subject, rebreathed foul air and dirty places; in fact, want of cleanli-
ress, and, above all, want of fresh air.

Well-ventilated cow sheds, and immediate separation of sick animals,
prevent the spread of tuberculosis among cows; thus children are
saved from the danger of tuberculous milk. The breath of the con-

sumptive in well-ventilated rooms may be considered harmless.

Animals have been infected by breathing the dust of sputum dissem-
inated in the air, and no doubt the same mode of infection is very
common among mankind, but only in close association with the sick or
in stuffy apartments. The State board of health of Maine has issued
valuable instructions to prevent the practice of expectoration except
in spittoons, which may be wooden or pasteboard, and should either be
burned daily or cleansed with boiling water and potash soap.

The reduction of consumption by such means and by better regard
for ventilation is not only probable, but certain. In England the death
rate has considerably declined with sanitation. From 1851 to 1860 it
was 2,679 per million per annum. In 1888 it was 1,541. In New
Hampshire, United States, the deaths from the several diseases named
were as follows: From 1884 to 1888, consumption, 4,059; diphtheria
and croup, 983; typhoid, 750; searlatina, 187; measles, 160; whoop-
ing cough, 109; smallpox, 2. Here the very large proportion of deaths
due to consumption, and the importance of effecting a reduction, are
strikingly shown; but a similar proportion exhibits itself in every
thickly inhabited State, both in Europe and America.

Rooms occupied by consumptives should be periodically disinfected
and always keptclean. The danger is there, but itcan be averted. The
experience of the Brompton Hospital shows that with proper hygienic
precautions cases of infection from patients are very rare. Koch has
shown that enormous multitudes of bacilli may be distributed on the
ground and in the air from only one patient, and how infection is
explained by their long survival in a moist or dry state. Cornet
Showed how the walls and carpets, cornices, ete., retain them still
potentially virulent. Thus certain houses remain for a long while
centers of infection, and newcomers are attacked out of all propor-
tion to the cases among neighboring uninfected dwellings.

Prisons, barracks, etc., which when crowded and badly ventilated
were very fatally affected with consumption have been rendered whole-
some by thorough ventilation and greater cleanliness. Out of an
average prison population of 4,807 in the year 1890 in England, only
9 died of phthisis, excluding cases in which sick prisoners were
removed home.
256 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The mortality of the British army in barracks from consumption in
the ten years 1837 to 1846 was 11.9 per thousand. After the report of
a royal commission in 1858, ventilation and air space were greatly
extended, and the mortality immediately and rapidly fell; in 1888 the
consumption rate was only 1.2 per thousand.

The disease prevails more on wet, cold, clayey ground and damp places
generally than on high and dry sites, and all causes of chills and colds
give an opportunity to the infection of the specific bacilli where they
are present in sufficient numbers and strength.

Cold countries are rather less subject to the disease than temperate
and warm climates, but everywhere the most important factors are the
habitsof thepeople. A moist atmosphere, with wide daily range of tem-
perature, favors its prevalence. In Greenland, Labrador, Iceland, Spitz-
bergen, Nova Zembia, Finland, Siberia, and the northern parts of North
America the disease has been rare; also especially on mountain ranges,
high plateaus, and little-visited districts, such as the Soudan. In
Algeria the nomad Arabs were free from it. The Bedouins who
exchange their tents for stone-built houses suffer to some extent.
Many uncivilized tribes are exempt until they adopt the clothes and
way of living of civilization. Outdoor life in the free air, and clean,
Spacious sleeping quarters almost or quite annihilate consumption if
animal sources are excluded. Soldiers on campaign, fishermen, hunters,
engine drivers, gardeners, and farm laborers are least attacked; workers
in gritty stone or metallic dust, in hot, close, crowded, and damp
rooms or factories or mines, and dwellers in damp houses, back-to-back
houses, and close courts furnish the largest number of victims. In
the old town of Havre, with its airless, narrow streets, the mortality is
three times as great as in other parts of the town.

It has been shown that in proportion as a population, male and female,
is drawn to indoor occupations, the death rate from consumption
increases.

An elaborate investigation for official purposes by Dr. Ogle showed
the mortality from phthisis and lung diseases of men from 45 to 65
years of age working in pure and vitiated air in England, to be as fol-

From these figures the effect of the breathing of foul air on res-
piratory diseases is conspicuous. But the differences represented
would have been much greater if the class described as living in pure
air had not been subject, during that part of their lives which was
spent within doors, to the bad air of close apartments or cabins, and to
the occasional infection of places of assembly and resort.

That demonstrable bacilli are given out by the breath of persons
suffering from consumption and other diseases, has been proved by
Ransome and others. The possibility was doubted by Cornet and
other authorities on the grounds that nonvolatile substances can not be
exhaled, that many good observers have failed to find them, and that
where observed errors may have crept into the experiments. But
Cornet himself has shown that the bacilli are exhaled in small numbers
by patients, and that they and their spores are given off in great num-
bers from handkerchiefs, bed linen, furniture, floors, ete., of rooms in
which consumptive persons live.

Klein has shown that guinea pigs exposed to a spray of tubercular
matter in the air, or else kept in the shaft of a ventilator in a consump-
tion hospital, acquire the disease. It has been proved by Straus that
nurses of consumptive patients have tubercle bacilli deposited on their
breathing organs. These last experiments are not proofs of the exha-
lation of the fatal microbes. But we have the most convincing proof
in everyday facts of the possibility of the exhalation of the bacilli or
germs of several infectious maladies. The breath is one of the most
common vehicles of transference of infection from person to person.
Moreover, Ransome finds much indiffusible organic matter, such as
epithelial scales, in the condensed aqueous vapor of the breath. The
breath of consumptives, however, contains very few bacilli, and the
particles of sputum which fall from the mouth in expectoration or in
speaking are more dangerous.

Tuberculosis has been produced in animals by causing them to inhale
air vitiated by subjects of phthisis. Glass slides, wetted with glycerin,
show the presence of tubercle bacilli in the air of consumption hos-
pitals. Tuberculous particles inhaled are found to be more capable of
infecting than particles swallowed. The air does vot often, at any rate,
convey intection from the mere breath of a patient in an ordinary clean
room, and the temperature must be rather high to maintain the vitality
of the germ. In hot climates, under similar conditions, the danger is
greater, but generally the better ventilation reduces it.

Consumption and leprosy are caused by similar microbes, and have
much in common in their behavior. In phthisis the contaminated air
conveys the bacillus to the air passages, and in scrofulous glands to the
nearest sore; in leprosy the exposed parts, hands, face, and feet, which
have received some scratch or wound, are first attacked. As leprosy
has been got rid of not only by improved conditions of living, but by
segregation of the victims, so consumption and tuberculosis will be
exterminated wherever the utmost care is taken in providing for fresh

air, good and well-cooked food, clean dwellings and clean byres, and in
segregating or specially controlling and caring for affected individuals.
Close courts, back-to-back houses, damp cottages, tuberculous meat and
milk, overcrowding, and dusty occupations in heated air deserve either
total condemnation or most rigid precautions. Rooms should be con-
structed so as to be easily and frequently cleaned and constantly aired.
The habit of wetting envelopes, ledger pages, etc., from the mouth
Should be prohibited. Notification of cases should be required as in
other infectious diseases. Light, air, space, exercise, and cleanliness
should be made easy of attainment and common to every human being.

TYPHUS.

Another disease intimately associated with bad air and with crowded
dwellings is typhus. It does not arise at all among persons living in
the open air and in well-ventilated rooms, but spreads with fatal effect
in the crowded, dirty apartments of the poor, in filthy jails, ships, and
lodging houses. The disease was formerly very destructive in England,
infesting the prisons, and was sometimes communicated to judges and
lawyers into whose presence prisoners were brought; but better con-
ditions of living, greater cleanliness, and more regard for ventilation
have resulted in its almost complete extermination. So sensitive is the
microbe to fresh air and disturbance of foul surfaces that the crowding
and dirt which remain, bad as they are, are scarcely sufficient to main-
tain its virulence. Typhus is not conveyed far by the air, and as a rule
only infects those who are very near to the victim. AJ] the staff of the
Fever Hospital, in London, were attacked at some time through this
infection, but during eight years no case occurred among the staff of
the Smallpox Hospital, which was in close proximity. Even the attend-
ants in typhus wards run little risk when these are spacious, well venti-
lated, and not overcrowded. Poisonous microbic emanations from the
lungs and skin are thus in an almost incredible space of time rendered
harmless by the action of fresh air.

The winter has generally been the season of greatest prevalence of
typhus, owing probably to the greater distress and crowding in the cold
months. The infection remains for some time on clothing, walls, ete.,
so that the air does not apparently disinfect or destroy where the
organism has sufficient moisture and nourishment.

THE PLAGUE.

The plague, a very severe pestilence which has been common in the
East and in North Africa, and has visited Europe with the most appall-
ing mortality, arises in districts where filth abounds to the most extent,
where dwellings are overcrowded, and where famine and undernourish-
ment are frequent. It is both miasmatic and contagious. In 1603 it
hardly ever entered a house but it seized all living there. Prolonged
breathing of the sick-room air was the most effectual means of infection.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 259

A moderately high temperature is most favorable to the breeding of
this pest; above 86° F. it declines. Moist, alluvial soils; the banks of
ereat rivers, such as the Nile and Euphrates; a warm, humid air; great
accumulations of putrefying animal and vegetable matter in the vicin-
ity of dwellings; dwellings surrounded by heaps of manure and almost
hermetically sealed—these are conditions favorable to the growth of
plague. Once started, it spreads by infection much after the manner of
typhus. Care for the purity of air in and around dwellings abolishes
plague altogether, as has been proved locally in the Himalayas and
generally in the retregression of the disease from Europe.

CHOLERA.

Cholera is to a great extent a disease of air poisoning. It arises
from the soil in certain districts of India, where it is endemic, and from
which it occasionally has the opportunity, through favoring climatic
influences and the movements of travelers, of invading temperate
regions, in which it may cause great mortality in a few seasons, but
ean hardly establish itself permanently in the soil or water. It does
not, aS was long supposed, travel from place to place through the air,
and has no epidemic existence beyond its breeding places apart from
human agency. The cholera microbe, the comma in all probability,
thrives in a damp, organically polluted soil, such as that of the delta
of the Ganges and the flat lands around Madras, Bombay, and Shang-
hai; of the valleys of the Brahmaputra, the Nerbudda, the Tapti, the
Indus, and the Euphrates, and in a temperature of from 25° to 40° C,
In the delta of the Ganges the temperature of soil and air appears to
be so favorable that it never dies down; at Shanghai it regularly infects
the air and water after the heat of July and August. Itisaerobic. A
freezing temperature prevents its growth, but does not destroy it. Kept
moist, it may live for months after growth has ceased; dried for a few
hours, it dies. In temperate climates it is spread by the entrance into
water and air of the organisms derived from growth in the dejections
of cholera patients, some cases being only recognized as diarrhea, but
still being capable of spreading the poison. The destruction of the
dejecta is, therefore, the safeguard in all cases. The power of exten-
sion of cholera through the air alone in the neighborhood of cholera
patients where due hygienic precautions are observed is very small,
but every article used must be washed or sterilized. The general
atmosphere does not convey it either from person to person or from soil
to soil, unless, possibly, in rare cases and for a short distance. In fact,
free air, unless very humid, soon kills it. The atmosphere of the Gan-
getic delta, the chief endemic area of cholera, is remarkably damp.
There are probably a number of places in India where the soil is to
some extent infected, but where mischief arises only in certain seasons.

The conditions of soil and air favorable to the growth and exhala-
tion of the cholera germ may be concisely summed up as follows;
260 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

Permeability of soil to air, moisture of svil not excessive, average soil
heat at 6 feet deep about 79°, a moderate amount of contained organic
matter, and little putrefaction or ordinary decomposition; mean annual
temperature of air about 72° F. The minimum water level, otherwise
the maximum of soil ventilation, and the maximum of cholera coincide.
Dry or saturated soil are unsuitable for the continuous growth of the
bacillus.
DIARRHEA.

In an inquiry conducted about thirty-five years ago' regarding the
prevalence of diarrhea, a disease which in England is fatal to very
large numbers of children, it was found that there are districts in
which endemic diarrhea is unknown, and others in which it prevails
extensively every year. The excess of mortality coincided in all cases
with one of two local conditions, the tainting of the atmosphere with
the products of organic decomposition, especially human excrement, or
‘the habitual drinking of impure water. Since the time of the report a
large amount of evidence has accumulated which goes to prove that
summer or infantile diarrhea is caused by the infection of air and
food by emanations from a damp organically contaminated soil raised
above a certain temperature. Houses built on or near a subsoil con-
taining decomposing organic matter, or where sewers leak, are particu-
larly subject to diarrhea. The nature of the soil is important. Sand,
loose fine gravel, deep mold, and permeable soils generally, where
organic matter is abundant, are productive of the disease; houses built
upon rock, without fissures, are generally altogether exempt. ‘‘Made
ground,” containing organic rubbish, on which so many houses in the
outskirts of large towns are built, emits products of decomposition into
the interior of houses and is a fruitful source of suffering. The prac-
tice of building on rubbish heaps should be made a criminal offense.
The absence of free ventilation within and around houses greatly
increases the mortality from this cause. Deep drainage has been fol-
lowed by a marked fall in the prevalence of the disease. Paving,
impervious flooring in houses, cleanliness in the storage of food, with
ventilation, are important measures for its reduction. Purity of air,
indeed, in this as in so many other cases, is the remedy to be sought.

Diarrhea in the epidemic form arises under conditions very similar
to those of cholera. It’ may be in fact a very near relation of that
microorganism, but is milder in its effects and has the quality of
developing at lower temperatures. When polluted, damp soil at 3 or
4 feet deep reaches about 56° to 60° C., as it generally does in England
in June or July, the cases of diarrhea mount up rapidly, for the diar-
rheal microbe is then multiplying in the subsoil and emerging through
the upper stratum, and may indeed be developed in decaying organic
matter on the surface. Settling upon articles of food and drink, such
as vegetables, water, and milk, it multiplies and develops the poison

1Second Report to the Privy Council, London, 1859.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 261

which belongs to fungoid growth. When ingested with food, and even
when breathed with the air, it causes the disease. The air of that
part of a town which was subject to diarrhea has been proved to con-
tain germs which cause the disease, and to contain 2,000 to 7,000 bae-
teria and micrococci in the cubic meter. The deaths in this part of
the town, containing one-third of the population, were 216 out of a
total of 256. The remedies for diarrhea are principally draining the
ground to a considerable depth, paving, ventilation of dwellings and
of places where milk and food are kept with air from some height above
ground, cleanliness generally, and a good water supply. Cows, farm-
yards, and dairies need similar attention. Diarrhea is much less
common among the Irish population of large towns, owing to their
infants being almost invariably suckled by their mothers and not
from the bottle.

The general air soon nullifies the danger from strata near the
infected ground, and the germ seems to be incapable of enduring con-
veyance in a potent state through any considerable distance in the free

atinosphere.
TYPHOID FEVER.

Typhoid fever, like cholera and diarrhea, depends to a great extent
on the growth and cultivation in neglected human refuse by human
agency (unwilling but effectual) of germs which thrive in damp, pol-
-Juted soil or in foul water. Warmth and exelusion from free air favor
the development of the bacillus, supposed to be the cause of typhoid.
Tt can grow, however, in the presence of free oxygen, and then develops
the saprophytic habit and great resistant power. In direct sunlight it
is killed in six to seven hours, and in diffuse daylight growth is very
slow. The mode of entrance of typhoid is both through air and water
contaminated with the products of the intestinal discharges of persons
sick with the disease.

During twenty years preceding 1883, the average annual number
of persons who died of typhoid in England was about 15,000, the
number of those who suffered from it about 150,000. In many conti-
nental cities, the proportion is much higher. Although bad water
accounts for a large number of cases, bad air, the emanations from
drains through defective traps and waste pipes, also infects in very
many instances. Recent experiments of great interest have shown
that sewer air is capable of so poisoning the system as to lay it open
to the attacks of the typhoid bacillus, which is doubtless frequently
present either in the foul air or in the intestines. In this way many
outbreaks are caused by the combined influence of drain air and spe-
cific microbes. The condition of farmyards near dairies whence milk
is supplied to cities is too often so filthy that both air and water are
poisoned. Milk has aremarkable power of absorbing gases and vapors,
and is also a cultivating medium of various fungi and bacteria.

Typhoid germs, like so many others, are soon rendered innocuous by

262 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

mixture with fresh air, and there is some evidence to show that oxida-
tion by the air in running water has a good effect where the noxious
matter is largely diluted and the stream pure. In London, New York,
Paris, Berlin, and perhaps the majority of places in the northern tem-
perate zone, typhoid fever is most prevalent in the late summer or
autumn, when the ground at a little depth, and water in shallow wells,
are at their highest temperature. In India 1t occurs mostly in the hot,
dry months before and after the rains, and may in part be attributed
to the wind blowing up the dust of filth deposited in the fields, but
chiefly to the same conditions as prevail in England and to the intro-
duction of the virus, often from slight and unsuspected cases.

The great majority of houses in civilized places resemble inverted,
slightly ventilated bell jars, connected with a system of pipes on which
deadly organisms may grow, and from which they may be conveyed by
the poisonous gases to the bodies of the inmates. It should be a pri-
mary object to make the entrance of these gases difficult and of the
outer air easy. The bacillus concerned in typhoid fever is probably
widely diffused, but, whether often present or not in an innocuous form
in the human intestines, does not attack life where air and diet are pure.
With the aid of impure air from drains, middens, and foul sinks it
acquires deadly power. Cleanly disposal of refuse and abundance of
fresh air are the great securities against this disease.

MALARIA.

-Malaria is the most general, constant, and destructive of endemic
diseases in tropical climates and over a very large proportion of the
inhabited globe. Millions die of it every year in India, and in Africa
and South America it is terribly prevalent and fatal. Vast numbers of
people are crippled and diseased for life in consequence of the fever,
and in many districts the whole population looks debilitated and anzemic.
It depends on the emission of living organisms, probably amcebiform,
from warm, damp soil, rich mold, sand, or other suitable ground con-
taining a little organic matter. It haunts open and narrow valleys,
dried water courses, the country at the foot of many mountain ranges,
sandy coasts in certain climates, mangrove swamps, deltas, marshes,
and even in certain districts dry, sandy plains at a considerable eleva-
tion. The organism appears to exist either in an active or latent form
in nearly all hot countries where the soil contains sufficient organic
matter, and that need not be much. Where soil is efficiently drained,
naturally or artificially, malaria is rare or absent; and where irrigation
works increase the dampness of the soil, there also malaria increases
or develops itself. Cultivation, with the exception of rice growing,
in general diminishes or abolishes malaria within the area cultivated.
Lowering of the water level and aeration of the soil reduce malaria
notably. Drainage in East Anglia has almost extinguished ague, which
is a Similar or the same disease. Some sandy, semidesert districts, such
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 263

as Western Rajpootana, are subject to malaria, although the water is
several hundred feet below the surface. But here the sand is found to
be damp a short distance below the surface, and probably the same
condition prevails elsewhere in sandy tracts where malaria is present.
The rainfall is scanty, but the great range of temperature probably
causes a good deal of dew-condensation on the sand.

Sometimes, though rarely, rocky surfaces emit malaria, but probably
the habitat of the organisms in these cases is in clefts or disintegrated
rocky detritus. The efficiency of attack on the human body depends
in great measure on the concentration of the organisms within a few
feet of the surface of the earth in the evening hours, the difference
between day and night temperature, the high temperature of the soil,
and the suddenness of the fall of temperature. Although the strong:
est men in the best of health may be stricken, yet, in most malarious
countries, the avoidance of fatigue, of indigestion, and of any chilling
of the surface of the body, is an important safeguard. The conditions
in which malarious germs are emitted from the soil and concentrated
in the nethermost strata of the air are further considered in relation to
the emanation of vapor from the earth and the deposition of dew.

YELLOW FEVER.

Yellow fever results, in all probability, from a fungoid or microbie
growth, but the particular microbe concerned has not been certainly
identified. It prevails habitually in the West Indies and on the coasts of
the Gulf of Mexico, and these have been regarded as the original breed-
ing grounds. But it has also long been endemic on the west coast of
Africa, especially at Sierra Leone. It is easily capable of transporta-
tion, especially in the case of particular outbreaks and in particular
seasons, and it has in several years, like cholera, attained almost a
world-wide prevalence. When transplanted to favorable places (and
these are mostly seaports with very poor sanitary conditions) it takes
root and breaks out in succeeding years as if it were multiplying on
the polluted soil. As a matter of fact, it thrives on damp organically
contaminated soil, on the walls of houses, and on the wood of ships, in
foul holds. It haunts the vicinity of drains, banks of rivers occasion-
ally dry, harbors, and crowded rooms or houses. The manner of its
growth a good deal resembles that of cholera, but its areas of preva-
lence are smaller, and it is more largely communicated through the air,
each case of yellow fever becoming a focus of prevalence in tropical
and foul conditions. It requires a high temperature for its propaga-
tion, and is arrested, but not destroyed, by frost. Strangers are much
more liable to attack than residents, but residents are not always
immune. The living cause of the disease clings with great tenacity
to ships, walls, ete., for a long time, and is conveyed, in very many
instances, by the air to persons who approach the infected object. The
organic poison seems to multiply outside the body, upon foul surfaces,
264 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

and thence to infect. It is not transported by the wind—at any rate
to a distance—but depends on human movements, on overcrowding,
neglected refuse, and absence of proper ventilation. Itseems probable,
from its persistence on the coast, on the banks of tidal rivers, and on
ocean-going Ships, that it finds a favorite pabulum in slightly saline
deposits.

DIPHTHERIA.

Diphtheria, now one of the most fatal maladies of children, both in
Hurope and America, is equally preventable by purity of air; but since
itis commonly caught by infection, and susceptible persons are attacked
through shght doses, absolute prevention is difficult. Its propagation
depends to a great extent on schools and close aggregations of children,
some of whom may be affected by the disease in a mild form, such as

‘slight sore throat. Some cases arise from a disease of the cow, which

is not easily identified, but the great majority of cases of the disease
are certainly due to the emission into confined air of the microbes from
persons already suffering with sore throat or diphtheria, and therefore
the great majority of cases would not occur if schools and dwelling
houses were well cleansed and ventilated, and if children with sus-
pected throats were as far as possible isolated. The gradual growth
of diphtheria in villages and towns and its frequent recurrence indi-
eate an infection of the air in houses either from a contaminated sur-
face soil, from floor or walls, or from the breath of persons who have
had the disease and in whose throats the microbe lingers after their
recovery. Diphtheria does not occur at all in clean, dry places, unless
introduced by some person or imported article carrying the infective
organism. The germ is certainly not present in a potent condition in
the outer air. Newly inhabited countries and places have always
remained free from diphtheria until the germ has been introduced by
human agency.

Diphtheria and scarlet fever are among the most widely and con-
stantly prevalent, and most fatal, of all diseases in temperate climates.
They are both communicable through the air in proximity to a patient,
and this is a very common mode of conveyance. But they have never
been known to pass across any considerable space through the outside
air. The evidence leads very strongly to the conclusion that they are
rarely if ever caught by exposure to infected air which has been very
largely diluted in the free atmosphere. Predisposition to diphtheria,
and probably to a less extent to scarlet fever, is favored by drain air,
sewer air, and the emanations from heaps of decaying animal or vege-
table matter, dust heaps, and by the various causes of sore throat.
Aud itis probable that the microbe of diphtheria, which has been iden-
tified, frequently infects the surfaces whence the foul emanations pro-
ceed, It is certainly present in very many places, especially in houses
and localities where the disease has formerly prevailed. Measles are
often followed by diphtheria, though no source of infection can be
x

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 265

discovered. Many persons after recovering from diphtheria are still
capable of giving infection by the breath, for the bacillus may remain
for months in the mouth and throat. Cases of sore throat which may
be slight often communicate to other persons, in consequence of aggre-
gation in foul air, severe sore throats and diphtheria. It seems that
the disease may be a slight one until by the effects of rebreathed air it
develops fatal virulence. Tor this reason, and owing also to the oppor-
tunities of ordinary infection in confined air, diphtheria is a disease
which largely depends on schools for increase and propagation. It
haunts the surfaces of objects which have been exposed to it, and
thorough disinfection is required to remove it. The autumn and winter
season, damp dwellings, damp soil, dirty farmyards, privies, etc., favor
its development; but its continual increase has been due to increased
school attendance, meetings, ete., and to the increase in the number of
infected places, and in the means of quick traveling. Ventilation, much
more thorough than any now generally practiced, combined with the
better disposal of refuse, must be the principal hygienic measure to
reduce its prevalence. Investigation of the conditions under which it
survives in places and houses, and of the effect of ventilation and proper
Space in schoolsin preventing its propagation, is much needed.

PNEUMONIA,

Two or more different diseases are known under the name of pneu-
monia, The temperature of the air is an important factor in its pro-
duction, but all countries are subject toit. The maximum number of
deaths from this infection occur in December, the minimum in August.
Cold is a strong predisposing, but not the ultimate cause. Overerowd-
ing, the want of ventilation, emanations from sewer and filth, play an
important part in epidemic outbreaks. Certain bacilli or micrococci
are concerned in the production of epidemic pneumonia, and possibly
the commonest form of pneumonia is due to the opportunity given by
cold or by foul gases for the attack on the body of an organism fre-
quently present in the breathing organs. There is little evidence as to
the exemption of persons living entirely in the open air and thoroughly
well-ventilated dwellings, and not exposed to infection from others, but
the probability appears to be that many persons have in themselves a
cause of a certain sort of pneumonia which may attack them through a
chill, but that the breathing of purer air and the prevention of infection
through the breath would greatly reduce the number of victims. The
typhoidalcharacter of some forms of pneumonia and their mode of origin
and spread suggest a connection with soil poisoning and contamination
of superjacent air. On these points investigation is needed.

Pneumonia is very apt to occur after colds, measles, typhoid, malaria,
and especially influenza. If it be due to a particular micrococcus, the
organism must be very widely disseminated. But probably several dif-
ferent organisms are capable of thus affecting the weakened constitution,

266 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

and the disease named pneumonia is the result of different causes which
need more distinct classification than they have yet received.
Dusty trades and smoky fogs favor the incidence of pneumonia.

BRONCHITIS.

Bronchitis, one of the most prevalent and fatal of all diseases in cold
and temperate climates, is often directly due to the effect of cold and of
a sudden fall of temperature. Although much less common and fatal
among people living in healthy conditions, it nevertheless often attacks
strong constitutions, even in the purest atmosphere. Fatigue predis-
poses. A great deal of preventable bronchitis results from imprudence
in clothing and in diet—for instance, alcoholic excess—but much also
from breathing dusty and smoky air. A smoky fog of some days’ dura-
tion in cold weather in London causes a heavy mortality, while a fog in
the country has little effect. Much bronchitis results from weakness and.
chill following illness and fatigue. Changes in the blood and aceumu-
lation of waste products are apt to follow excessive exertion. The
importance of warm clothing and of breathing air free from smoke and
dust, especially the dust given off in the manufacture of hardware, pot-
tery, lead mining, etc., is great in the prevention of this disease. Close
rooms where gas is burned contribute largely to bronchial attacks, and
in general purity of air is one of the first conditions tending to immu-
nity. But cold and damp seem to be quite sufficient to produce bron-
chitis in some constitutions, and in young children and old people,
apart from anything like infection from outside. Indeed, it seems likely
that an excess of ozone, or else a cold, bracing air, often determines
an attack, and these qualities are beyond doubt sufficient greatly to
exacerbate symptoms resulting from a slight cold or chest weakness.
A soothing, soft, warm, damp air, on the contrary, quickly ameliorates
the condition of a sufferer from bronchitis, cold, or cough; the extraor-
dinary power of a whiff of cool, fresh air to increase the malady, and
the ill effect of even a glass of cold water, seem to show that the bron-
chial tubes, capillaries, and air passages are in a highly sensitive state
and that temperature is a matter of extreme importance. Experimental
investigation of the temperature and condition of air most tending to
rapid recovery from bronchitis might disclose facts of importance in
the connection of inflammatory states with the atmosphere. It seems
not unlikely that an absence of ozone, deficiency of oxygen, and excess
of vapor of water, and of nitrogen or carbon dioxide, might prove
favorable.

RHEUMATISM AND RHEUMATIC FEVER.

Few diseases are more common or cause more suffering than rheu-
matism, acute or chronic. A great deal has still to be discovered
respecting its external causes. It prevails much more in some districts
than in others, and certainly in many cases the mischief is brought
into the human system through the air. Damp and cold in soil and air,
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 267

and chill in the body, especially when feeble or fatigued, are main fac-
tors. As in so many other maladies, the specific cause in rheumatic
fever may be the entrance of a micrococcus or other germ by means of
a chill, either in hot or cold weather. An inquiry into the distribution
of rheumatism, with regard especially to soil, climate, air, and dwell-
ings, and eliminating as far as possible predisposing human habits,
would furnish results of much value. There is some indication, as in
the case of malaria, that air near the ground in low places has much to
do with the incidence of the disease. Damp dwellings and clothes
conduce to an attack, and to the chronic form. It seems very probable
that it would be found that persons removed from ground air, as in the
attics of high buildings, are exempt from attack, except through food
and drink.
MEASLES AND WHOOPING COUGH.

Measles and whooping cough are spread chiefly through the air to
persons in the immediate neighborhood of the sick, and of articles,
especially clothing, which have been exposed to the infective matter.
Segregation, ventilation, and avoidance and disinfection of materials
which may disseminate the disease are effective in prevention, where
they can be carried out. In the early stage of measles, as of influenza,
even while the symptoms are slight, the germs of the disease may infect
through the air, and therefore measures of precaution are difficult. The
best preventives against widespread and severe attacks are habitual
regard for sufficient air space and warmth and immediate isolation.

DENGUE.

Dengue is a disease somewhat resembling influenza in its symptoms,
but prevalent only as an occasional epidemic in tropical countries. It
is apparently spread by infection in the air from case to case, but not
through the general atmosphere. The reason of its failure to extend
beyond hot climates is quite obscure, but it would seem as if it required,
like yellow fever, a high temperature outside the body in order to grow
and disseminate germs fitted for infection.

SMALLPOX.

Smallpox has been ascertained by several careful investigations te
be capable of passing through long distances, at least half a mile or
amile, of fresh air without losing its power of infecting susceptible per-
sons. The experience of hospitals in London and Paris is well known.
Recent observations on the spread of smallpox from a hospital near
Leicester, containing 49 patients, showed that a number of cases which
occurred in a suburb about 300 yards distant were in all probability due
to transport by the wind. The epithelial scales and dust of smallpox
cases are rather peculiarly protected from atmospheric influences, and
the conditions of the survival of exposed germs need inquiry.

INFLUENZA.

No disease of the epidemic character has seemed to depend more on
the constitution and infection of the general atmosphere than influenza.
Its rapid spread, its apparently capricious outbreaks at places wide
apart, the almost simultaneous attack, as it seemed, upon a large
fraction of the population of a country, masked the true method of
progress. But when its track and behavior were carefully followed,
these facts became clear—that it never traveled faster than human
beings; that many mild cases existed in every large town long before
it was generally recognized; thatit took at least six weeks to attain its
maximum after the occurrence of the first cases; that its rapidity of
advancement from east to west and from town to village corresponded
roughly and generally with the rapidity of means of transit; that large
numbers of people not exposed to personal infection escaped; that
islands unvisited through the period, deep-sea fishermen, and light-
house keepers escaped, except in a very few instances where they had
been ashore or received communications from infected places; that
susceptible persons very easily caught the pest within a few days after
exposure to infection in the ordinary sense; that infection was some-
times conveyed by parcels, letters, clothing, etc., from patients or
infected places; that ships which had cases on board were the means of
starting it in islands at which they stopped; and that in previous epi-
demics the spread was often so very slow as to be quite unaccountable
by any atmospheric quality. Moreover, when the bacillus of influenza
was identified, it became easy to comprehend how the countless multi-
tudes of exceedingly small organisms alive in the sputum and saliva
might be disseminated in the air of buildings and of public conveyances
and transmitted from place to place by commerce and the post. The
general atmosphere either diffused them to harmlessness or killed
them, for there was no evidence of influenza reaching an isolated
community by means of wind blowing from a place where it was
prevalent. But in confined or foul air they were capable of passing
through many feet without losing their capacity of infection. They
were experimentally shown to thrive abundantly on the gum of an
envelope,' and since many patients wrote letters, this must have been
rather a common mode of transmission, the organic motes flying upward
to the breathing organs of the recipient on his breaking the fastening.
There is no difficulty in explaining the quick diffusion of an epidemic
having the qualities of influenza among a susceptible population. The
minuteness of the bacilli, their vast numbers in the breathing organs,
the short period of incubation, and the early infectiveness, and in mod-
ern times the immense daily communications between distant places,
have to be taken into consideration. If examination of matter of the

1 Dr. Klein, British Medical Journal, February, 1894.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 269

tenuity of smoke particles, or of the minutest microbes, could be under-
taken, with a view to determine the rate and extent of its diffusion by
human communications, it would probably be found that very few dis-
tricts in the country are out of microbic touch, as it were, with all the
chief centers of population for a single day, and none for so long as a
week; and certainly the air inclosed in a packet from an infected place,
when suddenly liberated, would be likely to bear with it active seeds
of mischief. But the great majority of cases of influenza were due to
proximity to a person already attacked. Most people in the course of
a day come into association with ten or twenty others in more or less
confined spaces of air. If only one in five catches the influenza, and
so on in the same proportion, a fourth part of a large city may be struck
down in avery few weeks. In general, one-half or three-fourths escape,
being insusceptible, or less susceptible than others, or less exposed to
the virus. Where large numbers of persons work together in one ill-
ventilated building, the proportion of attacks is much higher, other
things being equal, than where people work at their own homes. But
the frequent opportunities of infection at meetings, social gatherings,
public houses, in public conveyances, churches, and chapels tend to
reduce the inequalities which would otherwise be conspicuous. The
distance of air through which influenza can strike has not been well
ascertained, circumstances being very different, and some forms, such
as the catarrhal, being apparently more easily diffused than others.
The maximum distance in the recent epidemics, for susceptible persons,
could hardly have been less than 100 feet in close air, and 4 feet in the
open. Isolation, where practiced, was successful in so far as it was
strict. But the intercourse of ordinary life makes isolation impossible
for the general population when once an epidemic of influenza has been
allowed to attack a number of centers. Strong measures against unpor-
tation from other countries and immediate isolation and supervision
of the few cases which would occur might succeed in staving off a
national infliction, for the precautionary measures would not need
enforcement beyond the brief period of its prevalence in neighboring
countries. Not only the high mortality, but the enfeeblement of millions
of breadwinners for months, years, and even for life has to be consid-
ered in connection with the expense of preventive measures. This
expense would only be a small fraction of the losses incurred by per-
mitting the pestilence to rage unchecked.

As regards weather and climate, cold is distinctly conducive to the
spread of influenza, probably for several reasons: (1) The stillness which
often prevails in frost; (2) the closing of windows, etc., and the closer
association; (3) the greater prevalence of colds, bronchitis, etc., laying
open the breathing organs to attack. The first epidemic in London, at
the end of December, 1889, was ushered in by fog and frost, and appar-
ently rapidly reduced in severity by the mild and strong winds of the

latter half of January, 1890. The epidemics in succeeding years were

270 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

much more severe, although they came upon a population to some
extent protected. At the same time there can be no doubt that an
epidemic may occur in any climate and in any weather. The tropics
are not exempt. An instructive instance of the subtle diffusion of
influenza occurred in a village of Central Africa, which was attacked
immediately after the arrival of two natives from au infected place far
distant. But outdoor life and less constant communications prevent
the quick diffusion and wide prevalence which belong to civilized nations
in temperate climates.

The manifest, at present the only practicable and yet difficult, meas-
ures for preventing these great and very destructive epidemics are:
Precautions against the introduction of the pest by travelers and by
articles sent from infected districts; immediate compulsory notification,
without fee, of all cases occurring in a district to the medical officer of
the district and through him to the central board; isolation so far as
can be arranged of all the early cases in a district at the homes of the
patients; prohibition of attendance of infected persons at any assem-
blage; and publication of the importance of ventilation, and of living,
warmly clothed, as much as possible in the open air, unless actually
stricken. During the period of illness, and for some time after recoy-
ery, the greatest care is required to avoid chill, which often induces
pheumonia or other evils. The fresh outer air can only be safely
breathed when the symptoms have subsided and when the strength has
partially returned. It is remarkable that cold air alone, however pure,
seems capable of causing a relapse when the system has been greatly
enfeebled and the breathing organs left in a highly sensitive condition.

COLDS.

Colds and sore throat have never received the attention they deserve
from an etiological point of view, owing probably to the slight character
of the majority of cases. Yet they are important, first for their wide
diffusion, endemicity, and frequency, and secondly for their effect in
giving opportunity for the attack of more serious disorders, among
which may be mentioned diphtheria, measles, pneumonia, bronchitis,
and consumption. Close observation for many years has led the pres-
ent writer to the conclusion that though primarily a chill, that is
exposure, insufficiently clad, to a draft or cold air, is very frequently
sufficient to give a slight cold or sore throat, or the feeling of one, yet
severe colds are caught in general either (1) in marshy or low and damp
situations, or in conditions somewhat similar to those which produce
malaria; or (2)-by infection from persons after the manner of other
infectious diseases. It would appear as if the microorganism, or one
species of microorganisms, which sets up a sore throat and severe cold,
inhabits the upper layer of earth, especially in damp or marshy places,
where decaying vegetable matter abounds, and passes into the air,
especially in summer and autumn evenings when the earth and water
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 271

are still warm and the air is rapidly cooling. When the microbes are
dense in the humid and misty low stratum of air, and when the human
body is being quickly chilled, they are able to attack successfully. The
microbe is probably a very common and widely diffused one, and may
be present in comparatively small proportion and in less vigor in the
lower air generally over the land. At sea it would be absent, and indeed
there is good evidence that it does not bear long transport in a virulent
state in the free air. Colds are scarcely ever caught on the open sea,
even if the clothes be wet with salt water, and breezes straight from the
Atlantic do not seem capable of inducing sore throat or cold. But, of
course, to make an experiment crucial, previous liie in the open air,
disinfection of clothes and if possible of the breathing organs, would
be necessary. It is not improbable that the microbe of colds, like that
of pneumonia, may be frequently present in the mouth. The experience
of St. Kilda,'! which used to be absolutely free from colds until the
annual boat arrived from the mainland, points to the ordinary presence
of the infective particles on clothes or in the breath. The islanders
were nearly all struck down with severe colds within a day or two after
welcoming their visitors. Probably a similar dose of infection would
be quite insufficient to prostrate persons on the mainland who were
accustomed to the petty assaults of the microbe, and protected by
scarcely noticed symptoms of catarrh.

An exactly similar thing occurs in the case of influenza. Hundreds
of instances were observed in which the proximity of persons who had
had influenza or had been near cases of influenza gave it to others, and
often persons lately arrived in a place which had passed through the
epidemic were struck down while the great majority of the resident
population remained protected, at least for some months.

Colds protect against their own recurrence in most people for some
months. Severe colds go through a house after the manner of an infec-
tious disease, and can be similarly guarded against by isolation. The
air certainly conveys a cold for several feet through confined air, and
in a closed railway carriage susceptible persons who have been free
from colds for some time are easily infected. An attack is often attrib-
uted to a chill felt at the beginning of the infliction, but in reality the
cold has usually been caught some hours or a day or two before, and
the feeling of chill is simply the beginning of the disorder, as in other
infectious maladies. On the other hand, there may be a real chill,
which gives opportunity to the microbe to make its attack and produce
a feverish cold in a day or two. Foul air and crowded rooms are emi-
nently conducive, especially if combined with drafts, to disseminate
colds.

Persons arriving in town from the pure air of the country or from a
sea voyage are very apt to catch cold. They have been living apart

Government Board; Epidemic Influenza, London.

272 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

from the constant presence, and, as it were, the vaccinating influence,
of the germs in bad air. From similar reasons horses, when brought
from the country to London stables, very frequently fall out of sorts to
the extent, it is said, of 95 per cent, and sheep, when placed among
imported apparently healthy sheep, often fall sick. Texas cattle fever
is caught from apparently healthy cattle. The first intercouse between
Europeans and natives is attended with the introduction of fever,
dysentery, or other diseases.!

SHASONAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF INFECTIOUS
DISEASES.

Many of the spreading diseases are more or less wont to rise toward
a Inaximum and to fall toward a minimum at certain times of the year,
and these seasons are generally nearly the same in similar climates
in the same hemisphere, but there are many particular instances of
variation.

Scarlet fever is a disease chiefly prevalent in the northwest of Europe,
moderately prevalent in Russia, North America, and parts of South
America, the coast of Asia Minor, Italy, Turkey, and Greece, and quite
uncommon in Asia and Africa. It is not frequent in Australia. Its
maximum in London occurs in October, its minimum in April. In New
York its maximum is in April, its minimum in September. In Eng-
land, generally autumn is the time of maximum prevalence. In the
whole of Europe and North America 29.5 per cent out of 435 epidemics
are recorded as having occurred in the autumn, and 21.8 per cent in the
spring, the period of minimum; the remaining 48.7 per cent took place
in summer and winter. A dry air with little rain seems to increase the
prevalence of scarlet fever.

Measles, in London, has two maxima, one in December and a lesser
one in June, and two minima, one in September and one in February.
Measles occurs nearly all over the world since the great extension of
commerce, and seems to be little affected by climate. Cold weather,
however, favors it, as might be expected, since it infects through the
air of close rooms.

Influenza, typhus, relapsing fever, smallpox, whooping cough, croup,
pneumonia, not only prevail most in cold weather, but in cold countries,
where there is least outdoor life and least fresh air in rooms and most
crowding. Diphtheria increases with the cold weather of autumn, but
tends to decline in February, and is at a minimum during the hot
months. Cerebro-spinal fever, which is a good deal connected with
crowding in large numbers in institutions, ete., not only attacks most
in cold weather, but in cold or temperate countries. The relation
between the temperature and the disease seems to be indirect, and the
causation and dissemination of the malady are obscure.

Consumption or tuberculosis is most prevalent where the air is moist
and the daily range of temperature large.

Typhoid or enteric fever is most common in the autumn and much less
prevalent in Mayand June. There is a sharp decline in its prevalence
in London in December. In New York, and in large towns in Europe,
the maximum is decidedly apparent in late summer or autumn. The
variation of prevalence according to season seems to show a distinet
connection between the development of the bacillus and the tempera-
ture of soil and water, and considering the long incubation and dura-
tion of cases the maximum of infection must take place at the very
time when the temperature of the soil at 1 or 2 feet deep is about at its
highest.

Cholera, diarrhea, yellow fever, and malaria, the poison of all of
which arises from the soil and surroundings into the air, are much
more prevalent in the hot season and in hot countries.

CONDITIONS OF INFECTION THROUGH THE AIR.

In order to obtain a true conception of the manner in which the
virulent matter of infectious diseases may be conveyed through short
distances of air, either directly from a patient or indirectly from objects
which have become infected, we have to consider those cases in which
susceptibility 1s greatest, for these afford the truest criterion of the
capability of the survival of pathogenic microbes, and the best meas-
ure of the precautions which should be adopted to exelude not only
persons of average susceptibility, but the most susceptible, from the
area of danger. In cases of pyzemia, of puerperal fever, and of small-
pox, not only ordinary measures of disinfection, but abstinence from
attendance on susceptible persons for some time, is recognized as
needful. in cases of influenza, diphtheria, and scarlet fever less care
is exercised, except in regard to certain susceptible states. In all of
these diseases, however, transmission is far too frequent, and as a mat-
ter of fact the required precautions are not duly observed. The strict
regulations of dress and washing enjoined upon nurses are almost
equally applicable to medical attendants, and the use of clothes of a
washable material and smooth surface by all persons in the presence of
infectious cases would give greater security to all patients visited, and,
indeed, to the general population. A square inch of cloth can easily
hold upon its surface 10,000,090,000 microbes of influenza, so that it is
quite conceivable that a man may carry on his clothes many more of
these organisms than there are inhabitants on the globe, and that
many scores of thousands of these pass into the air of every room
which he visits.

Similarly, in the cases of other diseases which pass largely by the
breath and by deposited particles, there must always be acertain num-
ber on every person who visits the sick room, and although the majority
of people fall victims only to rather large numbers or a high degree of

SM 95——18

274 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

virulence, still, in order to avoid the setting up of fresh centers in sus-
ceptible people, disinfection and washing are indispensable.

The most remarkable instance of immunity from infection of a mater-
nity hospital is that of the Grand Duchess Catherine, at St. Peters-
burg, one of the most carefully regulated in the world. Every utensil,
instrument, and article of clothing is rendered aseptic and kept so. A
vacated room is at once stripped and disinfected. The floors are mosaic
concrete, the walls tiles and parian cement. Floors and walls are thor-
oughly washed. The result of this extreme care was that during three
years there was only one case of puerperal fever, and that was brought
in from outside.

A boiled vegetable or animal infusion in a test-tube may be kept an
indefinite time without change or fermentation when ordinary air and
objects are excluded, but a mere touch of the finger or of some object
which has been lying in a room infects with microbie life and the fiuid
goes bad. The comparative infrequency of the conveyance of some of
the infectious diseases from one to another by means of a third person
is less due to the absence of the germs than to the average resisting
power of the human body. The precautions taken to prevent the
spread of foot-and-mouth disease in sheep and cattle well illustrate
what is necessary for the protection of human beings. In an outbreak
in England in 1892, a strict watch was kept to prevent the passage of
any infected article, and no one was permitted to come in contact with
eases of the disease excepting those persons who were provided with
a.proper dress, which could be easily disinfected. If these and similar
measures had been customary for some years for the prevention of
epidemics in man, the belief in an ‘‘epidemic constitution of the atmos-
phere” or in “aerial transmission” by wind for long distances could
hardly have survived. The recent pandemic of influenza has given
occasion for the revival of these hypotheses, which were successively
overthrown in relation to consumption, the plague, cholera, yellow
fever, smallpox, and even rabies or hydrophobia. Recent investiga-
tions have, however, proved beyond all doubt that the atmosphere does
not, except possibly in the rarest instances, convey the virulent matter
of epidemics from place to place, and that there is no security against
infection so great as life in the open air and good ventilation. In fact,
the atmosphere is the great reservoir of purifying agents and the most
important of all disinfectants. In close places the air, deprived of some
of its oxygen, filled with moisture and the impurities of respiration,
can not exercise its beneficent function, and in crowded rooms infec-
tion becomes easy. So, also, cholera and other infectious matter retains
its virulence in packages or stored clothing. Under the open sky
and in pure air few species of pathogenic germs can pass many feet
unscathed.

Consumption is typical of the class of endemics which can be caught
either directly from a patient or indirectly through infected objects in
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 275

close air. People who live entirely in the open air and in well-venti-
lated, clean places do not suffer from it, except in the few cases where
it may be inherited or introduced from without. It is a disease of civ-
ilization, and many countries have been unaffected until the virus has
been brought by human agency.

Soil is not concerned in the prevalence of most endemic and epidemic
diseases, though many may have originally sprung from the soil, and
some have located themselves in certain areas from which they spread
over the globe. The small part played by soil emanations in the great
majority of spreading diseases is exemplified by the extension of epi-
demics and of endemies like consumption, diphtheria, measles, and
whooping cough, in countries which are covered with snow and con-
gealed with frost. When once introduced they pass among the popula-
tion whose habits are favorable to their growth. In islands, again,
when an infectious disease, such as measles or influenza, is introduced,
it spreads as fast as in countries where the soil might be supposed to
nourish the bacillus or micrococeus independently of the human body.
On board ships and in isolated institutions where opportunities are
given by association, many infectious diseases spread just as they might
in inhabited places, whatever the soil. At the same time endemicity is
largely a matter of soil and habitation. Infection from person to per-
son, and to a great extent through confined air, may thus be separated
off as the main condition of prevalence of infectious diseases.

Diseases capable of transmission for a short distance through the air
may, for present purposes, be divided into the following classes:

(1) Those which arise from damp soil or subsoil in alluvial plains,
deltas, valleys, mangrove swamps, certain sandy coast districts, and
other situations. Malaria, intermittent fever, and ague are the chief
diseases of this type, and are in general not transmissible from person
to person. They are transmissible a few miles through the air from the
locality of origin. Colds and sore throats probably arise from similar
conditions, and are infectious through a short distance of air to suscep-
tible persons. Forms of dysentery and certain diseases of the liver,
etc., seem to be due to conditions largely corresponding with those of
malaria.

(2) Diseases which arise in somewhat similar conditions, but seem to
have required not merely vegetable matter, but a large population and
neglected filth in the soil and water for their development. Cholerz
belongs to this class, and depends to a great extent on human filth in
the soil and befouled water. Cholera is infectious from person to per-
son through the air, but only to a slight extent, and depends for its
existence beyond its habitat on access to filthy soil, water, or places
where it grows, multiplies, and infects the air, as well as other matter,
which gains access to the body. ‘Typhoid grows on damp human filth
and may infect persons who breathe the air arising from such filth,
especially in houses and confined places. The air in the neighborhood

276 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

of a typhoid case does not appear to convey the disease, apart from
excremental matter exposed to the air. Yellow fever seems to grow in
conditions somewhat resembling those which are favorable to cholera—
filthy, damp surfaces in great heat—and infects the air in the neighbor-
hood of its growth, especially banks of rivers, harbors, holds and bilges
of ships, and dirty, dark, crowded streets. It sometimes infects direct
from a patient. These three saprophytic or semisaprophytic diseases
may be supposed to be propagated a short distance from place to place
through the air without the intervention of a human subject, but have
never been known to be carried far independently of human transporting
agency.

(3) Diseases which arise from deposits of organic matter from the
lungs and skin, and also probably from other excrementitious fiith.
Typhus and the plague may be named in this class, but other condi-
tions of filth are powerful in their genesis. Plague is both miasmatie
and contagious, and, where concentrated, seems to be capable of pass-
ing through several hundreds of yards of air. Prolonged breathing
of the sick-room air both in plague and typhus is the most effectual
means of infection. Damp, alluvial soils; streets, walls, and floors
with damp organic deposits sticking to them; carcasses and refuse
lying unburied around houses; in these situations the plague fungus
flourishes. Diphtheria arises probably from somewhat similar breed-
ing places, from heaps of house refuse, from middens, drains, ash
heaps, and polluted ground, floor, and walls, and is transmitted a short
distance through the air, probably seldom more than 10 or 20 yards.
It is very often, probably in the majority of cases, carried by the air
from person to person through a short distance, most easily in damp,
close, or confined air, like so many other infections. The diphtheria
fungus, when it has been once introduced, sticks to certain places, damp
houses and damp organically poliuted sandy soil seem to favor it. It
is improbable that it is ever conveyed far from place to place through
the air to persons except by human agency and the movements of
domestic animals. Pneumonia may possibly depend on somewhat simn-
ilar conditions, and may be caught by one person from another through
the air. Consumption, phthisis, or tuberculosis, depends to a very great
extent on conditions similar to those of typhus, and is spread through
the air a short distance in the dried matter of saliva and sputum.

(4) Scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, influenza, and dengue
arise from conditions outside the body which are unknown, but decay-
ing organic matter may provisionally be assumed to have been their
original breeding ground. They are now almost entirely dependent
on transmission from person to person, and to avery large extent on
transmission through a short distance of air. It is very seldom that
these maladies are caught in the open air, so that the medium of trans-
mission is the confined and more or less foul air of schools, houses,
churches, and theaters. They are never caught in isolated positions in
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 277

the open air, in islands to which no infection is brought by human
agency, and in well-ventilated institutions where every possible precau-
tion against infection from without can be rigidly maintained. Even
the Isles of Scilly, near the southwestern coast of England, were free
from measles, scarlet fever, and smallpox for ten years, the only district
exempt out of over seven hundred in the whole country. It was also
one of the seven districts in which no death from diphtheria occurred.!
Since communication has become frequent, owing to a great increase in
trade, the immunity does not continue, and influenza broke out there
only a few weeks later than on the mainland. Another island, Alder-
nay, was affected early by influenza through the examination of goods
by custom-house officers, who caught the infection soon after the arrival
of the steamer.

PREVENTION OF SPREAD AND PREVALENCE OF VARIOUS MALADTES.

Prevention of the spread of these various classes of disease, the
reduction of some and the extinction of others, may be effected by
the following means:

1. Malaria class.—Drainage, cultivation, planting, proper disposal of
refuse and carcasses. In places where a small area of moist ground or
small marsh gives off the dangerous exhalations, the surface might
be covered with a film of crude petroleum to prevent the escape of
the germs. Other experiments on the treatment of the surface of the
ground with antiseptic mixtures might lead to valuable results.
Powdered charcoal, and lime, might be tried.

2. Cholera class.—Proper disposal of refuse, drainage of soil, cleanli-
ness and airiness of streets, houses, quays, ships; prompt disinfection
and cleaning of places where first cases occur; prevention of over-
crowding. Where any damp surface, as in a midden, pool, or drain, is
suspected of giving off dangerous emanations, crude petroleum might
have the effect of imprisoning the germs by an impervious film, Experi-
ments are needed on means for the exclusion of living organisms from
the air, where they are numerous, by treatment of the surface soil; also
on substances inhibitive of their growth, which might be used on a

' large scale.

3. Typhus class—Cleanliness and good ventilation of dwellings and
of their surroundings and avoidance of overcrowding in houses, schools,
ete., prevent this class of disease from arising, but ordinary personal
infection has to be attacked also by isolation on the occurrence of the
first symptoms. The inside walls, floors, etc., should be of some imper-
vious material, easily and frequently washed. A dense cement or hard
wood may be suitable; but, whatever the material, liberal ventilation
and cleansing are required to prevent deposition of organic natter and
growth of fungi. In schools, etc., the walls should be of smooth cement,

glazed ware, glass, or metal, and the floors of close, hard wood or com-
mon tiles. The bacteriological examination of various wall and floor
surfaces, and of the air inclosed within them, would be of great service
with a view to the prevention of organic deposit and emanations.

4, Measles class—Cleanliness of surroundings and ventilation are
required as in the last class. Isolation on the occurrence of the first
symptoms, use of glazed or washable materials for the room where a
case is treated and for the outer clothing of attendants, absence of car-
pets and hangings, and frequent thorough sweeping, cleaning, and air-
ing would greatly reduce the number of centers of infection. Where
many people work or meet together, the air must be kept as fresh as
possible. Influenza is best reduced by immediate isolation or segre-
gation of the first cases in any place, and by avoidance of meetings in
confined spaces. The distance of air, confined and open, through which
various infections common among mankind and animals can pass should
be determined by comparison of records and by actual experiments on
animals.

The effects of the free air in healthy regions, neither very low nor
very high, neither very hot nor very cold, may be summed up as
supremely beneficial to human life and health. The most healthy
class of people are fishermen, sailors, and gardeners, yet some of these
are affected by close cabins, and others by surrounding zymotic dis-
eases. The most healthy creatures are the birds and wild animals in
fairly warm climates; a little less healthy are the sheep and oxen which
are never stalled; much less healthy are the stalled cattle and horses;
least healthy of all the higher orders of living beings are men in crowded
places.

The conditions of greatest security against endemic and infectious
diseases are also the conditions which conduce most to robustness,
physical and mental vigor, and enjoyment. Outdoor life with sufficient
work or exercise can not, with impunity to the race, be forsaken for
purely intellectual and sedentary pursuits.

IMPORTANCE OF FRESH AIR TO HORSES AND CATTLE.

Mr. Fred. Smith, professor of the Army Veterinary School at Alder-
shot, has shown the great importance of fresh air to horses in stables.
The air of buildings in which animals are kept has received very little
attention except in the army, but the results obtained by better venti-
lation wherever tried are remarkable. Warmth derived from the ani-
mals only, in a cowshed or stable, is evidenze of foul air; ventilation
should be by good-sized opposite windows, and by roof-ridge exits; and
if necessary, artificial heating should be employed. Cubic capacity
per head should be 1,600 feet. The majority of preventable diseases
among animals are traceable to food and feeding, but ‘certainly next
to this comes impure air.” By good ventilation and care for cleanliness
glanders has been entirely got rid of, a disease from which hundreds

previously died annually; pneumonia has been greatly reduced in preva-
lence and intensity; ophthalmia has nearly disappeared, and the animals
are much less susceptible to colds and coughs. ‘‘Cattle plague, pleuro-
pneumonia, variola, and probably tuberculosis are undoubtedly spread
by the medium of the air in infected areas.” This class of disease can
therefore be absolutely stamped out, and there are other diseases, such
as horse influenza and pneumonia, which, with better knowledge of
atmospheric influences in connection with the specific cause, may come
into the same category. Infected places should be treated as if in a
state of siege.

~ Port inspection, as regards some of the worst animal diseases, it is
impossible to estimate too highly; for instance, in the years up to 1886
the number of cases in Great Britain of foot-and-mouth disease was
1,993,149; since that year almost the only cases occurring have been
those which had escaped detection at ports in a very few instances, and
certain other cases which had been in their proximity. All these were
traced and most severely isolated, so that the country is saved from
great agricultural disasters by the constant vigilance of the central
and port authorities. Since many animal diseases, including tubereu-
losis, glanders, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, actinomycosis, scarlet
fever (a slight eruption in the cow), and diphtheria, are transmissible
to mankind (some of them, but to a very small degree so far as is
known, through the air in proximity), the immunity of animals from
disease concerns not only the wealth, but the health of the community.
Further inquiry is needed as to the transmissibility of horse influenza
and pneumonia through the air, and as to the connection, if any, of
these with human maladies of a like character.

THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITIES
AND ON NATIONAL HEALTH.

The influence of atmospheric qualities upon the bodily constitution
and health, upon the mind, and upon the enjoyment of life, is eminently
worthy of consideration. When we come to examine closely into the
manifold causes which contribute toward human happiness, we find
that, upon the whole, comparing acclimatized races, the differences in
the results in regard to all except extreme varieties depend at least as
much on human, artificial, and removable causes as on climate and on
atmospheric conditions. The peasant of Norway may be as healthy and
as happy as the peasant of Italy, the native craftsman or the ryot of
India as contented though not so vigorous as the woodsman or farmer
of Canada, the African negro of the equatorial zone and the uncor-
rupted Greenlander may physically enjoy life as much as the English
or American laborer. The peculiarities and tendencies of race can
hardly be separated in the account from the effects of climate. Broadly
speaking, however, we may safely affirm that, apart from the special and
preventable evils of a high civilization, the most vigorous, flourishing,

280 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

intellectual, healthy, and progressive people of the world are those —
which inhabit the temperate zones. Within the tropics the strongest
and most energetic peoples, bodily and mentally, are those living
in the mountains or at high altitudes. The inhabitants of low ground
in hot climates are inclined to be listless, uninventive, apathetic,
and improvident. ‘They live for the day, shut their eyes on the future,
and have a leaning toward fatalism. An equable high temperature
with much moisture weakens body and mind. No long-established
lowland tropical race is a conquering race in the widest sense of the
term, or forward in the march of intelligence. But certain nations have
the power of resisting, at any rate for a long time, the enervating
influence of a moist, warm climate, with the malarious fevers which
commonly belong to it. The Arabs and Chinese evince extraordinary
power in this respect. The Arabs not only thrive in their own hot, dry
country, but on the coast and in the interior of Africa, where the
negroes are driven like sheep before them. The Chinese make excellent
and most industrious laborers, even in the climate of Java, Sumatra,
and Borneo, and where neither Malays nor Europeans persist in the
hard work of cultivation. Their fare is rather scanty, and, as a rule,
entirely vegetable. The Italians and Spaniards, again, can withstand
hot climates better than most Kuropeans. The Spaniards have greatly
multiplied in Cuba, the Portuguese do not desert the oppressive forest
regions of Brazil. The natives of the South of France thrive in Algeria
better than natives of the North of France. On the other hand, the
people of northern Europe, if they do not themselves suffer much in
the tropics, rapidly degenerate, and the race either becomes extinct or
greatly enfeebled in a few generations. In Java, Europeans do not
live beyond three generations. It was shown many years ago by a dis-
tinguished lady, and has now to some extent been long recognized by
military and civil authorities in India, that a very large part of the
excessive British mortality in India was owing in the first place to
removable insanitary conditions, and in the second place, to faulty diet
and personal habits. The realization by the governing authorities of
the true and possible conditions of living in a hot climate has led to a
large reduction in the rates of sickness and death. Stokvis has shown
how in recent years Europeans have lived much better than formerly
in the tropics. Even children to the number of one hundred or more,
from the age of infancy to the age of 18 have grown up well in an
institution in Calcutta, where they were carefully tended. Theimproper
and excessive consumption of animal flesh, spirits and beer, and the
disregard of simple hygienic rules, still continue to give to climate an
ill name which fairly belongs to habit. Making full allowance, how-
ever, for these preventable causes of disease and degeneration, the fact
remains that children can only with difficulty grow to due strength and
capacity in the climate of India and the lowland tropics generally. They
begin to flag after their fourth year. Common experience demonstrates
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 281

the impracticability of colonizing the equatorial zone with the races
of the cooler temperate regions. Even the high stations on the hills,
where the temperature may not be above that of the home country,
are not sufficiently favorable to the continuance of the family and to
permanent settlement. The air, though cool at night and agreeably
warm by day, is somewhat too much rarefied, and the sun shines yerti-
cally. At 7,500 feet the pressure and density of the air are lessened
by one-fourth, and the sun’s heat increased by many degrees.

Australia is not yet proved to be equal to the Mother Country as a
permanent home for the Anglo-Saxon race; indeed, there is some evi-
dence that the British standard is not maintained, but this is largely
accounted for by causes which may be considered within human
control.

Hot climates are not favorable to emigrants above 44 years of age or
to children under 16, and field labor can not well be undertaken.

While Europeans visiting hot, moist climates are apt to be attacked
in the bowels, the inhabitants of hot climates visiting Europe and
North America are especially attacked by, and often succumb, to dis-
eases of the respiratory organs. The cold countries are unfavorable
to the establishment of tropical races. <A similar relation seems to
hold here between cold and respiratory diseases and heat and bowel
diseases, as we have seen to prevail in winter and summer in temperate
climates, but the effect is accentuated when the subject is unacelima-
tized. That the natives of tropical Africa can increase and multiply
in subtropical or moderately warm climates is proved by their increase
in the Southern States of North America.

Tropical islands are not in general well adapted for colonization by
northern Europeans, for though their climate is more moderate than
that of the mainiand and tempered by sea breezes, fever often infects
the valleys, and the moisture of the atmosphere has a relaxing influ-
ence. But many islands not considered wholesome would be far more
congenial if proper hygienic measures were taken and the most suit-
able food and clothing habitually used. The Sandwich Islands are
favorable for settlement, and may be compared with tropical highlands
of moderate elevation.

The most remarkable instance of the permanent settlement of English
people in the tropies is that of the inhabitants of the Barbados and of
Tuagua, one of the Bahama Islands. The former are descendants of
rebels sent from England for slavery between 1650 and 1700. They
have survived through conditions of great misery and severe exposure.
The islanders are now chiefly occupied in fishing. Deterioration there
has been, but this may fairly be ascribed to poverty and improper food
rather than to climate. In Tuagua the people, some of whom belonged
to families settled there since the time of Charles If, appear to have
maintained somewhat better health and physique.

It is noteworthy how in some circumstanees a seemingly small change
of climate does harm or good and in others a very great change has no

282 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

ill effects. Invigoration immediately follows a change from southern
England to the Alps, the Scotch Highlands, Norway, or the open sea;
a change for the worse, and loss of vigor overtakes natives of the north
of England or of Scotland who fix their abode in the Thames Valley
or near cities in the south. On the other hand, English crews may
winter in the Arctic regions, where temperature is 60 degrees below
what they are accustomed to, and diet coarse and unvarying; yet they
maintain perfect health. Food untainted and moderate in quantity
and abstinence from alcohol probably have much to do with health
maintenance in any climate.

Temperature falls about 1° F. for every 270 feet altitude on the aver-
age.! Other conditions being equal, a place at 6,000 feet high has a
temperature fully 20° lower than the plain at the sea level.

Generally, the range of temperature increases from the equator
toward the poles, from the coast toward the interior, and from moun-
tains in the tropics to mountains in northern countries. Humidity is
less at high levels, but relative humidity may be greater than at low
levels, and saturation may prevail for long periods. In Europe the
level of maximum rainfall is about 3,000 to 4,000 feet; in the tropies,
also, the lesser mountain ranges have more rain than the highest, and
the maximum rainfall is about 6,000 feet. Mountain valleys are less
healthy than high plateaus.

The ‘ vital” or lung capacity diminishes from about 266 to 246 cubie
inches in the ascent from sea level to 2,000 feet, and the pulse beats
faster by fifteen to twenty in the minute. At 2,000 feet the pressure of
air on the chest is reduced by over 200 pounds. Since vital capacity is
also diminished by high temperature, the hill station can not equal in
this respect the temperate climate, but there is reason to believe that
the lung capacity increases in course of time so as to be fully equal to
its value at the low level. Evaporation from the skin and lungs
increase, and digestion and sleep are generally good.

Strength is naturally greater in hill people. Life is hard, and the
weaker members perish; the pure air invigorates; the changes of tem-
perature refresh; good water is plentiful; the exertion of climbing and
the deep breathing expand the chest and increase the lung capacity;
the food is wholesome and not in excess; activity and alertness are gen-
erally expected. On the other hand, in high mountain valleys malaria
is often found, also goitre, asthma, ophthalmia, inflammation of the
lungs, and diseases of the kidneys. Dysentery, acute bronchial catarrh,
typhus, albuminaria, and diabetes are rare; also the many zymotic and
other diseases more or less dependent on aggregation.

MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITIES IN RELATION TO CLIMATE.

Distinguished observers! maintain that the white man can not flourish
in the tropics, and will not work where an inferior race works; that
in Ecuador and Brazil the white race dies out in the third genera-
tion; that in Southern and Central America, north of Uruguay, the
colonies break up through fever and climate; that in Panama and other
parts of Central America the air is so pestilential that even the Chinese
succumb at an enormous rate, and that the most fertile parts of the
earth, which are bound to be the most populous, can not possibly be
the homes of the Aryan race, or of any higher race whatsoever. There
can be no doubt that mental and bodily qualities are very largely
affected by the atmosphere, with its various constitution of density,
temperature, moisture, cloudiness, fog, wind, and organic pollution.
Extended investigation of the effect of climate upon human health and
welfare would lead to results of the highest importance. The inquiry
might be directed, in the first place, to an historical examination of the
movements of nations, races, tribes, and individuals, and of the effect
upon them of change of climate, separating as far as possible the
results due to preventable circumstances and change of habits, from
results which might be regarded as necessary in the relations of the
atmospheric and the human constitution.

Secondly, the fitness of various races for removal to various climates
under modern conditions might be examined, amd the effects of tropical
highlands be compared with those of lowlands.

When we recollect the evil reputation of many localities and climates
which in the first half of this century were spoken of as deadly, and
when we consider that these have lost their bad name solely by the
exercise of local and personal hygiene, we can not despair of the power
of man for reducing the unhealthiness even of large areas and tropical
climates. Last century a troopship, a prison, and a barrack may each
habitually have rivaled the worst tropical country in sickness and
mortality; to-day they are as healthy as a country village; the prison,
indeed, is a model of salubrity. -

The fact has been extensively realized that cultivation and draining
may often do for a pestilential tract what cleanliness and ventilation
do for an infected building. A scientific inquiry into the results of
cultivation, draining, and irrigation in improving or harming the health
of districts subject to malaria in various parts of the world would
afford information of great value. The nature of the soil, the height
of the subsoil water, the microbiology of the soil and of the superincum-
bent air, and the effect of atmospheric conditions should be tabulated
and compared. We already have evidence of the frequent recrudes-
cence of malaria through artificial irrigation in India, and in Hgypt

1 Pearson, National Life and Character, Wiener’s Senor et Bolivie. Orton’s Andes
and Ennegone Curtis’s Capitals of South Annantor.

284 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

the possibility of the revival of plague through irrigation can not be
lost sight of. What malaria means in India is best realized by a glance
at the mortality statistics, which show that 3,000,000 natives annually
fall victims to this most fatal of all endemic diseases, and we know
that where one dies many are enfeebled for life.

Looking at the available evidence, we may fairly infer (1) that the
inhabitants of temperate climates are, on the whole, intellectually and
physically superior, and that they owe this position largely to atmos-
pheric conditions; (2) that in the tropies and commoily in the temper-
ate zone the inhabitants of the mountains are physically the strongest;
(3) that tropical countries are not favorable for rapid permanent coloni-
zation by the races of northern Europe and of the Northern States of
America; (4) that the maintenance of healthy conditions in persons
passing from one kind of climate to another very different climate
depends to a great extent on the observance of hygienic method and a
change of habit, but also on the time taken to make the move, rapidity
of transition being inimical to health; (5) that tribes or races have
moved from hot to cold, and cold to hot climates, occupying centuries
or thousands of years in their progress, and have not invariably suf-
fered or degenerated, and that therefore, and on other grounds, it is
probable that fairly healthy hot or cold countries may in the course of
centuries be colonized by races which have successively and slowly
occupied lands warmer or colder than their own; (6) that people long
subject to extreme variations of temperature, as between winter and
summer, and day and night, are better able to colonize than those whe
are subject to more uniform temperature.

MODE OF ATTACK OF MIASMATIC DISEASES.

It is very desirable that the various diseases which affect the inhabit-
ants of moist countries in the tropics should be traced to their original
haunts, and their favorite channel of communication be ascertained.
Is the condition known as tropical anemia mainly a result of tempera-
ture or of an emanation from the soil in the air? Are dysentery, diar-
rhea, hepatitis, and liver disease due mostly to organisms swallowed
in food or drink, or inhaled in the air overlying soil rich in organie
matter, or are they produced by merely physical properties of the
atmosphere acting on imperfectly healthy bodies, by means of over-
fatigue, insolation, or chill? It appears likely that both air and water
are capable, in the case of several tropical diseases, of conveying the
poison. Thus, at Sierra Leone, improved water lowered the death rate,
but it still remains high; in the villages of the Najagarrh hills in India,
a drain-eut reducing the flood level by 3 feet greatly improved the
health of the people, and splenic enlargement cases were reduced to
less than one-sixth of their former prevalence; in the canal-irrigated
country in India fever.is both more prevalent and more virulent, and a
sreat difference in the health of the people is observed between places

where the water level is high and where it is low; the mere neighbor-
hood of a swamp, without any pollution of water supply, is often suffi-
cient to prostrate troops. There can indeed be no doubt that air
infected from the ground very commonly causes a widespread epidemic
of malaria. When the waters of a flood subside, the fever extends
over a wide area and beyond the limits of the flood; and exposure to
night air without any other source of contamination is a frequent cause
of fever even to the robust. Considering the large number of varieties
of bacilli residing in mold and in damp earth covered by sand, the
relation of diseases to the air and vapor emanating from the ground is
a subject worthy of national or international research.

All over the world there are indications, if not such evidence as
amounts to proof, that where the air stagnates or is confined in valleys
without exposure to frequent winds, the condition of robust health in
a population is not well maintained. In certain valleys of Switzerland,
of the Pyrenees, of Derbyshire, in England, and of parts of India
goiter and cretinism have been common; in low-lying clay districts in
England cancer has been shown to be prevalent above the average, and
in limestone or chalk districts to be below the average. Valleys lying
across the direction of the prevailing wind and not well ventilated are
liable to an excess of heart disease. Whether these effects are in any
degree due to stagnant or miasmatic air or wholly to difference in the
water supply it is uncertain, and the subject demands inquiry.

Climate has often been credited, even by great writers, with effects
on the human constitution which statistics have failed to indicate.
Most people have supposed that suicide in England must be most fre-
quent in November or in winter when the dark foggy air depresses the
spirits. As a matter of fact, however, in England and in Europe, as a
whole, suicides are most frequent in the summer half of the year, and
especially in May and June, when the aspect of nature is most cheer-
ful and the air bright and pleasant. A very distinct and considerable
rise in Suicides, crimes, and nervous diseases takes place in the spring
and early summer. ‘The first cold weather in autumn produces a tem-
porary and smaller increase. Montesquieu assumed that the number
of suicides is excessive in England, and attributed them to depression,
eaused by the dark, cold, damp climate. As a matter of fact, the sui-
cides in England are not excessive when compared with France and
central Germany, and the climate is not often dark and damp for long
periods. Esquirol and Cabanis asserted that a rainy autumn following
a dry summer is productive of violent deaths; Vilemais maintains
that nine-tenths of suicides happen in rainy and cloudy weather.
Quite a different order of things is revealed by a comparison of the
figures for suicide, and especially for the suicide of insanity, for the
different months. The quick increase of the temperature of the air,
the dryness and sunshine of the spring have the effect of precipitating

mental alienation and increasing nerve instability; the organism is

least robust when the winter passes away.

286 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

Suicide predominates in the central part of EKurope between latitudes
47 and 57 and longitudes 20 and 40. In the southwest and northeast
of Kurope the tendency is much less. Italy, Spain, and Portugal have
a minimum number. The distribution appears to be little affected by
climate, and very largely by mental advance and cultivation, so that
the climatic factor, if existent, is concealed. But there is sufficient
reason in Hurope, at least, to attribute an excess of nervous diseases
when other conditions are equal to periodic hot and dry weather and
alternations of heat and cold. Countries either very hot or very cold
are less subject to suicidal tendencies than the temperate region. But
inquiry is needed to dissociate the climatic factor from the many others
which confuse the evidence in civilized countries.

The influence of climate upon health and upon national character
has never been very fully studied, and is worthy of the attention of
Government and of science. The effect of change of climate has
already been touched upon in another part of this essay.

The degree of cold which the human body ean easily bear is surpris-
ing. A temperature of —70° F. with a dry and still air is less trying
than a temperature of 20° with damp and strong wind. The present
writer has had experience on a mountain in Italy of a temperature of
17° F., with sunshine, which was quite pleasant and not too cold for
sitting out. Even invalids can sleep with windows open and sit out,
without very heavy clothing, when the thermometer shows several
degrees of frost. The purity of the air as well as the dryness seems
to invigorate the frame and prevent the sensation of chill. Voyagers
in the Arctic regions endure prolonged cold without in any way suffer-
ing in health if judicious in their mode of life, and mountaineers are
seldom the worse for exposure unless they have greatly fatigued them-
selves or have been overtaken by rain or snow. The tolerance of heat
is also very remarkable where the air is dry and pure and direct sun-
shine avoided. The temperature of the body rises about 0.05° F. for
every increase of 1° F. above the ordinary temperature. The amount
of air respired is less in hot than cold climates, in the proportion of
8.157 to 10 ounces of carbon. ‘The total effect of heat and of cold on
the human body has never been fully investigated. The net result,
however, of a very complex series of changes induced by different tem-
peratures on the inhabitants of different lands seems to show that a
moderate or medium temperature is most favorable to health and
strength, apart from telluric and constitutional factors, and from diet,
training, and habits. Yet there can be no doubt that some race of
mankind may attain very great strength and health in any nonmala-
rious climate,
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 287

PART III.—VARIoUS ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS AND PHENOMENA.
TEMPERATURE AND HEALTH.

The relation of the temperature of the air to health has already been
noted in the case of various diseases. Thus malaria, dysentery, liver
diseases, cholera, yellow fever, and dengue belong especially to hot
climates. Anemia and general enfeeblement affect the inhabitants of
colder regions when stationed in the tropies. Hot weather in northern
Europe increases the prevalence of several diseases, and with drought
increases the death rate in towns and damp places. Diarrhea becomes
prevalent, and in less degree scarlet fever and diphtheria. Diseases of
the intestines increase. Cold, dry, still weather is generally healthy
except in towns, and to old people, and to persons whose lungs are
delicate. A cold winter in temperate climates increases the death rate,
and a mild winter is healthy in northwestern Europe. Influenza, pneu-
monia, and bronchitis are more fatal in cold weather. Diseases of the
circulatory system, heart disease, and phtlisis are at their maximum of
fatality. Cold, clear, still, frosty weather is, on the whole, healthy and
much less fatal in towns than cold with tog.

The most favorable temperature to health in temperate climates is
about 55° to 70° on an average; natives of the tropics probably thrive
best at a temperature of about 65° to 80°,

DRY CLIMATES AND HEALTH,

A perennially dry air is almost universally favorable to human life,
and dryness in a sparsely inhabited and well-watered country is whole-
some in several ways, especially, perhaps, in its preventive effect on
epidemic and lung diseases. In towns, dry weather without showers
is much less favorable, in fact it is distinctly unfavorable. Very damp
and rainy countries with moderate temperature are often healthy; for
instance, western Ireland, western Scotland, Cornwall, and the lake
district of England. The deaths from consumption, ete., are much
fewer in these districts than in the drier districts which are more
thickly inhabited, though not less, perhaps, than in equally sparsely
inhabited drier country districts. That they are so numerous as they
are depends probably very much on the tendency to aggregation and
bad ventilation in the dwellings in bad weather. Tropical or warm
countries, and warm seasons, in many localities, are unwholesome when
there has been much rainfall, and this is succeeded by hot weather.
Much moisture in a calm air helps greatly to spread various epidemic
diseases and malaria. Dry air is favorable to the healing of wounds,
and probably to the oxidation or death by desiccation of noxious living
matter in the air.

The exemption of many tribes and races living in dry climates from
phthisis and other disorders of an infectious nature may be, and

288 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

probably is, partly due directly to the dry air which does not permit
the growth of the bacillus on solid substances or soil, but must also be
attributed to the migratory habits of the people, the outdoor life, and
the absence of centers of infection. Arabs, who were exempt from
phthisis and scrofula in their camps, died at the rate of 50 per cent
when they were located in French prisons. This is only one of many
instances which go to prove that the infective matter of consumption
clings to solid surfaces and thence invades the human system through
confined air.
HEALTH AT HIGH ALTITUDES.

The effect of living at high altitudes has been variously stated, but on
the whole it seems probable that most persons become acclimatized to
the rarity of the air, diminished pressure, lower temperature, lessened
humidity, and increased sun power. Above 6,000 feet the pulse and
respiration rates are slightly increased. Dr. Marcet gave as the chief
outcome of several years’ experiments on the amount of carbon dioxide
and air expired at high altitudes the following statements:! The effect
of altitude and cold combined increases the amount of carbon dioxide
expired, but where the cold does not become appreciably greater, as on
the Peak of Teneriffe, the amount remains the same as at the sea level.
At altitudes above 10,000 feet the amount is lessened. Less air is
expired at high altitudes. It appears that the blood more readily
acquires oxygen at high altitudes than near the sea level. The body
can gradually accommodate itself to altitudes much above 10,000 feet.
Recent laboratory experiments by Dr. Loewy showed that the diminu-
tion of air density and pressure to about 17.717 inches is well borne,
greater rarefaction being balanced by deeper inspiration. A similar
compensation occurs when carbon dioxide is added to the air. Animals
breathing air rarefied to half an atmosphere eject the same amount of
blood from the heart as under normal pressure. :

The expansion of the chest and increased action of the heart add to
strength and vigor, and the mountain races, with the exception of peo-
ple living in deep or flat valleys, are generally fine in build. In the
tropics, Quito is an example of a large population doing well at a height
of 10,000 feet. For some forms of consumption, consumptive tendencies,
and several other diseases, such as anzmia, altitude is beneficial; for
others, including nervous irritability and heart weakness, it is harmful.
The elements which are concerned in these effects have not been identi-
fied. For old people and those who ean not take much exercise, mountain
heights are clearly not well adapted.

SHA AIR AND HEALTH.

Sea air is very beneficial to the great majority of people, and has a
wonderful restorative power in many ailments and illnesses. It is free

1 Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878, 1879.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 289

from all kinds of infective germs, and therefore epidemic diseases are
unknown at sea, except in so far as they arise from the material, pro-
visions, or water of the ship, or have been brought on board by crew or
passengers. Much of the benefit which would otherwise be derived
from a sea voyage is often counteracted by the small space and diffi-
culties of ventilation of sleeping berths and cabins. The temperature
of the tropics has a bad effect upon the crew and passengers of ships
from colder climates, and loss of weight results; but, in general, the
weight and strength of passengers are increased by voyaging in a fair
climate. Much depends, of course, upon the accommodation and diet,
as well as upon the atmospheric conditions.

THE IMPROVEMENT OF CLIMATE WITH SLIGHT ELEVATION,

From a certain number of experiments and from a review of observa-
tions taken by meteorologists of differences between temperature and
humidity at different heights above the ground, the present writer
came to the following conclusions,' shortly stated:

The mean temperature at a height of about 100 feet above the
ground does not differ sensibly from the mean temperature at 5 feet,
but seems to be slightly in excess.

The means of daily maxima at heights of 69 and 128 feet fall short
of the mean maxima at 10 feet, and still more of the maxima at 4 feet.
The means of daily minima at the greater heights exceed the mean
minima at the smaller heights.

There is a certain altitude, apparently about 150 feet above the
ground, at which, while the mean temperature is equal to that at 4 feet,
the maxima are lower and the minima higher than at any lower point.

On an average of nineteen months, the mean of maxima was about
1.5° F. lower at 128 feet 10 inches than at 10 feet, and the mean of
minima about 0.55° higher.

In eyelones the higher, and in anticyclones the lower, points gen-
erally have the lowest mean temperature.

The mean night temperature is always highest at the higher points,
and the mean day temperature always lowest.

About sunset in clear or foggy weather, when caln, temperature falls
much faster near the ground than at some height above it.

Equality of lower and upper temperature seems to occur about two
hours before sunset and atter sunrise, but varies with the season.

In clear weather and low fogs, between sunset and sunrise, tempera-
ture is always, or nearly always, higher at heights varying from 50 to
300 feet above the ground than at heights from 2 to 22 feet.

In bad weather the higher points are coldest by day and night. In
foggy weather, especially with ground or radiation fogs, temperature
is very much the lowest near the ground, and within the fog much

290 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The mean daily range at 128 feet approaches closely that of the
English seacoast, and at 69 feet is about midway between that of coast
and inland stations.

Mean humidity is more than 1° less at 69 and 128 feet than at 10
feet surrounded by trees. Humidity by day is a little greater, by
night much less, 2° or 3°.

Places on hills or slopes from 150 to 700 feet above a plain or valley,
especially with a southern aspect, have a much smaller annual range,
and also a smaller daily range than places on the flat. At 545 feet a
superiority of 12° or 13° in the extreme minimum has been registered.
Thus we find that at a height about equal to that of the upper rooms
of a high house a more equable and drier climate prevails than near
the ground, and that conditions on sloping or well-chosen natural
elevations are on the whole similar.

The importance to delicate persons, and indeed to the majority of
people, of living at some height above the ground, especially in places
which are damp, subject to fog, or to unwholesome emanations from
the ground, has yet to be appreciated.

EFFECT OF IMPURITIES IN THE AIR OF TOWNS ON MENTAL AND
BODILY HEALTH.

A dense population in manufacturing and other large towns is aceus-
tomed to breathe a compound mixture in the air which in course of
time profoundly affects the health of the race. The oxygen is deficient,
the ozone absent, carbon dioxide in excess, hydrocarbons, animal and
mineral dust, sulphurous acid, chlorides, ammonia, and microorganisms
in pernicious abundance.

The small tenements or crowded rooms produce the high death rate,
an enormous proportion of deaths in childhood, and of diseases of the
lungs at all ages. The best model dwellings, on the contrary, have a
lower death rate than the mean of the town, although the population to
the acre is dense.! In New York, about twenty-five years ago, 495,000
persons lived in tenement houses and cellars, most of them dark, damp,
and unventilated. By hygienic measures, largely by ventilation, the
death rate was reduced in twelve years from 1 in 33 to 1 in 38.

Townspeople spend much more of their lives indoors than the peas-
antry. At their work and in their rooms they breathe dust of many
sorts, particles of skin, organic poisons, and often many pathogenic
germs which would develop in their bodies if they had not already
passed through the specific disorder. The air being deprived of its
exhilarating power, they seek stimulants in food and drink, and go to
mischievous excess in the consumption of animal flesh and alcohol.
Hence many internal diseases. Children are never seen of the right
sturdiness and color which is common in the country. Most children

politan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes in Lon-
don, has been for some years past much below the average.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 291

born and bred in the crowded parts of towns are sickly, pale, feeble,
unnaturally sharp and wizened, their voices are of bad quality, and
their height and weight deficient. The elder people become reckless,
often depraved, dirty, and scarcely ever free from ailments. Their
whole bodily, mental, and moral nature deteriorates. As aconsequence,
it is difficult for native townsfolk to obtain employment in competition
with immigrants from the country. In general, policemen, laborers,
domestic servants, and several other classes of employees are found to
be most fitted for their duties if country born, and thus perpetual immi-
gration is stimulated. The best and strongest people are constantly
migrating to the great towns, bringing their health and youth to sup-
ply the demand for good work, and reducing the death rate, so that the
true proportion of victims of town air and town conditions fails to be
realized. As a matter of fact, it has been ascertained that very few
families survive in central London for more than four generations, and
that many die out in two or three generations. <A true Londoner of
the fifth and even of the fourth generation is rare. A very large pro-
portion, probably the majority, lose the fine stock of health they brought
with them from the country within two generations.! This is a matter
of national and international importance, and the fact should be clearly
understood by the public and by legislators that the desertion of the
country by the best blood involves the rapid consumption of the finest
physical, mental, and moral qualities.

We have, in fact, in our midst areas—climates, if we may so strain the
term—of which the properties come into close competition with the influ-
ences of the tropics in bringing about the decline and extirpation of
families. If the inner circle of a great city were to exclude immigra-
tion for a generation, the poverty of its health resources would stare it
in the face, and the falling value of a day’s labor would startle it into
the promotion of hygienic reform. Room and space would be demanded
as a necessity for the proper development of human beings.

The rate of mortality is greatly increased by the bad air of towns,
and especially by the close, foul air of dwellings and workshops. But
the rate of sickness is still more increased above that of the breezy
country. In one part of the parish of St. George’s-in-the-East, in Lon-
don, there are nine cases of sickness to one death, but in the worst
part of the same district there are twenty known cases of sickness to
one death, and a sickness rate of 620 per 1,000. There is, in fact, no
good health in the people of the crowded streets, unless it may be for

1 Defining a Londoner as one who habitually resides in London, with only few
holidays, and whose great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents were Londoners,
it is exceedingly difficult to find such a specimen among 5,000,000 people. Even
true Londoners of the third generation are very disproportionately small in numbers
and feeble in health and strength. These facts, however, do not prove that the
inhabitants of large towns must of necessity decay unless recruited from without,
for with better homes, houses, more air, reduced hours of work, more holidays, and
better hygienic conditions of suburban as compared with central quarters, the pros-
pect of continued vitality greatly improves.

292 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

a short time among newcomers from the country. ‘They are perpet-
ually on the trudge to the hospitals, and get patched up again and
again and liveon.”' Much of this most deplorable state of things may
be owing to excess of alcoholic drink, but the excess is in many cases
the result of a demand for a stimulant which pure air might have pre-
vented. About 1,000,900 out of 4,000,000 persons are treated at London
hospitals and dispensaries in a year, and probably this represents fairly
well the sickuess of great towns in general. A great amount of the
lassitude and idleness of the lowest population of cities has been traced
by Dr. Richardson to want of ventilation, in their own and former gen-
erations. ‘Tell them,” said Mr. Chadwick, the great sanitary reformer,
“that when they hear of that disease called consumption they ought
to know that it comes constantly from bad administration, which per-
mits dwelling houses to be built on damp and sodden and rotten sites,
and which permits industrial workers to breathe, but not to live, in foul
airs, gases, vapors, and dusts. Tell them that in model dwellings a
death rate of 15 in the 1,000 has replaced one of 30 in the 1,000.” Dr.
Louis C. Parkes, medical officer for Chelsea, states that much of the
anemia, the pale faces and disordered digestions, and many of the wast-
ing diseases of children in the great towns are to no small extent due
to a condition of atmosphere which prevents the perfect action of the
lungs and the complete oxygenation of the blood, and so lowers the tone
of the body and the ability to repel disease. These facts ought to be
impressed upon the population. In England it has been computed that
the amount now annually spent on intoxicating liquors might double
the actual house room for every family.

The causes of physical degradation in towns are no doubt complex,
but that bad air and want of light are very powerful factors, is proved
by the following considerations:

Children placed in every respect in equaily good conditions in town
as they have had in the country, with the exception of the difference
of town air, in many cases lose health, grow pale and weak, and in fact
do not thrive as they do in the country. Children brought up within
the central area of large towns are less robust than children brought
up in the country; the children of the poor especially suffer, for though
they may have the chance of more flesh meat and often of more food,
the air they breathe both without and within doors is inferior, and this
affects them not only directly, but indirectly, as through loss of appetite.
Very many children in towns have poor and unwholesome appetites.
Children in small, crowded towns in various countries, e. g., Italy or
Spain, where the streets are narrow and the air foul, often look
unhealthy and feeble, and bad air alone, both in town and country,
is known to give similar results. Children who are ailing or simply
pallid and unhealthy, after the pattern of the alley, very soon gain in
health and appearance when moved to country air. The experience of
very many adults is similar to that of children, and they rapidly or

gradually lose their accustomed vigor during a period of employment
in crowded or badly ventilated places. The air of workshops, printing
rooms, mills, etc., sometimes changes young, vigorous looking men
almost beyond recognition in the course of one or two years. Outdoor
work in towns is far less pernicious, and if houses and streets were
more spacious, and work places more airy, the physical degradation
would be much less perceptible. The mental and moral effect of living
in bad air can hardly be estimated, mixed up as it is with the various
other conditions which generally accompany it. The wits are certainly
dulled when oxygen is wanting and carbonic acid in excess, but social
contact tends perhaps more powerfully to sharpen them. Sharpness,
cunning, and alertness increase in towns, but great work demanding
sustained intellectual effort is not favored, but vitiated, by bad air.
In schools, the loss of attention, the difficulty of keeping on long ata
task, and the sympathetic weariness, are very frequently the result of
bad ventilation. The schoolmaster has great power to improve the
quality, or rather the scope, of his pupil’s brains by the admission of
plenty of air. School-masters and teachers as a class are not in the
list of healthy occupations, although they are above the average of
strength when they enter their profession. The air they breathe must
be concerned in the disorders which especially attack them. Town air
seems to tend ta weaken the power of the will, the self-command, and
the exhilarating sense of freedom and content which distinguish inde-
pendent yeomen or the peasantry of the hill country, who breathe the
vital atmosphere. But here again, we fail to discriminate between the
effects of physical and of social differences. Since ‘“self-reverence,
self-knowledge, self-control” are among the highest human attributes,
and most essential for future progress, the effects, direct and indirect,
of vitiated air on character might with advantage form the subject of
extended and carefully conducted scientific inquiry.

Intemperance in drink has been commonly attributed to foul air
among other influences. There can be no doubt that many a man has
become enfeebled by working in bad air, and has taken to drink in the
vain hope of keeping up his strength, or with the deliberate intention,
for the moment justified, of stimulating his faculties occasionally when
they flag. Where the air has so little freshness, mind and body are
more likely to crave for artificial and less wholesome sustenance.
Whether on the whole the indoor workers consume more alcohol than
the outdoor may be doubted, but the effect upon them, beyond question,
is worse.

An investigation of the effect of air on mental qualities might be
undertaken on the following lines: A number of schools in which
ventilation is good to be compared with schools similar in class of
Scholars, etc., but with bad ventilation of less space, the character of
the work and of the scholars to be compared; schools where great
improvements in ventilation have been made to be examined as to any
notable progress following the improvements; workshops of similar

classes to be compared, respectively good and deficient in ventila-
tion or -Space, the results as regards health, vigor, intemperance, and
efficiency.

WIND FORCE AND HEALTH IN A LARGE TOWN.

In an inquiry made quite recently by the present writer, but hitherto
unpublished, concerning the relation between the health of London in
winter and the force of the wind, the conclusion was arrived at that on
the whole, the mortality 1s greater in calm than in windy weather, and
that there is much less variation in the death rate during the preva-
lence of strong winds than during the prevalence of gentle winds and
calms. The period examined was from November, 1872, to December,
1893. In January, 1890, and in the first quarter of 1892, influenza
greatly raised the mortality above the normal, but since this is one of
the zymotice diseases, of which the prevalence is increased by calm
weather, the figures for these periods have not been omitted. The
months of October, November, and December, in 1879 and in 1839,
were the least windy periods recorded, and each was followed by a high
death rate. Several calm periods coincide with great cold and fog, and
it is these in combination which have the worst effect upon health in a
smoky town.

Further investigation is required to ascertain which diseases are
most apt to spread in calm weather, and the relation of particular
winds to particular diseases.

The following table represents roughly and approximately the rates
of mortality in the periods mentioned:

DEW AND FROST—EXHALATION OF VAPOR FROM THE EARTH,

From an investigation conducted by the present writer during the
two summers 1891 and 1892, the following were among the conclusions
arrived at:

Calm or a light air is favorable to dew formation. Wind prevents
the deposition of much dew and evaporates much of what is formed.
Free radiation or an exposed situation is, on the whole, perhaps the
most effectual cause of dew on very many nights of the year. In a
level country those parts of a field which are least sheltered by trees
and hedges gain most dew on perfectly calm nights. Those parts of
any flat substance with the most exposure to the sky are on calm nights
most bedewed. The tops of bushes, posts, railings, pans, ete., are on
calm nights more bedewed than the sides. Greater cold by. greater
radiation in these cases produces greater deposition. Radiation from
fine points, however, is often not sufficient to counteract in air which is
not very humid the effect of the continual impact of air above the dew-
point and higher in temperature. Close to the ground the case is gen-
erally different, for the movement of air is less and the humidity and
cold greater. With fog oravery humid air the points are most bedewed.
In dry weather the dew is deposited most on the leeward side, in moist
air or fog on the windward side of objects.

Nearly all the conclusions of Wells were confirmed. But a very
remarkable amount of evidence soon accumulated from the experiments
that a great proportion of the dew formed near the ground is condensed

296 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

from vapor derived from the earth. A large quantity of dew was inva-
riably found on clear nights in the interior of closed vessels inverted
over grass and sand, very little or none in vessels inverted over plates
lying on the ground. The inverted glasses or vessels, however much
their rims were embedded in the ground, gave similar results. More
dew was found on the lower surface of plates of glass or earthenware
or boards slightly raised above the ground than on the upper surface.
The lower sides of stones, slates, glass, and paper on the ground were
more bedewed than the upper sides. The lower half of stones lying
or embedded in sand was more often bedewed and frosted than the
upper half. The interior of closed vessels inverted on the grass and
covered with two other vessels of badly conducting substance was
thickly bedewed, and the grass in the three inclosures was also thickly
bedewed. The deposit on the interior of vessels was much less over
dry garden earth than over sand or turf. A great deal of dew was
deposited on the interior of vessels over dry sand or dust, the earth
being somewhat moist an inch or two inches below. Pebbles, etc.,
lying on a dusty road became quite wet underneath early in the evening,
and over grass the underside of a square of glass is clouded soon after
the grass loses the sunshine. A very great difference of temperature
was found soon after sunset after hot days between the temperature of
the soil at a depth of 2 or 3 inches and the temperature of the air close
to the ground, just above the blades of grass. On one evening at
11 p. m. the temperature of the exposed grass was 36; of the soil at 15
inches, 60.5.

The author became convinced by these experiments and other con-
siderations, that a great deal of dew comes from vapor from the soil
and from plants, and at sea from vapor from the surface of the sea; that
malaria and some other diseases are largely caused by emanations from
the soil at night bearing organisms into the air, which are then retained
by the damp air in a cold stratum near the ground, and that sand over-
lying damp earth permits air and vapor to rise easily through it. Also,
it became evident that a great deal of soil-air may be drawn into houses
through pervious soil, and that the neighborhood of damp ground may
be thickly infected with organisms contained in the air and vapor which
emerge from the soil. A dry covering of sandy earth is not only little
impediment to the exhalation of vapor, but may serve to protect micro-
organisms from the killing action of dry air and sunshine.!

EXHALATION OF GASES AND PARTICLES FROM THE EARTH.

It is generally assumed that evaporation or distillation of water gives
rise to pure vapor and leaves behind all impurities, but, as a matter of
fact, in many natural conditions this is far from being the case. When
earth becomes heated, moisture forces its way aS a vapor through a

'The author has treated this subject more fully in Trans. Sanit. Ins. for 1892: The
Exhalation of Vapor from the Karth.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 297

porous superficial layer, and carries with it spores or minute organisms
which have multiplied or germinated in the passages through which
the vapor passes. A moderate degree of moisture and rather free aera-
tion of the soil are favorable to the growth of many kinds of microbes.
We know that cotton wool, unless tightly packed, will not stop the
passage of microorganisms; sand and porous soil allow both air and
water to pass without depositing all their particulate contents. The
filter beds of water companies are efficient not by the action of the
sand, but by the retention of particulate bodies in the slimy covering
soon deposited above the sand.

Cold nights following hot days seem to favor very much the exhala-
tion of vapor from the earth.

Wind may very likely have an effect in drawing out the gases from
the soil, but this action is less important to human health, for malarious
germs are dispersed and much less dangerous in windy weather.

Aitken has shown by his experiments on the formation of small, clear
spaces in dusty air that bodies warmer than the air drive away dust
from their surfaces and create the dust-free black envelope which sur-
rounds them. He further showed that an evaporating surface has a
Similar influence, and that dust was driven more than twice as far from
the wet part of an object as from the dry, the object being above the
temperature of the air. The necessary conditions for the repulsive
effect to be strongly shown are that the air must be acquiring heat and
moisture from the surface. Very little heat with moisture gives a
thicker dark plane than double the heat would do. Dust passes
through small openings with surprising ease; ‘any opening which
admits air allows the passage of the finest particles.” The air contains
enormous multitudes of particles so small that the concentrated light
of the sun does not reveal them.! We may fairly infer from these facts
that no inconsiderable part of the fine dust of the air, mineral and
organic, is derived from below the surface of the ground. Some inter-
esting experiments made a few years ago showed that the dust depos-
ited in tightly closed cupboards is brought in by the movements of air
induced by changes of temperature. Similarly, changes of tempera-
ture must draw in and expel fine organic dust from and to air and soil.

The present writer’s observations led him to conclude that a great
quantity of vapor issues from the earth even in dry weather, and when
the surface down to 2 inches or more is dry and dusty that the emission
is very large in the evening, but that the maximum appears to take
place in the early hours of the morning in dry weather; that soon after
sunset in England in summer the temperature of short grass and con-
tiguous air may be 9° to 15° or 20° colder than that of the earth at a
depth of 1 to 15 inches, and that about sunrise the temperature of the
top grass of a pasture field may be 20° to 30° colder than that of the
earth at a depth of 9 to 15 inches and lower, and that the emission of

1Formation of clear spaces in dusty air. By John Aitken, Proc. Roy. Soc., 1877.
298 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

vapor is very much less through mold than through sand or dust.
In hot climates, such as India and Italy, on bare sandy ground and in
valleys it seems probable that the differences in temperature between
soil and surface air may amount at night to between 30° and 40°, and
in nalarious places the flow of impure vapor toward the surface may
be equal to the evaporation from a marsh. These facts have a very
distinct bearing on the generation and prevalence of malaria, diarrhea,
dysentery, and other diseases.

Herr Singer, at Munich, found that the maximum temperature of the
soil (59.3) at 4 feet 3 inches, was reached on August 24, and Fodor’s
results gave a maximum temperature at depths between half a meter
and 1 meter in August. Liebenberg observed that sand is warmed
throughout more rapidly than clay and that the richer a soil in organic
matter the greater its power of absorbing heat. Pettenkofer’s obser-
vations show that a very large amount of air is contained even in firm
soils and that effluvia from decomposing organic matter may pass for
a long distance through very loose soils. Permeable soils are sand-
stones, loose sands, and chalk, and are generally healthy unless they
contain much organic matter or are superposed upon a clay or other
impervious stratum which holds up the water near the surface. Move-
ment of subsoil water of course greatly affects the quantity of earth
vapor given off during certain periods. The dried beds of water .
courses are well adapted for the evolution of malaria, for the super-
ficial layer is usually permeable, the soil contains much organic matter,
the water level is not far from the surface, cold air collects over the
valley and is often moist and stagnant. In the dry regions of Aus-
tralia it is well known that water may be found at a little depth below
the dry channels of rivers.

Vegetable mold near the surface of the earth is very rich in sapro-
phytic bacteria, and Flugge states that infusions made from manured
fields and garden earth contain thousands of bacteria in every drop,
though diluted one hundred times. But the observations of the pres-
ent writer tend to prove that the retention of heat and moisture by
this kind of earth is much greater than that of other soils, and that
much less emission of vapor takes place from it into the air, so that
the organisms which might be expected to invade in excess the air over
cultivated ground may in reality be searcely capable of entering it.

GROUND AIR.

The amount of air in the upper layers of the earth is very consider-
able, but varies greatly with the nature of the soil. Gravel and sand
contain a large quantity of air, which has been estimated at one-third
of its bulk, A bird has been experimentally inclosed in a glass cylinder
with a solid bed of gravel below and above it, and was not affected, the
air which passed through the earth being sufficient to maintain life.
The proportion of carbonic acid, however, in some soils, especially
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 299

where there is much organic débris, much exceeds that in the atmos-
phere, and would prevent the success of such an experiment. Ground
air passes easily through earth, especially through gravel and sand, so
that in the. neighborhood of decomposing organic matter houses
built on such soil are liabie to invasions of poisonous gases. Carbon
monoxide has been known to pass 20 or 30 yards through the earth
into a house, causing severe illness. But the worst results follow the
infamous practice which has been in vogue at the outskirts of large
towns of selling turf and gravel on building sites, allowing the exca-
vations to be filled in with rubbish and refuse, and building dwelling
houses over these sources of disease.. Probably many houses in towns
where fever persistently breaks out owe their unwholesomeness to
this cause. Even where the soil is natural and undisturbed beneath
the foundations, there should always be a layer of impervious material,
such as good Portland cement or rock asphalt, between the house and
the ground; or else a good space through which the outside air may
freely flow. Dwellings well raised above the ground escape many dan-
gers associated with ground air, damp, and drainage. A damp base-
ment is a frequent source of trouble. Hollow skirtings, casings for
pipes, bell wires, etc., frequently give opportunities not only to rats
and mice, but to deadly gases, to make their way into the apartments.

Inquiry is needed to discover the actual quantities of vapor emitted
from different soils and subsoils, at different temperatures of air and
soil, at different barometric pressures, at different times of day and
night, and at different seasons, and at varying levels of subsoil water.
An examination of the different species of microbes or amceba-like
organisms emitted would also be of interest.

EMANATION OF ORGANIC PARTICLES FROM EVAPORATING FLUIDS.

The spread of infective organisms into the air from the surface of
evaporating liquids is a subject worthy of investigation. It has been
generally stated and assumed that an evaporating liquid contaminated
- with impurities leaves behind it all foreign ingredients and passes into
the air as pure vapor. This is very far from being universally true, if
evaporation be understood not as a laboratory process carefully con-
ducted, but as a process subject to the various interferences which
must occur in natural conditions. Evaporation from the sea may give
pure vapor into the air, so long as the sea is tranquil and no bubble
breaks on the surface, but the breaking of waves on the ocean and on
the shore, and the evolution of gases from animal and vegetable life
and organic decay cause evaporation to be accompanied by a consider-
able emission of sodium chloride, and of other substances in solution,
into the air with the bursting of foam and bubbles and the tearing off
of spray by the wind.

Marshes give off various gases, especially in the drying process,
besides vapor. The upward movement of the air from the drying

300 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

ground, the generation of gases in the viscous fluids and in the earth
below them, the bursting of countless small bubbles and films, the
development of electricity in the evaporation of an impure liquid, the
repulsion of small particles by a warm evaporating surface, all help to
carry into the lower air a large quantity of microscopic and ultra-
microscopic dust. In a research made by the present writer into the
diathermancy of thin films of water’ he was much struck by the force
with which the thinnest film snapped; a slightly soapy film of 14 inches
diameter and about one-millionth of an inch in thickness broke with
an audible sound. In the viscous fluid of drying marshes there must
be millions of thin films breaking and throwing their minute spray
into the air which carries off the contained organic particles. More-
over, there must be a continual evolution of very smail bubbles of gas
from the muddy earth through the liquid above it. The scattering
force of small bubbles is surprising. If a glass of effervescing water
be watched, the minute bubbles which rise to the surface of the liquid
will be seen to throw particles of water to a height of several inches in
the air. The smell of drying marshes probably proceeds not only from
gases, but from particulate products. Indeed, many organisms and
vegetable and animal débris have been actually observed microscop-
ically in the air above marshes. Many living germs are probably
beyond tthe range of visibility. The manner in which spores are scat-
tered from the hyphe of molds, etc., may represent a similar process
in the ejection from marshy surfaces of various microorganisms. The
formation of gas bubbles by the Bacillus coli communis may be only
one example out of many in which such action takes place. This
characteristic of coli communis has been used by Klein as a mark of
differentiation between it and the bacillus of typhoid.’

The influences, or some of them, which have been named as helping
to carry small organic particles into the air over marshes may be capa-
ble of launching infective matter from the lungs and air passages of
persons suffering from such diseases as scarlet fever, measles, diphthe-
ria, and consumption. Certainly organic matter and living particles
have been observed in the condensed vapor of breath. Thus walls on
which the breath condenses may become culture grounds for disease
germs which it contains.

PERMEATION OF BUILDING MATERIALS BY AIR AND VAPOR.

The ordinary materials used for floors of dwelling houses are quite
ineffectual to prevent the permeation of gases and microorganisms
from the soil into the air of the dwelling. By experiments made with
several different materials used for flooring, with a view to determine
the rate at which air would pass through them into the Torricellian

vacuum over mercury, it was ascertained that mortar is practically
merely a coarse sieve and permits the rapid and easy passage of gases,
that plaster of paris is also highly permeable, 75 per cent compared
with mortar; roman cement permeable to the extent of 25 per cent,
and portland and hygienic cement to the extent of about 10 per cent.
The rate of diffusion of gases through porous septa is, by Graham’s law,
in the inverse ratio of the square root of their gravity. If the gases
in the earth below the flooring be heavy compared with the air of the
room, upward diffusion through the flooring material must be rather
slow, unless other apertures for the ingress of outside air are insuffi-
cient to supply the draft of fires. When the ground is warm, as in
autumn, and contains certain light gases and vapor, there may be
considerable aspiration from the ground through the floor into the
room. It seems probable that mortar and other porous material would
permit the passage or penetration not only of gases, but of microbes,
but that good cement would not permit the passage or penetration of
microbes to any important extent. Asphalt is still better, and effectu-
ally shuts out both gases and germs. Coal gas has been known to
pass a considerable distance through the earth under frozen ground
and to enter a house through the flooring, and there can be no doubt
that much ground air enters houses in this way, especially in autumn
and winter. A good concrete layer, 4 to 6 inches thick, or asphalt,
under every house would do much to diminish diseases caused by
ground air. The reduction of two courses of bricks, which would be
saved by diminishing the air space between floor and ground, would

-partly balance the additional cost.

MECHANICAL VENTILATION IN SCHOOLS.

From a paper by Professor Carnelley on mechanical ventilation in
schools, Sir Henry Roscoe drew the following conclusions, briefly sum-
marized:

By mechanical ventilation the microorganisms were reduced to one-
tenth, the organic matter to one-seventh, and the carbon dioxide toone-
halt; the temperature was kept higher without draft, and cold drafts
were excluded. In badly ventilated schools microbes increase up to a
certain point with increase of wall space; in mechanically ventilated
schools the microbes decrease with increase of space. Scrubbing or
washing floors had no effect in reducing the emission of microbes into
the air, and it was found that the infection of a school with these organ-
isms takes place very gradually, old schools being much more infested
than new buildings. Similar facts have been observed by Miquel as
regards houses. It is clear that walls and floors and perhaps ceilings
also should be faced with an impervious material, adapted for frequent
washing, and without interstices. As regards mechanical ventilation,
however, it has not yet been proved that proper natural ventilation can
advantageously be superseded.
302 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The Hoors and walls of rooms must often be very suitable culture
grounds for the microbes of disease. Many fungi grow upon damp
plaster, damp wall paper, the interstices of floors, and upon rough sur-
faces and ledges in empty and also in occupied rooms. The Chetonium
chartatum, for example, dévelops on paper and on the binding and
insides of books wherever they are near a damp wall. Paper and size
are well adapted to the settlement and multiplication of molds and
probably also of some pathogenic microbes.

Bricks, mortar, plaster, and paper are all highly porous, and admit
the passage of air continually through them. A common brick can
absorb a pound of water, and plaster is also hygroscopic. We have,
then, this condition in a room, that it is surrounded by damp, porous
material, largely contaminated with organic dust and gases from the
interior condensed within the walls and in the flooring or carpets.
The resemblance to porous, damp, contaminated ground which is a
known source of disease, is sufficiently close to make it highly desir-
able that better provision should be made (1) against damp in walls,
(2) against the penetration of organic vapors and dust into the material
of walls and into the interstices of floors, and (3) for the easy cleaning
of walls with soap and water, and of floors which should be without
interstices, by dry rubbing or with paraffin or otherwise.

AERATION AND SELF-PURIFICATION OF RIVERS.

The oxygen of the air contained in water has been supposed to play
an important part in getting rid of the contamination of organic sub-
stances and in diminishing the number of pathogenic microbes in the
water of streams used for drinking. A large number of experiments
have been made in different countries with the object of determining
the degree of safety with which water may be used for public supply
which has run in the open air for various distances after contamina-
tion with sewage and other impurities.

The investigation is by no means a simple problem, and where the
bacteria are found to have greatly diminished in number in the course
of a few miles, the result is often due to other influences besides aera-
tion, of which gradual dying out of the organisms is one, and sedimen-
tation commonly the most efficient. Frank’s experiments on the River
Spree, at Berlin, showed that, though in flowing through the city, the
river contained hundreds of thousands of bacteria in the cubic centi-
meter, the water some miles lower contained only 3,000 to 8,000, about
the same number as in its upper course. In the Isar, below Munich,
the number fell from 15,251 to 2,378 in the course of 22 miles. In the
Thames and the Ure, Frankland did not find any considerable diminu-
tion. The Massachusetts State Board of Health found in the course of
23 miles a diminution of free ammonia from 1,728 to 1,299, of albumi-
noid ammonia from 826 to 382, of total nitrogen from 3,000 to 2,156, and
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 3()3

an increase of nitric acid from 218 to 457. Oxidation to an important
degree is shown in this case, but the result is not altogether favorable
to the efficiency of aeration. In observations made on the River Lim-
mat before and after passing through Zurich the following were the
results:

Miquel found in the Seine above Paris a rate of 4,800,000 microbes
in the liter; below Paris, 12,800,000; in sewer water, 80,000,000.

Instances of outbreaks of typhoid through the use of river water
contaminated miles above the intake are notrare. Gloucester suffered
by the poisoning of the river by Kidderminster, 20 miles higher up.
A single case of typhoid produced the disease in a Scottish town by
the drawing back up the course of the river, owing to the obstruction
of a weir, of the sewage which had entered below. At Providence,

_R.1., an epidemic was caused by the very slight pollution of a large.

and rather tapid stream 34 miles above the intake. When Lowell,
Mass., has had a fever outbreak, Lawrence, lower down, has had a
similar attack a little later. The Merrimac River has given several
instructive examples of typhoid following pollution, and the Schuylkill,
which is contaminated many miles above the intake of Philadelphia,
appears to be the chief cause of the prevalence of the disease in that
city.

Experiments on the artificial aeration of water by the Massachusetts
Board of Health, and on natural aeration below Niagara Falls by Pro-
fessor Leeds, show that little or no diminution of organic particles, and
no chemical purification, is brought about.

Dr. Perey Frankland has found that various disease-causing bacilli
present no uniformity in their behavior in potable water. Many pre-
serve their vitality for a considerable time—days and weeks—and some,
which form spores, for an indefinite time. Gaffkey’s typhoid bacillus
preserves its vitality even in distilled water for about fourteen days.

Altogether, aeration can not be trusted as effectual in rendering pol-
luted water fit for drinking, and the diminution of organisms which to
some extent does take place must be attributed to other causes.

304 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

ACTION OF BACTERIA AND OF THE AIR IN CONNECTION WITH
DECOMPOSITION AND PLANT GROWTH.

Bacteria, or microbes in general, of an immense number of different
kinds are almost ubiquitous on the whole surface of the earth and on
all exposed solids. The favorite habitat of most kinds is the moist
surface of some substance of organic origin undergoing decomposition.
But some sorts appear to flourish on almost any kind of solid exposed
to the air. Thus panes of glass, rocks, metals, tiles, and sand will
furnish a crop, the richer, no doubt, for any slight deposit from organic
liquids or gases. The chief work, and a very vast one, of microorgan-
isms is the transformation of dead organic matter into “inorganic”
substances. All the dead vegetable and animal substance lying
exposed or where air has access is being transformed into mineral
matter by this agency. Decomposition generaily consists of oxidation
by a class of microbes which take their oxygen from the air, and then
the transformation and use of the oxygenized products which sink
deeper into the earth by another class of microbes, the anaerobic,
which not only themselves detach oxygen from its new compounds,
but allow of its being united with products which are formed by
chemical changes as a result of their activity. The whole process
converts the nitrogenous elements into ammonia, nitrous and nitric
acids, carbonic acid and water, and produces also phosphoric acid. It
takes place most readily in porous, somewhat moist earth and at a
high temperature. It is a necessary preparation of the soil for the
life of plants. The active bacteria of this decomposition, nitrification,
or mineralization do not extend to any great depth, generally not so
deep as 12 feet, below which the ground is sterile. The rapid oxida-
tion going on near the surface leaves little free oxygen for the use of
bacteria even at the depth of a few feet. The decomposition effected
chiefly by the aerobic bacteria in the upper layers enables plants to
draw nutriment from the new products, and thus the presence of air
and bacteria in the mold are necessary conditions for the growth of
vegetation. These newly discovered facts must have a very important
bearing upon agriculture. ‘The relation of air supply, soil, tempera-
ture, and moisture to the microbie life in the earth, and consequently
to growing crops, will become a fruitful subject of research to chemists,
bacteriologists, and scientific farmers. ©

Most of the diseases of piants are dependent to a very great extent
on conditions of weather, and many are transported by the air to new
situations where they spread as from a center. Thus they differ from
the spreading diseases of animals, which are not, on the whole, mainly
affected by the character of a season, and are not carried so far through
the atmosphere. The number of plant diseases of an infectious kind,
depending on fungi or microbes, is very great. The vine alone is
attacked by more than a hundred species. Some species live in alter-
nate generations on different plants; thus the rust of wheat requires
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 305

the barberry plant for one of its stages of development. The spores
of mildews and microscopic fungi are generally ejected in great num-
bers and with some force into the air, and are carried from plant to
plant, or field to field, by the air, as, for instance, the potato disease,
Peronospora infestans, aud the mildew of the coffee plant. Heat and
moisture, dew and gentle rain, are favorable to the growth and spread
of most diseases of plants. The fungus of dry rot grows in damp,
unventilated places on badly seasoned wood, and when about to
produce spores, seeks the light; its sporangia dry up and discharge
innumerable spores. The common ferment of grape juice, the Saccha-
romyces ellipsoideus, grows on the surface of the grape, and when it
gains access to the fermenting vats develops enormously by budding
and division; when its development is hindered, as by drying up of the
liquid, spores are formed, which are capable of resisting dryness, high
temperature, and various conditions without losing their power of ger-
mination. They may thus be carried alive to a new habitat. This
action is characteristic of a great number of ferments, of minute fungi,
and of microbes generally, and explains the transmission of many dis-
eases both of plants and animals. The globular spore case of mold,
such as appears on fruit, jam, bread, etc., scatters its spores in all diree-
tions, each spore being about one three-thousandth of an inch in diam-
eter. These float in the air in great numbers. The spores of oidium,
again, a vine disease, escape into the air as fine dust, and spread with
extreme facility. The sudden appearance of potato disease in a field
is due to the field having been sprinkled with the spores of the perono-
spora in dry weather, and to the quick development of the zoospores
when favored by damp, either rain or dew. The smut of corn produces
extremely light spores, about one five-thousandth of an inch in diame-
ter; these float in the air, and have so strong a resistent power that
they will germinate in water after having been kept for years in a dry
place. The peziza of the lily disease fires off ascospores which are
carried by the wind to rich soil where they germinate, produce hyphe,
bore into the tissues of the plant, and shed millions of spores around.
A disease of the pine is associated also with the groundsel, on which
the fungus spends a portion of its existence. The hop mildew is borne
by the wind, and has been found to be to some extent averted from
threatened fields by thick woods or large hedge rows.

A great deal of disease in plants and forests is produced through
wounds, to which the air conveys fungi which accelerate decay. The
decomposed organic matter becomes a suitable soil for the development
of fungi, which are not parasitic on living parts, and spores from these
are very abundant. The hyphe of the disease fungus follow up the
poisonous action of the juices of the mold fungus and spread into the
contiguous wood. True wound parasites also alight on the damp sur-
face of a cut or broken branch and extend their mycelium into the
living tissues, gradually bringing about the death of the tree.

306 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

These and very many other spreading diseases in plants can only
with difficulty be controlled when their spores are given off in large
numbers, and when the vegetation on which they alight is damp or in
a vulnerable condition. Various applications have been tried to save
plants, such as potatoes and vines, from attack, and though partially
successful, they involve much trouble. The best security is the preven-
tion of the emission of large numbers of the disease spores into the air
from decaying or affected plants, and to cultivate only those varieties
of plants which are most immune from infection. The extent to which
plant diseases are transmissible through the air has never been ascer-
tained. It seems probable that, with the exception of wide-spread dis-
ease in exceptional seasons, the diffusive action of the wind would, in
general, so disperse the germs as to render them harmless to healthy
plants not too near together. If this be so, then the careful destruc-
tion of centers of infection as early as possible would very greatly
reduce the prevalence and damage of the diseases of plants. The
preservation of fruits, such as apples, is only successful where care is
taken that they are not too near together, and that those attacked are
speedily removed. But in damp, warm places the spread is too rapid
for such measures to be effectual. Dry, sterilized air might be found
a valuable means of preserving fruits, vegetables, and provisions gen-
erally.

INFLUENCE OF WEATHER ON INSECT PESTS.

The effect of a particular kind of season on insect pests is worthy of
more attention than it has hitherto received. The importance of attack-
ing in time and as far as possible destroying the insect life which,
if neglected, inflicts incalculable damage on crops and gardens, has
scarcely been realized, owing to the blight being generally regarded as
a necessary evil, not to be foreseen or prevented. The development of
insect pests is generally favored by dry weather. Stunting of the
growth, and overmaturation of the sap of plants induce early changes
jn the maturing and structure of aphides; the insects multiply without
the interference of the ordinary destructive influences of bad weather,
and delicate maggots, etc., which are generally drowned in very large
numbers by storms of rain, emerge unharmed. At the same time it
may happen that corn and other crops may be enabled by earlier hard-
ening of the case, stalks, ete., to protect themselves against attacks
which in wet years would bring serious damage. In some countries,
and in respect to some crops, it is customary to arrange the date of
maturity with special regard to the protective power of the plant and
the period of expected attacks from insects. The whole subject is at
present too little under scientific observation, and great benefit might
result if the following branches of inquiry were systematically investi-
gated: (1) The influence of different kinds of weather in developing
insect pests; (2) the time of appearance of crop insects in different sea-
sons in relation to the weather, and the time at which crops are most
4 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 307

open to attack in different seasons, according to the weather; (3) the
treatment of the ground in drought with a view to destroy threatening
pests in their early stages, and, in general, the conduct of agricultural
operations with regard to the probable development of particular pests
resulting from particular kinds of weather; (4) the issue of forecasts
of insect prevalence, derived from a careful study of the habits of
various species of insect pests, and of the weather of present and
previous seasons.

ACTION OF PLANTS ON THE AIR.

Plants in general take up free oxygen from the air and during the
night exhale a small quantity of carbon dioxide. They also give a
large quantity of oxygen to the air by the breaking up of carbon
dioxide into carbon and oxygen through chlorophyll. The oxygen is
set free, while the carbon is retained. Experiments have been made on
various plants with the object of ascertaining the amount of oxygen
which they absorbed at different temperatures. The following are
some of the results:

Five seedlings of Tropwolum majus absorbed 1.04 cubie centimeters
carbon dioxide of oxygen per hour at 35° C.

Four seedlings of wheat absorbed 0.088 cubic centimeter of oxygen
per hour at 15.4° C.

Each plant has its temperature of maximum absorption. Wheat
evolved 37.6 milligrams of carbon dioxide per hour at 40°C. The maxi-
mum amount of carbon dioxide evolved at the temperatures does not
correspond with the maximum of oxygen absorbed. Variations in the
composition of the atmosphere do not interfere with the respiration of
plants, and the relations of the amounts of these gases absorbed and
evolved, unless those variations are extreme, and not occurring in
natural conditions.

Plants have been placed under glass shades, with their roots immersed
in water containing free carbonic acid and certain salts, and with their
upper parts exposed to a north light in carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and
nitrogen. In the carbon dioxide they did not thrive. Convolvulus
throve very well in nitrogen, mixed with a third part of carbon diox-
ide, and after three weeks these gases were found to be mixed with so
much oxygen as to approach the proportions in the atmosphere. The
power of plants to produce in a closed space an atmosphere resembling
that of the globe might well form the subject of research on a great
scale.

THE INFLUENCE OF FORESTS ON CLIMATES.

The influence of forests on climate is now much better ascertained
than it was thirty years ago, at any rate with regard to temperate
regions. But the importance of preserving trees, woods, and forests
is far from being recognized as it ought to be by Governments and by
the people generally.

.

308 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The annual average temperature within forests is slightly lower than
in the open. The difference is greatest in summer, least in winter.
The day temperature is less, the night temperature more, than in the
open. In summer, a beech forest is more effective for cooling than fir
or spruce. ‘The soil temperature is lower in forests, especially in sum-
mer, when the difference may amount to 14° F. The mean annual
relative humidity is from 34 to 10 per cent greater than in the open.
Nearly one-fourth of the rainfall is intercepted by the trees and evapo-
rated or slowly conducted to the ground. Forests somewhat increase
rainfall, especially on high ground. The humus formed from fallen
leaves diminishes the evaporation from the soil by more than one-half.
The whole effect of forests is to retain and more equably distribute the
moisture throughout the year, so that streams flowing from them are
not torrential, and not subject to heavy floods, but are kept well and
moderately supplied. By the prevention of excessive heating of the
soil by the sun, and by the diminution of range of daily temperature
and of sudden changes, malarious fevers are reduced. The mitigation of
strong winds, of hot sunshine, of blizzards, and intense frosts is favor-
able to health, and generally the shelter and amenity of well-distributed
woods, copses, and forest trees are of great hygienic and agricultural
importance.

CERTAIN PHYSICAL QUALITIES OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

It is a law of gases that the volume of a given mass is inversely as
the pressure; otherwise stated, the density at a constant temperature
is proportional to the pressure. The resistance to compression, then,
is proportional to the pressure. Yet the law is not exactly true at
various pressures and temperatures. Air follows it very closely. Air
and nitrogen are, for pressures up to 20 atmospheres at least, more
compressed than if this law were exactly true. Amagat, by a fine
series of experiments with a tube of mercury extending about 1,000 feet
into a deep coal pit, found that air is slightly more compressed up to a
pressure of about 80 atmospheres, and then begins to be somewhat less
compressed. At about 400 atmospheres the deviation on the side of
less compression is nearly one-fifth of the volume, the value pv, or the
pressure multiplied into volume, being 1.1897 compared with the origi-
nalunit. For pressure diminished below that of the normal it appears,
so far as experiment has hitherto gone, that the value pv is practically
constant down to at least one eight-hundredth of an atmosphere. No
determination has been fully verified for pressures below one-thousandth
of an atmosphere. The air at a height of 90 miles is still sufficiently
dense to set meteors on fire by friction, but can not exert more than one ©
three-thousandth of the ordinary pressure, unless, indeed, the atmos-
phere be surrounded by some lighter gas. Both air and meteor are at
a temperature below —180° C. before contact takes place. The experi-
imental difficulties of ascertaining the values at these low pressures are
exceedingly great,
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 309

PROPAGATION OF SOUND IN AIR.

The rate of propagation of sound in air is believed, on theoretical
grounds, to increase in some slight proportion with the intensity of the
sound. The mean velocity of the explosion sounds and air waves of
Krakatoa, in the eruption of 1883, was about 700 miles an hour, or less
by about 23 miles than the velocity calculated for sound in air at 0° F.;
it corresponded with the theoretic velocity at between —20° and —30° F,
How was the rate affected by the temperature of the upper air, and what
mean value of temperature can be assumed in that total propagation?
The rate of movement diminished in the second and third circuits of
this great air wave round the globe; the rate for the first passage in
one direction was 10.23 per hour; for the last, 9.77 per hour; in the
other direction, 10.47 and 10.27, respectively; so that a diminution of
rate with diminishing intensity does seem to have occurred. The high
temperature of the tropics does not appear to have raised the rate, as
might be expected, above the rate in the temperate zones. Nor did the
air wave travel faster, so far as can be deduced, than ordinary sound,
although, considered as a very low note, it might theoreticaliy be
expected to do so. The velocity of the wave in the tropics toward the
east was retarded; in the extratropics toward the west was retarded
toward the east accelerated; from the data available in the report of
the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society of London it appears
that in the tropics there was an excess of general movement of air from
east to west of about 14 miles an hour, and in the extratropics an
excess of 14 miles from west to east. Thus the propagation of the air
waves throws some light on the mean air movement within and without
the tropics. The effect of cold in the regions both of the South and
North Poles was not what might have been expected; there was no
discoverable retardation by the low temperature. All these results
have yet to be interpreted, but may perhaps themselves contribute
toward a better knowledge of the laws of the transmission of sound
and great waves in air.

The sounds of Krakatoa, which were audible over an area exceeding
twice that of Europe, were not very loud in some places in the imme-
diate neighborhood of the voleano. It seems as if the mass of falling
ashes, pumice, mud, etc., and the great variations of temperature and
humidity in the midst of the hot materials must have exerted a pow-
erful dulling effect. Strive or Jamine of alternate hot and cold air
seem to be very capable of diverting and reflecting sound waves.

With regard to the conveyance of ordinary sounds in air in various
kinds of weather, Professor Tyndall and others have arrived at certain
results of much scientific interest and practical importance. The
condition of the air varies very greatly with regard to transmission of
sound, and often without any apparent cause. Fog, rain, hail, and
snow do not sensibly diminish sound. The most powerful cause of
310 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

stoppage is nonhomogeneity of atmosphere, or aerial reflection by a
number of currents, columns, or lamine of different density. On one
day guns and sirens were heard at 103 miles; two days later were
inaudible at 3 miles. Water in the state of vapor mixed with air,
in nonhomogeneous parcels, acts powerfully in wasting sounds. Not
only clouds, but layers of transparent air, may produce echoes both
intense and long. The power of the particles of cloud to produce
aubible echoes has been doubted by Tyndall; but we may observe that
a grove of trees in leaf, even of larches and pines, has a very strong
effect in reflecting sound and in heightening its piteh. Let any passen-
ger by railway note the marked rise of pitch as the train passes
between woods of beech or oak. The sound resembles that of a small
cascade, or of wind among rustling leaves. .

The blasts of the fog siren have hitherto been found to be most
effectual of all sounds tried for prolongation, penctration, and small
cost. Its audibility is good ata range of 2 miles under all conditions.
Experiments are still needed in order to attain a higher efficiency in
sound propagation for waritime and other purposes, and to ascertain
the effect of air in various conditions. The transmission and collection
of sound through a few miles by means of suitable exciters, polished
funnels, and acoustic mirrors of large size has not been developed as it
might be.

AURORA BOREALIS AND AUSTRALIS.

The aurora borealis or australis is very far from being understood.
The height of the luminous arch has been variously estimated and
calculated as between 33 and 281 miles, and no doubt greatly varies
in different latitudes and in different displays. The greatest height
estimated was 500 miles. But in high latitudes the aurora has been
observed to emerge from the tops of hills and even as a rule from the
ocean, but not from ice floes. Loomis has given much information
concerning the distribution of the aurora over the globe in the Smith-
Sonian Report for 1865. Near latitude 40 in the United States only
10 aurore, on an average, are seen annually. Near latitude 42, about
20; near 45, about 40; and near 50, about 80 are seen. Between lati-
tude 50 and 62 aurore are seen almost every night, as often to the
south as to the north. Farther north they are seldom seen except in
the south, and from this point northward they diminish in brilliancy
and frequency. Near latitude 78 the number is reduced to 10 annu-
ally. In the meridian of St. Petersburg the region of 80 auroras is
found between 66° and 75°. The region of greatest auroral action is a
zone of oval form encircling the North Pole. This zone resembles
a line everywhere perpendicular to a magnetic meridian. In Hurope
aurore are much rarer than in North America. Some auroral Gis-
plays, such as the remarkable one of March 30, 1894, are visible both
in Europe and America. It seems that an exhibition around one mag-
netic pole is often simultaneous with a similar exhibition around the
other magnetic pole of the earth.
- ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 31]

The aurora appears to be the result of the agitation and vibration of
particles of air under the influence of the passage of an electric current,
diverging from the magnetic polar regions. The current passes where
the resisting power is least, that is, in highly rarefied air, dense air
and a vacuum both offering too much resistance to be used for the
course of the current. It strongly affects telegraph wires and corre-
sponds with earth currents of uncommon intensity. It has been sup-
posed by Sabine and others to be connected with disturbances in the
sun, which, again, depend on the position of the planets. Sun spots
and aurore were considered to be at a maximum in periods of eleven
years; aurore and earth currents to be due to small but rapid changes
in the earth’s magnetism; the upper conducting strata of the air to
behave like a secondary coil, and the sun to act like a primary current
which produces magnetic changes in the core of a Ruhmkorff machine.
There seems to be no doubt of a connection between the periods of sun
spots, of the variation of the magnetic needle, and of aurore.

Some observers have noted a connection between these lights and
great cyclonic storms, but they are certainly not always followed by
bad weather, and in North America have been associated with clear
skies. Moreover, the height at which they traverse the air renders it
unlikely that they should be either the cause or effect of disturbances
in the lower air.

Occasionally the elevation of moisture and cirrus cloud to a great
height may afford a readier than ordinary means of transit to electrie
currents. Generally, however, cirrus cloud does not extend to one-
tenth of the calculated height of the aurora, and can hardly aid in
forming a passage for the current. That some visible effect of induc-
tion may be produced on cirrus and high cirro-cumulous, which are
themselves electrified, is not improbable. The present writer was once
greatly struck by a very extraordinary arrangement of high cirrus and
cirro-cumulus clouds in closely packed, detached, reticulated, and nearly
rectangular compartments, covering the whole area of the sky overhead,
from 9 to 9.50 a. m. on November 17, 1882, in London, and learned after-
wards that at about 10 a. m.a great magnetic storm had occurred over
the country. The radiant point was about north. The appearance
of the clouds was represented on paper at the time, and the diagrams
were afterwards submitted to members of the Royal Meteorological
Society.

The simultaneous appearance of an aurora in northern Europe and
in America rather discounts the supposed connection between this phe-
nomenon and the weather, for changes very rarely take place about the
Same time and in connection with each other over this wide area.
March and October, the months of maximum display, happen to be
months which are often windy in England. The cause of the aurora
is rather to be sought in changes which come within the scope of astro-
nomical inquiry. The spectroscope has not given much information
regarding the nature of the substances which emit the Heht. The>
312 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

appearance of the aurora greatly resembles the passage of voltaic elec-
tricity through Geissler’s exhausted tubes.

Observation is much needed in relation to these matters. The aurora,
from a meteorological point of view, is interesting as a proof of the
great height to which the atmosphere extends. Estimates of the height
of the phenomenon exceeding 100 miles have, however, not been fully
verified.

METEORS AND AEROLITES.

Meteors, or shooting stars, are within the domain common to both
astronomy and meteorology. The moment they enter the atmosphere
they are objects of special interest to the meteorologist. It is known
that they traverse the air, where it is dense enough to raise them to a
white heat, at very great velocities.

Many calculations have been made of the height of particular meteors
which have been observed over a wide stretch of country. The state-
ment by one astronomer many years ago as to the enormous numbers!
which enter the atmosphere daily has been repeated so often, without
confirmation by the actual observation of others, that it would be well
to obtain independent values for particular areas on which to base
fresh estimates. The majority of shooting stars are probably telescopic
objects and of very small dimensions, perhaps not larger than pebbles.
Particles weighing only a few grains become visible to the naked eye
if they enter the air at a velocity of 40 miles a second. Many nights
pass in which, with a clear sky, only a very few shooting stars cross the
field of view.

It has been suggested by a distinguished astronomer that meteors or
aerolites are the products of terrestrial or lunar volcanoes, which have
been shot out to so great a height that they escaped from the retaining
power of the earth’s gravitation. In remote ages the density of the
air and the amount of vapor, and consequently the friction, must have
been greater than at present; but meteorology offers no objection to
the theory, and the problem of their terrestrial or extraterrestrial
origin is rather one for geology to assist in elucidating.

ATMOSPHERIC TIDES.

There can be no doubt that large tidal effects are produced in the
atmosphere by the sun and moon, but they are not easily detected, for
the barometer only registers the weight of the air and not the height,
and the weight of a column of certain height is diminished under the
crest of a tidal wave. Practically, however, solar and lunar grayita-
tion and their atmospheric tides have no important influence on weather.
Provisionally, the barometric effect of the lunar tide has been calculated
from observation to be from 0.003 to 0.004 inch. The interest of
the question lies rather in its astronomical bearing. The range or

1 Four hundred million has been given by one computation.

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 513

differences of thickness of the stratum of air through which the heav-
enly bodies are viewed must be considerably greater at spring tides
than at the opposite phases.

THE ZODIACAL LIGHT.

The zodiacal light still remains very much a mystery. It may bea
reflection, by a multitude of exceedingly small and light solid particles
driven off from the sun, of the solar beams, and, indeed, it seems highly
probable that the development of electricity in the chromosphere may
be sufficient to propel small particles with much greater force away
from the sun than gravitation can exercise in restraining them. When
the surface is large compared with the mass, as in the smallest particles
larger than molecules, the electric forces need not be disproportionately
great to exceed by many times the force of gravitation even of the sun.
If the interplanetary spaces be filled with reflecting and nonreflecting
motes derived from sun, and moving at a speed much exceeding that of
aerolites, we must suppose that our atmosphere is always receiving within
its borders multitudes of these particles which are instantly consumed
by friction. Moreover, if such emission proceeds continually from the
sun, a Similar process takes place from the more distant stars, and the
whole of recognized space is traversed by small elementary particles
traveling at an enormous speed. The phenomena of the tails of comets
tend to corroborate this opinion. In fact, considering the immense num-
ber of comets in space, it seems impossible that such small particles
can be absent. Compared with their extension, their united mass may
be very small indeed within the orbits of the planets. Like meteor
Swarms, they do not apparently affect the motion of comets or of plan-
ets. None the less, the part they fill in the economy of the universe
may be considerable.

HEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

Meteors which have been calculated to pass with ignition through
air at a height sometimes as great as 300 miles; aurorz, of which the
height has been estimated by careful observation sometimes to exceed
281 miles; and the duration of twilight, with polarizing effects of the
sky, giving a height of 198 to 212 miles, agree in showing a much greater
-altitude for the extension of our atmosphere than was formerly supposed.
First 5 and then 45 miles was generally stated as the outside limit. And
we have to remember that at this great altitude of about 300 miles the
atmosphere is dense enough to produce very palpable effects. It would
be a bold proposition to assign a limit to the atmosphere within 1,000
niles.

ATMOSPHERIC DUST AND THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT.

Atmospheric dust, or particles large enough to arrest the movement
of light waves, exercise a very important function in the illumination
314 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

of the air and sky, which would otherwise be dark except in the direc-
tion of the sun, moon, and stars. The beauty of land and sea and of
atmospheric effects would be vastly reduced if the reflecting particles
were absent, and houses not facing the direct sunshine would be incon-
veniently dark. Ozone and oxygen molecules, in some state probably
of aggregation, are concerned in the reflection of blue rays, so that an
elimination of the coarser dust would not entirely darken the atmos-
phere. A complete removal of reflected rays would slightly diminish
the terrestrial warmth derived from the incidence of light rays from
the general atmosphere, and slightly increase that derived from the
direct rays of the sun. Invisible, or barely visible, vapor particles are
probably still more efficacious in producing similar effects.

SUNLIGHT AND THE EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE—ABSORPTION AND
REFLECTION.

The light of the sun which reaches the earth has passed through two
atmospheres, one of the sun and one of the earth, and each of these
atmospheres robs the light emitted from the sun’s body of some of its
brilliancy and an unequal proportion of color, so that the original color
of the sun is modified by the successive subtractions from parts of the
spectrum before it reaches our eyes. The sun’s atmosphere arrests
more blue rays than red, and the light from the middle of the sun’s
disk is more blue than that which reaches us from the limbs, for it has
to traverse less of the solar atmosphere. Prof. S. P. Langley has
shown that the effect of the invisible solar atmosphere is so important
that its diminution by a third part would cause the temperature of the
British Isles to rise above that of the torrid zone. The earth’s atmos-
phere, also, has the effect of scattering many rays, and principally
those waves which form the most refrangible end of the visible spec-
trum and gives the impression of blue. By the use of an exceedingly
delicate instrument, at a height of 15,000 feet, Professor Langley was
able to show that at this elevation, where nearly one-half of the absorb-
ing mass of the air was got rid of, the ray 60, near D, had grown in
brightness in the proportion 2 to 3, that the blue end of the spectrum
had grown in intensity out of all proportion to the rest, and that a very
great length of invisible spectrum became recognizable beyond the
visible rays below the red. The amount of energy in this invisible
extension is much less than that of the much shorter visible end. The
conclusions to which Professor Langley arrived as the result of his
investigations on the solar light was that the sun is blue, that the solar
heat is greater than was supposed, and that the total loss by absorption
in the atmosphere is nearly double what had been estimated. The sun
he calculates to be competent to melt a shell of ice 60 yards thick over
the whole earth annually, or to exert 1 horsepower for each square
yard of the normally exposed surface. The existence of life on the
planet, and especially of the human race, must clearly be dependent
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 315

on the capacity of the atmosphere for modifying and absorbing the
radiant energy of the sun.

An investigation of the principal elements concerned in arresting
and reflecting the sun’s rays would yield results of much interest. The
absorptive and reflecting capacity of vapor in the free air has not been
determined. The power of any constituents of the air, e. g., ozone and
ammonia, apart from dust particles, to scatter the rays of light, is not
known. ‘The reasons of the variations in radiation from the surface of
the earth on different days when the weather continues clear and appar-
ently unaltered have not been fully made out. Much information might
be gained by regular observation at two stations, one on the summit of
a high mountain and one on the plain below, of the radiation value by
day and night, and by comparing the results with the weather, humidity,
and any meteorological phenomena which might be connected with
them. Thus, for instance, a comparison of the radiation from the sta-
tions on two clear days, one dry and the other humid, would give some
idea of the effect of invisible vapor in arresting radiation. If true
vapor in a dry state is found in the laboratory not to stop heat rays,
the inference would have to be made that vapor in the air often exists
in a different but still invisible condition.

WINDS AND TEMPERATURE AT GREAT HEIGHTS.

Balloon observations have shown that a variety of currents are often
met with in ascending from the earth to 10,000 or 20,000 feet, and also
remarkable changes of temperature, not always in the direction of cold.
On September 15, 1805, the air near the earth was 82°, and at 23,000
teet was 15°. On July 27, 1850, after passing through a cloud fully
15,000 feet thick, 17.1° was noted at 19,685 feet, and —36.2° at 23,000
feet. On July 17, 1862, at 10,000 feet, 26°; at 15,000 feet, 31°; at 19,000
feet, 42°; then a little below this height only 16°. Thus it seems that
the air may be not seldom divided into adjacent masses differing by
26° or more. On March 21, 1863, up to 10,300 feet the wind was east,
between 10,300 and 15,400 feet, west; about 15,000 feet, northeast;
higher still, southwest, and from 20,600 to 23,000 feet, west. The
changes of humidity are also sudden and great. Rain falls sometimes
4,000 feet above falling snow, at 15,000 feet. At 37,000 feet the dryness
of the air indicated an “almost entire absence of vapor,” yet cirri
floated high above this altitude. On July 27, 1850, the balloon passed
through about 7,000 feet of ice-cold water particles, and ice needles
formed only at —10°. On March 21, 1893, a small balloon with regis-
tering apparatus was sent up to a height much greater than any of
which there was previous record, and a temperature of —51° C. was
recorded at about 45,500 feet; the air at Vaugirard at the time being
at 17° C. This very promising experiment of sending recording bal-
loons to great altitudes seems likely to lead to valuable information on
the condition of the air up to 50,000 or 60,000 feet in various kinds of
weather.

RANGE OF TEMPERATURE AT GREAT HEIGHTS.

Observations by mountaineers on the Andes and in the Himalayas
have shown that the difference between night and day temperatures, at
heights about 20,000 feet and over, is extraordinarily great, and that
changes are very sudden. The interposition of a cloud of ashes from
a voleano produced on Chimborazo a fall from 50° to 15° F. in two
hours. The effect of the shadows of clouds on the air and clouds below
must be very considerable.

ELECTRICITY AT HIGH ALTITUDES.

Electricity is highly developed in the upper regions. The obserya-
tions carried on for some years at Pikes Peak, Colo., 14,152 feet above
the sea, and about 8,000 feet above the plain, proved that snow and hail
are always accompanied by electric: manifestations. That St. Elmo’s
fire, or the brush discharge, occurs when the air is damp with rain,
snow, or hail, and that the sparks are often almost continuous in storms
of snow and hail, the flakes and hailstones being highly electrified.

The appearance of cirrus suggests the shaping of this cloud by elee-
trical forces, and there can be no doubt that the air above 5 or 6 miles
is strongly charged with electricity, which has not yet been experimen-
tally accounted for. The origin is generally attributed to evaporation,
by which the evaporated water and the water surface take electricities
of different signs, and there is some, but not sufficient, experimental
ground for the hypothesis. Gases consist of a vast number of mole-
cules which may be considered as separated from each other, and these
can receive an electric charge in such a manner as to make the whole
mass of a gas so charged electric. The minute particles of water float-
ing in the air, being better conductors, become more highly charged and
present comparatively smaller surfaces with a denser charge continu-
ally as they grow in size. In fine weather the air is usually positive,
in broken weather more often negative. The upper air is considered
to be positive and the earth’s surface is negative. Electricity increases
very rapidly with height; thus Sir W. Thomson found the potential to
increase from 23 to 46 volts for arise of 1 foot. Clouds in showery
weather are strongly electrified and the change of sign is often rapid.
In showers and thunderstorms streams of sparks run off from the end
of an elevated collecting wire, and sometimes from telegraph wires.
Valuable information for the forecast of storms and weather generally
might be obtained from observation of the electric character and
potential of clouds, obtained through instruments near the surface of
the earth.

ATMOSPHERIC CURRENTS ABOVE 40,000 FEET.

The observations of extraneous matter in the upper atmosphere after
the eruption of Krakatoa, showed that a current from east to west, of
hurricane force (80 miles an hour), prevailed in August and September
aa

ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 317

over the equatorial region, and that a slower movement of the upper
air from southwest and west prevailed in autumn over the northern
temperate zone. Investigation of the currents of the atmosphere at
heights exceeding 40,000 feet is likely to lead to valuable results.
Exploring balloons might even show the ultimate possibility of rapid
communications between distant places by means of steady upper
currents.

Parr LV.—SUBJECTS FOR RESEARCH.

The following subjects for research seem likely to yield valuable
results in connection with the welfare of man. The bearing of some
of the points suggested may be slight or remote, but are not on that
account altogether negligible:

The topographical features of different countries in relation to eli-
mate and weather, and a comparison of the effect on weather and
climate of similar physiographical features and circumstances in dif-
ferent zones and climatic areas.

The influences of forests and cultivation on weather, on humidity, on
atmospheric electricity, rainfall, thunderstorms, soil moisture, and the
flow of rivers.

The influence of the radiation from different soils and surfaces on
climate, as, for instance, of grass compared with fallow, and of sand
compared with rock and clay.

The heat received by the soil from the sun in different climates and
at different altitudes.

The intensity of solar radiation at different latitudes and altitudes.

The intensity of terrestrial radiation into space by day and night at
different altitudes, and the temperature of small objects suspended
at high altitudes in sunshine and at night. This might be obtained
by exploring balloons.

The temperatures of clouds of different thickness and different char-
acter in their upper, lower, and central parts, and at a little distance
outside them.

The causes of the down rush and increase of horizontal movement of
the air often observed before heavy showers and hailstorms.

The dynamical and thermal consequences of the rising and falling of
masses of air.

The action of air in motion, or wind, on calm or stagnant air near
their bounding surfaces; the manner in which by friction and by impact
masses of air influence other masses whether at rest or in motion, and
the effects of the collision of meeting masses of different specific gravity
and humidity.

The influence of clouds of various thicknesses and heights on the
radiation from the earth’s surtace.

The nature of the vapor or invisible water screen which often arrests
radiation ou clear nights.
318 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

The capacity of vapor and water of existing in various states in the
air, and the reasons for the great differences of state observed, whether
as dry or wet fog, mist, haze of several sorts, clouds of many sorts,
ice particles and snow erystals of very many different forms, snow flakes
of various shapes and sizes, hailstones of various shapes, construction,
and sizes, and soft hail, or graupel.

The temperature of fogs and of their bounding edges.

The climatic and geological effects-of coverings of ice and snow.

The relation of the temperature of oceans, seas, and lakes to the
climate of the neighboring parts.

The variations and ranges of temperature with height in different
latitudes and climates.

The extension of soundings of the high atmosphere with thermome-
ters and other instruments by small balloons on the plan recently suc-
cessful in Paris or at Vaugirard.

The observation by means also of small balloons and recording instru-
ments of temperatures at various heights above the ground in different .
kinds of weather, say at 2,000, 4,009, 6,000, 8,000, 10,000, 12,000, 14,000,
16,000, 18,000, 20,000, 24,000, and 28,000 feet. Such observations may
give very valuable information for the purposes of forecasting, for there
is reason to believe that certain kinds of stormy weather are charac-
terized by very great differences between adjacent strata, especially
in cold weather and at high altitudes, and that these differences are
diagnostic symptoms in many cases. In fine, settled weather the
changes are probably much more regular with increase of height.

The absorption, in air, of radiant heat of low refrangibility in differ-
ent kinds of weather both along horizontal planes and vertically, and
obliquely; and the relation of absorption to actual and following
weather. The amount of absorption, which might easily be measured
by a thermopile and galvanometer directly toward a constant source of
heat, or by a bolometer, would be an interesting subject of inquiry in
connection with obscure states of vapor and water in the air, and with
the forecast of weather.

The loss of heat by drops passing through a known distance of air,
both dry and humid, in a certain time. The relation of the rapidity of
the loss of heat to the size of the drop, and the difference between the
temperatures of the drops and of the air. Similar experiments could
be made with ice bullets. The results might elucidate some points in
connection with the evaporation and growth of raindrops and with the
growth of snowflakes and hailstones. A high tower in frosty weather,
or a shot tower, might be convenient for these experiments; or a cliff
of sufficient steepness and height.

The effects of the mixture, on a rather large experimental scale, of
masses of air of different temperatures, humidities, and electrical
states, and of different electrical sign. The resulting humidity, fog
formation, and electrical state.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIF® AND HEALTH. 319

The effects of mixture of invisible steam of different temperatures,
of visible steam at different temperatures, and of each of these in dif-
ferent electrical states. The growth of size, and the color, of the steam
particles and the effects of absence and presence of much dust or
smoke.

The true results of the electrification of jets of steam or cloudy
masses, the relation of the size of the deposited vapor particles to the
electrification, and the optical effects of various degrees of electrifica-
tion in air.

The eftect of an electric field on the surface tension of drops of water,
and the various effects of varying amounts and proximity of the elec-
tricity of the charged surface on drops of different sizes. When the
electrical field is uniform the surface tension of the drop is only slightly
diminished, and the diminution is independent of the size of the drop.
Very small drops thus preserve their high surface tension in the
neighborhood of an electric field. But when there are a number of
charged atoms surrounding the droplets the effect is different; the
diminution of surface tension which is brought about varies inversely
as the square of the radius of the droplet. The whole subject of the
electrification of gases, dry and moist, the electrification of drops of
water and their behavior under electrification, and the relation of sur-
face tension in cloud globules and drops to electricity in natural condi-
tions, requires investigation. The “cloudy condensation” of ‘steam,
and the optical effects in electrified steam have hitherto led to conflict-
ing inferences, and careful observation has not yet proved a diminution
or increase in the size of the water particles or a recombination of dis-
sociated molecules of oxygen and nitrogen. The question is of great
interest in many respects, and may have a bearing on thunderstorms,
rainfall, evaporation, and chemical problems.

Shortly stated, there are three principal views of the apparent
action of electricity on steam. Mr. Aitken believes that the thick con-
densation, coloration, etc., of a jet of electrified steam is due to the
prevention of the coalescence of the very small condensed particles
- which would occur without electrification. Mr. Bidwell believed that
the effects were produced by the conglomeration under electric excite-
ment of particles which would otherwise have evaporated unseen, not
becoming large enough to cause visible obstruction of light. These
views are related to Lord Rayleigh’s discoveries on the behavior of
drops under electrification; the drops coalesced when weakly, and
repelled each other when strongly electrified.

Prof. Paul Carus holds a very different view, and considers that the
condensation effects depend on the action on steam of exceedingly
small particles of dust. ‘One may estimate,” he says, “that pure
dust-free, unconfined steam at 100° would require a pressure of 10
or more atmospheres to condense it. Add to this dust particles less
than 0.000001 centimeter in diameter, and the pressure sinks to 15

320 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

centimeters of mercury; in the case of particles of 0.00001 centimeter
diameter, to 1 or 2 centimeters of mercury, that is, to pressure inere-
ments certainly met with in steam jets. The fact that nuclei of a few
hundred molecular diameters are needed is the very feature of these
experiments, and explains why smoke and other coarse material is use-
less, and why the condensation-producing dust must be so highly
specialized.” Glowing charcoal and red-hot platinum produce effects
similar to those of flame, owing, according to Professor Carus, to the
escape of clouds of exceedingly minute particles from these objects.
‘““Dust-stimulated condensation differs merely in degree, not in kind,
from jet condensation in air,” for air always contains fine dust. ‘Air
nominally purified needs only a higher degree of supersaturation to
evoke condensation running through the whole gamut of colors.” Mr.
Bidwell found the following substances active in the condensation of
the jet: Air, oxygen, or nitrogen, in which the electrical discharge was
occurring; burning and incandescent substances; fumes from phos-
phorus; hydrochloric acid; sulphuric acid vapor; nitric acid vapor;
acetic acid vapor. The following were inactive: Air, ete., in which
the electric discharge had ceased for about ten seconds; smoke with-
out fire; bottled phosphorus fumes; ozone, steam, alcohol vapor; formic
acid vapor; sulphurous acid. Finding that the effects of a discharge
in nitrogen and in oxygen separately were the same as in air, Mr.
Bidwell concluded that the action is due in some way to dissociated
atoms of nitrogen and of oxygen. Robert Helmholtz suggested such
an explanation, having discovered that flames and incandescent sub-
stances generally cause dissociation of the molecules of the surround-
ing air; and Mr. Bidwell hints at the possibility of the necessity of the
presence of water, aS in so many chemical reactions, to recombine
dissociated atoms.

The whole subject is an important one to meteorology and merits a
searching and full investigation.

The difference of weight in drops after falling through a measured
height in different states of the air, dry and moist, and the relation of
loss or increase of weight to size of drop.

The gain or loss in weight of drops similarly let fall, but previously
strougly or feebly electrified. These experiments to be tried in satu-
rated and in foggy air.

The increase in weight and bulk of particles and bullets of ice allowed
to drop through saturated and foggy air and through misty rain at a
low temperature. The ice bullets to be cooled, before falling, down to
several degrees below 0° C., and the effect of electrification to be tried.

Similar experiments to be tried in the laboratory; e. g., frozen spheres
of water to be rotated rapidly through freezing fog artificially produced
in a closed space; the icy spheres and the fog to be electrified, and the
gain in weight of the ice sphere to be noted, also the relation of rapid-
ity in rotation and differences of temperature and electric state to the

The development of large ice crystals to be attempted in the labora-
tory, such as sometimes form on the outside of hailstones. Electrifica-
tion, saturation of air, and great rapidity of movement would seem
needful.

The study of the movement of convection currents over a soil or sur-
face heated to various degrees above the temperature of the air. Smoke
might to some extent show the manner in which the currents rise and
the height to which they reach in continuous streams. The effect of
wind, at some height above the surface, in promoting or retarding the
unbroken ascent of currents might be observed, in connection with
such phenomena as showers, tornadoes, and the formation of cumulus.
The effect of a calm abovea moving air mass might similarly be shown
on a small scale.

The radiation of air and of vapor, separately and together, and mixed
in various proportions; also the absorption. Experiment might give
information respecting the radiation and absorption of air and vapor
in respect of light and of heat in general of various refrangibility.

The radiative and absorptive power of fog or cloud. Experiments
might give useful results both in the laboratory and in natural condi-
tions. The effects of dust and smoke mixed with the fog might be
observed, and the comparative loss of heat in unit of time by dusty
or smoky and dust-free air.

Observations are needed on the geographical distribution of thun-
derstorms and hailstorms, the influence of mountains, forests, and
local winds, and on means of forecast and warning against damage.

The elaboration of plans for the mechanical use of wind power for
pumping, irrigation, factories, mills, and traction or propulsion, and
for the conversion of wind power into electrical energy. The geo-
graphical distribution of wind force, and the areas in which steady,
strong winds blow continually or for long periods, need to be ascer-
tained in order to place windmills in economically advantageous posi-
tions. The heights above the ground at which wind is strongest
should also be ascertained.

Mr. Symons notes that the Hon. R. Abercrombie, in 1875, summed
up the results of a study of the oscillations of the barometer in thun-
derstorms, and concluded that there are two classes of storms in this
country—one in which the barometer rises, in the other it falls. The
rise is always under the visible storm, and the greatest rise is under
the greatest uptake, or ascensional column of air. Dr. Fines, of Per-
pignan, established a Redier baragraph in 1875, and in a memoir
published in 1883 gave reproductions of the traces of several storms.
He found that before heavy rain at Perpignan there is usually (1) a
decrease of pressure and temperature; (2) with the rain, sudden
increase of wind, rapid rise of barometer, and fall of temperature;
(3) at the end of the storm rain, reversal of the last three phenomena.

It appears probable that a fall of the barometer before thunder or
hail storms may be caused by the increased amount of vapor in the
sm 95——21

column of air above it, and the rise, in most cases, is simply explained
by the condensation of vapor permitting drier air to flow in, and still
more by the existence of a cold, heavy mass of air at some rather high
altitude, which, indeed, is one of the main causes of the storm. The
barometer may very probably in most thunder or hail storms be acted
upon oppositely by the two coexisting conditions, a humid column of
ascending air and a descending block of upper air colder than the
average of its level. Hence the mercury is either stationary or oscil-
lates within narrow limits. The rise under the ascensional column may
also be frequently caused by the rapid ascent of a column of air which
takes an appreciable time to expand to the lower density of the upper
levels. A study of the temperature and barometric movements before
storms of different kinds, and with different winds, might lead to a use-
ful prognosis of the course and character of storms, tornadoes, and
heavy rains.

Observations on the rate of change of ocean temperatures at differ-
ent depths in relation to the temperature of the air and to the influence
of currents are needed, and also of the rate of cooling and warming of
air currents passing over a sea surface of lower or higher temperature.

Experiment is needed in extension of our knowledge respecting the
‘amount of ground air and gases in various soils, their expansion under
variations of atmospheric and ground temperatures, of atmospheric
pressure, and of natural processes of decomposition. Smoking or
scented substances buried in the ground might afford some useful
information. Also, respecting the production of gases by bacteria in
the soil, the movements and permeation of ground air or gases through
various soils, the emission of microbes into the air at different seasons
and hours, and the density of microbes in the air near the ground.
Also, respecting the depth in various soils at which organic matter
best undergoes harmless decomposition, so as not to give out noxious
products to the air to a degree dangerous. to health, or offensively, so
as not to poison wells, and so as to be of maximum benefit in agricul-
ture. The relations of ground air to the ground water.

urement of the depth at which the soil begins to be moist on sandy

of 3 or 4 feet from the ground, on sandy malarious plains on still even-
ings, in places subject to cholera, diarrhea, and rheumatism, in low

to windward and to leeward of great towns, in streets, in old and new
houses, in crowded places, in railway cars and in cabins, and in schools.

An investigation of all the phenomena and physics of evaporation

would be within the scope of the inquiry.

A very interesting branch of research, and one to which little atten-
tion has hitherto been paid, is the formation of ice crystals, snow, and
hail. In the free atmosphere, beautiful crystals develop themselves in
great variety, mostly hexagonal or six-rayed, but some few with three
or twelve rays, and some of less regular shape. At least two hundred
different shaped crystals have been observed and drawn, many of the
most exquisite delicacy and regularity. Often a single shower yields
several different species of snow crystals, but generally there is great
similarity in the crystals which fall about the same time. The cause of
the difference in shape has not been made out, and indeed is not likely
to be fully accounted for by any means at our disposal, but the present

324 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

writer has been led by many personal observations to the conclusion
that the erystals are differently developed according to (1) the amount
of dust or nuclei in the air, (2) the electric state, (3) the humidity of
the stratum where they have their origin and of the lower strata, and
(3) the suddenness or slowness of their growth. He found that ina
clear air on a hill crystals on vegetation were clearer, simpler, and more
glassy than in the rather foggy neighboring valley; that in the neigh-
borhood (10 miles) of London, where the air was smoky, the erystals
on trees were very much more feathery, branching, and opaque, and
yielded smoky water on melting. The upper air varies greatly in the
amount of contained dust nuclei, in free electricity, and in differences
of temperature between strata. A moist southerly wind beating back
a cold northeast wind in England generally yields broad, heavy, irregu-
lar, conglomerated flakes; a dry gentle wind, with uniform conditions,
yields regular crystals, small and thin; a very dry and cold air in the
early days of asevere frost sometimes gives showers of pellets of vari-
ous sizes, roughly hexagonal or polygonal, very dense, thick, opaque,
and like a number of superposed plates. In March, and sometimes in
April, a soft hail or dense pellets of snow fall in showers with a north-
east or north wind, and dry air, the showers alternating with bright
Sunshine. At great heights in the Alps, the snow in winter is small
and powdery; in summer the flakes are much larger.

Hail is often the result of a sudden condensation of very warm, moist
air by great reduction of temperature at a great height. The dust
nuclei are soon all occupied by moisture condensed upon them, and as
the vapor falls to and below saturation point in a high column, it has
not sufficient nuclei on which to condense in cloudy form, and precipi-
tation takes place at a great rate, either on the cloud globules or on
the snow crystals which fall through from the upper part of the cloud.
Since the whole or a great portion of the column of the topmost cloud
is below the freezing point, the globules as they come in contact with
the falling crystals instantly freeze, and so the c:ystal grows and falls
ever faster, accumulating bands of ice and snowy particles according as
the air is clear and saturated, or else densely cloudy, through which it
passes. The electric charge being much denser comparatively on a
large drop or crystal than on a small one, and the vapor pressure being
less, the hailstones grow very quickly, and since they fall rapidly
through very thick clouds, they add much ice by mere impact at their
base. The radial structure so often observed indicates the origin of
the hailstone from a radial snowflake or hexagonal plate. Hailstones
of large size are produéed in circumstances of great electric disturbance.

Sometimes a hailstone has been found with finely developed hexag-
onal ice crystals growing like stalactites from a matrix. Possibly the
attachment of a flat hexagonal crystal at a certain stage in the fall of
the hailstone and the action of electricity in the rapid passage through
the air are sufficient to account for these large ice crystals, but they
_ ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 325

have not been observed in other conditions in nature. Small, long,
clear crystals are formed on vegetation in a clear, moist air by radia-
tion. It would be interesting to endeavor experimentally to produce
ice crystals of large size by strong electric charges in saturated air
below the freezing point and in rapid motion.

THE BEARING OF ATMOSPHERIC INFLUENCES ON PLANTS.

The connection between atmospheric conditions and the development
of plants, especially of staple crops, is strongly realized by every farmer
in countries where weather varies from year to year. But the subject
is an immense one, and its branches extend in many directions, some
of which have been little explored, and most of which have only recently
come under systematic scientific inquiry in a few places. Most valu-
able work on agricultural meteorology has been done in the United
States, in France, in Germany, and in England. The Climatology of
the United States, by Louis Blodgett, published in 1857; The Signal
Service Tables of Rainfall and Temperature Compared with Crop Pro-
duction; the Compendium of Phenological Observations, by Ihne, in
Sweden; the work of Lawes and Gilbert at Rothamsted, in England;
Wollney’s Researches in Agricultural Physics; Adamson’s and Bous-
songault’s various and interesting observations on plants; the great
work of Sachs on temperature in connection with plant life; and Hoff
man’s extensive work in the same field afford an excellent ground for
further researches, which ought to be based as far as possible on a
common plan and to be both national and international.

As regards temperature, the following points may be considered to
have been ascertained with respect certainly to a large number of
plants of agricultural value. <A particular temperature or a narrow
range of temperature within certain limits is required for the quickest
germination and most rapid growth of each kind of plant. Growth is
retarded in proportion to the deficiency or excess of temperature. For
each plant there is a minimum and maximum temperature and a tem-
perature most favorable to growth. The sums of the temperature
required for a certain growth of similar plants in two places are in
proportion to the sum of the temperatures above zero at the places.
Plants in high northern latitudes grow more quickly with the same
temperature than the same kinds of plants in lower latitudes. Capa-
‘ bility of resisting cold seems to increase with the age of the plant, and
plants containing much water seem least capable of resistance. Seeds
of northern-grown or mountain-grown plants germinate and develop
earlier than similar seeds in warmer situations when both are planted
together in the warmer place. There must be a maximum fruit forma-
tion and growth for some period of time best adapted to the plant or
crop. Blossoming and ripening of certain plants, beets and potatoes,
nowever early sown, coincided with that of the planting which took
place when the minimum temperature of germination of the plant had

326 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

been exceeded by the ground temperature. This result discourages
very early planting. The highest results in Austria-Hungary were
obtained from both beet and potato planted on May 1 as against
earlier and later dates. When the necessary earth temperature has
been reached, then the seeds should be planted.

The observation of ground temperature ought to be a very important
branch of agricultural practice. The temperature at depths of 14 to 3
inches should be taken daily, and in course of time, when observations
and experience have been accumulated, and a classification made of
the results for various crops, this will become a more useful and trust-
worthy guide to the farmer than the temperature of the air. The aspect
or exposure, and also the character of the ground, have of course to be
noted in connection with these inquiries. In dry ground temperature
increases in some ratio according to the size of the particles up to a
certain point, and then decreases. This holds good for the warm sea-
son. Oscillations of temperature follow in a similar relation. In moist
ground the temperature also increases, up to certain limits, with the
size of the earth particles, and the ground in a crumbly condition is
warmer than in a powdery or fine state of division. In the cold season
the coarser ground is colder and follows changes of temperature more
quickly than the less aerated or firmer ground.

Fine earth can contain more water than coarse earth, but also evapo-
rates more, and allows less water to sink through it. Penetrability and
evaporation are frequently inversely related to each other.

Perhaps some results of ground temperature and moisture observa-
tions arrived at by the present writer may be here briefly alluded to,
though they were on a small scale. When grass or earth is covered
over at night by an impermeable material, the moisture from a little
below the surface of the earth exhales, but does not escape, and is
deposited on the undersurface of the material and on the grass blades.
Plants might thus be kept moist, when desirable, by a covering which
could be removed at any convenient time in the afternoon and replaced
in the evening. Hollows, depressions, and sheltered parts near the
hedges are much more bedewed on most nights, excepting the calmest,
than fully exposed places, and the intensity of frost and the sun’s heat-
ing effect a little below the surface is also generally greater—in fact,
the daily and annual range of shallow-earth temperature is greater,
but all these results depend on the amount of wind at night in the
particular district. Dew, though copious under a close covering, is
very much below the normal on the earth under loose coverings or
under trees. Since moisture combined with frost is often fatal to plants
when frost alone is not, it is important to discover the driest and airiest
situations for delicate or early vegetables; if frost and fog with calm
are probable, but if the climate is subject to frost, fog, and wind, or
frost and wind, a more sheltered situation is desirable, according to the
nature of the plant, for some suffer more by cutting winds and others
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 327

by freezing fog. The southern border, even to some yards’ distance, of
a thick, high hedge of evergreen, such as holly, is much warmer than
other situations, and is most warm on sloping ground. Pasture land,
replacing arable, increases the cold due to radiation at night, and also
the relative humidity near the ground, for the dew-point is quickly
reached over grass. The difference of temperature between the top of
moderately long grass (a few inches) and the surface of the earth or
bottom of the blades is often very great in the evening and night,
10° or more occasionally, and at 2 inches deep in the ground the tem-
perature of the roots of grass, even in England, may be 26° higher
than that of the blades. The temperature close to the surface of the
earth under grass rises very quickly immediately after sunrise. The
temperature at 15 inches deep was high, 59° to 62°, and nearly uniform
in August. These experiments were made on sandy soil, and in the
mold of a pasture field.

The relations of the various qualities and conditions of the atmos-
phere to plant growth in various soils and situations have still to a
great extent to be determined. Agriculture depends not only directly,
but also indirectly on weather. A certain kind of season has a com-
pound effect on a great number of crops, on each a somewhat different
result, and this result has its effect upon the crops of succeeding years.
It may be favorable to a weed or to a species of blight, mold, rust, or
parasite, as well as to the crop attacked by such pests, and the net gain
or loss for the present and future may not be easy to determine. If a
particular character of spring is found to have a particular effect, either
in hardening a crop for resistance or in developing a pest at some crit-
ical time, or in rendering the ground fit for some other crop than one of
which the planting seems likely to fail, then valuable results will have
been gained. The co-relation of a variety of plants, of birds, of insects,
of fungi, with each other, and the relation of each of these to weather
and season, have still, for the most part, to be made out. Accurate obser-
vations of the times of planting, the times of gathcring, and the charac-
ter of seasons, may render it possible for specialists to inform farmers
with a large percentage of success of the best time for their operations
in various localities. Weather conditions are exceedingly important
in the cutting and carrying of certain crops—hay, for instance, and
there must be a particular time of the summer which is most favor-
able for each district, in view of which grass should be sown and cut,
without, of course, any interference with the individual judgment as
to the right time, which must vary with the aspect of weather and
crop. It would be desirable to use so:ne standard method of obtaining
the actual temperature of plants at a little height above the ground,
as well as in their roots. The amounts of rainfall and the relation to
plant growth in various soils should be systematically recorded. The
amount of sunlight and “actinic” energy with relation to various
crops has still to be investigated on a large scale; some valuable
results have already been obtained.

328 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

ABSORPTION AND EMISSION OF WATER FROM THE LEAVES OF
PLANTS.

M. Boussingault showed some years ago that plants absorb from the
earth and exhale to the air an enormous quantity of water. He caleu-
lated that a field of cauliflower, 1 hectare in extent, can emit in twelve
hours 20,000 kilograms. M. Deherain states that a young blade of
wheat evaporates in one hour a weight of water equal to its own.
Eucalyptus globulus is supposed to be capable of evaporating eleven
times the rainfall of the area which it covers, provided, no doubt, that
the rainfall is not excessively large. Oaks are also great evaporators
and grow best in wet clay. M. Fautrat, inspector of forests, has
found that the quantity of vapor in the air over forests is much greater
than in the air over the open country. But exact comparative obser-
vations of the amount of water evaporated within and without forest
areas in various clinates are wanting. Forests have been planted in
certain parts of southern France with excellent results in the improve-
ment of health, and malaria has diminished in several instances in
consequence of judicious planting. The question of planting in con-
nection with human health is a very important one, and the influence
of forests and trees on the steadiness of the water supply makes it very
necessary that forests should be carefully guarded by the State in
many countries. Vegetation, large or small, should never be hastily
destroyed. ‘Trees and hedges are very useful in breaking the force of
strong winds, in giving shelter to animals, and promoting the growth
of fruit trees and vegetables, and they add greatly to the amenity of
the country.

The exact: conditions of clinate most suitable to each kind of useful
crop, tree, or plant, have yet to be determined, though they are in
many cases fairly well known. The development and selection of
hardy specimens would be aided by trial of the effect of transplanting
or obtaining seed from various climates of each species examined. The
gradual acclimatization of plants might, under scientific inquiry, be
found to be capable of furnishing better results than have hitherto
been obtained.

The amount of water collected by trees from the air in misty and
damp weather has not been determined, although in some districts,
especially where warm, moist winds from the sea prevail, with frequent
mist, it must be considerable.

The exact manner in which the spores of dry rot, potato disease,
vine diseases, rust, and other plant fungi are conveyed through the air,
and how far they may be carried in a potent state through dry and
moist air, requires investigation; also the influence of ozone, of sun-
light, and of drought upon them when deposited on their host.

itants of wild, windy climates, such as those of northern and western
Britain, with the health and diseases of the inhabitants of calm,

septics such as thymol, cinnamon, toluol, and aromatic vapors.

Inquiry into the infective power, if any, of malaria from person to
person through the air, a few instances having been recorded.

CHOLERA.

The extent to which cholera may be regarded as endemic in parts of
India and other countries, the nature of the soil over which air is
infected, the most favorable amount of aeration and moisture of the
soil, the atmospheric conditions most favorable to its growth and to
its invasion of the air and of persons. The atmospheric conditions
most favorable to its extension over Europe and America, and the
special precautions needed to prevent the transport of the poison in
such conditions. The possibility of a system of international warn-
ings of the prevalence of the epidemic at any centers and of forecasts
of seasons or types of weather in connection with its probable spread.

wind, and other conditions of the air. The character of soil and sur-
face on which the microbe develops, the aeration of soil, etc., and the
possibility of checking its growth and emission into the air by spray-
ing with petroleum or some viscous disinfectant or antiseptic. Since
yellow fever germs seem to be aerobic and to grow largely on surfaces,
the treatment of street surfaces, walls, ships, harbors, ete., in this way
seems promising.

DIPHTHERIA.

Examination of air for detection of the diphtheria bacillus over
polluted surfaces of sandy soil, over ash heaps, decaying vegetable and
animal matter, and above drain outlets. Relation of the bacillus to
atmospheric conditions where it grows on soil, organic matter, dirty
floors, or walls, etc.; how far it is aerobic; how far it may pass through
air in different conditions, and how much it loses virulence in dry air,
in moist air, and in confined and onen spaces. Effect of exposure or
aeration in causing it to form spores,if any. Effect of sunshine on
the bacilli, with and without air; the diphtheritic poison is rapidly
weakened by air with sunshine, but only slowly by sunshine alone.
Effect of coating a cultivation of diphtheria bacilli with a very thin
film of oil or viscous disinfectant, so as to prevent growth and passage
into the air. The favorable temperature, a rather low one, the exclu-
sion from light and air, and the presence of certain other organisms
furnish useful points of departure for an investigation of climatic and
local conditions of prevalence of diphtheria.

with the virulence of pathogenic bacilli of different kinds exposed to
like surroundings. Dependence of most of these diseases on air in
confined and ill-ventilated spaces for effective spread. How far can
ventilation, and how far can diffusion of ozone, disinfectants, and vari-
ous aromatic substances and vapors counteract the infectivity of the
germs?

INFECTIOUS, CONTAGIOUS, EPIDEMIC, AND ENDEMIC DISEASES IN
GENERAL.

A full investigation into the comparative health of persons living in
fairly isolated places, such as islands or institutions having littie com-
munication with populous places, would lead to useful results. The
occasions of any outbreak of disease could probably be accounted for
and the medium of conveyance identified. The degree of human sus-
ceptibility to various infections could be much better made out than in
ordinary situations. Moreover, those diseases, such as bronchitis, rheu-
Inatism, and cancer, which do not seem to depend for the most part on

infection, but on constitutional or atmospheric conditions, could be bet-
ter accounted for, the possible causes being few. The immunity of
children living in several large and very well-managed institutions from
the ordinary diseases of children is instructive, and, on the other hand,
the frequent prevalence of ophthalmia in pauper schools indicates an
effect of bad ventilation upon crowded children of poor vitality. A
great sanitary authority demonstrated the enormous fall of mortality
following ventilation of crowded places, and another fall following reg-
ular daily head-to-foot ablution and insistence on clean clothing.

A comparison of different atmospheric or climatic influences upon
similar branches of the same race, through long and short periods.
Thus the effect of moving northward to a colder region upon a branch

An examination of the conditions under which, in the crowded quar-

time, if not recruited from the country, physically and mentally
enfeebled, and in a few generations almost extinct. The part played
by the continual breathing of bad air, and by the crippling produced by
attacks of various maladies most rife in crowded places and bad air.

Contrasted with country air, town air contains an excess of carbon
dioxide, less oxygen, no ozone, many gaseous and solid impurities and
vapors and an immensely greater number of motes of the finest dust.
The air is also heated by pavements, etc., so as to become less bracing.

be to some degree allocated.

The cause of milk turning sour in “thundery weather” and an exam-
ination of air at such times with regard to its microorganiec contents,
its putrefactive influence, and its effect not only on milk, but on vari-
ous animal and vegetable infusions. Certain kinds of fungi or germs
which affect milk may be enabled to survive in warm, moist air, when
they would be killed by dry air; in that case the “thundery weather”
would turn milk sour simply because the air is then commonly warm
and moist.

Animal flesh and other provisions do not putrefy or turn bad for a
long time in dry and desert air; apparently moisture is necessary in
the air for the conveyance of live microbes and for their attack on the
substance.

Wounds heal very well and rapidly in the desert, and disease is very
rare among wandering tribes; inquiry seems to be needed to ascertain
how far this is due to absence of microbie life in the air and on sub-
stances to which the air has access.

If some diseases and putrefaction and such changes as occur in mille
and organic infusions are owing to presence of microorganie life in
the air, then those changes and fermentations should not occur in mid-
ocean, where care is taken that only air which has not been in contact
“with any part of the ship, ete., gains access; for the air on mid-ocean
is considered to be practically free from living germs. Experiment
might best be made on small islands or exposed rocks, such as Rockall,
which may be assumed to be sterilized.

The antiseptic treatment of wounds is now recognized by the great:

- harmless to wounds, except, no doubt, in certain unhealthy situations
and near the ground. This conviction agrees well with the realization
by physiologists and by public health departments of the general rule
that epidemics exist through the action of man and not of the atmos-
phere. “It is in the power of man,” in Pasteur’s opinion, “to cause
the parasitic maladies to disappear from the face of the globe if, as 1
am convinced, the doctrine of spontaneous generation is a chimera.”

fungiin relation to plant and animal diseases. Their growth on various
fomites in relation to qualities of the air and to light.

The relation of weather to diseases, not only to those apparently
caused by microorganisms, but to a variety of other maladies. <A cer-
tain climate or a certain kind of weather may give rise to an excess or
maximum of a spreading disease by direct influence on the outside
growth of a microbe, or by helping to spread the spores or germs, or by
increasing the supply of some pabulum, or by effects on wells and water
supply, or by affecting the human constitution so as to lay it open to
attack, or by producing effects on human conduct which favor the
spread of the disease. The contributory factors may be many, remote,
or concealed, but such thorough investigation as is possible could
hardly fail to give valuable results.

There is generally a main cause in each disease by attacking which
much progressis made. ‘The soil temperature in diarrhea and cholera,
the dried sputum in consumption, the close air in typhus, have already
been thus marked out.

The lesions, or quasi-lesions, by cold and chill, are exceedingly effect-
ive in disarming the resistent powers of the body, so as to give oppor-
tunity to such diseases as bronchitis, pneumonia, liver and kidney
diseases, dysentery, malaria, and many others. The manner in which
by clothing and otherwise these consequences of atmospheric variations
may be guarded against might well form a subject for research. The
rate of cooling of vessels at the blood temperature surrounded by
various fabrics would give useful information. Some experiments of
Mr. Garrod! showed that in a room at about the average annual tem-
perature of the exterior air, when clothes are removed from the human
body, the temperature very quickly rises in the axilla to a point 2°
higher than before. The blood vessels are of course congested, and
colds, etc., are then easily caught. The rise does not take place when
the temperature of the room is above 70° F., and increases as the
temperature of the air is less.

1 Proc. Roy. Soc., 1869, No. 112.

336 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

A temperature between 30° and 42° seems to be very favorable
to chills, etc., possibly owing to the humidity and conductivity of the
air being greater than at lower temperatures, to the absence of the
sharp, bracing action of frost, and to the greater number and vitality
of microbes in the air than at lower temperatures. Dry, cold winds
may have a chilling effect equal to a calm, damp air of the same tem-
perature.

With regard to all these matters of air and health, or season and
health, a great deal might be done for the prevention of disease by the
public issue of forecasts, or monitions, at appropriate times, showing
the character of the maladies common at the season, or to be expected,
and giving some plain directions. If this were done weekly, it is prob-
able that the number of lives saved would be larger than those saved
by the weather forecasts for coast purposes.

EXPLORATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN CONNECTION WITH WEATHER
FORECASTS AND A MORE EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF ATMOSPHERIC
CONDITIONS.

Captive balloons regularly used, weather permitting, at a number of
well-distributed stations, would give valuable information in addition
to the ordinary items furnished for the purposes of governmental fore-
casting. Mountain observatories have already been long enough
established to give results which show a different distribution of tem-
perature and pressure before different types of weather. But balloons
might be fitted with instruments which would show the pressure and
temperature at several heights in succession during ascent and descent,
and this information would very probably be important in forecasts, if
the height attained were sufficient. Balloon ascents have shown the

atmosphere to be frequently arranged in blocks or masses of air of -

very different temperatures within a short distance of each other, and
occasionally in an inverse order to that which might be expected from
the law of diminution with height. Thus, on July 17, 1862, the ther-
mometer on the earth was 59; at 10,000 feet, 26; at 15,000 feet, 31; at
19,500 feet, 42; but on descent a little below this height, the tempera-
ture fell with extraordinary rapidity to 16. Strata much below the
freezing point may have a few hundred or thousand feet above them,
currents of air at 40 or 42. The variations are often very large and
rapid. The greater the height, within the limits of the cirrus cloud
at least, the greater apparently are the differences between adjacent
strata or masses of air. Irregularity of temperature and humidity dis-
tribution must have a considerable influence on the consequent weather,
and a series of balloon observations for a term of years at a good num-
ber of stations would probably be of very considerable service both
for theoretical and practical purposes.

Free balloons for exploration, such as have given good results in
France, might be contrived to ascend to some desired height, and then

hb ge 5°
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 337

rapidly to descend, so as to be again available. The hydrogen balloon
might, for instance, carry a small vessel containing a substance which
would combine with the oxygen and with the vapor of the air at an
approximately known and arranged rate; the increased weight of the
contents would reverse the ascent at a roughly calculated height, and,
except with strong winds, the balloon would descend at no great dis-
tance. In calm weather its motion could be watched with a telescope
and its approximate height noted. Intelligent persons in towns and
villages should previously be instructed to secure the descended bal-
loon and to take readings. Schoolmasters in France have received
such instructions.

It is probable that the condition of air immediately preceding torna-
does, cyclones, and blizzards, and thunderstorms or heavy rains would
frequently be of sufficiently remarkable character to give ground for
generalizations from balloon records by which the advent of these
phenomena could be foretold.

ELECTRICITY, CLOUDS, AND RAIN.

The connection of electricity with the formation of rain, snow, and
hail requires much fuller investigation than it has yet received, and
research in this field is sure to yield interesting results. The upper air
is positive, the lower often negative, and the almost invariable neces-
sity for two or more layers of clouds for the production of anything
more than misty rain over level ground seems to point to an almost
invariable coexistence of oppositely electrified clouds in the formation
of heavy rain. Heavy showers and snowstorms always show a large
development of free electricity, but of course this may be merely a con-
sequence of the agglomeration of the drops, and in no important degree
a cause of the precipitation. In the heavy clouds of showers there
seem to be generally several zones or areas of opposite electricities.
The observations on Pikes Peak show the large development of free
electricity in the rain, and hail, and snow formed at great altitudes.
Howard deduced from Reed’s observations that snow and hail unmixed
with rain are positive almost without exception. Probably if the snow
and hail could have been intercepted in the upper air, it might have
been said “ without exception.” On one occasion, when “a most awful
darkness filled the atmosphere” and some rain fell mixed with hail, the
positive charge became ‘as strong as it could possibly be.” !

Experiment on the electricity of clouds, showers, etc., does not seem
to have been continued in recent years, though much might be learned
from it in connection with the other conditions of weather. On the
other hand, laboratory experiment on the electrification of steam, of
smoke, and of small drops has led to most interesting results. An
electrified rod, at a few thousand volts, with brush discharge, in a

338 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

vessel filled with smoke, widened the ‘“‘dust-free coat” enormously, and
the whole box was cleared of smoke. A discharge from a Voss or
Wimshurst machine through smoke causes a very rapid aggregation in
masses or flakes along the lines of force, and the soot is left on the
sides and floor of the vessel. The most effect is produced when the air
itself is electrified, but a knob acts less quickly than a point.

A piece of rabbed sealing wax held about a yard distant from a fall-
ing water jet broken into small drops causes the drops at once to
cease to scatter, and unites them into large drops as of a thunder
shower. A cloud of steam turns into “Scotch mist;” a spherule of
water amalgamates with a large mass at the first opportunity; if there
be the slightest difference in size or in electrification, the repulsion is
exchanged for attraction before actual contact. The opposed surfaces
come into collision with considerable violence, even when the relative
motion of the centers of the masses is small. Surface tension is over-
come, and thus violence of contact promotes the coalescence of drops.

The whole subject is of deep interest, not only in connection with the
causes of rain and conditions of cloud formation, but with the physics
of the atmosphere generally.

OVERCOOLING, ETC.

Other matters deserving fuller investigation than they have yet
received, although they have been the subject of valuable memoirs by
Dufour, Von Bezold, and others, are the capability of vapor existing in
the atmosphere beyond the normal degree of saturation, ‘‘overcooling,”
as it has been termed; and, secondly, the degree of temperature and
other conditions in which small drops of water and cloud globules can
exist unfrozen. These questions are of great interest both meteorolog-
ically and in relation to physics in general.

With regard to the supersaturation of air, this has been proved to be
possible in the laboratory to a remarkable degree when dust is absent,
but has not yet been proved in the atmosphere. It seems highly prob-
able that occasionally, especially in very moist air, when much rain
and cloud has been long continued, or in the intervals between thunder
clouds at a great height, there may be spaces of the atmosphere in
which dust is so rare and moisture so large that the ordinary point of
saturation may be passed. The accumulation upon drops or snowflakes
passing through such a space would be heavy.

The latent heat of condensation from vapor upon cold drops of ice
has been supposed, owing to its very considerable amount, to make the
growth of such drops or hailstones to a large size by deposition from
vapor impossible. But rapid passage through cold air may be found to
dispose very quickly of the heat thus set free. Experiment is needed
on this point.

With regard to the liquidity of droplets below the freezing point, the
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 339

fact is fully proved, and clouds and fogs often seem to be still liquid at
12° to 20° F. below the ordinary freezing temperature of large drops.
But the degree of cooling which may be borne without freezing, and its
dependence upon the size of the globules in the free air, has yet to be
determined. Observation of the sun and moon and the diffraction
effects in clouds at ascertained heights would be the best available
means, short of direct observation at great heights, of fixing the rela-

‘tion of size to congelation at various temperatures.

DISTRIBUTION OF VAPOR CLOUDS.

Experiments with kites and with electrometers have shown that
transparent vapor is grouped in masses through the air like visible
clouds, but less continuous, and astronomical observations seemed to
show a distribution of the atmosphere not only into horizontal strata,
but into vertically extended compartments differing greatly from each
other. Brief perturbations of polarization, occurring at any hour of the
day, have been ascribed to “clouds” of cirrus, etc., too faint to be seen.
Recent experiments in the foehn and in other hill and valley winds have
shown considerable differences of temperature at intervals of a few
minutes. Delicate and sensitive thermometers, hygrometers, and elec-
trometers might well be used for the further discovery of the varying
states and divisions of the air in respect of temperature, humidity, and
electric state and of the causes of differences. ;

There is much reason to assume that the atmosphere is divided, like
the sea, into many large and small masses of unequal temperature.
The great reluctance of waters of different temperatures to mingle, as
seen in the neighborhood of Newfoundland and of the Gulf Stream,
also at the head of the Lake of Geneva where the Rhone enters, and
at the junction of the Rhone and Arve below Geneva, has its counter-
part in the atmosphere. It is curious to see a large body of water like
the Rhone plunge down toward the bottom of the lake, leaving only
floating substances on the surface.

The present author believes that since particles of water in the air a
little smaller than those of fine blue haze would be quite invisible,
owing to their inability to reflect light, like a soap film a millionth
of an inch thick, which is quite invisible, there must be a quantity of
water in moist, transparent air which is competent to arrest heat waves
by absorption, and is not in the state of vapor. He believes that a
theoretical and experimental investigation of the various conditions of
vapor and water in the air would lead to interesting and important
results. The effect of a thin veil of cirrus, and of a slight, equally dis-
tributed haze upon the intensity of solar radiation has been recently
investigated at Catania and Casa del Bosco (4,725 feet above the sea).
The cirrus was found capable of intercepting 30 per cent of the radiant
solar energy. The haze intercepted 23 per cent when the sun was 10
340 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

degrees above the horizon, and only 4 per cent when the sun was at an
altitude of 50 degrees. When the sky was light blue and cloudless the
absorption was greater than when it was deep blue.' Of course, these
experiments refer to the whole thermal solar energy, and there is at
present no record of the varying amounts of absorption of dark heat
only, or of the varying loss by radiation from an object on the surface
of the earth in different conditions of the unclouded sky.

SOUND IN AIR.

Experiment has still to determine the rate of propagation of sound
in air at different temperatures in average atmospheric conditions at
those temperatures in different countries; the rate of propagation for
intense compared with feeble sounds; the rate for notes of widely dif-
ferent pitch, and what sounds may be most effective at long distances
to the ear and to recording instruments. It is conceivable that instru-
ments may be constructed which would enable messages to be sent by
the voice or otherwise through long distances of air. Converging
lenses of gas have been constructed for focusing sounds, and similar
ones might perhaps be utilized if made on a large scale.

The homogeneity and discrepancy or heterogeneity of the atmos-
phere have been ascertained to be very important in the transmission
and arrest of sound waves; it seems frequently to be impossible, with
our present knowledge, to distinguish a good from a bad hearing day.
The air is often divided, apparently, into lamine or divisions of differ-
ent density, humidity, etc., which stops waves of sound and may even
reflect them loudly, though transparent. All these points deserve
further elucidation, and are of consequence for maritime and military
and naval purposes. They may also serve, with other prognostics, for
the forecast of weather. The echoing power of clouds of different
kinds is not well made out. The practicability of production of sounds
in a dense medium, such as air under pressure or in carbonic acid gas,
in order to increase its intensity, is worth investigation.

COMBINED FORECASTING.

An inquiry into and formulation of a plan for a combined system of
weather forecasting. In addition to the present schemes and practice
of weather forecast as used in Europe and America, it would seem
desirable to employ observation of local instruments and phenomena.
Trained observers are often able to make a more correct forecast for
their district from the appearance of the sky, etc., than they receive
from a central office. The training of observers is a necessary prelimi-
nary to a much more extended system of observation. The present
writer has proved that a great deal of use may be made of a number
of different signs taken in combination. Thus the character of a haze,
the superposition of currents, the exact character and appearance of
clouds and their edges, the length of trail of steam from a locomotive,
the color of the sky and sun, and of morning and evening clouds, the
radiation from an exposed thermometer, and the size and manner of fall
of raindrops, often give a fair prediction of coming weather. These
should be used in combination with the reports of barometric and other
instrumental readings from the various stations, and in aid of the estab-
lished system of data used for weather forecasts. Locally observed
phenomena, many of them not at present recognized as significant,
might, after a certain number of years’ observation, have a definite
percentage value assigned to each as a prognostic, and the observer,
provided with a table of values, might then add up the percentages of
all the signs observed on each occasion, and from the total obtain a
very fair estimate of probability of coming weather over a district of
moderate area. The following table is intended to furnish an example
of such a system of local combined forecast, with imaginary figures:

Probability, rain.

The number of items in the forecast might be much increased with
increasing knowledge, and the value of each sign would also increase
with continuous exact observation. Moreover, each sign should be
studied not as a single item, but as occurring with others, and when
considered in relation to others would gain much in value. Thus, visi-
bility is not infrequent in fine dry weather, and also occurs in moist
weather, before rain. If observed day after day in fine weather, its
value in forecasting is evidently much less than when occurring in
somewhat unsettled weather. In fact, each sign has properly a partic-
ular value in particular kinds of weather, and the special value has to
be ascertained. The length of time during which a certain type of
weather has continued is in some proportion to the probability of the
ensuing days being of a similar type.

When the total of the various percentages exceeds a certain fixed
amount, the probability of bad weather rises to something approaching
certainty, and perhaps the probability of fine weather when the amount
is minus goes a little further still. When, in addition, the probability
announced by the central office from wide data is in the same direction,
it becomes justifiable to place reliance on the forecasts for agricultural
purposes and general district warnings. It will also eventually be of
great use to farmers to have telegraphic information forwarded to dis-
tricts toward which bad weather is moving, if there is reason to regard
the change as more than local when first noticed.

ON SOME POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS OF CLIMATE BY HUMAN
AGENCY.!

There can be no doubt that some effect upon climate, shown more
by physiological influences upon mankind than by instrumental records,

1 This section is derived from MS. written in 1891, but not in any way published.
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 343

has been produced by extensive afforesting or disafforesting, substi-
tution of pasture for arable land, drainage of wet land, and irrigation;
but certain means still remain untried which, if undertaken on a large
scale, would probably bring about more important changes than any
hitherto accomplished, with the exception, perhaps, of the drainage of
wide marshy areas like the fens of East Anglia, irrigation works in
India, and changes in the irrigated area of the basin of the Nile.

The drainage works of the eastern counties put an end to the once
prevailing ague of the low levels, and the cessation of irrigation in
parts of the Nile Valley seems to have deprived the plague, which was
once a dreaded affliction, of its former power. The substitution of
pasture for arable land tends to increase the cold of the lowest atmos-
pheric stratum, and ground fogs are favored by the active radiation of
grassy surfaces.

The influence of mountain ranges, even of small elevated tracts, upon
surrounding districts in a climate such as that of England has long
been recognized, and no traveler can be surprised to find fewer fine
days and more rain in the hilly country than on the plain, but some of
the less striking geographical conditions which tend to increase or
diminish the rainfall or cloudiness of neighboring localities have been
little noted and appear to deserve investigation. During a visit in
September, 1889, to the coast of Donegal adjoining Slieve League, a
mountainous cliff about 1,600 feet high, the summit of the cliff was
observed by the author to be much more densely clouded than the
vicinity; this characteristic is common to high, somewhat isolated
mountains on our western coast. Moreover, the beginning of the
cloud formation took place at a distance of fully a quarter of a mile or
half a mile to windward of Slieve League, so that the modification of
the wind blowing from the sea took place long before the strong upward
trend caused on actually reaching the cliff. The air was raised and
expanded, and its moisture partially condensed by the pressure in
advance, due to the opposing mass, and not, as commonly stated in
text-books, by the cold tops causing condensation. Now, a similar
effect is produced by ranges much lower than the Donegal coast moun-
tains, and when the wind is sufficiently charged with vapor rain would
begin to fall on many occasions at a considerable distance to wind-
ward, and would always be greater in annual amount near the hills
than in the more distant low country. Such instances occur in the
west highlands of Scotland, the west of England, and Wales. The
excess of rainfall begins at a little distance to windward of the hills,
reaches a maximum a little to windward of the highest altitudes, and
declines again toward the low country on the other side. The western
coasts of Britain, Norway, Ireland, and Spain and Portugal all have
a large rainfall, and, on the whole, the number of days on which rain
falls decreases continually from west to east, except where mountain
ranges or hills demand a fresh tribute of moisture. Thus, in the west
344 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

of Great Britain, among mountains, the average yearly rainfall is
from 45 to 150 inches, and in the west, away from the hills, from 30 to
45 inches, while in the eastern counties it is only from 20 to 28 inches.
This very large effect is produced by mountains of moderate extent and
of average elevation of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. At Bergen, in Norway,
the fall is 89 inches; at Coimbra, in the Spanish Peninsula, 118 inches;
at Nantes, 51 inches, and at Bayonne 49 inches. In parts of Sweden
and Russia it is as low as 15 inches; in France the average is 30 inches;
in the plains of Germany and Russia 20 inches.

But the most striking instance of the rain-compelling power of moun-
tains is afforded by the Khasia Hills, situated about 200 miles north of
the head of the Bay of Bengal, and only about one-third of the height
of the Himalayas. Here the annual rainfall is said to be 600 inches, of
which 500 fall in seven months. At 20 miles farther inland, beyond the
hills, the annual amount is reduced to 200 inches; at 30 miles to 100
inches; and at Gowahatty, in Assam, to 80 inches. In the more west-
erly Himalayas, where the southwest monsoon has already been drained
of part of its vapor by passing over a tract of dry land and hilly coun-
try, the rainfall is only 120 to 140 inches. Similar instances occur in
India, e. g., Bombay, on low ground, 75 inches; among the Western
Ghauts, at Uttra Mullay, 263 inches; at Poonah, more inland, 24 inches.

In Mauritius, at Cluny, in the vicinity of mountains and exposed to
the southeast trade wind blowing from the sea, the rainfall in almost
any month is from four to six times greater than at Gros Cailloux, on
the northwest coast, only 16 miles distant.

In England the difference between hilly and level districts is well
observed in the winter, when the clouds are low, and when precipita-
tion is less due to ascensional currents than to vapor-laden winds. The
clouds on rainy days in winter are very frequently between 500 and
1,000 feet above the sea level. The effect of low hills is consequently
most marked at this season. Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Chiltern, Cots-
wold, Derbyshire, Surrey, and Hampshire hills severally raise the
observable rainfall above that of the surrounding country. At the
head of the valley of Longdendale, near Manchester, nearly 1,000 feet
above the sea level, the rainfall in 1859 was 534 inches; on the west
side, and just over the summit on the east side, 585 inches. At Peni-
stone, a few miles farther east, it was 39 inches, and at Sheffield, still
farther east, 25 inches. The height of the hills producing this effect is
about 1,400 feet. Similarly, the fall varied from 39.1 inches at Roch-
dale to 67 inches at Blackstone Edge (1,200 feet), 32.25 at the east-
erly foot of the ridge, and 20 inches at York in 1848. In 1859 a gauge
on the westerly side of Loch Ard gave 92 inches, while another near
Glenfinlas, farther east, gave only 48 inches. The instances of Slieve
League, of: Hoy, and of the South Downs show that it is not only noun-
tainous masses, but also mere barriers against the wind from the rainy
gaurter which cause precipitation. The air will be equally lifted to

windward whether the obstacle consist of a mountain or of a galva-
nized iron screen.

SYMONS’S BRITISH RAINFALL.

An examination of the means for fifteen years at anumber of stations
in England shows that such cases are not isolated. At Saltash, on the
southwest side of Dartmoor, the rainfall was 53.87, at Lee Moor (860
feet), on Dartmoor, 68.96, and at Bovey Tracey, east of Dartmoor, on
Jow ground, 46.08. At Clyst Hydon, the mean was only 34.21; at Bxe-
ter, 36.61; aud at Exmouth, 34.74. Similarly, at Tavistock (316 feet),
near the western edge of Dartmoor, the fall was 54.18; while at Tiver-
ton (450 feet), at some distance northeast of Dartmoor, it was 44.35.
At Kingsbridge, to the south, where the influence of Dartmoor was not
conspicuous, owing to its position with regard to the prevailing winds,
only 37.15 was registered. Taunton, protected apparently by the pre-
cipitating influence of both Dartmoor and Exmoor, as well as by the
nearer Blackdown Hills to the southwest, recorded only 29.75, against
Tavistock’s 54.18 and Barnstaple’s 41.95.

In Sussex we find that the South Downs, mostly 600 to 700 feet high,
and the ranges of hills on the southwest border of Surrey, have an appre-
ciable effect, though they do not exceed 800 feet, except at a very few
points. Thus, Arundel registered 34.29; the rising ground north of
Chichester, 34.90; Petworth, 36.19; Midhurst, 39.65; Fernhurst, 32.19,
against 28.41 at Dunsfold, near Godalming, some miles to the northeast
of the hills; 26.55 at Weybridge, still farther east, and 26.13 at Green-
wich. At Alton, on high ground (496 feet), the fall was 35.58, against
26.73 at Reading. At St. Lawrence, Isle of Wight, and Osborne, the
record gave ouly 31.20 and 29.91, respectively, and the seacoast from the
Isle of Wight to Dover has an average of less than 30 inches. On
the low ground of the eastern counties, where the air would no longer
be forced upward in crossing the land, the amounts diminish to 24.22 at
Royston, 23.78 at Peterboro, 22.81 at Cambridge, 22.63 at Ely, and 21.85
at Shoeburyness. But the low hills of Norfolk and Lincoln raise the
amount to 28 and 29 inches.

In the Midlands and northern counties the distribution of rain is
similar. Thus, while at Sedbergh, Penistone, and Dunford Bridge, the
amounts were 55.26, 56.76, and 55.75, stations at a moderate distance
eastward of the hills registered as follows: York, 26.93; Doncaster,
27.33; Leeds, 27.70; Sheffield, 35.02; Stockwith, 25.66; Lincoln, 23.83.
The rainfall of Carlisle is remarkable, only 30.07, owing to its position
to the northeast of the mountains in the same county, where the
amounts reach 80 and 100 inches. In the neighborhood of Sheffield the
fall varies from 43.26 at 1,100 feet at Redmires to 33.03 at Broomhall,
not many miles distant. Buxton, at 989 feet, has 57.14 inches, and
Chatsworth, about 20 miles distant, 36.66. Tunstall, a little eastward
of the mountains of the North Riding of Yorkshire, has only 28 inches
against 55.26 at Sedbergh on their western side.
346 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

In Scotland the rainfall of the northern part of Elgin and Nairn,
protected by the mountains intervening between it and the west coast,
is less than half that of western Sutherland, Inverness-shire, and Skye.
Portree, in Skye, has 81.75 against 25.87 at Inverness. The east coast
of Scotland, generally, is very much drier than the west, although the
large precipitation during east winds tends to counteract the effect
which the mountains westward have in reducing its rainfall during
the prevalence of the equatorial currents. Great differences in rainfall
may exist within a small area; for instance, the rainfall at Perth is
only 32.10 and at Ochtertyre 44.17 against 50 at Lochearnhead, and —
the rainfall at Bothwell Castle is only 29.98 against 115.46 at Ardlui.
At Braemar, at the height of 1,114 feet, the rainfall is only 36.50,
owing to the great mass of high mountains toward the south and west.

In Ireland the greatest amounts are registered on the southwest and
west coasts, and the fall diminishes inland eastward of the mountains,
until in the northeast corner the average is only about 30 inches
against 60 to 80 in the west.

Among the above instances the most instructive, perhaps, for the
present purpose-are the records of Midhurst, Petworth, and Arundel,
compared with those a little south and north of these stations. It is
plain that the action of the long, wall like ridge of the South Downs,
not exceeding 600 feet in average height, is sufficient to cause from 5
to 10 inches excess of rain in its immediate neighborhood, the rainfall
20 miles westward and 8 miles southward, being only about five sixths
of that which occurs in close proximity to this ridge. Part of the defi-
ciency on the coast must be attributed to the frequent exemption from
heavy showers which form over the land, but not over the sea, in sum-
mer. The present author has observed this, especially on days with a
light westerly or southerly breeze, and has also noted the preference
of thunderstorms for the low ground between the hills and the downs,
The greatest fall takes place at Midhurst, which lies about 5 miles
north of the South Downs, and at the foot of the southern slope of a
second ridge, Henley Hill, about 600 feet high, which stretches from
east to west. Compared with Dunsfold, about 17 miles to the north-
east, the amount is in the proportion of 4 to 3. Dunsfold is probably
deprived of a good deal of rain by the mass of Blackdown (900 feet) 8
miles to the south. Fernhurst, near a cleft or dale in some high hills
on its northern side and 2 miles north of Henley Hiil, has, roughly,
74 inches less than Midhurst. That even lower hills (400 feet) in a
flat country may raise the rainfall of their climate by 5 or 6 inches is
shown by the records of the high ground of Norfolk and Lincolnshire.

Now, the practical inference from these statistics is that it may be
possible where desirable to imitate natural barriers on a small scale
and to increase rainfall in their proximity in order to diminish it else-
where. Thus, if between Chichester and Arundel the natural height
of the Downs were to be raised by 300 feet, the rainfall would be
ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. 347

increased a mile or so southward and perhaps a few miles northward,
but would be diminished over the northern half of Sussex, and prob-
ably in Surrey, to an appreciable degree.

Similarly, a wall of 400 feet in height between Yes Tor and Hartland
Point, in Devonshire, would increase precipitation along a band par-
allel with the wall, but would give a drier climate to the more easterly
portions of the county, and probably also to Somersetshire. In Eng-
land, not only does the greatest quantity of rain reach us from the
southwesterly quarter, but the clouds are lowest in the rains from that
quarter, so that the greatest effect of a barrier is produced on rains
coming from south and southwest.

The method of construction is a question for engineers. Would it
be possible to construct a screen several hundred feet high, of iron, as
used in the large gasometers which we see in the neighborhood of our
large towns? Oris masonry necessary in order to withstand the extreme
possible pressure of strong winds?

The desirability of forming any such artificial barrier would, of
course, depend on the calculated probable benefit to be conferred on
any county or district, and it would very likely be only in rare cases
that the increased geniality of climate would repay the outlay. Pos-
sibly it is only worth considering in the case of very wet climates, or
of places where little rain falls and more is needed. In England, sup-
posing for a moment that its erection is desirable, the line to be taken
for a wall must be such that there would be very little disturbance of
natural features of interest or beauty; in fact, it should either be across
barren moors or wastes, or else parallel to the cliffs on a desolate coast.
The line above suggested from Yes Tor, near Okehampton, toward
Hartland Point, appears in all respects a favorable one for the pur-
pose, as the country to be crossed is dreary and almost uninhabited.
The wall would have an additional advantage of permitting trees to be
planted on its northeast side in a broad belt, so as to make the begin-
ning of a forest, where the winds are now too severe for vegetation.
Another favorable stretch of country lies along the ridge of the South
Downs between Swanage and Bridport. A high barrier here would
give to a large part of Dorsetshire and southeast Wiltshire a climate
not unlike that of Bournemouth, which owes its dryness to the hilly
promontory of the Isle of Purbeck.

Portsdown Hill, which runs east and west for nearly 7 miles, and is
over 400 feet high, would be another highly favorable ridge for an
experimental wall, say 400 feet in height. The practicability of works
of this kind can hardly be questioned when we hear of structures like
the reservoir embankment at Bombay, a stone barrier 118 feet thick,
over 100 feet high, and 2 miles long. A less amount of material would
have gone toward a wind wall 30 feet thick at the base, 300 feet high,
and 3 or 4 miles long.

A wall 300 or 400 feet in height and 5 or 6 miles in length, extending
348 ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH.

from near the Thames a few miles east of London in a northwest direc-
tion, would probably have the effect of stopping a considerable amount
of fog, which often moves from the Essex marshes toward the metrop-
olis. It would somewhat increase the annual rainfall on its westerly
side. A wall stretching from northwest to southeast across some of
the heaths in the neighborhood of Woking would reduce the rainfall of
northeast Surrey and of London.

The effect of a wall, like that of a perpendicular cliff, would be to
drive the impinging air vertically upward, so that the increased rain-
fall would take place near the wall and a little to leeward.

Experimental barriers might be first erected across the mouths of
valleys open toward the west or southwest, for in many such situa-
tions a wall 1 or 2 miles long and 500 or 600 feet high would cause
increased precipitation near the ocean, and a considerably drier climate
in nearly the whole of the remainder of the valley. Yor example, a
wall across the valley, a little to the north of the town of Neath, would
reduce the rainfall of the Vale of Neath for a long distance, and many
of the Welsh valleys opening westward to Cardigan Bay might be
equally protected from excessive winter rains.

With regard to other countries, there are localities where a structure
a few miles long based on rocks or ridges already some hundred feet
above the sea would prove very beneficial in reducing rainfall farther
inland. In other exceptional cases, where precipitation is deficient, it
might be promoted on the windward side by similar means.

In parts of Australia, local rainfall might be appreciably increased
by raising the height of ridges. Wherever water is scarce and valu-
abie and the climatic conditions favorable, experimental barriers would
give interesting results.

Some American cities are very liable to be attacked and partially
destroyed by violent tornadoes or whirlwinds. These storms usually
proceed from about the same direction, and it might possibly be an
experiment worth making to set up a wall, say 300 feet high and 2 miles
long, on the dangerous quarter, with the object of breaking their force.
The clearing of forests seems to favor the development and progress
of American tornadoes by allowing the surface of the earth to become
more highly heated and by reducing friction, for they are caused
chiefly by the breaking of unstable equilibrium when the lowest strata
are highly heated and a cold current prevails within a few miles of the
earth’s surface,
THE AIR OF TOWNS.

By Dr. J. B. COHEN.

[These Lectures were submitted by Dr. J. B. Cohen, of Yorkshire College, Leeds,
England, in the Hodgkins Fund prize competition of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. |

LECTURE 1.—CLOSE Rooms.

Perhaps I ought first to explain my reason for selecting for these four
lectures the subject of ‘‘ Town air,” a subject which, if it can not be
characterized by the word dry, certainly does not sound attractive.
My reasons are threefold—its importance to health, a personal interest
in the subject, and a desire to arouse the same interest in others.

I wish that I could paint for you my ideal city of Leeds—a smokeless
atmosphere through which the sun, when he did shine, would shine with
his full brilliancy, wide streets interrupted by open spaces with green
turf, trees, and flower beds, and a little ornamental relief to the dead
monotony of our brick walls.

Tam sure you will all agree with me that under such conditions our
moraland physical well-being as a community would be vastly improved.
‘There are two great wants,” writes Miss Octavia Hill, ‘‘ in the life of
the poor of our large towns, which ought to be realized more than they
are—the want of space and the want of beauty.”

You may at once stamp these views as Utopian. Speaking for myself,
I have every expectation of seeing them realized. I think that if people
can only be convinced of a possibility it is not a long step to its becom-
ing a reality. I think I shall have no difficulty in convincing you of
the possibility. Although everyone is quite aware that town air is a
different article from fresh country air, it excites very little notice
unless, aS sometimes happens, we are brought face to face with it dur-
ing foggy weather when the dirt and impurities accumulate under a
thick layer of mist. The reason, I think, is to be found in the fact that
air 1s invisible.

‘Seeing is believing” is a common saying, and I suppose the reverse
is true.

How long has it taken civilized communities to recognize the evil
effects of bad water? Clear, sparkling water may contain the germs

349

350 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

of disease, yet we see nothing of them. The death roll of all our bat-
tlefields probably does not number so many victims as that of contam-
inated water. What is the result? An unlimited quantity of pure
water is regarded as the first essential to health. We go far afield for
it. Manchester, at a cost of £3,000,000, drinks the water from the
rivulets of Cumberland. Liverpool pays a high price for the water of
the Welsh hills.

As regards the air we breathe, we stand much in the same relation
as Mohammed to the mountain. As we can not bring pure air to the
town, we go and seek it in the country or by the sea; that is, those of
us who can afford it.

But there are many Mohammeds who never see the mountain. How
many there are may be judged from this fact, that according to the
registrar-general’s report, out of a population in England and Wales
of 29,001,018 on April 5, 1891, 20,802,770 persons were urban and
8,198,248 were rural, i. e., nearly three-quarters live in towns as against
about one-quarter resident in the country.

What is the effect of this town air upon the urban population ?

Where changes are occurring which are imperceptibly affecting indi-
viduals, and to the cause of which we therefore can not definitely point,
it is possible by coordinating a large number of observations to so
multiply the effect that we can arrive at a very probable estimate of it
and lay our finger on the cause.

By means of statistics from the health returns of medical officers we
can compare the health of the town with that of the country. Dr.
Tatham, medical officer for Manchester, in a life table compiled for

Manchester, has shown that ‘“‘if we take three periods, under 25 years.

of age to represent youth, the period between 25 and 65 to repre-
sent maturity, and ages above 65 to represent old age, it will be found
that males in Manchester are young for 94 per cent, mature for 87 per
cent, and old for 46 per cent as long as in England and Wales. We
are almost forced to the conclusion that in Manchester men grow oid
sooner than in the country as a whole.”

What may be said of Manchester may also be said of Leeds and
other industrial towns. This, of course, might be put down to the
strain and worry of business life; but if we compare the diseases from
which people die in town and in the country, those who have examined
the medical returns-must have been struck by the number of deaths in
towns from diseases of the respiratory organs, pneumonia, phthisis,
etc. My friend and colleague, Mr. Wager, of the Yorkshire College,
took some trouble to obtain statistics on these points in regard to
Leeds, and found that the percentage of deaths from diseases of these
organs was considerably greater in the town than in the surrounding
districts. As I prepared this lecture, the quarterly return from the
medical officer for Manchester arrived for the quarter ending Septem-
ber, 1893, and here I found that out of 400 deaths between the ages of
THE AIR OF TOWNS. 351

25 to 45 years by far the largest number (122) are due to phthisis, and
the next largest number (38) to pneumonia. This high percentage of
deaths from such diseases is characteristic of all large manufacturing
centers.

But we need not have recourse to these statistics to assure ourselves
of the beneficial effects of fresh air. We have all experienced them.
Statistics, however, emphasize the cumulative effect of imperceptible
changes—an effect which you will all admit is sufficiently serious.

There is such a thing known as cumulative poisoning. White lead, for
example, taken internally in minute quantities will in time produce the
effect of a poisonous dose. Bad air is also an example of a cumulative
poison.

According to Professor Foster, the average individual inhales 2,600
gallons of air in twenty-four hours, or about 54 pounds by weight, as
against 54 pounds of food, liquid and solid, or six times the weight of
food. If we had to buy our air at so much a pound or pay rates on it
at so much a cubic foot-or gallon, we should take good care that it was
not adulterated; for we distinguish fresh air as we do fresh butter from
the second-rate article. There is, however, an important distinction
between food and air regarded in this way. If the food we take is not
quite as nourishing or as good as it should be, the digestive process is
sufficiently adaptable to select the good and reject the bad; but the
lungs are infinitely more delicate in structure and function, and we
can not with impunity inhale a vitiated air and expect our lungs to
select the pure and reject the impure without permanent injury to our
breathing apparatus as well as to our whole body.

Before passing to the subject of ‘‘Town air,” I should like you to
grasp and keep well before you the idea that we are living at the
bottom of a great ocean of air, that we are surrounded on all sides
by matter invisible because composed of minute particles (separated by
Spaces which are big in comparison with the particles) but none the
less material.

That the air has weight was first demonstrated by Galileo about the
middie of the seventeenth century. I will repeat his experiment:

A glass globe (fig. 1), furnished with a brass stopcock is evacuated
by the air pump, the stopcock closed and the vessel then carefully coun-
terpoised. On opening the stopcock air rushes in with a hissing sound,
and the balance now sinks at the arm to which the globe is sus-
pended, thus showing that the air has weight.

Now, this invisible matter or gas is not a single gas, but a mixture of
gases—mainly two.

One of these gases is nitrogen, an inert gas, whose chief properties
are negative. It constitutes about four-fifths of the total bulk of the
air and serves to dilute the other constituent, oxygen, which is the active
part. This gas helps things to burn and supports life by consuming
waste tissue and keeping up the animal heat. In these processes the

352 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

free oxygen is removed from the air by entering into combination with
the substances which it burns or consumes.

A piece of charcoal is attached to an iron rod, which passes through
a metal plate (fig. 2). The charcoal is first heated until it begins to
glow, and is then brought into a glass jar containing oxygen. The
charcoal immediately glows with dazzling whitness by uniting with the
oxygen to form carbonic acid.

I shall have very little more to say about these two gases, but shall
now direct your attention to another gas, carbonic acid, which is always
present in the air, usually in a minute quantity. Its presence may be
most readily shown by exposing to the air some clear limewater in a
glass basin, when the surface is soon coated with a white film of ear-
bonate of lime. It is also a very heavy gas, as I can show you by the
following experiments:

In fig. 3, a represents the vessel containing the clear lime-water,
which on standing becomes covered with a white film of carbonate of
lime; ) represents the vessel containing the heavy gas, carbonic acid,
upon which the soap bubble floats. The apparatus figured at ¢ is for
generating carbonic acid. It consists of two vessels, which are con-
nected by glass tubing. The larger vessel contains marble. By pour-
ing acid down the funnel a brisk effervescence occurs, carbonic acid
being evolved, which bubbles through the second vessel containing
water to remove impurities, and is then used for filling B with gas.

A large glass beaker (fig. 4) is suspended at one arm of a balance and
carefully counterpeised. By slowly inverting another beaker contain-
ing carbonic acid above the open mouth of the suspended one, the
latter becomes filled with the heavy gas and descends.

The following table gives the volumes of the different gases in pure
air in 100 volumes and also the total weight of these gases:

turbid indicated the presence of carbonic acid.) It is given off from the
breath, as the following experiment will show:

By filling a bell jar (fig. 5) with water and breathing air into it from
the lungs an atmosphere is obtained within the jar which readily extin-
guishes a taper, indicating the large percentage (about 5 per cent) of
carbonic acid in the breath.

Two bottles (fig. 6), each provided with a double neck, are so con-
nected that air may be drawn into the Iungs through the liquid
contained in A and expelled through the liquid in B without removing
the tube from the mouth. If clear limewater is introduced into these
two vessels, that contained in B will very shortly become turbid, indi-
cating the presence of carbonic acid in the lungs, whilst A remains clear.

Carbonic acid is produced by fermentation and the decay, which is
another form of fermentation, of animal and vegetable substances.

A solution of grape sugar is introduced into a flask (fig. 7), together
with a quantity of brewers’ yeast. The flask is provided with a cork
through which a bent tube passes. The longer limb dips into a test
glass containing limewater. If the flask is allowed to stand at the
ordinary temperature, the liquid begins-to froth and bubbles of car-
bonie acid rise through the limewater, turning it milky. After a few
hours a sufficient quantity of alcohol will be formed to enable its
presence to be demonstrated. On bringing some of the liquid into a
flask fitted with a long glass tube and boiling it, the vapors passing
out of the tube will take fire and burn with the blue flame of burning
alcohol.

All these processes go on at the expense of the oxygen of the air,
which in time would disappear. It has been estimated that it would
require 900,000 years to consume all the oxygen in the air and convert
it into carbonic acid. Long before this, however, lite would have ceased
on the earth, for a slight increase in the amount of carbonie acid or
diminution of oxygen would render the atmosphere unfit for respiration.

We are fortunately not threatened by any such catastrophe. No
accumulation of carbonic acid can occur in the open air under natural
conditions, for although carbonic acid is a heavy gas, it rapidly
diffuses.

Two flasks (fig. 8) are connected by a long piece of narrow tube. In
the lower flask the heavy gas, carbonic acid, is introduced, and in the
upper one, the light gas, hydrogen. Owing to the property of dif-
fusion some of the heavier gas will be found after a time to have passed
into the upper flask and the lighter gas to have passed downward.

Carbonic acid therefore becomes quickly disseminated through the

accumulation of carbonic acid wherever vegetation is allowed to flour-
ish, and where the quantity of carbonic acid does not accumulate too
rapidly to be dealt with by nature in this manner.

It is therefore obvious that overcrowding, want of open spaces, and
the absence of vegetation favor the accumulation of carbonic acid.

Overcrowding has, however, been dealt with by legislation, and
where legislation steps in we may be sure that the evil is a real and
a pressing one.

Governments and municipalities have recognized fie importance of
open spaces, of streets of a certain width, of epen spaces at the backs
of houses, of a certain number of cubic feet for each inmate in lodging
houses, hospitals, workhouses, prisons, ete. .

This will help to check the accumulation of carbonie acid. But
although people are content to live in crowded and smoke-laden towns,
vegetation is not so easily persuaded to forego its natural atmosphere,
and the smoke question must be dealt with before we can stop the
deposition of soot and let in the sunlight to give the necessary vitality
to plant life, which should flourish in the very center of our big towns.
Let us see now what the evil is. Here is a table showing carbonic
acid found in different places:

The amount seems very small. Perhaps the following diagram will
represent the proportion more graphically:

The diagram (fig. 9) is divided into squares showing the proportion
of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid in the volume of air indicated
by the large square.

Although the proportion of carbonic acid in good and bad air is so
inconsiderable, we must not be led into supposing that the difference is
negligible. There are many examples known to the chemist in which

a minute quantity of impurity may produce effects apparently quite dis-
proportionate to the cause. We have it on the authority of Professor
Roberts-Austen that a difference of one-tenth per cent of carbon in
steel rails may be a very serious matter.

The steel cylinder, containing compressed oxygen, which recently
burst at the station at Bradford with such fatal effect, contained only
three-tenths per cent too much carbon—an amount, however, quite suf-
ficient to account for the mischief.

The steel dies used in the mint should strike 40,000 coins on the aver-
age, yet if the die contained one-tenth too much carbon it would not
strike 100 pieces without cracking.

Let us see what is the full effect of the difference in carbonic acid in
town and country air. If we take country air to contain 0.05 and town
air 0.04 per cent of carbonic acid, or a difference of 0.01 per cent, it will
amount to about 1 additional quart of carbonic acid inhaled during the
day, supposing we take into our lungs 2,600 gallons of air per diem.

This would weigh about 30 grains, an amount sufficient to kill ten
people if the poison were as virulent as white arsenic. Moreover, we
must remember that if we inhale 1 quart of carbonic acid more we take
in 1 quart less of life-supporting oxygen. Is carbonic acid really so pois-
onous that a quart or gallon more carbonic acid and a corresponding
amount of oxygen less would be hurtful to this extent? The answer
is“* No.” Although from experiments made by Angus Smith in an air-
tight leaden chamber, when pure carbonic acid was introduced to the
extent of 3.84 per cent, two friends suffered after a few minutes from
headache, and he himself soon felt great discomfort, it is known that
workers in soda-water factories, where the amount of carbonic acid in
the air reaches 0.1 per cent, are not injuriously affected. Yet our senses
detect the difference between town and country air. We can perceive
the difference between Manchester town air and that of the outskirts—
a difference of only 0.0034 per cent—or between the air of the streets
and the parks of London, which amounts to 0.004 per cent. Why can
we detect these minute differences? Because, as Angus Smith says,
carbonic acid always comes in bad company. It is its bad companions
that affect us. It is the sulphurous acid, which accompanies burning
coal and gas; it is the organic poison which accompanies the exhala-
tions from the body.

The latter is the subject to which I now wish to direct your attention.

It is obviously very important to determine minute differences of car-
bonic acid in the air so that we may guard against the least increase
in carbonic acid in the atmosphere. As little as 0.004 per cent can be
detected by our senses, as we have seen, and a difference of 0.02 per cent
is not pleasant when caused by want of ventilation. Angus Smith says:
“We all avoid an atmosphere of 0.1 per cent in a crowded room, and the
experience of civilized men is that it is not only odious, but unwhole-
Some. When people speak of good ventilation in dwelling houses they

356 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

mean, without knowing it, air with less than 0.07 per cent of carbonic
acid. We must not conclude that because the quantity of carbonic
acid is small, the effect is small. The conclusion is rather that minute
changes in the amount of this acid are indications of occurrences of the
highest importance.”

What is the substance which accompanies the breath ?

Dr. Ransome says that “the aqueous vapor arising from the breath
and from the general surface of the body contains a minute proportion
of animal refuse matter which has been proved by actual experiment to
be adeadly poison. It is this substance which gives the peculiar close,
unpleasant smell which is perceived on leaving the fresh air and enter-
ing a confined space occupied by human beings and other animals, and
air thus charged has been fully proved to be the great cause of scrofu-
lous or tubercular diseases, and it is the home and nourisher of these
subtle microscopic forms of life that have lately become so well known
under the title of germs of disease or microzymes. It 1s probably the
source of a large part of that increase of mortality that seems inevitably
to follow the crowding together of the inhabitants of towns.” These
views are shared by such eminent men as Dr. Foster, Prof. Du Bois-
Raymond, Dr. Carpenter, Sir Douglas Galton, and others.

But in what manner has the above statement been put to the proof?

I desire to refer to a very ingenious experiment which has been ear-
ried out by the French physiologist Brown-Séquard.

Fig. 10 repiesents diagramatically an experiment similar to that of
Brown-Séquard. Four bell jars are connected by glass tubes in such
a way that by aspirating air through the open tube connected with
the fourth bell jar a current of air is made to travel through the series
in the direction indicated by the arrows. Between the third and fourth
bell jars a vessel is inserted containing strong sulphuric acid, which
removes the organic matter from the air passing into the last bell jar.
By confining mice in these jars, the first mouse will get the fresh air,
the second will breathe air vitiated by the first, and so on, the last
mouse breathing the whole of the carbonic acid given off from the
lungs of the first three. In this experiment the third mouse would
die, but not the fourth, proving that it is the organie poison rather
than the carbonic acid in bad air that produces the most serious
effects.

Whatever may be the exact nature of this poison, of which little more
than its mere existence is known, there can be little doubt that the
amount in town air, indicated by 0.001 per cent, produces a cumulative
effect upon our vitality, which makes us long for fresh country air, and
which no doubt enhances the depression induced by the gloom of our
city surroundings.

Health like charity begins at home, and we should therefore start by
studying the conditions under which we live in our own dwellings.

Let us consider the case of a person sitting in aroom and consuming
a THE AIR OF TOWNS. 357

2,600 gallons of air in twenty-four hours, or breathing out 16 cubic feet
an hour of air containing 5 per cent of carbonic acid. For the air to
remain fairly fresh the amount of carbonic acid should not rise above
0.06 per cent; that is to say, the amount of carbonic acid should not
imcrease more than 0.02 per cent, supposing the air to contain originally
0.04 per cent. How much fresh air will be needed per hour? This may
a x 16=4,000 cubic feet.

Air can not be renewed more than three or four times per hour with-
out producing a perceptible current or, as we should say, causing a draft.
It therefore follows that each individual should be allotted at least
4000

be caleulated as follows:

= 1000 cubic feet of air space. This renewal of air in closed places
if ]

constitutes a branch of study termed ventilation. I have not time to
discuss fully this important subject. A whole course of lectures might
be delivered uponit. All that [ can doin the short time at my disposal is
to indicate the principles which underly it. The replacement of vitiated
air by fresh air without creating draft is the basis of good ventilation.

This necessitates a flow of air. This flow of air may be produced by
mechanical meanus—a fan or pump driving in air, exhausting the bad,
or doing both simultaneously—or, more frequently in dwelling houses,
by the natural currents produced by hot air.

When air becomes warm it expands. <A certain bulk of this air com-
pared with an equal bulk of the original air will be lighter. The warm
air therefore ascends, colder air replaces it, and a flow of air is thereby
produced.

To show that warm air ascends, a large glass globe open at the top
and bottom is supported upon blocks (fig. 11). On introducing a Bun-
sen burner at the lower opening a strong upward current of air is pro-
duced, which causes a spiral of paper pivoted to the horizontal rod to
revolve rapidly. Strips of tissue paper gummed around the edge of
the top opening form vertical streamers, also indicating the presence
of an air current. ‘Toy fire balloons of tissue paper illustrate this prop-
erty of heated air exceedingly well.

It is for this reason that the warm air, which includes the expired
air, finds its way toward the top of aroom. It is for this reason also
that an open fireplace with a good chimney produces a current of air,
which rushes up the chimney to the extent of 150 to 300 cubic feet per
minute. These two effects may be combined to draw off the vitiated
air by introducing an opening into the chimney near the ceiling. But
although by this means bad air is withdrawn and fresh air enters, the
method of ventilation can not be considered wholly satisfactory. In
my dining room with a good fire burning, | have found that the air

passes up the chimney at the rate of 240 cubic feet a minute with the
_ door open, and 200 cubic feet a minute with the door closed. In
_ the first case the fresh air comes mainly through the open door; in the

358 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

second, it finds its way through the chinks round the door or between
the window sashes. It naturally follows that where cold air is enter-
ing through small inlets to supply 200 cubic feet a minute, drafts are
frequently experienced by persons in the room, unless mechanical con-
trivances are arranged for directing the cold air to the top of the room.

It follows that ventilation produced by the currents set up by warm
air is closely connected with the methods of warming aroom. Regarded
from this point of view, the open fireplace is the reverse of economical.
The whole of the heating is here produced by radiation; that is, by heat
passing from the fireplace to the walls, ceiling, and floor, which in turn
transfer their warmth to the air in contact with them, and this repre-
sents a small fraction of the heat passing up the chimney.

A more economical method is to warm the air of rooms by means of
steam or hot-water pipes; but in this case there is no natural ventila-
tion, no fresh air is introduced as with the open fireplace, and special
means must be provided to supply the defect.

Another method is to supply a house with fresh air, which has been
slightly warmed by passing it around a stove fixed in the basement or
out of doors. * In this ease, if a suitable exit is provided to permit the
vitiated air to escape, a constant current.of fresh air is set up, which
may effect the whole heating and ventilation of an ordinary dwelling
house at a comparatively small cost for fuel. In large buildings, such
as warehouses and factories, the same result is effected by pumping in
at the basement fresh air, warmed by passing through a stove and mixed
in any desired proportion with cold air and drawing off the vitiated
air by means of an exhaust fan placed at the top of the building.
These principles may be demonstrated by the following experiments:

The illustration (fig. 12) represents a shallow, air-tight box with a
glass front. Three small circular holes are bored along one side equi-
distant and one at the bottom of the opposite side. In A this hole is
fitted with a glass T piece, the top vertical end of which passes through
a cork of a lamp chimney. Through the same cork a gas burner is
fitted. The box is filled with a dense fog by blowing in ammonium
chloride fumes and is brightly illuminated by a lantern. When the gas
jet in the chimney is burning, one of the circular holes is opened to
the air, and the lower vertical end of the T piece closed, we have on
a small scale the conditions of ventilation in a room with an open fire-
place. The air enters through one or all of the circular holes, appearing
in the fog like black smoke, and the white fumes-are observed to issue
from the top of the lamp chimney. The other experiment figured at
B is to illustrate heating and ventilation by warm air. Air enters the
box through the bent pipe, which is heated bya burner. The warm air,
which appears at the top of the foggy chamber as a dark cloud, grad-
ually displaces the fog, which is driven out at the lower left-hand aper-
ture and the chamber is thus filled with warm fresh air.

The importance of placing within the reach of every person a method
of determining quickly and accurately the amount of carbonic acid in
the air has induced me to devise a process, a description of which will
be found in the appendix.

LECTURE 2,—SMOKE.

Smoke is solid matter given off during burning. Gunpowder smoke
is largely mineral salts and so is tobacco smoke. Coal smoke is soot—
that is mainly what chemists call carbon. All the common inflammable
substances, coal, wood, paraffin, petroleum, benzine, as well as coal gas,
contain carbon and in luminous flames the carbon can readily be shown
as soot. I have only to bring this white plate into the candle flame
and we have as you see at once a deposit of soot. This soot in the
flame is white hot and gives to the flame its luminosity. The lumi-
nosity imparted by solid matter to a nonluminous flame may be readily
demonstrated.

Here is a blow pipe (fig. 13), fed with coal gas and oxygen, which
gives as you see a nonluminous flame hke burning spirits of wine, but
it is nevertheless a very hot one, for as soon as I introduce a lump of
infusible material, like quicklime, the latter becomes in a moment
white hot and brilliantly luminous.

But an ordinary luminous flame is not necessarily a smoky one,
because the soot burns when it reaches the outside of the flame and
comes into contact with the air.

Why is it, then, that luminous flames are sometimes smoky and some-
times not? Coal and wood, benzine, paraffin, turpentine, and often
tallow and wax candles burn and give off soot. It is because there is
too little air where the flame is hottest. The soot as it passes up gets
cool and when it reaches a new air supply it is too cold to take fire.
It is this that makes a candle, with a wick that requires snuffing, give
a smoky flame, because with the long wick it is supplying more
combustible to the flame than the surrounding air can burn.

An ordinary oil lamp smokes until the chimney is put on. Then the
draft up the chimney is increased, more airis supplied, the flame gets
hotter and therefore brighter, and the soot is burned up.

Here is a smoky turpentine flame. By blowing oxygen through the
center a brilliant nonsmoky flame is produced.

In a, fig. 14, we have a section of the apparatus. It consists of a
metal tube, furnished at the top with a hollow metal rim, which is filled
with cotton wool soaked in turpentine; b represents the smoky tur-
pentine flame and ¢ the flame after admission of oxygen.

Soot or coal smoke is then an inflammable part of the fuel and where
soot is allowed to escape, the fuel is lost. If, then, we not only feed the
flame with more air, but at the same time make the soot hot the smoke
is consumed. These are the two simple principles of smoke prevention.
Let me show you this by an experiment with a model furnace, flue, and
chimney (fig. 15). This consists of a straight metal pipe open at both
ends and perforated with air holes near the lower end. A bent metal
arm is fixed on by a T piece and represents the flue. The furnace is
represented by a turpentine lamp, which burns inside the sheet-iron

360 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

case. Volumes of smoke issue from the top of the chimney until a
Bunsen flame is introduced within the OWT end of the chimney, when
the smoke suddenly ceases.

Various forms of grates and furnaces have been proposed for pre-
venting smoke; some utilize more of the heat, and so reduce the cen-
sumption of coal; others, by various devices of air inlets at certain
times of firing and at special points of the grate, burn up the smoke
before it passes to the flue.

I do not intend, for I do not feel competent, to explain the advantages
or disadvantages of the large variety of smoke-preventing appliances
now before the public. A great deal has been written on the subject
by competent persons, and anyone who wishes for information may
very easily procure it.t

What are the effects of smoke? Before attacking this question, we
ought to consider the extent of the evil.

Iam making determinations, which are now in progress, and though
still very incomplete I am able to give an approximate estimate of the
amount of solid matter in the air of Leeds which is mainly due to
smoke. There is daily sent into the air of Leeds 20 tons of soot, of which
one-half ton falls, and of that one-half ton, 20 to 25 pounds stick; that
is, are not removable by rain. How have these figures been arrived
at? Ihave found that in the town 100 cubic feet of air contain on
the average over 1 milligram of solid matter which is mainly due to
smoke. If, now, we take the most thickly populated area of the city as
covering 4 square miles, and supposing the sooty atmosphere to pene-
trate to a height of 306 feet, the amount of solid matter will be about
800 pounds, constantly floating over these 4 square miles. If, further,
we assume that the air of the town is renewed from ten to fifty times in
twelve hours, according to the strength of the wind (and it is nearer
the latter than the former number, as I will show in a moment), this
will mean, taking the higher number, rather under 20 tons of smoke
delivered to the atmosphere during the working day. Why dol take
fifty as the frequency of atmospheric renewal? The difference in the
amount of carbonic acid between country air and town air such as is
found on the average in industrial centers like Glasgow and Manches-
ter, and we may also include Leeds, is 0.01 per cent. There are at least
4,000 tons of coal burnt in Leeds every twenty-four hours, yielding
12,000 tons of carbonic acid, and in addition there are 300 tons given
off from the lungs of the inhabitants, i. e., in all, 12,300 tons. If we
keep to the same area of 4 square miles and KG same height of 300

feet, which we took as the smoke-infected area, the amount of carbonic
acid would be about 1 per cent higher in twenty-four hours, or would
have to be renewed fifty times in twelve hours to keep down the aver-
age amount of carbonic acid to 0.04 per cent.

Let us attack the problem in another way. In Professor Roberts-
Austen’s report on the London smoke-abatement exhibition a large
number of analyses are given, from which it is easy to calculate the
weight of smoke from coal burnt in house fires. These analyses refer
to different kinds of smoke-preventing domestic fire grates burning
different kinds of coal. According to these results about 5 per cent of
the coal burnt gets into the air. Mr. Russell, of the Yorkshire Col-
lege, and myself experimented in the same direction and arrived inde-
pendently at the same conclusion, without having referred to the
results of Roberts-Austen’s analyses.

If we take 100,000 tons as the house consumption of coal in the year
for Leeds, this is equivalent to about 11 tons in twenty-four hours
throughout the year. If we allow an equal amount for factory chimneys,
this brings it to 22 tons in twenty-four hours. Or if we follow Scheurer-
Kestner and take one-half to three-fourths per cent as the amount of
coal given off as smoke from boiler furnaces, then if Leeds consumes
1,500,000 tons of coal a year, or 4,000 tons a day, one-half per cent upon
this is equivalent to 20 tons a day. So you see that whichever way
we work our calculation we can not get below 20 tons of smoke a day,
and J consider that this figure represents a minimum quantity rather
than the true average.

And now as to the amount that falls. The winter before last snow
fell on January 7. A sample covering 1 square yard was carefully
removed from a gravestone in the parish churchyard a short time after
the fall ceased.. The snow was melted and analyzed. Fresh samples
were taken and analyzed on the following three days. They contained
a variety of things in solution—ammonium sulphate, sulphate of lime,
and free sulphuric acid, all mainly derived from coal. We need not
trouble ourselves about these at present, although we can not mask the
injury which this corrosive acid produces upon vegetation and the stone
and brick work of our buildings.

It is the solid matter which now concerns us.

Here are some of the samples (fig. 16): A was collected on the first
day, B on the second, C on the third, and D on the fourth. The accu-
mulation of soot is evident from the depth of color.

The weight of solid matter carried down, as determined from the first
sample, was equivalent to 16 hundredweight on the square mile. The
additional weight of soot which accumulated each day was equivalent
to 4 hundredweight on the square mile; or, if we take a smaller quantity
aS an average over the 4 square miles of the city, we arrive at the daily
smoke fall of about one-half ton.

It is impossible to say what proportion of the soot in the air, during
the snowfall, the 16 hundredweight represents, but it all points in one

q
362 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

direction, that the waste of fuel in the form of unburnt coal passing
into the air is prodigious. Estimated for the whole country, it would
mean not an insignificant item of loss to the nation.

Before we can understand the effects of smoke we must learn its
composition. I have analyzed two samples, one of which was deposited
on the orchid houses at Chelsea during fog, and the other was obtained
from my chimney sweep. They contained respectively 14 and 15 per
cent of a nasty, sticky oil. Were the soot pure carbon it would be
comparatively harmless. It would possess no smell, it would not adhere
to anything, and the first fall of rain would wash it away. Unfortu-
nately, this is not the case. Wherever the soot alights a great part of
it sticks, and no amount of rain water will remove it. That is why our
buildings become permanently black and foliage is discolored.

In order to demonstrate to you the effects of this sticky material
in the soot, I analyzed the deposit on three glass plates, 1 foot square,
which have been stationed in different spots—one at Pool (about 9
miles from the center of Leeds), one on the roof of the Yorkshire
College (about 1 mile from Leeds), and one on the roof of the Philo-
sophical Hall (in the town)—all being removed from the immediate
neighborhood of chimneys. This is the appearance (fig. 17) which
two plates present after a years’ exposure, one in the country and the
other in town. A remained clean and transparent, whereas B was
quite opaque.

A series of experiments of this nature extending over many months,
in which the deposit after washing was weighed, showed that the
deposit on the Philosophical Hall plate was twenty-four times and on
the Yorkshire College plate ten times that on the Pool plate, the latter
being insignificant in quantity.

The effect of breathing such a filthy atmosphere can only be indi-
rectly gauged. That it plays no insignificant part, by clogging the air
passages, in bringing about the high mortality from respiratory diseases,
So conspicuous in all industrial towns, can not for a moment be doubted.
Its fatal effects upon vegetation are obvious. The green leaf of the
plant is its perspiring organ, and the leaf is provided with little pores—
the stomata. When these get clogged with svot the plant dies, just as
a human being would if the pores of his skin were closed by a layer of
varnish. But the soot in the air does more than this. The plant
derives the principal material for its growth from the carbonic acid in
the air. By the aid of the green coloring matter, the chlorophyll, which
is found in the leaf or stem, the carbonic acid of the air is decomposed,
the oxygen being restored to the atmosphere and the carbon retained
by the plant. This process only occurs vigorously in sunlight. What,
then, must be the effect of the black deposit upon the leaf in shutting
out that light, and what must be the effect of the smoke-laden air in
preventing the passage of the sun’s rays?

Here are photographs of two leaves gathered near the town (fig.
13). From half of each the deposit of soot has been wiped off and the
THE AIR OF TOWNS. 363

green color then bleached, without disturbing the sooty deposit on the
other half.

The diminished amount of sunlight received in the town of Leeds
may be gathered from the simultaneous records taken at the Philo-
sophical Halland at Adel (4 miles from the city). Inthe year 1892, there
was 43 per cent, and in 1893, 30 per cent more sunshine at Adel than
in Leeds. This is the record of hours of sunshine, but not of its inten-
sity. The latter, had it been recorded, would probably have shown a
still greater difference.! I said that the snow in the parish churchyard
contained acid—sulphurie acid. This acid is, like soot, derived from
coal, for it is never found in the country. The sulphur in the coal,
which is present to the extent of from 1 to 3 percent, burns, and a por-
tion passes up the chimney as sulphurous acid, and then into the open
air. Itis this sulphurous acid which imparts to town fog its choky
and irritating effects. In the open air it is rapidly converted into the
much more corrosive substance—sulphuric acid, which nearly always
accompanies soot, and it is found with soot on leaves, and probably
promotes their early withering near towns. Moreover, it corrodes the
mortar and stone work of our buildings.

The following table, prepared by the Manchester air analysis com-
mittee, gives the analyses of deposits upon leaves gathered in and near
the city. The places are arranged in the order as we pass from the
outskirts to the center of the town:

It has been said that however much you may do away with smoke,
you will never remove this acid; it will still pass into the air. Quite
true; but to anyone who advances that as an excuse for the smoke
maker, I would say this: Soot is an oily substance not wetted by water.
The acid, therefore, attached to it is not washed away by rain so rapidly
as it certainly would be, if it were not in contact with this film of oily
matter. Although sulphurous and sulphuric acids are injurious to
plants, I do not believe the quantity given off from our chimneys would
prove nearly so hurtful as it is now in company with soot.

There are real or imaginary difficulties in the way of stopping smoke
from house fires, yet I firmly believe that before another generation has

passed away people will look back upon the hideous heap of black stones
stowed away in an ornamental box in every dwelling room as we now
contemplate the tinder box or the tallow candle. But if domestic chim-
neys are responsible for half, or even more than half the smoke, it is no
reason why we should suffer from the other half if it can be removed,
Let me now direct your attention to the legal aspect of the question.
It may be said that this hes beyond the province of the scientific man,
but my conscience would not be satisfied if I did not link to a subject,
which I regard as of serious importance, the knowledge of how the
evil may be coinpassed. Legislation in regard to smoke abatement is
to my mind as simple as it is just.

The Public Health Act, 1875, part 1, subsection 7, states:

‘“Kor the purposes of this act, any fireplace or furnace which does
not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the com-
bustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam,
or in any mill, factory, dyehouse, brewery, bakehouse, or gas work, or
in any manufacturing or trade process whatever, shall be deemed to
be a nuisance, and hable to be dealt with summarily in the manner
provided by this act.”

This is in regard to furnaces. In respect of chimneys, the second part
of subsection 7 of section 91 says:

“For the purposes of this act any chimney, not being the chimney of
a private dwelling house, which emits black smoke in such quantities
as to be a nuisance, shall be deemed a nuisance, and liable,” ete.

Put briefly, the law is this: Every factory-chimney owner who is
not using the best practicable means for preventing smoke, whether the
quantity is large or small, is acting contrary to the law.

Before the alkali act existed, wherever alkali makers erected their
plant they were like plague spots; vegetation died for miles around,
making the neighborhood of the works a bare wilderness like the dis-
trict of St. Helens is to this day. The alkali act did not stop these
works. It simply prescribed that the best practicable means should
be adopted to prevent the escape of acid, and inspectors were appointed
to see how far this could be carried out. What happened? Before
long a most efficient method was found to condense the acid fumes.
The acid turned out to be a profitable commercial article, and now
the amount of acid escaping into the air is invariably under the
minimum quantity—a very minute amount—prescribed by the present
act of Parliament.

Government has acted with equal wisdom in regard to factory chim-
neys. No particular form of furnace is prescribed, but only the best
practicable means for preventing smoke.

If, then, a manufacturer is sending out not black smoke, but one par-
ticle of soot—

‘‘Be it so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance
As the division of the twentieth part

Of one poor seruvle; nay, if the seale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,”

which might by other and better means be prevented, he violates the
law.

The second part of the act relating to chimneys should be unneces-
sary if the first were properly carried out. That itis necessary, arises
from the fact that convictions are almost impossible, because the smoke
maker may always urge in his defeuse that his furnace is the best he
can procure for the purpose, which statement the magistrate is usually
willing to accept.

Could it be shown that the complete consumption of smoke would be
to the advantage of the smoke maker, as it was in the case of the alkali
maker, factory chimneys would soon cease to smoke. Before I go fur-
ther, I wish to establish a claim to understand the smoke maker and
to sympathize to some extent with him. I was for a few years assistant
manager in a large chemical works. If there 1s an industry where
excuse may be found for smoke it is in a chemical works. Of the five
boilers on the works some were used for machinery, others for distilling
purposes. Sometimes during the day the boilers were working at low
pressure, at other times they had to deliver the maximum amount of
steam. Then there were a large number of small furnaces for special
products, and here, again, the firing was irregular from the necessity of
the case. In addition to this, noxious vapor had to be treated before
the gases escaped into the chimney. One could scarcely expect that
with all this intermittent firing, the chimney should make no smoke.
Much more might be urged on the part of smelting works, which
have even greater difficulties to encounter in the way of fume and the
nonobstruction of draft. Yet no works are exempt from the act, and
the best practicable means should be enforced everywhere.

Now, although I think I am able to take a fair view of the manufac-
turer’s case, my sympathies, I confess, are with the workingman. No
doubt some of these men, the firemen, are directly responsible for
much unnecessary smoke. This has often been advanced as an excuse
for the manufacturer. I do not think it is a legitimate one. A manu-
facturer ought to know and appreciate better than his workmen the
evils of smoke, and should exercise the authority he possesses to
enforce his more enlightened ideas. It is certainly the workman who
bears the brunt of the polluted atmosphere. I lived for a time near
the works I have described, right in the heart of a manufacturing dis-
trict. Of the character of the district you may form some idea from
the fact that within almost a stone’s throw of my door were three tar
works, two other chemical works, an iron foundry, a fire-brick works, a
colliery, and an alkali works. Opposite my lodging was a row of cot-
tages similar to the row in which I lived and behind it, like a great
seatfold, rose the winding gear of the colliery. At the back of the
house was the yard of a tar works with its desolate, black beds of pitch,
and beyond a mountain of alkali waste, sending forth day and night its
fetid odor of sulphuretted hydrogen. This smell, combined with the
366 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

vapors of pitch, which was run out in the early morning, was sometimes
wafted into my bedroom and would awaken me with an indescribable
feeling of nausea. Fill up the scene with a forest of smoky chimneys,
begrimed wails, screeching steam whistles, and the steady rumble of
strings of coal carts, and you have a picture which represents the not
unusual surroundings of the workingman in a manufacturing district.
There he lives, buried in one great, blank mass of ugliness, neither
vestige of green around his dwelling nor even an untainted sky above
his head.

TI do not think that in passing through such a spot it is possible to
imagine the life that belongs to these surroundings. It certainly made
an impression upon me, which I never previously realized and which I
shall not readily forget. Perhaps not the least melancholy side to this
picture is the reference, which Mr. Acland made to it in a recent speech:
‘“‘All those who are making a careful study of the condition of our towns
were perfectly aware of this fact, that a great deal of the work in the
towns, which necessitated strong and healthy men, especially in Lon-
don, was done by those who had been brought up in country homes, and
not in those of the towns.” However, I have no wish to appeal to any
sentimental feeling. Political economy has nothing in common with it,
we are told, and ‘ business is business,” which I suppose means the same
thing. I have pointed out that some few works have to fire their fur-
naces intermittently and some smoke or fume may be unavoidable.
This does not apply to the large majority of steam users, who require a
fairly steady steam pressure throughout the day. Let us see what is
the opinion of persons who have earefully studied the question.

The Sheffield Smoke Abatement Association subcommittee, after a
careful experimental inquiry, state that “it is certain that smoke may
be almost entirely and completely prevented from steam-boiler chim-
neys.” Deputations from the corporation of Bolton, Rochdale, Black-
burn, Bury, Oldham, Middleton, and many iocal boards, made a round
of visits to smokeless works, and the corporation of Rochdale passed a
resolution that there was to be found in the market apparatus, by which
coal could be burnt for trade purposes economically and smokelessly.
A special subcommittee of the Blackburn corporation passed a resolu-
tion, stating that “‘they are convinced that the smoke nuisance in
Blackburn can be for all practical purposes done away with by the
application of these coking machines, and that it is of advantage to
the steam users to use them; and they are further of opinion that no
hardship will be inflicted upon steam users if the law respecting nui-
sance from smoke is strictly enforced.” The larger boroughs named
are now all prosecuting.

From the following list of works using smokeless appliances, compiled
by Mr. Herbert Fletcher in 1888, it is interesting to note the great variety
of industries represented. To this list must be added, further, 28 firms
representing 174 boilers since adapted with smokeless appliances.

There is only one conclusion to be drawn from this, that the majority
of smoke makers are acting in violation of the law. The smoke banners
which they fly from their chimney tops are the black flags of piracy.
They are pirating the pure air, which is the property of everyone.

Here is a scene (fig. 19) which may be observed any hour of the day
in Leeds. |

What remedy, then, should I propose? I would have a government,
368 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

not a municipal, smoke inspector, a scientific man of wide practical
experience, like our alkali inspectors—the offices in fact might be com-
bined. In the matter of smoke abatement, the local authority and
juspector are useless. I am not speaking specially of Leeds, for in
nearly every town where a strong desire has been shown to abate
smoke, the local authority, which had the power, has usually done
nothing. ‘The ratepayers’ representatives are either smoke makers or
have smokemaking friends, and the municipal smoke inspector is, as
a rule, not equal to the task.

The relation of a municipal to a government smoke inspector might
be compared to that of a sympathetic friend and the family doctor.
You have a bad headache and feel ili and your good-hearted friend
calls in. After making inquiries, he suggests various remedies as
certain cures for your ailment. You say you have tried everything
under the sun, but you are no better. Then comes the family doc-
tor. ‘Hello!” says he; ‘I see what is wrong; we'll soon put you all
right.”

I will read you the deliberate utterance on this subject of Her Maj-
esty’s ex-chief alkali inspector, Mr. A. E. Fletcher, which ought to
carry weight:

‘““There are difficulties in making any change. Masters will not take
the trouble to alter their furnaces, nor will the men alter their method
of stoking the fires unless they are compelled. The numberless alter-
ations made in the construction and conduct of chemical works during
the last twenty years would never have been carried out but for the
pressure brought on the manufacturers by means of the alkali act.
So it will be with the smoke nuisance. Men are too idle or too much
occupied to move in such a matter until pressure from outside is applied.

The moral pressure must come from the public, and it should be made
some one’s business to see that the law regarding it is put in force.”

This question is a workingman’s question. He is or should be most
interested init. His health, his home, and his surroundings are infected
by the smoke plague far more than those of his wealthier neighbors.

I believe that if the employer were obliged to put in an efficient
smoke-preventing appliance, of which there are several in the market,
he would reap advantages in two ways. He would probably econo-
mize in fuel and the health of his workmen would be improved. But,
as the alkali inspector says, the manufacturer will not change his
method until he is obliged, and the moral pressure must come from the
public.

May it before long be said of Leeds not oly of the morning, but of
all and every day,

“This city now doth like a garment wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare
Ships, towers, domes, theaters, and temples lie

Open unto the fields and to the sky
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.”

LECTURE 3.—TowNn [oa.

Before discussing the nature and effects of town fog, we will begin,
as in the first lecture in the case of carbonic acid, by seeking for its
origin.

Town fog is mist made white by Nature and painted any tint from
yellow to black by her children; born of the air of particles of pure
and transparent water, itis contaminated by man with every imaginable
abomination. That is town fog. How does this mist arise? It is
water vapor or steam always present in the air in varying quantities,
which by a fall of temperature suddenly appears either as mist or rain,
snow, hail, or dew, according to the extent and rapidity of cooling and
the amount of water vapor present in the air at the time. The follow-
ing experiments will make this evident:

A little ether is placed in this bright silvered cup (fig. 20); on
rapidly evaporating the ether by blowing air through it by means of a
hand bellows the temperature is lowered, and the bright surface soon
becomes dimmed with a deposit of moisture from the air.

If, on the other hand, I bring a flame under the jet of steam (fig,

_ 21), which is now visible through partial condensation in the form of
mist, i. e., fine water drops, the mist suddenly vanishes, for the warmer

air can now take up the water in its invisible form as vapor. When I

remove the flame the mist again appears.

There is one interesting and curious fact about the formation of fine
particles of mist or the larger particles we call rain drops or dew—that
the starting point, the nucleus, of each of these particles of water is a
speck of dust, a speck so minute that it is generally invisible to the
naked eye. Without dust there is no mist or rain or dew. It is solid
matter which is the starting point for the deposition of moisture.
What would happen if air free from dust were saturated with moisture
and the temperature fell? Water would be deposited, but only on solid
objects. It would deposit on the ground and on our buildings. It
would stream down the walls of our houses and soak the surface of the
earth. Every solid thing out of doors would be wet, but no mist would
appear and no rain would fall.

Mist is the offspring of vapor and dust. What is the character and
quantity of this dust? We know that it exists. We know that it is
very plentiful in our houses. As far as we know, it exists everywhere;
but of course the quantity varies and varies enormously, as we shall
presentiy see.

Here is a slide (fig. 22) which shows some of the things composing

_ the dust of a dwelling room highly magnified.

We find in it particles of soot, crystals, fibers, vegetable cells, spores
and pollen grains, starch grains.and meteoric iron, the remains of insect
life, and living germs. Of the character of this dust, I shall have more
_ tosayin my next lecture. Much of itis so fine that it is invisible under

sm 95——24

370 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

ordinary circumstances. Itis only when a beam of iight in a darkened
place, a ray of sunlight in a room, a street lamp on a dark night, illu-
minate these little particles so that they stand out against a darker
background that we see them—the so-called motes dancing in the beam.
It is, in fact, these little particles which make the beam of light. With-
out the particles the path of the beam would be invisible. The path of
light from a luminous body without solid matter to obstruct and reflect
it is absolute and unqualified darkness. Here, if I pass a strong beam
of light from an electric are lamp (fig. 23) through the side windows in
this wooden box free from dust the beam is cut out where it enters the
box and reappears on the other side, where the light emerges.

We can learn something more from this experiment. The dust is
mainly organic; that is, the product, living or dead, of animal and plant
life, living germs or dead spores or animal and vegetable refuse matter ;
for if I now bring a red-hot poker or a Bunsen flame beneath the beam,
black smoke appears to rise. The black smoke merely indicates the
absence of dust particles where they are burnt up by contact with the
source of heat. I will now perform a third instructive experiment to
show how little of the dust breathed into our lungs finds its way back
into the air; for the air passing out of the lungs cuts a hole in the beam,
showing the absence of dust in the breath. These interesting experi-
ments were first devised by the late Professor Tyndall.

I take an ordinary lamp chimney (fig. 24), at the bottom of which
a bent tube passes through a cork. By breathing out air from the lungs
at the constricted part of the beam, the beam is interrupted from the
absence of dust.

And now let us see how far our theory of fog is capable of illus-
tration.

I have in this large glass vessel (fig. 25) air standing over water.
The air is of course saturated with moisture. There is within the
vessel a little electric lamp, which will render more evident any
change taking place within. If I cool the air, moisture will be depos-
ited, but according to our theory it should only appear as mist, if dust
particles are present. As the air in the vessel has been standing out
of contact with the outside atmosphere for two days, we may assume
that the dust now has all subsided and dropped into the water. On
cooling the air, we should see no mist. Wecan cool the air conven-
iently and rapidly by making use of the property which air possesses
of becoming colder on sudden expansion. I have only then to exhaust
the air partially by an air pump by attaching it to this bent tube which
passes into the interior to produce the necessary conditions for the
formation of mist. Now I have done so, and you observe that no mist
appears. I can now, through this second bent tube, draw in a little air
laden with dust from the room. I will now cool the air again, and you
see at once that a fog appears within the vessel. If I pass in more dust
particles, which I am now doing, and pump out the air again, we have

avery typical and dense Leeds fog. The more dust particles there are,
the thicker the fog.

Before passing to the subject of town fog, I should like to say a word
or two about the weight and number of those dust particles which we
see play such an important part in the production of fog. The experi-
ments we have just seen have been turned to account by the distin-
guished physicist John Aitken, to determine the number of dust
particles in the air. By using a small vessel and dusty air largely
diluted with air free from dust, he has succeeded in producing an
apparatus, in which the dew drops or mist drops are sufficiently small
in number to be counted. As the apparatus is exceedingly simple
in construction, I propose to explain it. Fig. 26 represents the
instrument, which for the sake of explanation, is drawn partly in sec-
tion. It consists of a shallow circular metal box of known capacity,
furnished top and bottom with glass plates. It stands upon two eylin-
ders opening into it. One cylinder forms a small air pump and con-
tains a piston. The other is provided with three taps, the bores of
which hold a measured volume. The top tap holds the smallest and
the bottom one the largest volume. Below these there is a plug of cot-
ton wool, and at the bottom of cylinder, which is closed at the end, is
a small hole through which air can enter. Above the metal box is a
magnifying lens and below a reflector. The lower glass plate of the
box is divided into measured squares, etched on the glass. The atmos-
phere within the box is kept saturated with moisture by means of
strips of damp blotting paper. By drawing down the piston with the
taps in the position shown in the diagram, air enters the metal box
through the cotton plug, which frees it from dust. To test a sample of
air, one of the taps (determined by the amount of dust present) is
turned through aright angle so that the bore is horizontal. It now
communicates directly with the outside air as represented at a, which
shows it in section. By turning it back, the bore again communicates
with the metal box. The piston, which is at the top, is now drawn
down and the sample of dusty air is drawn up along with filtered air
into the metal box. By again raising the piston and drawing it down
rapidly, a deposition of moisture occurs, which falls in drops on the
glass squares, such as is represented on the top squares in the diagram
at b. These drops are counted and from this the number of dust parti-
- cles may be ascertained.

The following are the average number of dust particles in town and
country air taken from Aitken’s observations: Country, 8,000 to 100,000
per cubic inch; town, 1,000,000 to 50,000,000 per cubic inch. I was not
satisfied with simply exhibiting Mr. Aitken’s results, and so I borrowed
the instrument, which he kindly placed at my service, in order to find out
the character of the air in Leeds. The following results were obtained
_ on a fine day with the wind blowing from the northwest. ‘The relative
_ position of the places of observation are noted on the diagram (fig. 27).

There is one curious fact about these results, to which I would call
your attention. There are, you will observe, fewer dust particles in a
flour mill, where the air is thick with dust, than in the comparatively
clear air of the churchyard. This was a puzzle to me at first, but I think
it may be explained by the fact that the particles in the flour mill are
larger and therefore more visible. As to the size of the particles, they
may be accounted for possibly by coalescence produced by electrifica-
tion. This curious effect of coalescence of dust particles by electrification
may be easily demonstrated. We have only to connect one conductor
of an electric machine with a wire passing through the top of a bell jar
containing fumes from burning magnesium, when, on turning the
machine, a little whirlwind of particles is set up and in a moment, as
you see, all the solid matter has deposited in coarse grains round the
sides of the vessel (fig. 28).

Let us now return from this digression to the fog once more and fol-
low its life history.

With acalm atmosphere, a high barometer and a fall of temperature, a
film of water coats every little floating particle of dust, as it were, with
an overcoat to keep out the cold. A white fog slowly enshrouds the
town. Each particle of dust now heavily weighted with its unwonted
cloak of moisture has its progress impeded, hangs or falis, but does not
rise, and in its turn impedes the movement of the air. Stagnation of
the atmosphere is produced, especially as wind is light with fog. What
happens? An accumulation of products of combustion occurs, viz, of
carbonic acid, sulphurous acid, and soot, which under ordinary condi-
tions are rapidly dispersed. Our senses give us abundant evidence of
this in the case of soot and sulphurous acid. Our faces and clothes are
soon begrimed and our eyes and throats suffer from the irritating effects
of the acid. Carbonic acid shows a like increase, again illustrating
the well-known axiom that carbonic acid always comes in bad company.

The table which I now project on the screen shows the increase of

carbonic acid during fog:

You will notice that where the fog is long continued the amount of
this gas increases threefold.

I should now like to explain to you briefly the apparatus which I
_ devised for the Manchester Air Analysis Committee for making these
_ determinations of sulphurous acid.

The apparatus used for the determination of sulphurous acid in the
air consists of three parts (fig. 29). A,a long glass tube, about half
an inch in diameter, open at both ends, which is fixed horizontally so

as to project into the open air; B, a glass tower, about 30 inches high
and 14 inches in diameter, open atthe top, and drawn out into a fine jet
at the bottom. Two side tubes are fixed to the tower, one near the bot-
tom and the other on the opposite side near the top. The tower is filled
to within 1 inch of the upper sidepiece with glass beads, and into the
open top a tap funnel is inserted through a tightly fitting cork. The
lower side tube is attached to the horizontal tube; the upper one, by
means of wide india-rubber tubing, to a combined meter and aspirator, C.
This is an ordinary wet meter converted into an aspirator by attaching
toothed wheels to the revolving drum and driving the wheels by means
of a wire cord passing over a pulley and carrying a weight. <A series
of dials register the volume to the one-hundredth of a cubic foot. The
method of conducting the experiment is as follows: About 250 cubic
centimeters of a solution of hydrogen peroxide in water, containing about
1 milligram of active oxygen in each cubic centimeter, is poured into
the tap funnel, from which it is allowed to drop onto the glass beads
at the rate of about one drop a second. The liquid passes down and
out at the lower end of the tube through the jet, and falls into a flask
placed below. A drop of liquid which permanently fills the jet seals
it effectually from the entrance of air from the interior of the room.
After running through, the liquid is poured back into the funnel. The
weight being wound up, the volume indicated on the dial is read off,
and thedrum setin motion. With a column of beads of about 20 inches
and a weight of 20 pounds, 20 cubic feet can be aspirated in an hour.
Once started, the apparatus needs no further supervision until either
the weight has reached the ground or the solution of hydrogen peroxide
has run out of thefunnel. The period required for this is readily deter-
mined, so that no time is lost in looking after the apparatus.

Thus we see that carbonic acid and sulphurous acid, as we should
have anticipated, rapidly increase during fog, and, although I have no
determinations of soot to record, the fact that it increases also is suffi- _
ciently evident.

If we assume that dust particles are the cause of fog, then it follows
that the thickness of fog depends upon the number of these particles
and the fog must be denser in the town than in the country. Moreover,
each particle of water floating as fog becomes coated with a film of
sooty oil—of that oil which forms so large a constituent of soot. What
is the effect? Evaporation is retarded and the fog persists longer than
it would were these particles composed of pure water only. To illus-
trate this, I wish now to refer to an experiment, which has been pro-
ceeding since the beginning of the lecture. I then called your attention
to the fact that in each pan of this balance I had placed a large watch
glass containing water. Onto the surface of one watch glass of water
Thad poured a drop of oil, which spread itself out into a film. You now
observe that this pan has descended, showing that evaporation has
proceeded at a greater rate in the other pan.

We have not yet touched upon the evils attending fog. Apart from
the cost due to the extra daily consumption of gas, which is estimated
in London at 25,000,000 cubic feet, or £3,125 per annum, there is a
serious increase in mortality. The figures in the following table must
be taken with sonie caution, as it is recognized that a fall of temperature
increases the death rate; but there can be little doubt that the high
mortality due to respiratory diseases which occur with the advent of
fog must be in a large measure directly traceable to this cause:

Sickness and mortality in Manchester during the months of December (1890), January, and
Lebruary (1891).

I have little more to add. We have learned one important lesson,
viz, that dust is the mother of mist and rain.

Looking at the statistics of the annual rainfall since the beginning
of the century, there appears to be a slight increase; but it may not
be due to an increase of solid matter in the air. Whatever the facts
may be, it is interesting to remember that dust is its own destroyer.
Rain, snow, and mist drag it to the earth, and so wash and purify the
air. Were it not so, though the ground would still receive its neces-
Sary moisture, the greater part of the 20 tons of smoke daily sent into
the atmosphere of Leeds would continue to float forever in the ocean
of air around us. That atmospheric dust is gradually delivered back
to the earth is, however, poor consolation to us who suffer from town
fog. Just as well might we promise to the drowning man a future
abundant supply of air, for the lack of which he will in a few moments
have ceased to live. A lecture is neither a fable nor a fairy tale and

376 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

need point no moral; but before bringing it to a close I have one
suggestion to make. Those who have followed my lectures thus far
will, I am confident, agree with me as to the serious importance
of this subject of town air from the nature and extent of air pollu-
tion here in the town of Leeds, its marked effect upon the life of
its citizens, especially of its working population, and its effect on
vegetation, aud indirectly, therefore, on the possibility of purifying the
atmosphere.

Our medical officers in their weekly or quarterly returns usually
include a certain amount of interesting and useful information about
the weather, the temperature, and the barometer readings. These
weather statistics have their value in relation to epidemic and endemic
disease. I donot wish to underrate them. But how vastly more impor-
tant is it for us to know the extent of our air pollution. And the mat-
ter carries still further weight from the fact that the weather is beyond
our control, but the purity of our town atmosphere lies in our own
hands. We want our experimental stations, our watchtowers, within
and outside the town, where the condition of the atmosphere may be
constantly tested, where with every new progressive step in air purifi-
eation we may mark the effect on the atmosphere as well as on the
health of the citizens. This need be no costly undertaking. Three or
four intelligent lads of 15 or 16 with a good board-school training
under the control of the city analyst or other competent chemist could
manipulate all the necessary apparatus, which in itself, as you haveseen,
is simple and inexpensive.

One word more. Kuskin, as Collingwood in his biography relates,
kept for fifty years careful account of the weather and effects of cloud.
He noticed that since 1871 there had been a prevalence of chilly wind,
but different in its phenomena from anything of his earlier days. ‘The
plague wind,” so he named if, ‘ blew from no fixed point of the com-
pass, but always brought the same dirty sky in place of the healthy
rain cloud of normal summers.” |

This “ eclipse of heaven” Ruskin regarded, ifnotas a judgment, at all
events aS a Symbol of the moral darkness of a nation. In whatever
light we are inclined to regard Ruskin’s opinions, he has ever been
admittedly a most careful and trustworthy student of nature. May not
this ‘ eclipseof heaven ” be the effectof our town smoke, which we know
is perceived at a radius of 10 miles, and probably extends many times
that distance from some of our large towns. I can not doubt that the
total effect of the millions of tons of smoke sent yearly into the atmos-
phere of the United Kingdom must modify in some degree the charac-
ter of our climate.

We ought, however, to take courage from the fact that, if we can not
get pure country air in town, a vastly purer atmosphere is within easy
reach if we would only grasp it. Then we may begin to think seriously

of beautifying our buildings and streets and squares, and of realizing
the ideal town described in my first lecture.

LECTURE 4.—THE GERMS OF THE AIR.

Until the beginning of the present century, physical science directed
the minds of philosophers mainly toward the study of the infinitely
great—the discovery of new worlds in space, the study of universal
gravitation, and the measurement of the velocity of light. The present
century has illumined a new path in the Dark Unknown. ‘The science
of to-day is essentially the science of the infinitely small. Dalton’s
atomic theory, a theory of the invisible atomie structure of matter, is
the foundation of modern chemistry and physics. The germ theory of
disease, a theory which involves the existence of the microscopic living
matter dwelling within and around us, is the basis of modern pathology
and surgery. Itis to these minute organisms that I have now to direct
your attention.

The discovery of these living particles, particles so small that it is
probable that many of them defy the scrutiny of the most perfect
microscope, originated in the study of a very ancient process, the proc-
ess of fermentation.

Boyle, in the seventeenth century, in his ‘‘ Essay on the pathological
part of physik,” with that almost prophetic clearness of vision which
marked his conclusions, wrote as follows: “‘And let me add that he
that thoroughly understands the nature of ferments and fermentations
shall probably be much better able than he that ignores them to give
a fair account of divers phenomena of several diseases (as well fevers
as others) which will, perhaps, be never properly understood without
an insight into the doctrine of fermentations.”

The making of wine and the brewing of beer have been practiced in
historic and prehistoric times. Theophrastes, who lived in Egypt B.C.
400, described beer as the ‘‘ wine of barley.” Noah, we read, ‘planted
a vineyard and drank of the wine which maketh glad the heart of man,”
and one or both of these processes is practiced by nearly every nation,
civilized and uncivilized, at the present day.

If the grape is crushed and left to itself at a moderate temperature
it begins to froth. After a few days its sweetness, which was due to
Sugar, has gone and the juice has acquired a slightly burning taste.
It now contains no sugar, but alcohol. If barley is moistened and
allowed to germinate and the germination suddenly stopped by roast-
ing the grain, the barley has a sweetish taste. It is now called malt.
The constituents of the barley have been changed; a new substance
has been formed, viz, diastase, a substance which has the peculiar
property of converting the starch of the grain into sugar as soon as the
grain is steeped in water. A little of this sugar has already appeared

378 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

in the malt, and to this its sweetness is due. The malt is now steeped
in water for a short time, the water is boiled and rapidly cooled, and
this extract is called ‘“‘wort.” If a little yeast or brewer’s barm is
added to the wort it begins shortly to bubble up, and at the same time
a white scum forms. This scum is yeast, which by the end of the proe-
ess is four or five fold the quantity of the original yeast. The sweet-
ness of the wort has gone, and in the vlace of sugar it now coutains
alcohol. The making of wine and the brewing of beer are very simi-
lar processes. In brewing, the brewer adds his ferment; in wine mak-
ing, the ferment is with the grape. ‘What has been done consciously
by the brewer has been done unconsciously by the wine grower.”! The
nature of this ferment—the yeast—was first examined in 1680 by
Leuwenhoek in the early days of the microscope, and he found that it
consisted of minute globules. More than a century and a half elapsed
before our knowledge of these globules was materially increased, and
then in 1835 Cagniard de la Tour, in France, and Schwann, independ-
ently, in Germany, on carefully observing these globules noticed that
they threw out buds, that they were in fact a low form of plant life.

Here you see (fig. 30) the yeast plant in its various stages of growth,
the single spherical cell, then the bud growing and developing, and
finally separating from the mother cell and so forming a new yeast plant.
Tf the liquid is undisturbed these cells remain together and appear to
ramify like the lobes of a cactus leaf.

It was at this point that Pasteur took up the subject. I could easily
devote a lecture—nay, a series of lectures—to the researches of this
distinguished chemist, which are models of scientific acumen and
experimental skill.

It may suffice to say that he incontestably established the fact, in
spite of much opposition on the part of scientific men, that the conver-
sion of sugar into alcohol is brought about, although we do not yet
know how, by the living yeast cell during its life in the liquid. As
long as yeast is excluded no fermentation takes place. How comes it,
then, that wine ferments spontaneously, whereas beer does not? This
question was also answered by Pasteur. The germs of the yeast plant
are contained in the dust of the air which settles upon the grape. I
will now show you on the screen the apparatus and explain the method
by which Pasteur solved the problem.

The flask A (fig. 31) has two necks, the one is drawn out toa point,
and sealed, the other is also drawn out iv a fine tube and bent, as
shown in the figure. Although the end is turned up and open, no dae
can enter. The point is inserted through the skin of the grape, as
shown in B in the enlarged drawing of the same. After insertion the
point is broken and the juice sucked into the flask by aspirating at the
open bent limb. The point was then fused; in this way the dust from
the outside of the g ee was excluded and no fermentation took place.

THE AIR OF TOWNS. 379

Yeast would also find its way into the brewer’s wort; but this liquid is
neutral and not acid like grape juice and is capable of nourishing other
germs, which can not convert sugar into alcohol, but yield acid sub-
stances, as the brewer not unfrequently finds to his cost, when occa-
sionally such germs find their way into the fermenting vat.

By adding pure yeast, the yeast being first in the field establishes
itself generally to the exclusion of other forms of life just as soil sown
with wheat will produce wheat and not weeds, as it would otherwise
do. The souring of beer and wine next claimed Pasteur’s attention
and he found that certain much more minute forms of low vegetable life
called bacteria or microbes had the property of converting sugar into
acids. ,

Here are some of these much more minute germs which are found in
bad beer growing in bead-like filaments side by side with the yeast
cells (fig. 32). The study of the microbes led Pasteur to the discovery
of a process for preventing wine from turning sour. He found that a
temperature below the boiling point of water destroyed these germs.
After the wine is bottled a short immersion in hot water will kill the
germs without materially affecting the flavor of the wine, and the wine
will undergo no change on keeping. This process is known as ‘ pasteur-
ization.” The production of vinegar from beer and wine was found to
be due to the microscopic ferment, which converts alcohol into acetic
acid, known as mycoderma aceti or acetic ferment, and which, as just
stated, is found in sour beer.

The germs of all these forms of vegetable life are found in the dust of
theair. This dust when not stirred up gradually settles, and when the
germs chance to sow themselves in good ground, with the temperature
neither too hot nor too cold, they will immediately begin to grow and
multiply, generally at a prodigious rate, living on the material and
bringing about its conversion into new and usually simpler forms of
matter.

The inference that putrefaction has a similar origin naturally sug-

gests itself. We know that meat during warm weather rapidly becomes
putrid. Such a piece of meat examined under a powerful microscope
will be found to be swarming with bacteria. Now, it is found that
_ exposure to the temperature of boiling water if sufficiently prolonged—
for some bacteria die harder than others—will kill them, and the freez-
ing temperature will render them inactive, though without always
destroying them; that certain so-called antiseptics, carbolic acid, cor-
rosive sublimate, boric acid, etc., act as poisons and kill them. We
can recall for ourselves a number of instances where one or another of
these methods is employed to prevent putrefaction and decay. Meat
and milk are preserved by heating them in air-tight tins. In summer
time milk may be kept from turning sour by boiling it, and game pre-
served untainted by parboiling it. In a similar manner cool larders
_ and refrigerating chambers retard or prevent putrefaction.

380 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

Perhaps one of the happiest and most fruitful results of the study of
this engrossing subject has been the antiseptic treatment of disease,
first introduced by Sir Joseph Lister. In speaking upon this subject,
the late Professor Tyndall said:

Consider the woes which these wafted particles during historic
and prehistoric ages have inflicted upon mankind; consider the loss
of life in hospitals from putrefying wounds; consider the loss in places
where there are plenty of wounds, but no hospitals, and in the ages
before hospitals were anywhere founded; consider the slaughter which
has hitherto followed that of the battlefield, when these bacterial
destroyers are let loose, often producing a mortality far greater than
that of the battle itself; add to this the other conception that in times
of epidemic disease the selfsame floating matter has mingled with it
the special germs with produce the epidemic, being thus enabled to
sow pestilence and death over nations and continents—consider all this
and you will come to the conelusion that all the havoc of war ten times
multiplied would be evanescent if compared with the ravages due to
atmespheric dust.

If after disinfecting by killing the germs we can exclude the air, or
the dust of the air, the most putrescent substances may be kept indefi-
nitely without the slightest indication of putrefaction. Both Pasteur
and Tyndail have established this fact in the most convincing manner,
the former by allowing calcined air (that is, air passed through a red-
hot tube) to come in contact with a highly putrescible substance like
beef extract, the latter by giving the substance access to dust-free air
in a chamber similar to one shown in my last lecture, the purity of the
air being tested by a beam of light. I have referred to the relations
of dust to epidemic diseases in the paragraph quoted from Professor
Tyndall. This relationship is perhaps not quite so obvious as that
which has been found to exist between the germs of the air and festering
wounds.

To discover this relation, we must again seek it in a research of Pas-
teur—one of the noblest services that any man has rendered to his
country. The outline of the story is briefly told.'

For fifteen years, a plague raged among the silkworms in the
silk-growing district which lies to the southeast of France. From
430,000,000 frances, which was the value of the silk produced in 1853, it
had dropped to 30,000,000 frances in 1862, and there was no sign of
abatement of the disease.

In 1863 the French minister of agriculture offered a reward of £20,000
to anyone who should find a remedy. The district which suffered most
was Alais, the country of Pasteur’s friend, the chemist Dumas, who
wrote to Pasteur, “I put a great price upon seeing you fix your atten-
tion on the question which interests my poor country. The misery
there surpasses all imagination.” In June, 1865, Pasteur gave up his
post at Paris and with his wife left for Alais. The disease of the

THE AIR OF TOWNS. 381

silkworm was characterized by the appearance of black spots. It
showed itself, moreover, in the stunted and unequal growth of the
caterpillars, in the languor of their movements, fastidiousness in regard
to food, and premature death. The black spots which appeared
through the transparent skin of the silkworm had been examined and
proved to be living corpuscles. These gradually took possession of
the intestinal canal and spread, finally filling the silk cavities so that
the worm when its appointed time came went automatically through
the process of spinning, but without producing any silk. This was
already known when Pasteur came upon the scene. By careful and
constant use of the microscope he followed the life of these fatal
corpuscles.

The life of the silkworm is like that of any ordinary caterpillar.
When hatched from the egg the worm, which is not much larger than
a pin’s head, begins to feed and grow, casting his skin from time to
time when his coat gets too tight until, having attained a léngth of
almost 2 inches, he suddenly stops feeding and, having found a suit-
able spot, he begins to spin his silk web around him.

Within the cocoon he remains dormant for a time in the chrysalis
state, and then in the form of the moth makes his way out of his silk
prison. The puzzle which had baffled previous investigations was
this: The eggs and the worm might appear sound and healthy and yet
produce in the one case diseased worms and in the other, although
spinning their silk cocoons, produce diseased moths or eggs. Pasteur
proved that “the corpuscles may be incipient in the egg and escape
detection, germinal in the worm and baffle the microscope.” As the
worm grows the corpuscles grow; in the chrysalis they are more dis-
tinct, and in the moth they invariably appear. A diseased moth then
lays infected eggs which, owing to the minuteness of the corpuscles,
appear healthy. Moreover, a diseased worm may infect a healthy one.
Feeding together, corpuscles are transferred from the diseased to the
healthy worm, and the infected worm, without immediately showing
signs of disease, may spin its cocoon and eventually lay its eggs; but
the eggs are all tainted. Instead, then, as silk growers were in the
habit of doing, of selecting the eggs for the next year’s growth from the
moths which had survived the most successful cocoons, the microscope
was brought to bear on the moths when the presence of these diseased
corpuscles was invariably made evident. This is the practice now
adopted by all silk growers, and numbers of women skilled with the
microscope examine each moth as it emerges from the cocoon.

Here we have, then, the first distinct connection between living germs
and the cause of disease, of infection, and of hereditary taint. The
constant strain of microscope work, which restored to France her silk
industry, produced partial paralysis from which Pasteur never quite
recovered.
382 THE AIR OF TOWNS.

It would be easy to multiply examples to which this great discovery
has givenrise. Tuberculosis, diphtheria, wool-sorter’s disease, leprosy,
cholera, typhus, and tetanus have been traced to the existence of micro-
scopic living matter (figs. 33, 34). ;

I have taken you over this little bit of history in order to indicate
the importance of knowing the number and character of the almost
invisible living germs of the air, and this must be my apology for intro-
ducing a subject which may seem to lie a little outside the special topic
of town air.

If we examine dust under a powerful microscope, we find that it con-
sists of a variety of things, which I enumerated in my last lecture.
Now, the greater part of this dust, although heavier than air and set-
tling rapidly where the air is still, is so very fine as to be almost invis-
ible except when illuminated by a bright beam of light. Can we gain
any idea of the weight of these little particles? In my second lecture,
I told you that the weight of dust in 100 cubic feet of air in town is over
1 milligram. In my last, that in the parish churchyard 3,638,000 dust
particles were contained in 1 cubic inch. From this it may be caleu-
lated that about 40 million million dust particles weigh 1 grain and
would occupy a space of 240 cubie yards, or a space measuring rather
over 6 yards each way.

What proportion of the dust consists of spores, pollen, and fungi, and
what proportion do the bacteria form? The amount of living matter
in the air has been carefully investigated for a long period of years by
M. Miquel, of the Observatory of Montsouris, situated on the outskirts
of Paris. This careful experimenter has directed his attention mainly
to determining the number of vegetable spores, fungi, and microbes in
the air in various places and at various seasons of the year. He has
determined the amount of vegetable matter and microbes in the streets,
bedrooms, and living rooms of Paris and inthe environs. Hehas drawn
samples of air from the sewers of Paris, and from the top of the Pan-
theon, high above the town. He has examined the street dust, the dust
of rooms, of the soil in the country, and in graveyards—in short, the
dust of all possible places where disease germs might lie. Anyone who
has leisure to take up the book *“‘ Les Organismes Vivants” can not fail
to be interested in the results of so much laborious work and of so many
carefully recorded facts. It would take too long and carry me beyond
my subject, if Ll gave even a brief outline of these results; I must limit
myself to town air and the minute organisms which inhabit it. The
vegetable spores and fungi we may pass over briefly. This slide (fig.
35) represents the most common forms met with at the Montsouris
Observatory.

The average for the country is 200 and for the town 1,000. This refers
to Paris, where there are plenty of beautiful parks and where trees line
the larger streets. Where vegetation is nearly obliterated, as in the city
of Leeds, the number will probably fall much below that of the country.

We now come to the much more minute inhabitants of the dust—the
microbes or bacteria. Here are some of the commoner forms as seen
under a powerful microscope (fig. 36).

There are globular and elongated forms, twisted filaments, spherical
dots, and short, straight rods. Yeast cells, too, are often met with.
They rapidly reproduce; the parent cell in the case of bacteria divid-
ing into two or more new cells, and these again undergoing subdivision.

It may interest you to know how these almost invisible germs can
be counted. Although the germ itself is only visible under high mag-
nification, if the germ falls upon nutrient material it will soon produce
a family cirele readily visible as a spot of mold. One of the methods,
which has been introduced by a German bacteriologist named Hess, is

- represented in the following diagram (fig. 37).

It consists of a glass tube coated with a nutrient jelly. The tube
is first rendered sterile by heat, and then a measured volume of air is
slowly aspirated through it by the aid of two bottles containing water,
which can be alternately lowered and raised. The tube is then placed
under the best conditions for the growth of the germs and excluded
from the dust. Where a germ has fallen a spot of mold will soon
appear, and such spots mark the residence of the original single germ.

The following slide (fig. 38) represents the appearance produced in
the tube in three experiments made in a schoolroom: No. 1 experiment
was made before the school assembled, the second in the middle of the
day, and the last when the school closed.

One is struck by the great variety of these minute beings, and the dif-
ficulty of distinguishing them is increased by the fact that they appear
to vary in Shape with the nutrient material upon which they grow. If
they are fed on beef tea they may take a different shape to that pro-
duced by a diet of agar jelly. There seems very little doubt that the
number of species is very large, and very little is known, moreover, of
their functions. It is certain that at least a few produce disease. It
is equally certain that a large number, when inoculated into animals,
are harmless. That these harmless ones serve a useful purpose in ear-
rying on putrefactive change, acting as scavengers for the world’s

refuse, seems not unlikely; but the subject is still in its infancy, and one
upon which, no doubt, fresh ight will fall as bacteriological research
progresses. The following table gives the proportion of dust particles,
Spores, etc., and bacteria in a cubic foot of town and country air:!

The numbers represent averages throughout the year, but this
includes considerable variations, which occur at different seasons of
the year.

The shaded portion in the diagram (fig. 39) represents the number of
bacteria, and the dotted line the temperature during the various months
of the years 1879-1882.

The number does not appear to vary proportionately with change
of temperature; but if we compare the rainfall with the number of
microbes we see at once a rapid diminution. The rain evidently car-
ries them down to the earth. But they are far from being destroyed.
The moisture seems to assist reproduction, for we find a rapid increase
directly after rain. If drought is long continued the number falls off
again. They die. Here, again (fig. 40), the shaded portion represents
the number of bacteria, and the line the rainfall during the year
1879-80.

The number of microbes in the streets of Paris is on the average
about 21 to 22 in the cubic foot, and this agrees with that found by
Professor Carnelley in the streets of Dundee, viz, 20 in the cubic foot.
Outside of Paris the number falls off to 2 whereas, in dirty, one-roomed
houses Carnelley found 3,430 and Miquel in a neglected hospital ward
3,170 in the cubic foot. The effect of population in inereasing the
number of microbes may be represented by the following rough map of
Paris (fig. 41), in which the number of microbes in a cubie meter of
air observed at Montsouris is marked against the arrow denoting the
direction of the wind. From this it will be seen that the largest number
occurs when the wind blows across the town and the smallest number
when it comes direct from the country—that is, from the south.

The number, 21 to 22, for the streets of Paris is a rough average. In
dry, dusty weather, following rain, the number may rise to 150. Directly
after wind and rain it may fall to an average of 6 per cubic foot.

We can not be surprised that the washings of the air by rain, aceu-
mulating in the mud of thoroughfares, should be the gathering ground
for microbes. ‘The mud of streets is more than this. It provides
food for their growth. It is the great source of bacterial propogation.
When we open vur windows to let in fresh air on a dry, windy day, we
are welcoming these small visitors. The number of microbes in a grain

of dust from the streets of Paris was found to be 84,240, nearly double
that contained in similar dust obtained on the outskirts of the town.

Can we be astonished at finding domestic dust nearly as pregnant
with living matter as that from the street, which, according to Miquel,
is 64,000 in the grain? It might appear judicious to keep our windows
closed under such a siege, but a moment’s reflection will, I think, solve
the difficulty. We do not know to what degree these microbes are
mischievous. We do know to what extent fresh air is necessary to
health. Let us admit air, but keep our dwellings, as far as possible,
free from dust. Microbes settle rapidly in still air, and we have only
to rise a few hundred feet above the ground level to prove it. On the
same day Miquel found on the top of the Pantheon less than 1 on
the average in the cubic foot; at Montsouris 15, and in Paris streets
about 12. At a height of almost 1,000 feet the number is about one-
sixteenth of that on the ground level. On the high Alps, as Pasteur
and Tyndall have shown, they disappear completely. If we want fresh
air we know where to go. We must climb the hilltops. An idea of
the great army of microbes which are constantly on the march out of a
big town may be gathered from the number computed for Paris, viz,
40,000 million daily, a number which may be graphically expressed
by supposing all the microbes in 11 gallons of soup, in full putrefac-
tion, to arise and march away.

Ladies and gentlemen, my task is at an end. There is much that I
have left unsaid in the course of these lectures. I should like to have

. alluded to the possibility of reducing domestic smoke, of the smoke of

our warehouse and office buildings, of the better utilization of coal, and
of the use of gas for household purposes. I should like to have said
much more on the important subject of ventilation of our dwelling
rooms and offices. These matters must be left for a possible future
occasion. I should, however, be content with the result of these four
lectures if you carried away, immovably impressed upon your minds,
the fact that pure air is indispensable to health. Do not let us resem-
ble people sitting in a close room who, by gradually becoming accus-
tomed to their surroundings, grow oblivious to the polluted atmosphere
they are breathing and the poison which they are slowly absorbing.

' A chairman at a lecture which I once delivered on a similar topic to
this said at the close: ‘I think the lecturer makes too much of these
invisible things in the air. We seem to keep alive in spite of them.”
But we don’t want merely to keep alive. We want to live without the
burden of trying to keep alive. What future is there for a country
two-thirds of the population of which inhabit towns, and of whom Mr.
Acland said “a great deal of this work of the towns, which necessi-
tated strong and healthy men, was done by those who nad been proaett
up in country homes and not in those of towns.”

As I have already said, impure air, no matter whether it arises from
bad gases, soot, or igor! germs, is injurious to health. If we are

attacked by a wild beast we do not remain passive. We prepare to kill
itor torun away. And if the health of a town population is slowly
undermined, as it assuredly is, by causes which we can compass and
prevent, as we can not run away to pure air, we must face those causes
and stamp them out. There is much that the local authority can and
ought to do, and which we should collectively see is done. But there
is much that we as individuals can do ourselves. It is a duty to our.
Selves that these things should be done. It is equally a duty to the
young and growing generation.

A RAPID METHOD FOR THE ESTIMATION OF CARBONIC ACID IN
THE AIR.

(1) A standard solution of limewater.—Pure water is left in contact with slacked
lime until saturated. The clear decanted liquid is diluted with ninety-nine times
its volume of distilled water. Make 1 quart or 1 liter.

(2) Phenolphthalein solution is made by dissolving one part of phenolphthalein in
five hundred times its weight of dilute alcohol [equal volumes of pure alcohol and

water]. Make 3 ounces or 100 cubic centimeters.
(3) A 20-ounce stoppered bottle with (preferably) a hollow stopper
marked to hold 3 drams or 10 cubic centimeters.
A sample of air is taken by blowing air into the clean stoppered
ooxd bottle (fig..1) with bellows. Six minims or one-third of a cubic cen-
timeter of the phenolphthalein solution is then added, and the meas-
ured volume of limewater is run into the hollow stopper.

The limewater is poured into the bottle, the stopper inserted, the time noted, and
the contents vigorously shaken. If the red color of the liquid disappears in three
minutes or less the atmosphere is unfit for respiration.

The stock of limewater should be kept in a bottle.(fig. 2) fur-
nished with a tap and coated within with a film of paraffia, and
in the neck an open tube shouid be inserted containing pieces of
caustic soda or quicklime. The phenolphthalein solution is best
measured by means of a narrow glass tube passing through the
cork of the bottle upon which the measured volume is marked.

If the cork fits easily the liquid may be forced up exactly to the Fic. 2.
mark by pushing in the cork.

The following are estimations: made in this manner sommpavad with the results
obtained by Pettenkofer’s method:

during the months November, 1895, to February, 1896. The same has been done at
the Philosophical Hall (near the center of the town) and at Kirkstall Road + (a busy

THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR AND ITS EFFECTS
UPON ANIMAL LIFE.’

ABSTRACT OF A REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION MADE FOR
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION UNDER-THE PROVISIONS OF THE HODGKINS
FUND.

3y J.S. BILLINGS, M. D., S. WEIR MITCHELL, M. D., and
D. H. BERGEY, M. D.

In May, 1893, a grant was made from the Hodgkins fund to Drs.
John 8. Billings and 8. Weir Mitchell “for the purpose of conducting
an investigation into the nature of the peculiar substances of organic
origin contained in the air expired by human beings, with special ref-
erence to the practical application of the results obtained to problems
of ventilation for inhabited rooms.”

For a number of years prior to 1888 the prevailing view among phy-
Sicians and sanitarians had been that the discomfort and dangers to
health and life which had been known to exist, sometimes, at least, in
unventilated rooms occupied by a number of human beings, were
largely or entirely due to peculiar organic matter contained in the air
expired by these persons, and that the increase in carbonic acid due to
respiration had but little effect in producing these results, its chief
importance being that it furnished a convenient means of determining
the amount of vitiation of the air. Recently, however, several experi-
menters have concluded that the organic matters in the exhaled breath
are not harmful, at all events to animals, and the main object of the
proposed investigation was to determine the correctness of these
conclusions.

The effects produced on animals and men by an atmosphere contami-
nated with their exhalations, and with particulate matters derived from
their bodies or their immediate surroundings, may be divided into acute
and chronic. The acute effect may be death in a few minutes or hours,
as Shown by the results observed in the Black Hole of Calcutta, in the
Steamer Londonderry, and in many of the experiments referred to in
this report, or it may be simply great discomfort, especially in those
unaccustomed to such conditions.

(No. 980), 4to, pp. 81.

390 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

The chronic effects include the favoring of the action of certain
specific causes of disease commonly known as contagious, if these are
present, and perhaps also a general lowering of vitality.

The statistical evidence collected by the English Barrack and Hos-
pital Commission (1)' as to the effects of insufficient ventilation upon
the health of soldiers in barracks, published in 1861, showed that men
who live for a considerable portion of their time in badly ventilated
rooms have higher sickness and death rates than have those who
occupy well-ventilated rooms, other conditions being the same; and
this has also been found to be true with regard to monkeys and other
animals. It is evident, however, that in a room occupied by animals
or men there are many sources of impurity besides the exhaled breath,
and it is still a question whether the expired air contains substances
injurious to life, excluding carbonic acid.

The widely divergent results obtained and conclusions reached by
different investigators during the last ten years as to whether the
exhaled breath of men and animals contains a peculiar volatile organic
poison, have made it desirable to repeat and vary such experiments in
order, if possible, to settle this important point. The chemical analyses
of the air of overcrowded rooms, and the experiments upon animals
with various proportions of carbonic acid, made by many investigators,
indicate that the evil effects observed are probably not due to the com-
paratively small proportions of carbonic acid found under such cireum-
stances.

Claude Bernard (2), in 1857, experimented with animals confined in
atmospheric air and in mixtures both richer and poorer in oxygen than
atmospheric air. A small bird placed in a bell glass of a little more
than 2 liters’ capacity, containing a mixture of 13 per cent carbonic
acid, 39 per cent oxygen, and 48 per cent of nitrogen, died in two and
one-half hours. He demonstrated that carbonic acid is not poisonous
when injected under the skin of animals—as much as one liter injected
under the skin of a rabbit producing no ill effects. No ill effects fol-
lowed the injection of the gas into the jugular vein and into the carotid
artery. An atmosphere of equal parts of oxygen and nitrogen had no
effect upon an animal confined in it, while an atmosphere composed of
equal parts of carbonic acid and of oxygen produced immediate death
in the animal placed in it. He explains the poisonous effects of car-
bonic acid when respired to be due to the fact that it deprives the
animal of oxygen. Similar results were reported by Valentin (3) and
by Paul Bert (4).

Richardson, in 1860-61 (5), found that a temperature much higher
or lower than 20° C. had the effect of shortening very considerably the
lives of animals confined in an unventilated jar, and that these effects
were more marked when the animals were confined in an atmosphere

'The numbers in parentheses refer to the bibliographical list appended to this:
report.
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 391

richer in oxygen than air, in which case he found that by passing
electric sparks from a frictional machine through the fatal air (having
previously deprived it of its carbonic acid) it was again made capable
of supporting life, from which he concluded that the oxygen is ‘ devi-
talized” during respiration, and that the electric spark has the faculty
of revitalizing it.

Von Pettenkofer, in 1860-1863 (6), showed that the symptoms observed
in crowded, ill-ventilated places were not produced by the excess of
carbonic acid, nor by a decrease in the proportion of oxygen in the air;
neither of these being sufficient in our dwellings, theaters, etc., to pro-
duce toxic effects. He did not believe that the impure air of dwellings
was directly capable of originating specific diseases, or that it was
really a poison in the ordinary sense of the term, but that it diminished
the capability of withstanding the influence of disease-producing agen-
cies on the part of those continually breathing such air, and laid down
the rule, which has been accepted and taught by sanitarians for thirty-
five years, that the proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere of
inhabited places affords a safe indication as to the amount of the other
impurities resulting from respiration and other exhalations from the
bodies of the occupants.

Hammond, in 1863 (7), reported experiments in which he sought to
remove the carbonic acid and moisture, and to supply fresh air as fast
as it is needed to take the place of the carbonic acid removed, thus
leaving the “organic matter” to accumulate in the vessel. For this
purpose he confined a mouse in a large jar, in which were several
sponges saturated with baryta water, by which the carbonic acid was
removed as fast as formed. Fresh air was supplied as fast as required
by means of a tube communicating with the bell jar and closed by
water in the bend of the tube, which acted as a valve. As the air in
the bell glass was rarefied by respiration and absorption of the car-
bonie acid, fresh air flowed in from without, while the arrangement of
the tube prevented the air of the bell giass from passing out. The
watery vapor exhaled by the animal was absorbed by two or three
small pieces of chloride of calcium. The mouse died in ferty minutes.
The observation was repeated many times, and death ensued invariably
in less than an hour. On causing the vitiated air to pass through a
solution of permanganate of potash the presence of organic matters in
large quantity was demonstrated.

Ransome, in 1870 (8), reported a series of very interesting investi-
gations upon “ Organic matter of human breath in health and disease.”
By condensing the aqueous vapor of the human breath and analyzing
it by the Wanklyn and Chapman method, he found that “in ordinary
respiration about 0.2 gram of organic matter is given off from a healthy
man’s lungs in twenty-four hours,” while in the air expired by persons
affected with certain diseases, he found great variations in the amount
of organic matter, the amount being greatest in a case of phthisis com-
plicated with Bright’s disease.
Doe THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

Smith (9) employed a lead chamber in his investigations upon the
question whether human lungs give off any poisonous agent other than
carbonic acid. He found the pulse to fall from 73 to 57 beats per
minute, and the number of respirations to rise from 15.5 to 24, as the
carbonic acid in the atmosphere increased from 0.04 to 1.75 per cent
during four hours. When the proportion of carbonic acid rose to 3 per
cent there appeared great weakness of the circulation with slowing of
the heart’s action, and great difficulty in respiration. He believed that
these results should be attributed to other conditions rather than to
the excess of carbonic acid, because he found later that it was only
when lamps became dim in an atmosphere—indicating a proportion of
about 10 per cent of carbonic acid present—that the respiration became
difficult.

Seegen and Nowak, in 1879 (10), believed they had demonstrated the
presence of poisonous organic matter in the expired breath by passing
it over red-hot cupric oxide, but the quantity found was so small that
they failed to determine its exact nature and properties.

Hermans, in 1883 (11), was unable to detect any organic matter in the
atmosphere of a tin cage in which several persons had been confined
for a number of hours, and found that an atmosphere containing from
2 to 4 per cent of carbonic acid and 15 per cent of oxygen was not toxic.

Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval, in 1887 (12), reported that the air
expired by men and dogs in astate of health has the power of produc-
ing toxic phenomena, citing three series of experiments on rabbits where
such phenomena were observed. In the first series they injected into
the vascular system of a rabbit 4 to 6c. ¢. of water obtained by inject-
ing from 15 to 25 ¢. c. of pure filtered water into the trachea of a dog.
In a second series from 6 to 7 ¢. c. of a liquid obtained by condensing
the moisture in the exhaled breath of a man were injected into the aorta,
or into a vein, of arabbit. In the third series from 4 to 6c. ¢. of a liquid
obtained by condensing the moisture in the exhaled breath of a trache-
otomized dog were used. The condensed liquid thus obtained was fil-
tered and then injected either into the jugular vein or the carotid artery.

The symptoms observed were dilatation of the pupils, increase of the
heart beat to 240, 280, or even 320 per minute, lasting for several days
or even weeks. The temperature remained normal, the respiratory
movements were generally slowed, and usually there was observed par-
alysis of the posterior members. Choleraic diarrhea was invariably
present. Death usually took place in a few days, or at the farthest in
four or five weeks. As a rule, it appeared that larger doses caused
labored respiration, violent retching, and contracted pupils. A rapid
lowering of temperature, 0.5° to 5° C., was sometimes observed. The
appearances that presented post-mortem were much like those observed
in cardiac syncope.

They believed they had discovered a volatile organic poison in the
exhaled breath and the moisture condensed from it. This poison they
5 =

believed to be of the nature of an organic alkaloid, or a ptomaine not
unlike Brieger’s ptomaine (12).

In further reports, in 1888 (12°), they state that none of eleven rabbits
in which the condensed pulmonary vapor had been injected into the
vascular system in doses of 12 to 30 c. c. survived, but of eight rabbits
receiving an injection of from 4 to 8 c. c. three were living after the
lapse of from four to five weeks, but were then weak. When the fluid
was injected under the skin of the thorax and in the axilla, five out of
seven rabbits died rapidly. The results were much the same as when
it was injected into the blood. The quantity of the condensed liquid
injected in these seven was 20 ¢. ¢. in one case, 25 ¢. c. in three cases,
ol ¢. ¢. in one case, 40 ¢. c. in one case, and 44 ¢.c. in another case.
After death, considerable congestion of the viscera was noted, espe-
cially of the lungs. No appearance of embolism was noted. The brain
and its membranes were congested, but without visible lesion. The
condensed liquid turns concentrated sulphuric acid yellow. The poison
is reduced by ammoniacal nitrate of silver solution as well as by chlo-
ride of gold. After boiling in a close vessel it is still toxic, showing
that the poison is not a microorganism. The boiled lung liquid poisons
with more rapidity than that which has not been sterilized, and may
kill a pigeon and a guinea pig as well as a rabbit; that it may kill by
being injected into the rectum or into the stomach; that a guinea pig
two months old was killed within twelve hours by an injection of 3 ¢. ¢.
into the peritoneal cavity. If injected into the lungs this liquid pro-
duces rapid congestion followed by true inflammation and red hepati-
zation.

In an experiment with two dogs it was arranged that one breathed
ordinary air and the second inhaled air which came from the lungs of
the other. The dogs were of the same weight, 15 kilograms. The
experiment continued for six hours and forty minutes. No appreciable
or immediate consecutive accidents were produced.

In a second experiment the pulmonary liquid was collected from dogs
through a tracheotomy tube, to exclude impurities furnished by the
mouth. The air inhaled was first washed to remove dust. The mois-
ture in the air expired was condensed, and the liquid collected in a flask
surrounded by ice. At the moment of injection this liquid was filtered,
and was then injected at the temperature of the laboratory, about 12°
C. If the animal was kept immovable from twelve to sixteen hours,
inflammation of the air passages was produced. The liquid of the first
hours came from a thoroughly sound lung, and in the later hours from
a diseased lung. The two were collected separately and tried sepa-
rately. For 1 kilogram of the animal, for each hour, the mean quantity
of fluid obtained was 0.38 gram, varying from 0.28 to 0.48 gram. It was
greater in the beginning and lessened the longer the animal was kept
in a fixed position. It was injected into the marginal vein of the ear
of a rabbit by means of a syringe, 75 ¢c. c. being injected. . When the

injection did not exceed 40 to 50 c. c. the time occupied by the injection
was from six to fifteen minutes. Experiments made by injections upon
the dog were negative without exception. Experiments made upon
the rabbit produced lesions, but the relation between these and the
injections is uncertain. :

Dastre and Loye, in 1888 (13), reported that they had exposed one
dog to the expired breath of another for six hours without noting
any effects. They inoculated animals with the condensed moisture
of respiration, as follows:

a Of water.

They found that 50 to 70 ¢. c. of the condensed fluid of respiration (20
to 35 ¢.¢. per kilogram) could be injected into the veins of the ear of
a dog without producing any of the symptoms reported by Brown-
Séquard and d’Arsonval. They observed one death during the injec-
tion of 190 ¢. c. (60 c. c. per kilogram), yet by control experiments with
water they obtained a more remarkable result—a rapid death from the
injection of 30 ¢c. c. of distilled water (25 c. c. per kilogram).

Russo-Giliberti and Alessi, in 1888 (14), reported experiments con-
firming the results obtained by Dastre and Loye.

Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval, in 1889 (15), reported a new form of
experiment, by means of which they obtained additional evidence in
support of their former statements. The new form of experiment
consisted in confining animals (rabbits) in a series of metallic cages con-
nected by means of rubber tubing, through which a constant current
of air is aspirated. The animal in the last cage of the series receives
air that has traversed the entire series of cages, and is loaded with the
impurities from the lungs of the animals in the other cages. This
animal succumbs, after a time, to the atmospheric conditions present.
After another interval of some hours the animal in the next to the last
cage also dies, the first and second animals usually remaining alive.
They could not attribute the death of these animals to excess of car-
bonic acid in the atmosphere of the cages, because they rarely found
more than 3 per cent of this gas in the last jar with small animals, or
6 per cent with larger animals. On placing absorption tubes contain-
ing concentrated H,SO, between the last two cages, the animal in the
last cage remained alive, while that in the cage before it was the first
to die. They concluded from these facts that the death of the animals
So THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 395

was produced by a volatile poison, which poison is absorbed by the
H.SO,, which thus saves the life of the animal in the last cage.

They stated (16) that any alkali used to absorb carbonic acid from
expired air would also change the organic poison, and proposed an
apparatus by means of which the organic poison should be supplied to
the fresh air entering the jars by volatilizing it from fluid condensed
from the expired air.

V. Hofmann-Wellenhof, in 1888 (17), found that when he injected
large quantities of the condensed fluid of respiration at 12° C., instead
of at 37° C.—intravenous inujection—a resemblance of the results
obtained by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval was produced. Under
such circumstances he observed muscle weakuess, slowing of respira-
tion, fall of temperature, and dilatation of the pupils, though the ani-
mals remained alive. He injected ten rabbits with 6 to 30 ¢. c. of the
fluid warmed to the body temperature, all the results being negative.
Three other animals were injected in the jugular vein, one receiving 28
ce. c. of the fluid, another 25 c. c. of distilled water, and a third 50 c. ¢. of
distilled water. There was no difference in the symptoms noted in the
animals. He noticed symptoms of depression only after injecting 50
¢c. c., or more, of the fluid. In a series of seventeen experiments with
inoculations of from 30 to 50 ¢. ¢. each of the fluid, in twelve there
appeared hemoglobinuria; six of these died. As the result of his
experiments, he concluded that the existence of a volatile poison in
the expired air of healthy human beings has not been demonstrated
by his experiments, this being a direct contradiction of the results of
Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval, as were also those of Dastre and
Loye.

Uffelmann, in 1888 (18), found that there was a perceptible increase
in organic matter in the atmosphere of a sleeping room occupied by
several persons for some hours, increasing in amount with the length
of time the room was occupied.

Lehmann and Jessen, in 1890 (19), collected 15 to 20 c. c. of the con-
densed fluid per hour exhaled from the breath of a person breathing
through a glass spiral laid in ice. The fluid was always clear as water,
odorless, and of neutral reaction. Nessler’s reagent showed the pres-
ence of ammonia constantly, with good teeth but little, sometimes merely
a trace, with bad teeth, more, though never more than 10 milligrams of
NH,Cl in 1 liter. Traces of HCl were also constantly found. <A small
sediment remained on evaporation, ranging from 39 to 86.4 milligrams
per liter of fluid. This they believed to originate from the glass ves-
sel; probably calcium oxalate. They tested its reducing power upon
solution of permanganate of potash, making two control determinations-
The first determination showed 3.6 milligrams of O for the oxidation of
-141.; the second, 4.2 milligrams of O. They were unable to obtain any
alkaloid reaction in the condensed fluid, or in its distillates, by means
of PtCl,, AuCl;, KCdI, K Bil, KI, Bouchardet’s reagent, K,CrO,, picric

acid, metawolframie acid, or phosphowolframic acid. Only sublimate
gave at times an opalescence which, like the yellow coloration of the
Nessler reagent, pointed to traces of NH;. Neither could they succeed,
according to the method of Wiirtz, in obtaining a lime or oxalic acid-
free filtrate. The ammoniacal silver solution, according to Brown-
Séquard and d’Arsonval’s method, failed to give the desired reaction,
remaining clear. They confined a man, clothed in his working clothes,
in a zinc cage for about one-half an hour, then allowed a boy and girl
to inhale the air from the cage. No ill effects, except increase of respi-
rations to 30 and 40 per minute, were noticeable. They had complete
negative results from inoculations of condensed fluid into animals.

Lipari and Crisafulli, in 1889-90 (20), reported results which were in
accord with those of Dastre and Loye and directly opposed to those of
Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval. They could find no organic principle
possessing toxic properties in the expired breath of healthy persons.

Margouty, in 1891 (21), reported the results of experiments similar to
those of Hammond, and also of experiments in injecting fluid condensed
from expired air into animals. His results did not correspond to those
reported by Hammond, and there was no evidence of toxic properties
in the injected fluids.

Haldane and Smith, in 1892 (22), published an account of experiments
in which an air-tight chamber, 6 feet 2 inches high, 2 feet 11 inches wide,
and 3 feet 11 inches long, was employed. Samples of air for analysis
were drawn off through a tube placed in the wall of the chamber, about
3 feet from the floor. When one person remained in this chamber until
the vitiation was from ten to twenty times as great as in the most
crowded and worst ventilated public buildings, there was no percept-
ible odor or sense of oppression. Air vitiated to such an extent as to
completely prevent a match from burning had no appreciable effect
upon the subject of the experiment. In other experiments hyperpnea
and other phenomena produced were apparently due to the increased
proportion of carbonic acid.

With rabbits weighing 1,800 grams, hematuria was produced when
the amount of boiled distilled water injected passed beyond 100 e¢. c.,
and therefore 80 c. c. were taken as the maximum dose.

To obtain the condensed liquid from the lungs, a man expired
through a Liebig condenser, in the jacket of which was flowing a
stream of ice-cold water. The condensation liquid was collected in a
flask, the bulb of which was buried in ice; and when the required
amount (80 ¢. ¢.) had been obtained, it was at once injected into the
subcutaneous tissue of the back. Six rabbits were thus injected, each
with 80 ¢. ec. of the fluid, with no evident disturbance of health in any
of them; 80 ¢. ¢. to a rabbit corresponds to a dose of about 3 liters to a
man. They also repeated the experiments of Brown-Séquard and
d’Arsonval in supplying to the animals air charged with organic mat-
ter drawn directly from the lungs of other animals. Two large rabbits
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 397

were placed in an air-tight chamber and a current of air drawn through
this was supplied to two young rabbits under observation; no effect
was produced.

Merkel, in 1892 (23), reported an pea in which four air-tight
glass vessels, of 15 liters’ capacity, were connected by means of glass
tubes, a mouse being placed in each vessel. Between the third and
fourth vessels a Geissler absorption tube containing sulphurie acid
was interposed. Air was now drawn slowly through the vessels by
means of an aspirator, so that the second mouse breathed the air from
the first, the third from that of the second, etc. The result was, just
as in the experiment of Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval, that the mouse
in the third vessel died first, after sixteen to twenty hours, while that
in the fourth vessel remained alive.

The conclusion is drawn that, as the fourth mouse remained alive,
the death of the third can not have been due to excess of carbonic
acid, or deficiency of oxygen in the air, but must have been caused by
the presence of some volatile substance which is absorbed or destroyed
by sulphuric acid.

The symptoms presented by the mice before death were at first rest-
lessness and gradually increasing acceleration of respiration, afterwards
slowing of respiration, and finally spasmodic, deep respirations, becom-
ing constantly less frequent until the advent of death. The proportion
of carbonic acid in the air led through the glass vessels was not poison-
ous; it amounted in the highest case to 1.5 per cent.

He concludes that the expired breath of healthy persons contains a
volatile poison in extremely small quantities, being probably a base
which is poisonous in its gaseous state, but loses its toxicity after
combination with acids. His belief in the toxicity of the organic
matter contained in the expired breath of human beings is based solely
upon the results he obtained in the Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval
experiment.

Haldane and Smith, in 1893 (24), repeated the Brown-Séquard ex-
periment, using five bottles, each of a capacity of 1 to 14 liters, con-
nected by means of tubes. A mouse was placed in each bottle, and
ventilation established through the whole system by means of a filter
pump, a small gas-meter being placed between the last bottle and the
pump. Specimens of air leaving the last bottle were drawn off at
intervals for analysis. Full-grown mice were used. The mice in the
last two bottles were exposed to the full effect of the vitiated air for
fifty-three hours without detriment.

In a second experiment an absorption tube containing pumice stone
saturated with sulphuric acid was placed between the last two bottles.
This experiment was continued for thirty hours; no serious effects
were observed. The amount of ventilation furnished was from 15 to 24
liters per hour. The mice remained normal after having been in the
bottle three days, and the percentage of carbonic acid in the last bottle
had varied from 2.4 to 5.2, averaging about 3 per cent.
398 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

They state that these experiments, like their former ones on rabbits
and man, are distinctly against the theory that a volatile poison other
than carbonic acid exists in the expired air.

Beu, in 1893 (25), reported the results of experiments, made under
the direction of Uffelmann, in which the condensed moisture of expired
air was collected by the methods usually employed, taking the precau-
tion to cleanse his apparatus with solution of KMnO, and distilled
water, and likewise sterilizing the apparatus before it was brought
into use. The saliva is collected in a Woulff bottle attached before
the condenser. The amount of air expired, measured by a gas meter,
was found to be 3,000 liters in eight hours, from which he collected
100 ¢. c. of fluid. A distinct ammonia reaction was obtained upon
the addition of Nessler’s reagent. Nitrate of silver failed to show the
presence of chlorine.

Its reducing power upon solution of permanganate of potash showed
50 milligrams of oxygen necessary to oxidize 1 liter of fluid, or 15 mil-
ligrams in twenty-four hours, which denotes 0.0017 milligrams per liter
of expired air. The alkaloid reaction with AuCl;, KI, phosphomolyb-
date of potash, gave negative results.

He expired 500 liters through 150 c. ec. of a 1 per cent solution of
HCl, then evaporating to dryness on the water bath. <A yellowish-
brown deposit remained. This deposit, dissolved in distilled water,
formed a fatty layer on the surface of the slightly yellow fluid. The
whole quantity, 1.5 grams, was warmed to the body temperature and
injected under the skin of the back of a white mouse without produc-
ing observable symptoms. This fluid had a distinct odor not compar-
able to anything.

He next confined a mouse in a sealed glass vessel, having a globe
attached, with potash solution to absorb the carbonic acid; 3,200 expi-
rations of air were conducted into the glass vessel during the three
hours; no effect noticeable. In a second experiment the carbonic acid
was not absorbed, the experiment lasting four hours; no effect.

He repeated the Brown-Séquard experiment, using white mice in
four glass cages. The death of the animals, he believes, was due to
changes in the temperature and the accumulation of moisture in the
jars. He believes the protection afforded by H,SO, in Brown-Séquard
and d’Arsonval’s experiments was due to its abstraction of the mois-
ture from the air. An acute poisoning through the organic matters
contained in the expired air he believes to be impossible, at least as not
shown by anything in his experiments.

Rauer, in 1893 (26), used white mice confined in glass vessels of
about 14 liters’ capacity, the bottom of which was covered with oats.
The cork was perforated by three tubes. One of these passed down
near the bottom of the vessel and served for the entrance of air; the
second terminated just below the cork and served for the exit of air,
and the third extended down to about the height of the animal, but
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 399

was usually closed; this was only used for the removal of air for its
chemical examination. In the beginning thermometers and hygrome-
ters were used in the vessels, but they were found to be unimportant
and were abandoned. The whole apparatus was connected with a large
aspirator.

In an experiment with five animals and a ventilation of 4 liters per
hour, the carbonic acid was found to amount to 9.5 per cent after five
hours. In another experiment with six animals and with a ventilation
of 24 liters per hour, he inserted four absorption tubes, with soda lime
between the last two jars, and a Geissler tube containing concentrated
H,SO, between the fourth and fifth. The sixth animal remained alive,
while the fifth died earlier than the fifth animal in the first experi-
ment. He concludes that there is no organic poison in expired air,
death being due to the excess of carbonic acid in the atmospheres of
the jars.

Sanfelice, in 1893 (27), reported that he had repeated the Ham-
mond experiment, using a flask of about 5 liters’ capacity, the animal
dying in six or seven hours. He is undecided as to the existence of a
volatile expiratory poison, though he thinks that other factors, for
instance, heat radiation, have an important influence upon the results.

Liibbert and Peters, in 1894 (28), reported that they had repeated
the Brown-Séquard experiment, placing a guinea pig in each of a
series of four flasks. Between the third and fourth flasks they placed
a combustion tube through which the air coming from the third flask
was conducted, passing over red-hot cupric oxide, to remove the organic
matter. Before reaching the fourth flask, the air was again cooled by
conducting it through a cylinder surrounded with ice. In this manner
all moisture contained in the air was condensed. From this cylinder the
air passes through a series of twelve U-tubes, each made from a piece of
tubing 80 centimeters in length and of. 2 millimeters internal diameter.
During its passage through these U-tubes the air assumed a tempera-
ture of about 18° C. as it entered the fourth flask. The results obtained
by this arrangement substantiated the conclusions they had formed from
conducting the experiment in the ordinary manner, that the cause of
death was traceable to the high per cent of carbonic acid. The removal
of the organic matter by combustion failed to save the life of the animal
in the last jar when the carbonic acid had increased to 11 or 12 per cent.
After the absorption of the carbonic acid by means of soda lime the
last animal remained alive. They conclude, therefore, that the poison-
ous expiratory poison of Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval does not exist,
but that death is produced by the excess of carbonic acid in the flasks.

Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval, in 1894 (29), reported further exper-
iments, and at the same time gave fuller details as to all their experi-
ments and the apparatus employed. They had inoculated over 100
animals with the condensed fluid of respiration and believed in the
truth of their former statements as firmly as ever. They could not

400 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

understand the failures on the part of the other experimenters. They
emphatically reaffirm that the expired breath of man and animals con-
tains a volatile organic poison producing the results reported by them,
and that these results are not produced by excess of carbonic acid or
deficiency of oxygen in the air.

From the foregoing summary of the reports of different experimenters,
it will be seen that widely different results have been reported by them,
but that the majority of the later investigators agree in denying that
the exhaled breath of healthy human beings or of animals contains a
poisonous organic alkaloid, or any poisonous product other than ear-
bonic acid, yet in any case positive results require an explanation
which shall account for the facts.

DR. BERGEY’S EXPERIMENTS.

The first experiments made by Dr. Bergey were to ascertain whether
the condensed moisture of air expired by man in ordinary, quiet respi-
ration contains any particulate organic matters, such as microorgan-
isms, epithelial scales, etc. The test for microorganisms was made by
having an adult man expire for from twenty to thirty minutes through
sterilized melted gelatin, which was then preserved as a culture for
from twenty to thirty days. In the first trial, six, and in the second,
two colonies of common air organisms developed: but when special
care was taken to thoroughly sterilize the vessels used, the result was
that in two consecutive trials the gelatin remained sterile. Epithelial
scales and other particulate matters were sought for by condensing the
vapor of the exhaled breath and examining the product with the micro-
scope, with and without the use of stains. In six preparations thus
examined no bacteria or epithelial cells were found. This result was
to be expected, since neither bacteria nor wetted particles pass into the
air from the surface of fluids, or from moist surfaces, unless the air
currents are sufficiently powerful to take up particles of the liauid
itself in the form of spray.

Abbott (30), in his paper on sewer gas, reports some experiments made
to determine the possibility of conveying microorganisms from liquid eul-
ture media by means of a current of air bubbling through such media;
also by means of ordinary baker’s yeast inoculated into media contain-
ing from 4 to 5 per cent of glucose. No bacteria were carried from the
culture by the exploding air bubbles produced by the yeast, but a cur.
rent of air equal to 34 liters in six hours, bubbling through a liquid
culture, carried with it some of the organisms in the culture.

The determinations of ammonia in the condensed fluid of expired air,
the estimation of its reducing power upon solution of permanganate
of potash, and its reaction with various reagents, were made with fluids
collected from a healthy man, from a man with a tracheal fistula follow-
ing excision of the larynx, the expired air not coming in contact with
the mouth or the pharynx, and from a man suffering from well-marked

tuberculosis of the lungs. In each case the amount of ammonia and of
albuminoid ammonia in the fluid was very small, the average being, in
grams per liter of fluid:

|

The oxidizable matter in these fluids, as shown by their reducing
power on a solution of permanganate of potash, was determined. The
average results, stated in milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of
condensed fluid, are as follows: Healthy man, 10.72; man with tracheal
fistula, 13.49; consumptive, 19.34. The high average for the man with
the tracheal fistula is due to a single observation, for which the figure
was 24.916. Omitting this, the average for the three other observations
would be 9.68.

The average for five specimens of fluid condensed from the expired
air of a healthy man four hours after he had taken a meal was 11.98,
while the average for six specimens from the breath of the same man
half an hour after the meal was only 3.86. For two specimens from the
same man collected three and a half and four hours after a meal, but
just after the mouth had been thoroughly rinsed with warm water, the
average was 2.49. These results indicate that the ammonia and oxi.
dizable organic matter in the condensed fluid were, to a large extent,
due to products of decomposition of organic matters in the mouth. The
well-known fact that the amount of oxygen absorbed and of carbonic
acid given off varies according to whether the person is fasting or has
recently taken a meal, may possibly be in part due to the same cause,
but the results obtained by Birkholz (31) indicate that it can only be
in part. Ransome (8) reports no marked difference in the amount of
ammonia, or of oxidizable organic matter, as determined by the per-
manganate test, contained in the fluids collected from the exhaled
breath soon after a meal and in that collected from a fasting person.
Beu (25) found a much higher proportion of oxidizable matter in the
fluid condensed from his own breath (50 milligrams of oxygen required
per liter of fluid) than was found in Dr. Bergey’s experiments. His
results indicated the exhalation of 15 milligrams of organic matter in
twenty-four hours, the corresponding figure from Ransome’s results
being 20 milligrams. About 12 c.c. of fluid was collected from about
ovo liters of air expired per hour, being nearly equal to the results
obtained by Beu (25), who condensed 100 c. c. of the fluid from 3 cubic
meters of air expired in eight hours.

Renk (32, p. 162) gives a table showing that in an average quantity
_ of 9,000 liters of air expired in a day by a healthy man, the amount of
7 moisture may be from 200 to 400 grams, depending on the temperature
SM 95——26
402 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

and relative humidity of the inspired air. With air containing 50 per
cent of moisture inspired at 25° C., the amount of moisture is 293 grams,
or about the result given by Beu, referred to above.

Lehmann and Jessen (19) found that between 3 and 4 milligrams of
oxygen were required in 1 liter of fluid to effect oxidation, and note
that more ammonia was present in the fluid collected from a person
with decayed teeth than in that obtained from a person whose teeth
were sound. The very considerable differences in the amounts of
ammonia and of oxidizable matter found in the fluid condensed from
expired air by different experimenters, and by the same experimenter,
in fluids obtained from the same person at different times, are probably
due to several different causes and their combinations. The amount
of fluid condensed per liter of expired air varies from 0.003 to 0.004 c. ¢.
The soundness and cleanliness of the mouth and teeth influence the
amount of ammonia and oxidizable matter expired. Variations in the
amount of organic matter contained in the inhaled air may possibly
influence the result, but this influence must be slight. Ransome’s
results indicate that the age, health, and vigor of the person may affect
the amount of organic matter exhaled, and Dr. Bergey’s experiments
with the fluid obtained from the consumptive patient show that a smaller
proportion of ammonia and a larger amount of oxidizable matter were
present in it than in the fluid collected from a healthy man. It should
be remembered, also, that it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate
results in quantitative determinations of such very minute amounts of
ammonia and oxidizable matters as are found in expired air, and a
part of the differences in results obtained is no doubt due to unnoted
differences in the details of the experiment.

The results of tests for the presence of an organic alkaloid in the
condensed fluids obtained by Dr. Bergey were negative, corresponding
to those reported by Lehmann and Jessen (19) and by Beu (25).

The results of attempts to condense the moisture of the air in the
hospital ward were not satisfactory, and the determinations of ammonia
in the fluid obtained are not comparable, except they show that the
placing of a dust filter in front of the condensing apparatus causes
a marked reduction in the proportion of ammonia in the condensed fluid.
The evaporation equaled the condensation except on days when the
external air was saturated with moisture, hence no moisture was col-
lected on clear days, but on such days some dust particles may haye-
accumulated in the apparatus which had no filter.

Several series of experiments were made to determine the nature
of the gaseous mixtures in which small animals die with symptoms of
asphyxia. The first of these series were repetitions of the experiments
reported by Hammond and described above. Mice and sparrows were
used. It was found impossible, by Hammond’s method, to absorb all
the carbonic acid produced by an animal. At the time of death of the
sparrows, the carbonic acid had inereased until it formed from 12.27
THE COMPOSITION OIF EXPIRED AIR. 403

to 14.08, or an average for eight experiments of 13.24 per cent of the
air, while the oxygen had diminished to from 3.25 to 5.61, or an average
of 4.67 per cent of the air. The symptoms observed were those pro-
duced by insufficiency of oxygen, and there was no evidence that death
was due to organic matters in the air. The duration of life in the ani-
mals confined was from three to six hours, being much longer than that
reported by Hammond, using a slightly smaller vessel, viz, less than

one hour, and corresponds to the results reported by Sanfelice (33),

who found that the animals lived from six to seven hours. When the

experiment was so modified that all the carbonic acid was removed
from the air breathed by the animal, the animal did not die in seven

hours, although the percentage of oxygen had been reduced to 18.35.

These experiments, therefore, furnish no evidence of the existence of

an organic poison in the expired air, but the method of absorbing

carbonie acid by an alkali is said by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval

(16) to change the organic poison which they claim to be present, and

hence these experiments are not conclusive on this point.

A series of experiments was also made upon mice and sparrows to
determine the time required to produce death by asphyxia when the
animal is confined in a jar of known capacity, when no provision is
made for removing carbonic acid and moisture, or for supplying fresh
air, and also to determine the proportions of carbonic acid and of oxy-
gen existing in the inclosed air at the time of death. In connection
with these experiments, it was also sought to determine the influence
which high or low temperatures of the air would have on the result.

A mouse weighing 21 grams, placed in a jar of 1,000 c. ¢. capacity at
a temperature of 30° C., lived four hours; in a jar of 2,000 ¢. c. capacity
a Similar mouse lived seven and a half hours; in one case when the
room temperature was 25.5° C., in another case when the room temper-
ature was 0° ©. In the first case, death occurred when the amount of
carbonic acid was 12 and that of the exygen 8.6 per cent of the mix-
ture; in the second case, the proportions were 13.2 per cent of carbonic
acid and 6.4 per cent of oxygen; and in the third case, 10 per cent of
earbonie acid and 9.2 per cent of oxygen. There are considerable dif-

_ ferences in susceptibility to the effects of an impure atmosphere in
individual mice, but when a mouse is placed in a closed jar containing
ordinary atmospheric air, the time required to produce death is usually
that required to produce the proportions of carbonic acid and of oxy-

_ gen indicated above, and, hence, is in proportion to the size of the jar.

_A mouse should live about twice as long in a jar of 2,000 c.c¢. as in one

of 1,000 c. ¢., other conditions as to temperature, etc., being the same,
and commencing with ordinary atmospheric air.

The duration of life in the experiments with atmospheric air in closed
vessels, making due allowance for variations in the air volume, coin-
cides quite closely with the duration of life in the Hammond experi-
 mnent. The air analyses at death of the animals in the two forms of

AQA THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

experiment, also gave very similar results. In comparing the results
it is necessary to bear in mind the differences in the size of the Jars and
in the weight of the animals used in the several experiments. Asa
general rule, the animal dies when the carbonic acid has increased to
between 12 and 13 per cent and the oxygen has diminished to between
5 and 6 per cent. Is death due to the increase in the carbonie acid, or
to the diminution in the oxygen, or to both?

Some data for answering this question are presented, showing the
results obtained by placing animals in gaseous mixtures containing
various proportions of carbonic acid, oxygen, and nitrogen. The ani-
mals experimented on were mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and spar-
rows. The diminution in oxygen in the inspired air was the most
important factor in producing death, and so long as the oxygen is pres-
ent in the proportion of 6 per cent and upward, carbonic acid may be
present to the amount of 20 per cent without causing death. When
the carbonic acid forms much more than 20 per cent of the mixture,
say 30 to 40 per cent, the oxygen must form at least 12 per cent to
preserve life.

If the proportion of oxygen in the mixture be reduced, the duration

In these experiments, the proportion of oxygen was reduced to about
one-half of that in the normal atmosphere, and the dutanion of life
was also reduced about one-half.

The toleration which is acquired by an animal by prolonged sojourn
in an atmosphere which is gradually becoming richer in carbonic acid
and poorer in oxygen, makes it impossible to compare the results as to
duration of life in such experiments with the results of experiments
in which the animal is placed at once in an atmosphere containing
abnormal proportions of these gases, so far as the effects of increase of
carbonic acid and diminution of oxygen are concerned, but death does
not occur in atmospheres in which the carbonic acid does not exceed
10 per cent unless the oxygen is reduced to below 7 per cent of the
mixture.

A series of experiments was made by injecting into animals the fluid
condensed from the air expired by healthy persons and by a man with
a tracheal fistula, from whom it was possible to obtain such fluid without
contamination from the exhalations from the mouth. The injections
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 405

- were made into the general circulation in rabbits, and into the peri-
toneal cavities of rabbits, guinea pigs, and white rats, following the
methods employed by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval and by V. Hof-
mann-Wellenhof. The fluid was collected with the greatest care in a
sterilized apparatus; subsequent cultures made from it indicating that
it was sterile. It was warmed to about 35° C. before injection. The
proportion injected, as compared with the body weight of the animals,
was, In some instances, less than that used by Brown-Séquard and
d’Arsonval, in others greater than the smallest quantities used by them
with fatal effects.

In most of the animals no observable disturbance of health was pro-
duced, nor did this condition alter in the course of several months
during which they were kept under observation. One rabbit died
thirty-two days after having received an injection into its peritoneal
cavity of 5¢. ¢. of fluid condensed from the breath of a man with tra-
cheal fistula. The results of post-mortem examination showed focal
necrosis in the liver, but no eechymoses and hemorrhages in the lungs
and intestines, such as are reported as a characteristic result of such
injections by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval. Three other rabbits
which had received injections of the condensed fluid, and had remained
apparently perfectly well from six weeks to seven months, were killed
and careful post-mortem examinations made. The results of these
examinations showed that there was no special disease or degeneration
in the organs of these animals.

The results of this series of experiments are, therefore, in accord
with those reported by V. Hofmann-Wellenhof, and indicate that fluid
condensed from the pulmonary exhalations of man has no toxie or
specially injurious effect when injected into animals, and that there is
no evidence that such fluid contains an organie poison.

The attempt to collect condensed moisture from the air of the hospital
ward was but partially successful, as has been stated above, and a suf-
ficient amount of the fluid to make injection experiments was not
directly obtained. To overcome this difficulty, the air of the ward was
drawn over sterilized glycerin, which was then diluted with distilled
water, and the product injected into animals. Three of the animals
thus injected died between four and six weeks later, but the post-mortem
examinations failed to show any clear connection between the injection
and the fatal result. As it was shown that the fluid collected and that
the dust in the ward contained several species of bacteria, including
pathogenic forms, it was to be expected that more definite results would
have been obtained, but the power of the cells and tissues to resist the
pathogenic organisms was sufficient to prevent their action in each case,

except, perhaps, in one, in which the abscess produced may have been

due to pyogenic bacteria in the injected fluid.
A number of experiments were made in which animals, in a series of
bell jars, were caused to breathe air which became more contaminated
406 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

with the products of respiration as it passed through the series, being
a repetition of the experiments of Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonyal.

In the great majority of cases, death was evidently due to the dimi-
nution in the oxygen and increase in the carbonic acid, the proportions
of these gases present in the jar when an animal died being that as
reported, i. e., the oxygen was reduced to between 4 and 6 per cent and
the carbonic acid increased to from 12 to 14 percent. The mode of death
of the animals was similar to that observed in slow asphyxia, and the
results of careful post-mortem examination and microscopic investiga-
tion do not indicate the effects of any organic poison.

The insertion of absorption tubes containing caustic alkalies between
the bell jars, to absorb the carbonic acid, and of concentrated sulphuric
acid, did not give results corresponding to those reported by Brown-
Séquard and d’Arsonval.

The mice became habituated, to a certain extent at least, to the con-
ditions under which they were placed, and could live in an atmosphere
which was almost immediately fatal to a fresh mouse placed init. This
had already been demonstrated by Bernard. In the case of several
mice, this power to resist the foul atmosphere was preserved for from
three to eight days after they had been removed from the jar, so that
they had a certain degree of permanent immunity. Hxperiments were
made to see if it was possible to develop such an immunity, and the
results obtained indicate such a possibility, but further investigation
will be necessary to settle this important point. At present it is uncer-
tain to what extent the immunity observed in a few mice was possessed
by them before they were experimented on, or was produced by their
first exposures to the vitiated atmospheres.

From the data accumulated with reference to the composition of the
atmosphere in these bell jars by repeated analyses at short intervals,
compared with the results reported by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonyal,
it seems probable that the cases in which the last animal in the series
survived some of the others, and a low percentage of carbonic acid was
found in the jar, should be attributed entirely to defeets either in
methods of air analyses or in the apparatus, or in both. If, however,
the life of the last animal was apparently saved by H,SO, in Dr. Ber-
gey’s experiments, it was due to leakage in the connections from the
increased resistance caused by the interposition of the absorption tube.
This is an important fact, which is in direct opposition to the theory of
Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval with regard to the influence of the
H,SO, in the absorption tubes. The great differences in individual
susceptibility of different animals must also be taken into account in
considering the results of these experiments. In some mice there
seems to be a very considerable immunity against the asphyxiating
effect of an atmosphere poor in oxygen and rich in carbonie acid.

The duration of life of individual animals in experiments of this kind
depends upon the size of the bell jars in relation to the size of the
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. 407

3 animal, on the amount of fresh air supplied, on conditions of tempera-
- ture and moisture, and on individual peculiarities of the animal; and
- it seems probable that variations in these factors will account for the
different results obtained by different experimenters. The symptoms
in the animals which died were those of death by slow asphyxia.
Microscopic examination of the organs presented a picture coinciding
with the gross post-mortem appearances. In the lungs the capillaries
were found to be distended with blood, occluding in many cases the
lumen of the alveoli and air cells, and presenting a typical picture of
passive hyperemia. In the liver, kidneys, and spleen, as well as in the
intestines, the capillaries were likewise overloaded with blood. Patho-
logical changes were but rarely noted, and some of these, such as slight
proliferation of connective-tissue elements between the tubules of the
kidney, and in rarer instances, in the interlobular spaces of the liver,
- are such as are occasionally found in animals which have not been sub-
jected to such conditions, and may, therefore, have existed in the ani-
mals at the beginning of the experiment. All the changes which were
constantly present may properly be attributed to the action of the car-
bonic acid and the low percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, inter-
fering with the circulation and aeration of the blood. The lesions
reported by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval as characteristic in such
cases were not seen. No focal necroses or peculiar uniform degenera-
tive changes were found. The results of these experiments, therefore,
do not agree with those reported by Brown-Séquard and d’Arsonval—
and furnish no evidence of the existence of an organic poison in the air
expired by animals.
CONCLUSIONS.

1. The results obtained in this research indicate that in air expired
by healthy mice, sparrows, rabbits, guinea pigs, or men, there is no
peculiar organic matter which is poisonous to the animals mentioned
(excluding man), or which tends to produce in these animals any spe-
cial form of disease. The injurious effects of such air observed appeared
to be due entirely to the diminution of oxygen, or the increase of car-
bonie acid, or to a combination of these two factors. They also make
it very improbable that the minute quantity of organic matter con-
tained in the air expired from human lungs has any deleterious influence
upon men who inhale it in ordinary rooms, and, hence, it is probably
unnecessary to take this factor into account in providing for the ven-
tilation of such rooms.

2. In ordinary, quiet respiration, no bacteria, epithelial scales, or
particles of dead tissue are contained in the expired air. In the act of
coughing or sneezing, such organisms or particles may probably be
thrown out.

3. The minute quantity of ammonia, or of combined nitrogen, or.

other oxidizable matters, found in the condensed moisture of human
breath appears to be largely due to products of the decomposition of

408 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

organic matter which is constantly going on in the mouth and pharynx.
This is shown by the effects of cleansing the mouth and teeth upon the
amount of such matters in the condensed moisture of the breath and
also by the differences in this respect between the air exhaled through
a tracheal fistula and that expired in the usual way.

4, The air in an inhabited room, such as the hospital ward in which
experiments were made, is contaminated from many sources besides the
expired air of the occupants, and the most important of these contam-
inations are in the form of minute particles or dusts. The experiments
on the air of the hospital ward and with the moisture condensed there-
from show that the greater part of the ammonia in the air was proba-
bly connected with dust particles which could be removed by a filter.
They also showed that in this dust there were microorganisms, includ-
ing some of the bacteria which produce inflammation and suppuration,
and it is probable that these were the only really dangerous elements
in this air.

5. The experiments in which animals were compelled to breathe air
vitiated by the products of either their own respiration or by those of
other animals, or were injected with fluid condensed from expired air,
gave results contrary to those reported by Hammond, by Brown-
Séquard and d’Arsonval, and by Merkel, but corresponding to those
reported by Dastre and Loye, Russo-Giliberti and Alessi, Hofmann-
Wellenhof, Rauer, and other experimenters referred to in the prelim-
inary historical sketch of this report, and make it improbable that there
is any peculiar volatile poisonous matter in the air expired by healthy
men and animals other than carbonie acid. It must be borne in mind,
however, that the results of such experiments upon animals as are
referred to in this report may be applicable only in part to human
beings. It does not necessarily follow that a man would not be injured
by continually living in an atmosphere containing 2 parts per 1,000 of
carbonic acid and other products of respiration, cf cutaneous excretion,
and of putrefactive decomposition of organic matters, because it is
found that a mouse, a guinea pig, or a rabbit seems to suffer no ill
effects from living under such conditions for several days, weeks, or
months, but it does follow that the evidence which has heretofore been
supposed to demonstrate the evil effects of bad ventilation upon human
health should be carefully scrutinized.

6. The effects of reduction of oxygen and increase of carbonic acd to
a certain degree appear to be the same in artificial mixtures of these
gases aS In air in which the change of proportion of these gases has
been produced by respiration.

7. The effect of habit, which may enable an animal to live in an
atmosphere in which, by gradual change, the proportion of oxygen has
become so low and that of the carbonic acid so high that a similar
animal brought from fresh air into it dies almost immediately, has been
observed before, but we are not aware that a continuance of this
Ren:

immunity produced by it had been previously noted. The experiments
show that such an immunity may either exist normally or be produced
in certain mice, but that these cases are very exceptional, and it is very
desirable that a special research should be made to determine, if pos-
sible, the conditions upon which such a continuance of immunity
depends.

8. An excessively high or low temperature has a decided effect upon
the production of asphyxia by diminution of oxygen and increase of
carbonic acid. At high temperatures the respiratory centers are
affected, where evaporation from the skin and mucous surfaces is
checked by the air being saturated with moisture; at low temperatures
the consumption of oxygen increases, and the demand for it becomes
more urgent.

So far as the acute effects of excessively foul air at high temperatures
are concerned, such, for example, as appeared in the Black Hole at
Calcutta, it is probable that they are due to substantially the same
causes in man as in animals.

9. The proportion of increase of carbonic acid and of diminution of
oxygen, which has been found to exist in badly ventilated churches,
schools, theater's, or barracks, is not sufficiently great to satisfactorily
account for the great discomfort which such conditions produce in many
persons, and there is no evidence to show that such an amount of
change in the normal proportion of these gases has any influence upon
the increase of disease and death rates which statistical evidence has
shown to exist among persons living in crowded and unventilated
rooms. The report of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the
reculations affecting the sanitary conditions of the British army (1)
properly lays great stress on,the fact that in civilians at soldiers’ ages,
in twenty-four large towns, the death rate per 1,000 was 11.9, while in
the foot guards it was 20.4 and in the infantry of the line 17.9, and
showed that this difference was mainly due to diseases of the lungs
occurring in soldiers in crowded and unventilated barracks. These
observations have since been repeatedly confirmed by statistics derived
from other armies, from prisons, and from the death rates of persons
engaged in different occupations, and in all cases tubercular disease of
the lungs and pneumonia are the diseases which are most prevalent
among persons living and working in unventilated rooms, unless such
persons are of the Jewish race. But consumption and pneumonia are
caused by specific bacteria, which, for the most part, gain access to
the air passages by adhering to particles of dust which are inhaled,
and it is probable that the greater liability to these diseases of persons
living in crowded and unventilated rooms is to a large extent due to
the special liability of such rooms to become infected with the germs
of these diseases. It is, however, by no means demonstrated as yet
that the only deleterious effect which the air of crowded barracks or
tenement-house rooms, or of foul courts and narrow streets, exerts upon

410 THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR.

the persons who breathe it is due to the greater number of pathogenic
microorganisms in such localities. It is quite possible that such im-
pure atmospheres may affect the vitality and the bactericidal powers
of the cells and fluids of the upper air passages with which they come
in contact, and may thus predispose to infections, the potential causes
of which are almost everywhere present, and especially in the upper air
passages and in the alimentary canal of even the healthiest persons,
but of this we have as yet no scientific evidence. It is very desirable
that researches should be made on this point.

10. The discomfort produced by crowded, ill-ventilated rooms in per-
sons not accustomed to them is not due to the excess of carbonic acid,
nor to bacteria, nor, in most cases, to dusts of any kind. The two
great causes of such discomfort, though not the only ones, are exces-
sive temperature and unpleasant odors. Such rooms as those referred
to are generally overheated, the bodies of the occupants and, at night,
the usual means of illumination contributing to this result.

The cause of the unpleasant, musty odor which is perceptible to most
persons on. passing from the outer air into a crowded, unventilated room
is unknown; it may, in part, be due to volatile products of decomposi-
tion contained in the expired air of persons having decayed teeth, foul
mouths, or certain disorders of the digestive apparatus, and it is due,
in part, to volatile fatty acids given off with, or produced from, the
excretions of the skin, and from clothing soiled with such excretions.
It may produce nausea and other disagreeable sensations in specially
susceptible persons, but most men soon become accustomed to it, and
cease to notice it, as they will do with regard to the odor of a smoking
car, or of a soap factory, after they have been for some time in the place.
The direct and indirect effects of odors of various kinds upon the com-
fort, and perhaps also upon the health, of men are more considerable
than would be indicated by any tests now known for determining the
nature and quantity of the matters which give rise to them. The
remarks of Renk (32, p. 174) upon this point merit consideration. Cases
of fainting in crowded rooms usually occur in women, and are connected
with defective respiratory action due to tight lacing or other causes.

Other causes of discomfort in rooms heated by furnaces or by steam
are excessive dryness of the air, and the presence of small quantities
of carbonic oxide, of illuminating gas, or of arsenic derived from the
coal used for heating.

11. The results of this investigation, taken in connection with the
results of other recent researches summarized in this report, indicate
that some of the theories upon which modern systems of ventilation
are based are either without foundation or doubtful, and that the prob-
lem of securing comfort and health in inhabited rooms requires the
consideration of the best methods of preventing or disposing of dusts
of various kinds, of properly regulating temperature and moisture,
THE COMPOSITION OF EXPIRED AIR. All

and of preventing the entrance of poisonous gases like carbonic oxide
derived from heating and lighting apparatus, rather than upon simply
diluting the air toacertain standard of proportion of carbonic acid present.

It would be very unwise to conclude, from the facts given in this
report, that the standards of air supply for the ventilation of inhabited
rooms, which standards are now generally accepted by sanitarians as
the result of the work of Pettenkofer, De Chaumont, and others, are
much too large under any circumstances, or that the differences in
heaith and vigor between those who spend the greater part of their
lives in the open air of the country hills, and those who live in the city
slums, do not depend in any way upon the differences between the
atmospheres of the two localities except as regards the number and
character of microorganisms.

PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT!

By RAPHAEL DUBOIS,
Professor of General and Comparative Physiology in the Faculty of Sciences at Lyons.

PART FIRST.—PHOTOGENIC ORGANISMS.

One of the most curious phenomena of life is unquestionably the
property possessed by certain organisms of radiating into space, as
luminous vibrations, a partof the energy that animates them. It might
be said that these vibrations are those of life itself, since they emanate
from a living substance that dies in generating them. This light being
physiological in its origin, I have called its production the photogenic
function. Its study comprises one of the most interesting and most
important chapters of general physiology—that branch of science
which embraces the history of the phenomena of life common to ani-
mals and vegetabies.

I

The existence of the photogenic function has been demonstrated de
visu in numerous species belonging to the two kingdoms, and it might
perhaps be found in all living creatures if we possessed instruments of
sufficient delicacy to detect it; but this is pure hypothesis.

In vegetables this function has been observed with certainty only in
organisms destitute of chlorophyll or, occasionally, in parts deprived of
the chlorophyll-making function (the yellow flowers of the French and
African marigolds, of the nasturtium, aud others of the same color), and
theretore corresponding closely with animals as to their general nutri-
tion. But itis only in mushrooms and white alge that the photogenic
function has been studied in a truly scientific manner.

The family of Bacteriaceew includes many photogenic species, both
marine and terrestrial, that form the gents Photobacterium. The
marine Photobacteriacee live free in the sea or on the surface of fishes,
crustaceans, cephalopods, and many other animals; but they do not
generally become luminous until after the death of their host, and after
being out of the water from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. As soon

as putrefaction appears, the luminosity which they imparted to these
cadavers ceases. Some Photobacteriacee live in a state of symbiosis
upon species of animals that possess a luminosity of their own (Pholas
dactylus, Pelagia noctiluca). In other cases they behave like true path-
ogenic parasites. When introduced, either accidentally or experimen-
tally, under the carapace of certain marine or terrestrial crustacea
(Talytres, Cloportes), they develop and invade the entire body. The
animal thus invaded becomes luminous, but it shortly dies. The
attempts made to inoculate animals of higher organization with these
pathogenic microbes have hitherto failed. Still, it is quite probable
that the cases of phosphorescent urine, saliva, sweat, and even
wounds, observed principally in man, have had no other cause—an
important matter to definitely ascertain. Unhappily for science, exam-
ples of these singular affections, which, by the way, do not appear to
be dangerous, are more rare than those of mammals that become lumi-
nous after death. Besides the phosphorescence of the human cadaver,
which has been observed several times, there have occurred in butchers’
stalls and slaughterhouses true luminous epidemics affecting sometimes
pork, sometimes beef sometimes horse meat. In the general physio-
logical laboratory at Lyons, a case of luminosity in the domestic rabbit
has been recently studied, and from it was prepared, for the first time,
a pure culture of a photobacterium of the flesh of mammals, the Photo-
bacterium sarcophilum (fig. 1). This discovery has led to the elucidation
of several important points in the biology of these curious parasites.
The Photobacteriacew usually have the form of an elongated sole;
their length varies between 2 and 4 y and their breadth between 1 and
2 yw’. Some seven or eight species, or perhaps varieties, are distin-
guished. Some are very polymorphous and may change into micro.
cocci, into commas, into filaments, without ceasing to be luminous.
At other times, while the form remains the same, the photogenic func-
tion may be made to disappear by slightly modifying the culture
medium, and inversely, the bacteria which have been extinguished may
by the same means be lighted up again even after quite a long time.
These facts show that the photogenic function is independent of the
form of the creature. These microbes are readily cultivated in bou-
illon of gelatin peptone containing 4 per cent of sea salt. While the
Photobacterium sarcophilum develops well in liquid bouillons, it is the
first photogenic microbe which has been successfully cultivated in
a fluid medium containing only substances having a definite chemical
composition, such as water, glycerin, phosphates, asparagin, sea salt.
It also presents a peculiarity not found in other species, and which it
is well to note, because it may explain why certain pathogenic agents
infect all individuals without distinction, while others attack only those
which have a special, morbid predisposition. With the exception of

‘The 4, which is the unit of length in micrography, is equal to the thousandth of
a millimeter.
PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT. 415

the Photobacterium sarcophilum, the Photobacteriacee are not luminous
in acid gelatin peptone. That bacterium, however, does not really form
an exception to the common law, but it possesses the property of secret-
ing an alkaline substance which, by neutralizing the acid medium, per-
mits the photogenic function to operate. It therefore creates for itself
a medium where others would succumb to the influence of the environ-
ment.

The luminosity quite frequently seen in autumn in the forests on dead
leaves or on fragments of young or old wood, and even in mines on
worm-eaten beams, is often, if not always, due to the vegetative organs
of mushrooms of quite high organization, especially certain Hymeno-
mycetes, the Agaricus melleus, for example, whose slender filaments
penetrate the ligneous tissues, forming an easily recognized, whitish
network. These luminous myceliums have even been sxecessfully cul-
tivated. Still, I have vainly sought them on pieces of very young wood,
freshly broken, that presented over their entire surfaces a steady and
regular phosphorescence that in certain cases might indeed be a
result of a necrobiotic alteration of the tissues or the work of microbic
parasites. But the microbes found on these fragments have not pro-
duced luminous cultures, neither have those which live in symbiosis on
the higher photogenic mushrooms.

In certain mushrooms at an adult age the photogenic function is
well marked. The lamin of the Agaricus olearius, which is quite
common in Provence at the foot of olive trees, gives out a bluish light
that follows the fluctuations of vitality in the mushroom. It does not
reside in any specially differentiated part, but only where the spores
are developed.

Luminous exotic mushrooms are quite numerous. There is known
in Brazil the Agaricus Gardneri, in Australia the Agaricus phosphoreus,
candescens, lampas, illuminans, etc., whose names indicate their singu-
lar property. Some of them give enough light to make it possible to
read by means of this living torch.

It can not be affirmed that in the vegetables we have mentioned the
light is the result of a secretion. It seems rather to have its origin in
the protoplasm, for when a bouillon made luminous by Photobacteria is
filtered through a porcelain tube it loses its light; it would be other-
wise if the photogenic substance were really dissolved in the ambient
liquid.

II.

The photogenic function is likewise widely found among very inferior
animals, the Noctiluca miliaris, for example, to which is often due the
splendid phenomena of ocean phosphorescence. Besides its envelope,
some intercellular liquid, its digestive vesicles, and a flagellum, the
structure of the Noctiluca is that of an active, contractile, protoplas-
mic mass, surrounding a nucleus and sending toward the internal wall
416 P PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

of its envelope numerous retractile and excitable prolongations. It is
in this last tract that we see formed rounded granulations having a
special refractive power that we shall henceforth find in all photogenic
elements.

Mechanical, physical, and chemical stimuli cause the interior of the
Noctiluce to shine, and they then appear to the naked eye like little
stars emitting a steady light. But with sufficient magnification this
apparently uniform glow is resolved into a multitude of little, brilliant
points or sparks that, by their form and distribution, correspond to
the refringent granulations of which we have already spoken.

The photogenic function is widely distributed in the class of Celen-
terata. There is, it is true, but one luminous species known among
the sponges, but they are numerous among the Cnidaria and have
been well studied in the Anthozoa of the family of the Pennatulide. —

In abyssal regions numerous polyps with horny or calcareous axes,
such as Isis, Gorgon, or Mopsea, form veritable luminous forests, pro-
ducing a truly fairy-like effect.

Among the Pennatulide the photogenic function is already localized.
It has its seat in the eight cords which adhere to the external surface
of the gastro-vascular cavity of polyps and zooids and extends as far as
the buccal papille. The light originates in cells containing an adipoid
material and very numerous rounded, albuminoid granulations. In
these cells, as with the Noctiluce, mechanical, electrical, and chemical
stimuli induce a luminous explosion that is transmitted from one place
to another in a very regular manner, from the foot of the polyp toward
the extremity of the arms or inversely, with more or less extensive
generalizaticn, according to the intensity of the stimulus.

The granulations of the luminous cells seem to be formed under
stimulation by a phenomenon analogous to that of the formation of
crystals by the agitation of a saturated solution; at least that is what
occurs in the ectodermic cells of Hippopodius gleba. That elegant
celenterate is composed of a series of horseshoe-shaped segments,
transparent as crystal when the animal is not stimulated, but, when
the ectoderm is touched, the cells which compose it become at once
opalescent or milky by the formation of a multitude of granulations,
and emit a magnificent, azure-blue light. The simultaneous oceur-
rence of these phenomena is very striking in this particular case.

Stimulation of the ectoderm also produces light in certain Meduse,
such as Cunina albescens and Pelagia noctiluca. In the latter the pho-
togenic function is localized in the epithelium of the external surface,
the radial canals, and the genital glands. The tesselated cells that
compose this epithelium have a nucleus that is often masked by a mul-
titude of fine and very re‘ringent granulations, varying in color from
yellow to orange.

When these cells break down they form a luminous mucus that
adheres to the fingers and continues to shine for a considerable time.

Many Ctenephora, among which may be cited the Cestide, the Cydip-
pide, the Beroide, are luminous. The photogenic elements generally
surround the costal vascular canals and sometimes also the canals of
the gastro-vascular network. The embryo of Beroes, while yet in the
egg, is luminous, and usually, if not invariably, photogenic animals
transmit from generation to generation the torch of life that is never
extinguished and seems to have been lighted at the very dawn of cre-
ation. In the Mediterranean the phosphorescence of the sea may be
exclusively produced, as I have found, by the disintegration of coelen-
terates, whose bodies are sometimes thrown on the shore in great
numbers.

Among the echinoderms the star fishes and particularly the Brisin-
gide furnish most brilliant examples. Certain Ophiwride also emit a
beautiful green light, especially when young.

Balanoglossus also produces an emerald-green light having a very
beautiful effect, and this function is an additional character connecting
that creature with echinoderms and worms.

In the race of worms the photogenic function has been observed in
many wandering annelids. In the collared Polynoe it appears in a
quite limited region of the elytra, around the elytrophore, where sec-
tions show a structure that recalls that of the luminous organs of
Pholas, of which we shall speak further on.

In other cases the luminosity is situated in the antenne and its
existence has been shown quite early in polytrochous larvee of poly-
cheetous annelids. Quite frequently in France there have also been
found earth worms, luminous Lumbrici, recently placed in the genus
Photodrillus. The species that compose it seem to be of exotic origin.

Among articulate animals there are a great number of species in
which the photogenic function is very well developed and particularly
well differentiated. It isin general localized, but often the localization
seems to be displaced during the metamorphoses of the individual.

Many crustaceans have a luminosity of their own. It may be pro-
duced as in the Huphauside, in quite definite organs, which may have
a Structure so complex that they have been considered as eyes. This
connection of a luminous organ appears less strange when we know the
mechanism of the dermatoptic and photogenic functions in Pholas dac-
tylus, and, besides, it is not impossible that the same organ may alter-
nately or simultaneously perform two functions. These luminous
globules or photospheres may exist at the same time in various parts
of the body, on the claws, the thorax, the abdomen, ete. In other
crustacea, such as ysis, there is a brilliant circle surrounding the eye,
which is actually set in a luminous, spherical cavity. The photogenic
power of the eyes appears to be well developed also in Aristeus, Geryon,
and Munida.

In the class of Myriapods luminosity has been scientifically investi-
gated among the Geophilide in both sexes of Scolioplanes crassipes.

This species inhabits central Europe and becomes luminous in autumn,
While walking or when stimulated its teguments transude a granulose,
viscous liquid that emits for some moments a greenish luster. Some-
times there is no cutaneous excretion and the entire body of the ani-
mal is illuminated, except the head. The Orya barbarica also, which
inhabits Algeria, may, under the influence of pressure and contact, dis-
charge from its abdominal, tegumentary pores a viscous liquor, insolu-
ble in alcohol, which solidifies rapidly, giving out at the same time a
greenish-blue light. The recent study of this secretion has given me
important information as to the intimate mechanism of photogeny.

Ill.

The most resplendent of all animals are insects, of which class the
glowworm, beloved of the poets, is one of the most brilliant exam-
ples. Among the thirteen orders of this class, there are but three that
contain species to which the photogenic power may be with certainty
attributed, viz, the Coleoptera, the Diptera, and the Thysanura.

In certain continental localities the soil has been seen to become
luminous, like the sand of the sea which contains Noctiluew, on account
of the presence of quite minute insects belonging to the order Thysa-
nura, family Poduride, genus Lipura (fig. 2, Lipura noctiluca), that
are not more than 2 or 3 millimeters in length. I know of but one
photogenic species; this much resembles Lipura ambulans, if it is not
identical with it, but I prefer to call it Lipura noctiluca.

Such species are also rare among the Diptera, the luminosity of the
antenn of the Thyreophora cynophila, a fly which lives in charnel
houses, being probably the result of its habitat. The function may,
however, be properly ascribed to the larve and nymphe of Ceratoplatus
sesioides. There is also found in the Sea of Aral certain species of
Chironimus, which shine like small, dull stars. Certain analogous
phenomena have been noticed in Culex and Tipula.

The most beautiful luminous insects are incontestably among the
Coleoptera, confined to the two related families of Malacodermide and
Hlateride, of which the best known are the Luciola italica, the Lampyra
noctiluca or glowworm, and the Pyrophorus, commonly known under
the name cucuyos.

The photogenic property appears in the egg of the glowworm (Lam-
pyra), even while it is contained in the ovary before fecundation; in
the fertilized eggs it persists till the hatching of the larva. In these
centrolecithal eggs we find very early the blastoderm represented by a
single layer of large, polyhedric cells inclosing numerous rounded
granulations and possessing the same characteristics as those which
are again met with later in the luminous organs of the adult and the
larva. At the moment of hatching, in the larva of the first stage, the
luminous appearance shows itself in the form of two small, yellowish,
vyuld bodies situated ou the sides of the penultimate ring.

PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT. 419

Each organ is formed by a vesicle with a transparent wall (fig. 3,
luminous organ of the larva of Lampyra noctiluca, young specimen)
which is hyaline, anhistous, filled with very granular, polyhedric cells,
representing perhaps a post-embryonic blastoderm. There runs among
these cells a very finely ramified tracheal arborization. When the little
photogenic vesicle is compressed under the microscope there escapes
from it a liquid inclosing a multitude of small, rounded, protoplasmic
granulations, whose form and size recall those of certain spores; they
show active movements (Brownian ?).

This larval organ persists in the nympha, in the female, which pre-
serves until adult life its vermiform appearance, and in the male (fig. 5,
male organ) which in the state of a perfect insect is a winged beetle;
but it undergoes certain modifications.

In the organ of the adult male, for example, there are more clearly
distinguished two layers, one whitish, opaque, chalky (fig. 6, male
organ enlarged), formed of very refringent, crystalloid granulations,
the other parenchymatous, composed of granular, polyhedrie cells.
The first layer is manifestly formed by the breaking down of the
parenchymatous cells, and by the change of part of the primitively
colloidal protoplasm to a crystalloidal state, as is clearly shown by fig. 6,
which represents a vertical section of the male organ. This section
also shows some muscular fibers which are apparently for the purpose
of aiding the voluntary or reflex separation of the cretaceous layers
from the parenchymatous one. This is unquestionably the function of
these muscles in the female.

Besides the larval organ, the female possesses two others which rest
upon the abdominal wall of the two penultimate rings, these remaining
transparent at this point (fig. 7, female organ). They are also com-
posed of two layers—one, superior, chalky, crystalloidal, the other
parenchymatous, formed of rounded cells arranged in regular, linear
series (fig. 8).

Numerous tracheal ramifications carry on respiration in these organs,
and certain anatomists, who apparently had never seen any other lumi-
nous animals, have supposed these ramifications to be of primary
importance in the light-making mechanism, considering these tracheas
as blast tubes for enkindling the protoplasm as if it were charcoal.
But they should have at least known that the egg of the Lampyra has
no need for such an incendiary bellows to make it shine. We will
not dwell here upon the erudity of this interpretation that has
nothing physiological about it and whose error we have elsewhere
demonstrated.

Between the files of cells of the female organs (fig. 8, ¢, ¢), there exist
numerous passages (me, me, me), whose width is regulated by the play
of the muscles (fig.-7, m, m, m), so that the blood may enter the organ
in greater or less quantity, thus rendering nutrition more or less
active. These muscles are under the control of voluntary and reflex

420 PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

centers, which explains why sensorial or psychic stimuli may affect the
production of light. It is proper to add that the protoplasmic cells of
insects are directly excitable, like the Noctiluca or the ectoderm of the
Celenterata. In the Lampyrida, the light-producing power is not lim-
ited to the organs in question, as the eggs become luminous in the
ovary, and at the moment of molting, when the new integument is
yet uncolored, in absolute darkness the entire hypoderm shows a feeble
phosphorescence. Besides, embryological studies show that both in
the larva and in the female nympha the photogenic organs are formed
at the expense of the hypoderm.

The organic mechanism of the photogenic function in the Coleoptera
is particularly easy to study in the luminous Mlateride, those dazzling
beetles of the tropics, and particularly in Pyrophorus noctilucus.

The egg of Pyrophorus is luminous, like that of Lampyra, and the
little larva which comes from it also carries with it at birth the lumi-
nous source transmitted to the egg by its ancestors. In the young
larva, this is single, bilobate, and situated at the junction of the head
and the thorax. It contains numerous rounded granulations and emits
a bluish light. After the second molting the cephalothoracic appa-
ratus persists, and then others appear on each of the segments and a
larger single one upon the last ring. These luminous spots may be
lighted and extinguished successively, like the gas-burners of a stair-
way swept by the wind, and it is a very curious spectacle to see two of
these larvee struggling together and twisting about while emitting
flashes of light. Imagine what it would be if the combatants were
some meters in length.

In the adult state, Pyrophorus has three lanterns—two dorsal ones
upon the cephaiothorax and a ventral one at the junction of the
thorax and abdomen. The arrangement of these organs is quite
Similar to that of the organs of the Lampyride, and their regulating
mechanism is also very much the same. For example, by the action of
small muscles the ventral organ of Pyrophorus opens and closes like a
purse, and owing to its situation and anatomical structure it is easy to
show, both by direct observation and by experimentation, that the pro-
duction of the light is closely allied to the fluctuations of blood in the
organ, and to a great degree independent of the play of the stigmata
and the trachex, which are in relation with it. But why should we
further discuss the essential function of hypothetical tracheal blast
tubes? When the organ is isolated from the body, dried and pulver-
ized, it still gives out light when a drop of water is let fall upon its
amorphous dust—a singular combustion truly, but without blast tubes
this time. Jn order to rapidly conclude an examination of photogenic
species, I will for the present leave the study of the special mechanism
of photogeny, which will be treated in the second part of this article.
PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT. A421

IV.

Among the Mollusca, we find that cephalopods show luminosity only
in certain rare species, though there may yet be some doubt concerning
the function of certain organs supposed to be photogenic before their
action was observed in living specimens. Luminosity has been noted
in several molluscous gasteropods: Aecolis, Hyalea, Creseis, Cleodora,
Phyllirrhe, and in one lamellibranchiate, Pholas dactylus; it has been
carefully studied only in the latter and in the Phyllirrha bucephala.

Phyllirrhe is a naked, pisciform, Mediterranean gasteropod, having
a laterally compressed, transparent body. The light is produced in
peripheral, nervous cells of an ordinary form, in the cells of the central
ganglia, and in tegumentary elements having very marked, dark con-
tours and inclosing numerous rounded granulations immersed in the
intracellular liquid.

The photogenic function again occurs in nervous and tegumentary
cells having granular contents in Pholas dactylus, a sedentary mollusk
that on our coast inhabits holes hollowed in the rocks, where it lives
secluded, showing only the end of its siphon—a kind of double-barreled
contractile tube by which it draws in and rejects the water that serves
for its nutrition. The external integument of the siphon is sensitive
to light like the retina of the human eye, with which it presents many
analogies; it is the seat of the dermatoptic function,' while the internal
wall of one of the two tubes of the siphon is the seat of the photogenic
function. There is also as much analogy between the structure of these
two walls as has been shown to exist between certain photogenic and
visual organs of crustacea or fishes.

In Pholas (fig. 9), the light originates in the nervous, internal subepi-
dermic coat of the aspirator siphon, and very likely, asin Phyllirrhe, in
the nervous elements that form a sort of diffuse ganglion; but, besides,
also like that gasteropod, it appears in the tegumentary elements with
granular contents, arranged, in Pholas, in the form of two glandular
cords and two triangles situated on the inner surface of the aspirator
canal. In response to various stimuli, there is formed in this canal
an abundant secretion of a highly luminous mucus that communicates
to the water and to bodies that imbibe it a beautiful bluish and quite
persistent luminosity. Microscopical examination shows in this mucus
various elements from the internal wall and from the blood, and espe-
cially certain cells with well-marked contours inclosing a liquid that
holds in suspension rounded protoplasmic granulations. Other granu-
lations of a similar nature, coming from the glandular caliciform cells
of the cords and from the triangles, swim abundantly in the luminous
mucus. We will study their metamorphoses in the section of this
article devoted to the special mechanism of the photogenic function.

sciences pures et appliquées, avril, 1890.

422 PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

Among the Tunicates, there has been noted the Appendicularia of the
southern Atlantic, whose urocord emits a light of a variable color, being
red blue, green, and even white in the same individual. This varia-
bility in the color of the light has also been noted among the salpiform,
colonial Ascidians in Pyrosoma, whose form is like that of a pine cone
or an elongated thimble, and which is frequently found on the shore
at Nice. Besides artificial stimuli, which may lead to a sudden produe-
tion of light, spontaneous simultaneous movements of the colony may
produce the same result. Hach colonist carries a pair of photogenic
organs at the base of its neck, near the upper border of the branchiz.
They are part of the external layer and entirely composed of spherical
cells directly bathed by blood. <A colony 0.08 centimeter in diameter,
containing 3,200 colonists, will therefore present 6,400 luminous points.
These little organs arise in the embryo from the ectoderm.

Salpa and Doliola have also been reported as luminous. In the
Pacific they sometimes form streaks of light many leagues in length.

Among vertebrates, aside from cases of phosphorescence, probably of
parasitic origin, found in man and some rare animals, the photogenic
function has been seen only in fishes and especially in those that live
at great depths. The photogenic organs may be situated in very dif-
ferent regions; along the body walls from the fins to the tail, near the
eyes, on the branchiostegal rays, the dentary bone, and the preopercu-
lum. By their position as well as by their organization and structure,
they recall the photogenic organs of the crustacean Huphauside; like
these, they have sometimes been thought to be accessory eyes and some-
times photogenic apparatus. Perhaps they may combine the two fune-
tions. They have, at any rate, ectodermic, muciparous glands connected
with nerves of general sensibility, an arrangement that in no way con-
flicts with this view when we consider the dermatoptic and photogenic
functions in Pholas dactylus.

This rapid survey of the world of luminous animals and vegetables
shows that the photogenic function is more widely distributed than
had been generally supposed, and that this beautiful phenomenon
should not be considered as a mere biological curiosity. it is, like the
production of electricity and of heat, a great physiological function,
general in its distribution—thaft is to say, common to the two kingdoms
of living beings.

The examples we have cited sufficiently show how independent this
general function is of the organs in which it arises, and yet how simple
is the cellular mechanism that produces it; this being always the same
whether we consider the Noctiluca, the Hippopodius, the glowworm or
its egg, etc.

We shall see in the latter portion of this article that physiological
analysis may be pushed quite beyond the cell, and we shall endeavor
to ascertain whether this light, transmitted from generation to genera-
tion without extinction, having doubtless been burning for thousands

of years, is reducible to a simple chemical or physical phenomenon
properly so called, or whether there is reason to conelude that it
depends upon vital phenomena which should be considered together
in a special chapter of general mechanics—physiological mechanics or
biological dynamics.

Parr SEconD.—SPECIAL MECHANISM OF THE PHOTOGENIC
FUNCTION.

Since we employ the expression animal heat to designate the heat
produced by animals, so we should understand by physiological light the
light generated by the biological activity of living beings. It is dis-
tinguished from all other light by its composition, its origin, and the
special mechanism by which it is produced.

i

The color of the light may vary according to the species that pro-
duces it. In the Photobacteriacee it is sometimes silvery white, some-
times bluish or green, sometimes tinged with orange. In the same
species it may also change according to the environment. In the solid
bouillon of gelatin peptone the Photobacterium sarcophilum emits a
ereenish luster, which changes to a light blue in liquid bouilion.

In mushrooms, we observe similar variations; the luminosity of
Agaricus igneus is bluish, that of Agaricus Gardneri dull green, that of
Agaricus olearius and noctilucens white.

The same remark applies to animals, and, among these, the same indi-
vidual is quite often seen to change its color from one moment to another.
There have been taken from more than a hundred fathoms depth in the
Strait of Skye Pennatulide or sea-pens that shine with a pale lilae
light; in other cases, as in Ophiura and Balanoglossus, the light is a
fine emerald green. It is bluish in Lampyra, white with golden glints
in Luciola. Two lights of different colors may coexist in the same
individual; certain exotic larve have a red light near the head and
bluish lights along the body. The light may also vary with the meta-
morphoses of the individual. The egg and the young larva of Pyro-
phorus noctilucus give out pale blue rays, while those emitted by the
adult are light green.

But what is more singular, is to see in the same animal all the colors
of the spectrum succeed each other rapidly and without interruption.
From all points of the stems and branches of certain Gorgonide, light
may be seen to gush forth in jets and sprays of fire, whose luster dies
away, then revives, passing from violet to purple, from red to orange,
from bluish to different tints of green, sometimes even to the white of
Superheated iron. In the same way the Pyrosomata offer a very curi-
ous spectacle when heated or strongly excited. Pyrosoma atlanticum
becomes at first red, then pink, then orange, afterwards greenish,
A?4 PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

finally ultramarine blue. Certain Appendicularia have a tricolored
luminosity.

Most of these variations depend upon corresponding modifications
of the internal photogenic mechanism; so when the light of Noctiluca
changes from blue to white by reason of fatigue or the somatic death
of the animal, the protoplasmic granulations and the beams that they
emit become at once smaller and more numerous. But the coloration
of the light may also depend upon circumstances independent of its
mode of production, the color of the integument, or of the blood. For
example, by injecting eosin into the blood of Pyrophorus the light
changes from its usual green color to rose.

Finally, the pale blue tint seen in many marine animals, larvee, mush-
rooms, and bacteria, must in certain cases be entirely attributed to the
slight intensity of the luminosity. For the same reason, a spectroscopic
examination does not enable us to distinguish the color of the different
rays that compose their spectra, but the extreme limits of such spectra,
fixed by various observers, leave no doubt as to their polychromatic
nature. The luminous intensity is generally only slightly increased
in the middle regions of this pale spectrum.

The light of insects furnishes, on the contrary, a fine continuous
spectrum, without bands or lines, but in which the various component
rays can be readily distinguished. That of Pyrophorus noctilucus, for
example, is quite remarkable when the animal is very luminous; some-
what extended on the side of the red, it reaches as far as the first blue
rays and covers about twenty-four divisions of the micrometer. Its
approximate limits are on one side the line B, on the other the line F, of
the solar spectrum. So the middle part of that spectrum corresponds
to the maximum luminous intensity of the spectrum of Pyrophorus.

It should also be noted that the impression produced on the eye warns
us that the composition of this hght is not the same as that from arti-
ficial sources. It is easy to assure ourselves that this is the case by
arranging an artificial diaphragm so as to give to a beam of artificial light
a photometric intensity approximately equal to that of the luminous
organ and then comparing its dispersion with that of the rays from
Pyrophorus. The graphic representation of the results obtained by this
spectroscopic experiment may serve to give an idea of the respective
composition of the light of these various sources, but this method is
evidently extremely imperfect, since we can not by ordinary photomet-
ric processes compare the intensity of lights of different composition.

A spectro-photometric analysis, however, taking the wave-lengths for
abscisse and the intensities of the luminous rays for ordinates, shows
that the area between the axis of the wave-length and the curve is, in
the light from Pyrophorus, almost wholly occupied by green and yellow
rays (fig. 1). The maximum of intensity corresponds to a wave-length
pt 9.523,56. Now, this wave-length is precisely the same as that which
affords the maximum of clearness in the solar spectrum, while in the
flame of a candle the maximum of luminous intensity corresponds to
PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT. 425

the wave-length , 0.485,68, and is consequently thrown back on the
side of the more refrangible rays. An inverse result would have been
obtained if the peculiar appearance of the spectrum of Pyrophorus was
due only to its relatively feeble intensity, since in that case the blue
rays would seem more abundant. Finally, in the case of the candle,
the yellow rays fall in a narrower part of the area between the curve of
intensity and the line of wave-lengths.

In comparing these areas with each other, we find that the spectro-
photometric value of one of the two prothoracic lanterns of a Pyrophorus
would be about one one hundred and fiftieth of a Phoenix candle (8 to
the pound). If we admit that the ventral apparatus possesses an
illuminating power double that of the prothoracic ones, we see that it
would take from thirty-seven to thirty-eight Pyrophori, all luminous
at once with their three apparatuses, to illuminate an apartment with
the same intensity as a candle.

The average wave-length of this light, obtained either by calculation
or graphically, is found to be between py 0.530 and jy 0.553, nearly
that of the green line of thallium j 0.535; and, indeed, the light of
Pyrophorus is very similar to that of the sun shining through foliage
(GaA1os, a green branch).

It should be added that this spectrum is not at all like that of phos-
phorus burning in oxygen or hydrogen, and hence we can at once reject
certain hypotheses relative to the special mechanism of the photogenic
function. The green color of the light of Pyrophorus is increased by
the existence of green matter in the blood, which bathes abundantly
the photogenic organs during their action. But besides its special
coloration, it possesses a peculiar opalescent luster, on account of which
all observers speak of it as of beautiful clarity.

This clarity recalls that of fluorescent substances, and it is this that
led us to discover in the blood of Pyrophorus a material that becomes
luminous when exposed to the influence of the ultra violet rays, espe-
cially those having a wave-length of yu 0.391. Dilute acetic acid
annuls this fluorescent power, while ammonia restores it. Now, both
these reactions affect similarly the photogenic power of all substances,
animal or vegetable, and this has led us to think that the production
of physiological light was due to the transformation of obscure vibra-
tions, depending on protoplasmic molecular movement, into luminous
undulations. But this substance not having been found in the lumi-
nous creatures, there is reason to believe that its function is limited to
transforming into luminous rays and throwing toward the middle por-
tion of the spectrum the chemical rays that originate simultaneously
with the luminous rays in Pyrophorus. Thus reenforced, the middle
portion of the spectrum forms what might be called a focus of condensed
light. I have given to the transforming substance whose composition
is unknown, but whose existence can not be doubted, the name of
pyrophorine.
426 PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

An organoleptic examination shows, like the physical analysis, that
the light of Pyrophorus is undoubtedly superior to that of any artificial
sources of light with which we are acquainted.

The visual intensity, measured by means of a typographic scale, has
been found, when compared with that of a candle, to be much greater
than is indicated by the luminous intensity, as determined by the spee-
trophotometer. The beautiful clarity of the Pyrophorus does not favor
retinal persistence, there are no accidental images, and complementary
color images are produced with difficulty. In spite of its greenish hue,
it has almost no influence on the color sense, for all tints are easily
recognized, except blue and violet, which do not exist in its spectrum,
and its rays are perceived at the extreme limits of the visual field.

*The light of the Pyrophort contains no polarized rays, which proves
that the function attributed to the chalky, radio-crystalline layer of the
photogenic organs of insects does not exist. On the contrary, it still
includes, in spite of the fluorescence of pyrophorine, a sufficient quan-
tity of chemical rays to effect the photographic reproduction of objects,
but no less than five minutes’ exposure is necessary to produce, with
the ventral organ (the most brilliant of the three), a good proof with
gelatin-bromide plates that give with solar ight an image in a frac-
tion of a second (fig. 2).

The quantity of heat generated by the photogenic organs is infini-
tesimal. I have, however, been able to show the presence of a few
heat rays by means of an extremely sensitive thermo-electric pile, so
arranged as to avoid all causes of error. It has also been possible to
show that this small quantity of heat is nearly double that given out
by the dark portion of the tegument at the same time. The existence
of these calorific rays has been completely confirmed by the use of the
bolometer, an instrument which informs us, as it appears, that the
quantity of heat given off during ten minutes, by the most brilliant
Pyrophorus, is a seven-millionth of a caiory.

The most sensitive instruments fail to show any electric phenomena
whatever accompanying the production of the light.

The experiments, taken together, fully justify the conclusions which
we published in 1886,' namely, that in contrast with artificial light in
which 98 per cent of the energy is employed otherwise than in produc-
ing illuminating rays, physiological light employs effectively 98 per
cent of energy, with only 2 per cent of loss. Besides this immense
economic superiority there should be mentioned the exceptional quali
ties (organoleptic or otherwise) which cause the Pyrophori themselves
to prefer their own beautiful light to any other, it never causing

1886. The exactitude of the physical results noted in that work has been fully cor-
roborated by the confirmatory researches of MM. Véry and Langley published in
1890 (see Phil. Magaz., XXX, Series V, p. 260); but these scientists were in error when
they said that I had not been able to show the existence of calorifie rays.

conflagrations and never being extinguished by the winds nor the rain,
being, in fact, an ideal illuminant. Neither need it be supposed that
these little lanterns which they always carry with them, and which they
can use at any moment, cause any great expenditure, for the total loss
of weight of twenty Pyrophori in three days and three nights during
which they had shone for long hours was found by experiment to be
0.063 gram—that is to say, about 0.05 gram per insect, and during
that time they had expended much more energy in movement than in
light and had consumed no nutriment. Was I not right when I said
in the first place that this physiological light ought, by its eomposi-
tion, to serve as a type for the artificial light of the future, and have
not the recent applications of zirconium to illumination already partly
shown the accuracy of my predictions? Up to 1886, when I published
my first researches, nothing was thought of but the perfecting of the
iUluminating apparatus then in use. I believe that I opened a new and
promising field for future progress by showing the inferiority of these
means when compared with those of nature and by placing the ques-
tion upon the ground of producing illumination by a new method.

Il.

Everything goes to prove that there is no analogy between the actual
mechanism of the photogenic function and our industrial methods, and
we are far from the artless explanation of the blast tubes for burning
up the protoplasm, but the analysis of the physiological mechanism of
the photogenic organs, and even that of the intracellular modifications
that accompany luminous emission (discussed in the first part of this
article), have not answered the philosophical question, much more
important for us than the economic one: Is the production of physio-
logical light reducible to a simple physical or chemical phenomenon ?

We know now that the ultimate element of the phenomenon is
physical. Let us examine the work of the vital function.

It will be remembered that the photogenic organ of Lampyra dried
and pulverized still gives out light when the amorphous dust is mois-
tened with a drop of water. This simple experiment, which may be
repeated with a multitude of other photogenic organisms, suffices to
prove that it is neither in the structure nor in the working of the
organ or of the photogenic cell that we must seek for the ultimate
cause of the emission of light.

For simplicity, we will first confine ourselves to the consideration
of the photogenic matter furnished by Pholas dactylus, because that
mollusk produces it freely and quite abundantly in the form of a
liquid that remains luminous even after being filtered, then containing
in suspension only fine protoplasmic granulations that give it a cloudy
appearance. These semifluid granulations, which I have called
vacuolides because of the appearance that they present under the
428 : PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

microscope, and which are found in all photogenic elements, must be
the plasmatic or microsomic corpuscles of the luminous cells.! They
are seen to undergo a series of metamorphoses in proportion as their
photogenic power becomes exhausted (fig. 3).

Like all protoplasm undergoing catabolic changes—or, to express it
otherwise, passing from life to death—these granulations lose, with the
energy which they emit, their colloidal nature, passing to the erystal-
loidal state. But the photogenic protoplasmic matter survives the
animal and continues to shine and palpitate for quite a long time after
somatic death. It is even possible to retard its spontaneous destrue-
tion and to suspend the emission of light by covering the luminous
organs with powdered bichromate of soda. There is then formed a
peculiar liquor, which becomes luminous upon the addition of water
and its agitation in contact with air. Immersion in vinegar produces
the same result, and the light may be made to reappear after several
days by adding ammonia. But there is no method by which it can be
indefinitely preserved. The most advantageous means are those used
for preserving pancreatic ferments. The luminous organs sprinkled
with very dry, finely powdered carbonate of lime are dried in an oven
at 36°. After drying they are separated from the inert powder and
macerated in absolute aleohol and ether at 60°. Thus treated, these
luminous organs may be relighted by contact with water after a very
long, but not an indefinite time. This experiment shows, first, that
the photogenic substance is not a fatty matter soluble in alcohol and
ether, as has been supposed, and, second, that it is spontaneously
destroyed at length, in spite of all precautions against such a result.
It thus behaves exactly like certain viruses, such, for example, as
vaccine matter. Although absolute alcohol does not destroy it, dilute
alcohol does, and, like many microorganisms, it can, when quite dry,
resist a temperature of 120°, but in the presence of water its photogenic
power is destroyed at 60°.

In order to clearly show that the cell and the photogenic matter are
independent, the organs prepared as I have just indicated should be
triturated and the luminous liquid thus produced filtered; with this
liquid a certain number of reactions may be obtained which I will
succinctly state.

Solutions of acids or of energetic bases when sufficiently concentrated
destroy the luminosity immediately, so that it does not reappear upon
neutralizing the liquid. A great number of neutral chemical com-
pounds, such as the chlorides of sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
sulphates of sodium, magnesium, ete., dissolved in sufficient quantity
in the liquid, suspend the emission of light, which, however, reappears
upon the addition of a sufficient quantity of water. All the reagents
which coagulate albuminoid substances, such as tannin, bichloride of

mercury, etc., immediately suppress the luminosity, which fails to
reappear when water is added.

The antiseptics, phenol and thymol, and many other antiseptic and
antizymotic substances extinguish physiological light. Reducing agents,
such as the sulphydrates, sulphites, and hydrogen, suspend the photo-
genic property. It is also extinguished by the action of a vacwum or
by shaking the photogenic liquor with animal charcoal; the light reap-
pears on agitation with air. Oxidizing reagents, such as ozone, oxygen-
ated water, and pure oxygen, even at a pressure of several atmospheres,
do not increase the intensity of the luminous phenomenon; on the con-
trary, the action of energetic oxidizing reagents at once and finally
extinguishes the light without first causing any increase in its luster.

Cold—that is to say, a temperature of —15° C.—does not finally
destroy the photogenic power. The light which disappeared on the
freezing of the liquid reappears with unabated intensity after melting.
Heat excites and hastens the appearance of the light, whose intensity
increases up to 30°, remains nearly constant from 30° to 55°, then
decreases to finally disappear at 60°. Hlectricity acting upon the saline
luminous liquor contained in a U tube induces a series of interesting
phenomena. The light first grows pale and is soon extinguished at the
negative pole. At this instant the positive pole begins to be obscured,
and a moment afterwards only the lower part of the U tube shines.
When the liquor at the two poles is extinguished and the current is
reversed the light reappears in the branch in which the positive pole is
placed, but it does not always reappear at the negative pole. There
are produced during electrolysis about the electrodes flocculous depos-
its in which there may be distinguished granulations having the aspect
of more or less modified vacuolides. It is easy to show that the liquor
ceases to shine at the negative pole because of nascent hydrogen while
it is extinguished at the positive pole, in spite of the presence of nas-
cent and ozonized oxygen because the liquid becomes strongly acid.

All these reactions, as well as many others which I pass over, suffi-
ciently prove that we have to dea! with a protoplasmic substance whose
spontaneous destruction may be retarded, but not completely sus-
pended, and which behaves toward reagents as do ferments, whether
figurate or not; as do viruses; in a word, as does living matter
reduced to its simplest expression, living, but yet incapable of repro-
duction while in that condition. This protoplasmic living matter, after
if has dissipated in the form of light the energy that animated it,
becomes changed to a crude, crystalline substance, and this is death.

The constant coexistence of these colloidal and crystalloidal sub-
stances caused me to think that one of them acted upon the other to
produce light, but a more profound study showed me that the crystal-
line substance was only a transformation of the protoplasmic substance,
to which I gave the name luciferase.

This transformation takes place under the influence of life, water,
and a suitable temperature.
430 PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT.

A confirmation of the accuracy of this theory, which I consider as
final, has been furnished by my recent researches upon luminous
myriapods.!

The Orya barbarica of Algeria, which we have mentioned in the first
part of this article, secretes by special hypodermic unicellular glands a
luminous liquid free from foreign matter. The microscope readily reveals
not only in the glandular protoplasm, but also in the secreted product,
the vacuolides or photogenic granulations, which can be seen to become
transformed into magnificent crystals during the emission of light.
When the phenomenon is completed the preparation is composed
wholly of crystals. The photogenic matter rapidly dried (on filter
paper, for example) may remain in a colloidal state for a long time and
become reillumined by a drop of water when exposed to air. In the
particular case of Orya barbarica, one could not apply the hypothesis of
Radziszewski, that the luminosity is occasioned by a pure and simple
oxidation of certain organic substances in an alkaline medium at an
ordinary temperature, for the secretion of Oryais clearly acid. Besides,
all the reactions indicated for Pholas are applicable to the luminous
secretion of this Algerian myriapod.

Til.

From all these observations and exnerpents, the following conelu-
sions may be drawn:

First. The photogenic phenomenon requires for its accomplishment
neither the integrity of the organ nor of the cellular elements; the
activity of the cell alone, when it is not independent, assures the activ-
ity of the organ. The cell, in its turn, forms the photogenic substance;
but that, when once formed, may shine or become extinguished inde-
pendently of the anatomical element that produced it, according to
circumstances affecting its environment.

Second. The environment must be such as to satisfy the conditions
indispensable for the production of the phenomena of life; it should
contain water, be oxygenated, and have a suitable temperature.

Third, All the causes that suspend or abolish the activity of zymoses
or figurate ferments, or, to speak more generally, protoplasmic activity,
also suspend or abolish the photogenic function—that is to say, the
production of physiological light.

Fourth. It is in passing, by reason of an inevitable ancestral impul-
sion, from the state of ene pr otoplasmic granulations to the state of
crude crystalloid matter that the photogenic substance disengages at
one aud the same time, under the form of light, the evolutive energy
received from its ancestors and the compensatory energy drawn from
its environment.

1See Comptes rendus de Académie des Sciences, 17 juillet, 1893,
PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGHT. 431

The final result of the photogenic phenomenon is, then, a physico-
chemical one—physical as regards the emission of light, chemical as
regards the formation of a crystalline substance; but the formation
and transformations of the photogenic protoplasmic granulations are
the result of a physiological process and are the exclusive domain of
biological mechanics.

vve may perhaps better comprehend the importance of the solution
of the problem of the mechanism of the photogenic function, a solution
which we have sought for many years, if we again read the words of
Claude Bernard, which are, as might be said, the scientific testament
of that illustrious physiologist, since they were those delivered by him
at the close of the last lecture which he gave at the Museum, on the
“Phenomena of life common to animals and vegetables,” some time
before his death.

“¢ Arrived at the termination of our studies, we see that they lead us
to a very general conclusion, the result of experiment; namely, that
between the two schools, one holding that vital phenomena are abso-
lutely distinct from physico-chemical phenomena, the other that they
are wholly identical with them, there is place for a third doctrine,
that of physical vitalism, which takes account of what there is peculiar
in the manifestations of life, and what there is that conforms to the
action of general forces; the ultimate element of the phenomenon is
physical, the arrangement is vital.” !

The study of the photogenic function conducts us to physico-vitalism,
or, more exactly, to biological dynamics, which is a department, but a
special department, of general mechanics.

By WILLIAM A. HERDMAN, F. R.8.

This year, for the first time in the history of the British Association,
Section D meets without including in the range of its subject-matter
the science of botany. Zoology now remains as the sole occupant of
Section D—that “Fourth Committee of Sciences,” as it was at first
ealled, more than sixty years ago, when our subject was one of that
group of biological sciences, the others being botany, physiology, and
anatomy. These allied sciences have successively left us. Like a
prolific mother, our section has given rise one after another to the now
independent sections of anthropology, physiology, and botany. Our
subject-matter has been greatly restricted in scope, but it is still very
wide—this year, when Section I, devoted to the more special physiology
of the medical physiologist, does not meet, perhaps a little wider than
it may be in other years, since we are on this occasion credited with
the subject “Animal physiology”—surely always an integral part of
zoology! It is to be hoped that this section will always retain that
general and comparative physiology which is inseparable from the study
of animal form and structure. The late Waynflete professor of physi-
ology at Oxford, in his Newcastle address to this section, said “ that
every appreciable difference in structure corresponds to a difference of
function” (Burdon-Sanderson, British Association Report for 1889),
and his successor, the present Waynflete professor, has shown us ‘how
pointless is structure apart from function, and how baseless and unsta-
ble is function apart from structure” (Gotch, “‘ Presidential address to
Liverpool Biological Society,” Vol. LX, 1894)—the “argument for the
simultaneous examination of both” in that science of zoology which
we profess is, to my mind, irresistible.

We include also in our subject-matter, besides the adult structure
and the embryonic development of animals, their distribution both in
space and time, the history and structure of extinct forms, speciography
and classification, the study of the habits of animals and all that mass

of lore and philosophy which has gathered around inquiries into instinct,
breeding, and heredity. I trust that the discussion of matters con-
nected with evolution will always, to a large extent, remain with this
Section D, which has witnessed in the past the addresses, papers, dis-
cussions, and triumphs of Darwin, Huxley, and Wallace.

When the British Association last met in Ipswich, in 1851, Section
D, under the presidency of Professor Henslow, still included zoology,
botany, and physiology, and a glance through the volumes of reports
for that and neighboring years recalls to us that our subject has under-
gone great and striking developments in the forty-four years that have
elapsed. Zoology was still pre-Darwinian (though Charles Darwin was
then in the thick of his epoch-making work—both what he ealls his
“plain barnacle work” and his ‘‘theoretic species work”). (See Life and
Letters, Vol. I, p. 380.) Although the cell theory had been launched
a decade before, zoologists were not yet greatly cencerned with those
minute structural details which have since built up the science of his-
tology. Theheroes of our science were then chiefly those glorious field
naturalists, observers, and systematists who founded and established
on a firm basis British marine zoology. Edward Forbes, Joshua Alder,
Albany Hancock, were then in active work. George Johnston was at
his zoophytes, Bowerbank at sponges, Busk at polyzoa. Forbes’s short,
brilliant career was nearly run. He probably did more than any of his
contemporaries to advance marine zoology. In the previous year, at
the Edinburgh meeting of the association, he and his friend MacAndrew
had read their classic reports (British Association Report for 1850, p.
192 et seq.) ““On the investigation of British marine zoology by means
of the dredge,” and ‘‘On south European marine invertebrata,” which
mark the high-water level reached at that date, and for some time
afterwards, in the exploration of our coasts and the explanation of the
distribution of our marine animals. At the Belfast meeting, which fol-
lowed Ipswich, Forbes exhibited his great map of the distribution of
marine life in “* Homoiozoic belts.” In November, 1854,he was dead,
six months after his appointment to the goal of his ambition, the pro-
fessorship at Edinburgh, where, had he lived, there can be no doubt he
would, with his brilliant ability and unique personality, have founded
a great school of marine zoology.

To return to the early fifties, Huxley—whose recent loss to science,
to philosophy, to culture, we, in common with the civilized world, now
deplore—at that time just returned from the memorable voyage of the
Rattlesnake, was opening out his newly acquired treasures of compara-
tive anatomy with papers on Siphonophora and on Sagitta, and one on
the structure of Ascidians, in which he urged—fourteen years before
Kowalevsky established it on embryological evidence in 1866—that
their relations were with Amphioxus, as we now believe, rather than
with the Polyzoa or the Lamellibranchiata, as had formerly been sup-
posed. Bates was then on the Amazons, Wallace was just going out
OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. A35

to the Malay Archipelago, Wyville Thomson, Hincks, and Carpenter,
the successors of Forbes, Johnston, and Alder, were beginning their
life work. Abroad that great teacher and investigator, Johannes
Miiller, was training among his pupils the most eminent zoologists,
anatomists, and physiologists of the succeeding quarter century. In
this country, as we have seen, Huxley was just beginning to publish
that splendid series of researches into the structure of nearly all groups
in the animal kingdom to which comparative anatomy owes so much.

Tn fact, the few years before and after the last Ipswich meeting wit-
nessed the activity of some of the greatest of our British zoologists—
the time was pregnant with work which has since advanced, and in
some respects revolutionized our subject. It was then still usual for
the naturalist to have a competent knowledge of the whole range of the
natural sciences. Edward Forbes, for example, was a botanist and a

geologist, as Well as a zoologist. He occupied the chair of botany at
King’s College, London, and the presidential chair of the geological
section of the British Association at Liverpool in 1854. That excessive
specialization, from which most of us suffer in the present day, had not
yet arisen; and in the comprehensive, but perhaps not very detailed
survey of his subject taken by one of the field naturalists of that time,
we find the beginnings of different lines of work, which have since
developed into some half dozen distinct departments of zoology, are
now often studied independently, and are in some real danger of losing
touch with one another. (See diagram.)

The splendid anatomical and “‘ morphological” researches of Huxley
and Johannes Miiller have been continued by the more minute histo-
logical or cellular work rendered possible by improvements of the
microtome and the microscope, until at last in these latter veers we

investigate not merely the cellular anatomy of the body, but the anat-
omy of the cell—if, indeed, we are permitted to talk of “cell” at all, and
are not rather constrained to express our results in terms of ‘ eytomi-
crosomes,” ‘‘ somacules,” or ‘‘idiosomes,” and to regard our morpholog-
ical unit, the cell, as a symbiotic community containing two colonies of
totally dissimilar organisms. (See Watasé in ‘‘ Wood’s Holl Biological
Lectures,” 1893.) To such cytological investigations may well be
applied Lord Macaulay’s aphorism, “A point which yesterday was
invisible is its goal to-day, and will be its starting point to-morrow.”

Somewhat similar advances in methods have led us from the life
histories studied of old to the new and fascinating science of embry-
ology. The elder Milne-Edwards and Van Beneden knew that in their
life histories Ascidians produced tadpole-like young. Kowalevsky
(1866) showed that in their embryonic stages these Ascidian tadpoies
have the beginnings of their chief systems of organs formed in essen-
tially the same manner and from the same embryonic layers as in the
case of the frog’s tadpole or any other typical young vertebrate; and
now we are not content with less than tracing what is called the ‘cell-
lineage” of such Ascidian embryos, so as to show the ancestry and
descendants, the traditions, peculiarities of, and influences at work
upon each of the embryonic cells—or areas of protoplasm—throughout
many complicated stages. And there is now opening up from this a
great new field of experimental and ‘‘mechanical” embryology, in which
we seek the clew to the explanation of particular processes and changes
by determining under what conditions they take place, and how they
are affected by altered conditions. We are brought face to face with
such curious problems as, Why does a frog’s egg, in the two-celled stage,
of which one-half has been destroyed, develop into half an embryo when
it is kept with one (the black) surface uppermost, and into—not half an
embryo, but—a whole embryo of half the usual size if kept with the
other (the white) surface upward. Apparently, according to the con-
ditions of the experiment, we may get half embryos or whole embryos
of half size from one of the first two cells of the frog’s egg.!

One of the most characteristic studies of the older field naturalists,
the observation of habits, has now become, under the influence of Dar-
winism, the ‘“‘Bionomics” of the present day, the study of the relations
between habit and structure and environment—a most fascinating and
promising field of investigation, which may be confidently expected to
tell us much in the future in regard to the competition between species,
and the useful or indifferent nature of specific characters.

Other distinct lines of zoological investigation, upon which I shall
not dwell, are geographical distribution and paleontology—subjects
in which the zoologist comes into contact with and may be of some
service to his fellow-workers in geology. And there still remains the

central avenue of the wide zoological domain—that of speciography and
systematic zoology—which has been cultivated by the great classifiers
and monographers from Linneus to Heckel, and has culminated in our
times in the magnificent series of fifty quarto volumes, setting forth
- the scientific results of the Challenger expedition; a voyage of discov-
ery comparable only in its important and wide-reaching results with
the voyages of Columbus, Gama, and Magellan at tle end of the fif-
teenth century. It is now so long since the Challenger investigations
commenced that few, I suppose, outside the range of professional zoolo-
gists are aware that although the expedition took place in 1872 to 1876,
the work resulting therefrom has been going on actively until now—
for nearly a quarter of a century in all—and in a sense, and a very real
one, will never cease, for the Challenger has left an indelible mark upon
science, and will remain through the ages exercising its powerful, guid-
ing influence, like the work of Aristotle, Newton, and Darwin.

Most of the authors of the special memoirs on the sea and its various
kinds of inhabitants have interpreted in a liberal spirit the instrue-
tion they received to examine and describe the collections intrusted to
them, and have given us very valuable summaries of the condition of
our knowledge of the animals in question, while some of the reports
are little less than complete monographs of the groups. I desire to
pay a tribute of respect to my former teacher and scientific chief, Sir
Wyville Thomson, to whose initiative, along with Dr. W. B. Carpenter,
we owe the first inception of our now celebrated deep-sea dredging
expeditions, and to whose scientific enthusiasm, combined with admin-
istrative skill, is due in great part the successful accomplishment of the
Lightning, the Porcupine, and the Challenger expeditions. Wyville
Thomson lived long enough to superintend the first examination of the
collections brought home, their division into groups, and the allotment
of these to specialists for description. He enlisted the services of his
many scientific friends at home and abroad, he arranged the general
plan of the work, decided upon the form of publication, and died in
1882, after seeing the first ten or twelve zoological reports through the
press.

Within the last few months have been issued the two coneluding
volumes of this noble series, deaiing with a summary of the results,
conceived and written in a masterly manner by the eminent editor of
the reports, Dr. John Murray. An event of such first-rate importance
in zoology as the completion of this great work ought not to pass
unnoticed at this zoological gathering. I desire to express my appre-
ciation and admiration of Dr. Murray’s work, and I do not doubt that
the section will permit me to convey to Dr. Murray the congratulations
of the zoologists present, and their thanks for his splendid services to
Science. Murray, in these “Summary” volumes, has given definiteness
of Scope and purpose and a tremendous impulse to that branch of
science—mainly zoological—which is coming to be called

438 OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE.

OCEANOGRAPHY.

Oceanography is the meeting ground of most of the sciences. It
deals with botany and zoology, ‘‘including animal physiology ;” chem-
istry, physics, mechanics, meteorology, and geology all contribute, and
the subject is of course intimately connected with geography, and has
an incalculable influence upon mankind, his distribution, character-
istics, commerce, and economics. Thus oceanography, one of the latest
developments of marine zoology, extends into the domain of, and ought
to find a place in, every one of the sections of the British Association.

Along with the intense specialization of certain lines of zoology in
the last quarter of the nineteenth century, it is important to notice
that there are also lines of investigation which require an extended
knowledge of, or at least make use of the results obtained from, various
distinct subjects. One of these is oceanography, another is bionomics,
which I have referred to above, a third is the philosophy of zoology,
or all those studies which bear upon the theory of evolution, and a
fourth is the investigation of practical fishery problems, which is
chiefly an application of marine zoology. Of these four subjects—
which, while analytic enough in the detailed investigation of any par-
ticular problem, are synthetic in drawing together and making use
of the various divergent branches of zoology and the neighboring
sciences—oceanography, bionomies, and the fisheries investigation are
most closely related, and I desire to devote the remainder of this
address to the consideration of some points In connection with their
present position.

Dr. Murray, in a few only too brief paragraphs at the end of his
detailed summary of the results of the Challenger expedition, which I
have alluded to above, states some of the views, highly suggestive and
original, at which he has himself arrived from his unique experience.
Some of his conclusions are very valuable contributions to knowledge,
which will no doubt be adopted by marine zoologists. Others, I ven-
ture to think, are less sound and well founded, and will scarcely stand
the test of time and further experience. But for all such statements, or
even suggestions, we should be thankful. They do much to stimulate
further research; they serve, if they can neither be refuted nor estab-
lished, as working hypotheses; and even if they have to be eventually
abandoned, we should bear in mind what Darwin has said as to the
difference in their influence on science between erroneous facts and
erroneous theories: ‘False facts are highly injurious to the progress
of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by
some evidence, do little harm, for everyone takes a salutary pleasure in
proving their falseness; and when this is done, one path toward error
is closed, and the road to truth is often at the same time opened.”
(Darwin: The Descent of Man, second edition, 1882, p. 606).

With all respect for Murray’s work, and fully conscious of my own
OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 439

temerity in venturing to differ from one who has had such an extended
experience of the sea and its problems, I am constrained to express
my disagreement with some of his conclusions. And I am encouraged
to do so by the belief that Murray will rightly feel that the best compli-
ment which zoologists can pay to his work is to give it careful, detailed
consideration, and discuss it critically. He will, I am sure, join me in
the hope that, whether his views or mine prove the false ones, we may
be able, by their discussion, to close a ‘ path toward error,” and possi-
bly open “ the road to truth.”

One of the points upon which Murray lays considerable stress, and
to the elaboration of which he devotes a prominent position in his
‘General observations on the distribution of marine organisms,” is the

‘presence of what he has called a “ mud-line” around coasts at a depth
of about 100 fathoms. Itis the point “at which minute particles of
organic and detrital matters in the form of mud begin to settle on the
bottom of the ocean.” He regards it as the great feeding ground, and
a place where the fauna is most abundant, and from which there have
hived off, so to speak, the successive swarms or migrations which
have peopled other regions—the deep waters, the open sea, the shallow
waters and the estuaries, fresh waters, and land. Murray thus gives
to his mud-line both a present and an historic importance which can
scarcely be surpassed in the economy of life on this globe. I take it
that the historic and the present importance stand or fall together—
that the evidence as to the origin of faunas in the past is derived from
their distribution at the present day, and I am inclined to think that
Murray’s opinion as to the distribution of animals in regard to the
mud-line is not entirely in accord with the experience of specialists,
and is not based upon reliable statistics. Murray’s own statement is
(Challenger Expedition, Summary, Vol. II, p. 1453): “A depth is
reached along the continental shores facing the great oceans immedi-
ately below which the conditions become nearly uniform in all parts of
the world, and where the fauna likewise presents a great uniformity.
This depth is usually not far above nor far below the 100-fathom
line, and is marked out by what I have elsewhere designated as the
Mud-line. - - - Here is situated the great feeding ground in the
ocean - - -” and he then goes on (p. 1454) to enumerate the Crusta-
ceans, such as species of Calanus, Hucheta, Pasiphaa, Crangon, Calocaris,
Pandalus, Hippolyte, many amphipods, isopods, and immense numbers
of schizopods, which swarm, with fishes and cephalopods, immediately
over this mud deposit. Now, I venture to think that the experience of
some of those who have studied the marine zoology of our own coasts
does not bear out this statement. In the first place, our experience in
the Irish Sea is that mud may be found at almost any depth, but is very
varied in its nature and in its source. There may even be mud laid
down between tide marks in an estuary where a very considerable cur-
rentruns. A deposit of mud may be due to the presence of an eddy

or a Sheltered corner in which the finer particles suspended in the water
are able to sink, or it may be due to the wearing away of a limestone
beach, or to quantities of alluvium brought down by a stream from the
land, or to the presence of a submerged bed of bowlder clay, or even, in
some places, to the sewage and refuse from coast towns. Tf inally, there
is the deep-water mud, a very stiff blue-gray substance which sets,
when dried, into a firm clay, and this is, I take it, the mud of which
Dr. Murray writes. But in none of these cases, and certainly not in
the last mentioned, is there in my experience or in that of several other
naturalists I have consulted, any rich fauna associated with the mud.
in fact, I would regard mud as supporting a comparatively poor fauna
as compared with other shallow-water deposits.

For practical purposes, round our own British coasts, it is still con-
venient to make use of the zones of depth marked out by Forbes. The
first of these is the “ Littoral zone,” the space between tide marks,
characterized by the abundance of seaweeds, belonging to the genera
LTichina, Fucus, Enteromorpha, Polysiphonia, and others, and by large
numbers of individuals belonging to common species of Balanus,
Mytilus, Littorina, Purpura, and Patella amongst animals. The second

zone is the ‘“ Laminarian,” which extends from low-water mark to a
depth of a few fathoms, characterized by the abundant growth of large
seaweeds, belonging to the genera Laminaria, Alaria, and Himanthalia,
and by the presence of the beautiful red seaweeds (Floridez). There
is abundance of vegetable food, and animals of all groups swarm in
this zone, the numbers both of species and of individuals being very
great. The genera Helcion, Trochus, and Lacuna are characteristic
molluscan forms in our seas. Next comes Forbes’s ‘‘ Coralline” zone,
badly so named, extending from about 10 to 40 or 50 fathoms or so.
Here we are beyond the range of the ordinary seaweeds, but the
calcareous, coral-like Nullipores are present in places in such abun-
dance as to make up deposits covering the floor of the sea for miles.
Hydroid zoophytes and polyzoa are also abundant, and it is in this zone
that we find the shell beds lying off our coasts, produced by great
accumulations of species of Pecten, Ostrea, Pectunculus, Fusus, and
Buecinum, and forming rich feeding grounds for many of our larger
fishes. All groups of marine animals are pretty well represented in
this zone, and Antedon, Ophiothrix, Ophioglypha, Ebalia, Inachus, and
Hurynome may be mentioned as characteristic genera. Lastly, there is
what may be appropriately called the zone of deep mud (although
Forbes did not call it so), extending from some 50 fathoms down to (in
our seas) 100.or so. The upper limit of this zone is Murray’s mud-line.
We come upon it in the deep fjord-like sea lochs on the west of Scot-
land, and in the Irish Sea to the west of the Isle of Man.

Now, of these four zones, my experience is that the last—that of
the deep mud—has by far the poorest fauna both in species and in
individuals. The mud has a peculiar fauna and one of great interest
OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 441

to the zoologist, but it is not arich fauna. It contains some rare and
remarkable animals not found elsewhere, such as Calocaris macandree,
Panthalis oerstedi, Lipobranchius jeffreysi, Brissopsis lyrifera, Amphiura
chiajii, Isocardia cor, and Sagartia herdmani; and a few st:iking novel-
ties have been described from it of late years, but we have no reason
to believe that the number of these is great compared with the num-
ber of animals obtained from shallower waters.

Dr. Murray not only insists upon the abundance of animals on the
mud, and its importance as the great feeding ground and place of
origin of life in the ocean, but he also (p. 1432) draws conclusions as to
the relative numbers of animals taken by a single haul of the trawl in
deep and shallow waters which can scarcely be received, I think, by
marine zoologists without a protest. His statement runs (p. 1432): “It
is interesting to compare single hauls made in the deep sea and in
shallow water with respect to the number of different species obtained.
For instance, at station 146 in the Southern Ocean, at a depth of 1,375
fathoms, the 200 specimens captured belonged to 59 genera and 78
species.” That was with a 10-foot trawl dragged for at most 2 miles
during at most two hours. Murray then goes on to say: “In depths
less than 50 fathoms, on the other hand, I can not find in all my experi-
ments any record of such a variety of organisms In any single haul even
when using much larger trawls and dragging over much greater dis-
tances.” He quotes the statistics of the Scottish fishery board’s
trawlings in the North Sea, with a 25-foot trawl, to show that the
average catch is 7.3 species of invertebrata and 8.3 species of fish,
the greatest number of both together recorded in one haul being 29
species. Murray’s own trawlings in the west of Scotland gave a much
greater number of species, sometimes as many as 50, ‘still not such a
great variety of animals as was procured in many instances by the
Challenger’s small trawl in great depths.

Now, in the first place, it is curious that Murray’s own table on page
1437, in which he shows that the “terrigenous” deposits lying along the
Shore lines yield many more animals, both specimens and species, per
haul, than do the “pelagic” deposits! at greater depths, such as red
clays and globigerina oozes, seems directly opposed to the conclusion
quoted above. In the second place, I am afraid that Dr. Murray has
misunderstood the statistics of the Scottish fishery board when he

'One of the earliest of the Challenger oceanographic results, the classification of the
submarine deposits into ‘‘terrigenous” and ‘‘ pelagic,” seems inadequate to repre-
sent fully the facts in regard to sea bottoms, so I am proposing elsewhere (‘‘ Report
of Irish Sea Committee”) the following amended classification: (1) Terrigenous
(Murray), where the deposit is formed chiefly of mineral particles derived from the
waste of the land; (2) Neritic, where the deposit is chiefly of organic origin, and is
derived from the shells and other hard parts of the animals and plants living on the
bottom; (3) Planktonie (Murray’s ‘‘ pelagic”), where the greater part of the deposit
is formed of the remains of free-swimming animals and plants which lived in the sea
over the deposit.

442 OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE.

quotes them as showing that only 7.3 or so species of invertebrates are
brought up, on the average, in the trawl net. I happen to know from
Mr. Thomas Scott, F. L. S., the naturalist who has compiled the sta-
tistics in question, and also from my own observations when on board
the Garland on one of her ordinary trawling expeditions, that the
invertebrata noted down on the station sheet are merely a few of the
more conspicuous or in other ways noteworthy animals. No attempt
is made—nor could possibly be made in the time—by the one naturalist
who has to attend to tow nets, water bottle, the kinds, condition, food,
etc., of the fish caught and other matters—to give anything like a com-
plete or even approximate list of the species, still less the number of indi-
viduals, brought up inthe trawl. I submit, therefore, that itis entirely
misleading to compare those Scottish fishery board statistics, which
were not meant for such a purpose, but only to give a rough idea of the
fauna associated with the fish upon certain grounds, with the carefully
elaborated results worked out at leisure by many specialists in their
laboratories, of a haul of the Challenger’s trawl. Of Dr. Murray’s own
trawlings in the west of Scotland, I can not, of course, speak so posi-
tively; but I shall be surprised to learn that the results of each haul
were as carefully preserved and as fully worked out by specialists as
were the Challenger collections.

Lastly, on the next Liverpool marine biology committee’s dredging
expedition in the Irish Sea after the appearance of Dr. Murray’s vol-
umes, I set myself to determine the species taken in a haul of the trawl]
for comparison with the Challenger numbers. The haul was taken on
June 23, at 7 miles west from Peel, on the north bank, bottom sand and
shells, depth 21 fathoms, with a trawl of only 4-foot beam, less than
half the size of the Challenger one, and it was not down for more than
twenty minutes. I noted down the species observed, and I filled two
bottles with undetermined stuff, which my assistant, Mr. Andrew Scott,
and I examined the following day in the laboratory. Our list comes to
at least 112 species, belonging to at least 103 genera.! I counted 120
duplicate specimens, which, added to 112, gives 232 individuals, but
there may well have been 100 more. This experience, then, is very dif-
ferent from Murray’s, and gives far larger numbers in every respect-—
specimens, species, and genera—than even the Challenger deep-water
haul quoted. I append my list of species,” and practiced marine zoolo-
gists will, I think, see at a glance that it is nothing out of the way;
that it is a fairly ordinary assemblage of not uncommon animals, such
as is frequently met with when dredging in the Coralline zone. I am

It is interesting, in connection with Darwin’s opinion that an animal’s most for-
midable competitors in the struggle for existence are those of its own kind or closely
allied forms, to notice the large proportion of genera to species in such hauls. I
have noticed this in many lists, and it certainly suggests that closely related forms
are comparatively rarely taken together.

2See Appendix, page 454.
OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 443

sure that I have taken better netfuls than this both in the Irish Sea and
on the west of Scotland.

In order to get another case on different ground, not of my own choos-
ing, on- the first occasion after the publication of Br. Murray’s volumes,
when I was out witnessing the trawling observations of the Lancashire
sea fisheries steamer John Fell, 1 counted, with the help of my assist-
ant, Mr. Andrew Scott, and the men on board, the results of the first
haul of the shrimp trawl. It was taken at the mouth of the Mersey
estuary, inside the Liverpool Bar, on what the naturalist would consider
very unfavorable ground, with a bottom of muddy sand, at a depth of
6 fathoms. The shrimp trawl (14-inch mesh) was down for one hour,
and it brought up over 17,000 specimens, referable to at least 39 spe-
cies,' belonging to 34 genera. These numbers have been exceeded on
many other hauls taken in the ordinary course of work by the fisheries
steamer in Liverpool Bay—for example, on this occasion the fish nuim-
bered 5,943; and I have records of hauls on which the fish numbered
over 20,000, and the total catch ot individual animals must have been
nearly 50,000. Can any of Dr. Murray’s hauls on the deep mud beat
these figures?

The conclusion, then, at which I arrive in regard to the distribution
of animals in deep water and in water shallower than 50 fathoms, from
my own experience and an examination of the Challenger results, is in
some respects the reverse of Murray’s. I consider that there are more
species and more individuals in the shallower waters, that the deep
mud as dredged has a poor fauna, that the Coralline zone has a much
richer one, and that the Laminarian zone, where there is vegetable as
well as animal food, has probably the richest of all.

In order to come to as correct a conclusion as possible on the matter,
I have consulted several other naturalists in regard to the smaller
groups of more or less free-swimming Crustacea, such as Copepoda and
Ostracoda, which I thought might possibly be in considerable numbers
over the mud. I have asked three well-known specialists on such
Cretaceans, viz, Prof.G.8. Brady, F.R.S., Mr. Thomas Scott, IF’. L.8.,
and Mr. I. ©. Thompson, F. L. 8., and they all agree in stating that,
although interesting and peculiar, the Copepoda and Ostracoda from

the deep mud are not abundant either in species or in individuals: In
answer to the question which of the three regions (1) the Littoral
zone, (2) from low water to 20 fathoms, and (3) from 26 fathoms onward,
is richest in small, free-swimming, but bottom-haunting, Crustacea, they
all replied the middle region from 0 to 20 fathoms, which is the Lami-
narian zone and the upper edge of the Coralline. Professor Brady
assures me that nearly every other kind of bottom and locality is bet-
ter than mud for obtaining Ostracoda. Mr. T. Scott considers that
Ostracoda are most abundant in shallow water, from 5 to 20 fathoms.
He tells me that as the result of his experience in Loch Fyne, where a
great part of the loch is deep, the richest fauna is always where banks
occur, coming up to about 20 fathoms, and having the bottom formed
of sand, gravel, and shells. The fauna on and over such banks, which
are in the Coralline zone, is much richer than on the deeper mud
around them. On an ordinary shelving shore on the west coast of
Scotland, Mr. Scott, who has had great experience in collecting, con-
siders that the richest fauna is usually at about 20 fathoms. My own
experience in dredging in Norway is the same. In the center of the
fjords in deep water, on the mud, there are rare forms, but very few of
them, while in shallower water at the sides, above the mud, on gravel,
shells, rock, and other bottoms, there is a very abundant fauna.

Probably no group of animals in the sea is of so much importance
from the point of view of food as the Copepoda. They torm a great
part of the food of whales, and of herrings and many other useful fish,
both in the adult and in the larval state, as well as of innumerabie
other animals, large and small. Consequently, f have inquired some-
what carefully into their distribution in the sea, with the assistance
of Professor Brady, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Thompson. These experienced
collectors all agree that Copepoda are most abundant, both as to
species and individuals, close round the shore, amongst seaweeds, or
in shallow water in the Laminarian zone over a weedy bottom. Indi-
viduals are sometimes extremely abundant on the surface of the sea
amongst the plankton, or in shore pools near high water, where,
amongst Wnteromorpha, they swarm in immense profusion; but for a
gathering rich in individuals, species, and genera, the experienced
collector goes to the shallow waters of the Laminarian zone. In regard
to the remaining, higher groups of the Crustacea, my friend Mr. Alfred
O. Walker tells me that he considers them most abundant at depths of
from 0 to 20 fathoms.

I hope no one will think that these are detailed matters interesting
only to the collector, and having no particular bearing upon the great
problems of biology. The sea is admittedly the starting point of life on
this earth, and the conclusions we come to as to the distribution of life
in the different zones must form and modify our views as to the origin
of the faunas—as to the peopling of the deep sea, the shallow waters,
and the land. Murray supposes that life started in Pre-Cambrian
al OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 445
times on the mud, and from there spread upward into shallower waters,
outward on to the surface, and, a good deal later, downward to the
abysses by means of tie cold Polar waters. The late Professor Moseley
considered the pelagic, or surtace life of the ocean, to be the primitive
life from which all the others have been derived. Prof. W. K. Brooks
(The Genus Salpa, 1893, p. 156, etc.) considers that there was a primitive
pelagic fauna, consisting of the simplest microscopic plants and animals,
and “that pelagic life was abundant for a long period during which the
bottom was uninhabited.”

I, on the other hand, for the reasons given fully above, consider that
the Laminarian zone close to low-water mark is at present the richest
in life, that it probably has been so in the past, and that if one has to
express a more definite opinion as to where, in Pre-Cambrian times, life
in its simplest forms first appeared, I see no reason why any other zone
should be considered as having a better claim than what is now the
Laminarian to this distinction. It is there, at present, at any rate, in
the upper edge of the Laminarian zone, at the point of junction of sea,
land, aud air, where there is a profusion of food, where the materials
brought down by streams or worn away from the land are first depos-
ited, where the animals are able to receive the greatest amount of light
and heat, oxygen and food, without being exposed periodically to the
air, rain, frost, sun, and other adverse conditions of the Littoral zone.
It is there that life—it seems to me—is most abundant, growth most
active, competition most severe. It is there, probably, that the sur-
rounding conditions are most favorable to animal life; and, therefore,
it seems likely that it is from this region that, as the result of over-
crowding, migrations have taken place downward to the abysses, out-
ward on the surface, and upward on to the shore. Tinally, it is in
this Laminarian zone, probably, that under the stress of competition
between individuals and between allied species evolution of new forms
by means of natural selection has been most active. Here, at any
rate, we find, along with some of the most primitive of animals, some
of the most remarkably modified forms, and some of the most curious
cases of minute adaptation to environment. This brings us to the
subject of

BIONOMICS,

which deals with the habits and variations of animals, their modifica-
tions, and the relations of these modifications to the surrounding
conditions of existence.

Itis remarkable that the great impetus given by Darwin’s work to
biological investigation has been chiefly directed to problems of struc-
ture and development, and not so much to bionomics until lately.
Variations amongst animals in a state of nature is, however, at last
beginning to receive the attention it deserves. Bateson has collected
together, and classified in a most useful book of reference, the numer-
ous scattered observations on variation made by many investigators,

446 OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE.

and has drawn from some of these cases a conclusion in regard to the
discontinuity of variation which many field zoologists find it hard to
accept.

Weldon and Karl Pearson have recently applied the methods of
statistics and mathematics to the study of individual variation. This
method of investigation, in Professor Weldon’s hands, may be expected
to yield results of great interest in regard to the influence of variations
in the young animal upon the chance of survival, and so upon the
adult characteristics of the species. But while acknowledging the
value of these methods, and admiring the skill and care with which
they have been devised and applied, I must emphatically protest
against the idea which has been suggested, that only by such mathe-
matical and statistical methods of study can we successfully determine
the influence of the environment on species, gauge the utility of specifie
characters, and throw further light upon the origin of species. For my
part, I believe we shall gain a truer insight into those mysteries which
still involve variations and species by a study of the characteristic
features of individuals, varieties, and species in a living state in rela-
tion to their environment and habits. The mode of work of the old
field naturalists, supplemented by the apparatus and methods of the
modern laboratory, is, I believe, not only one of the most fascinating,
but also one of the most profitable fields of investigation for the philo-
sophical zoologist. Such studies must be made in that modern out-
come of the growing needs of our science, the Zoological Station,
where marine animals can be kept in captivity under natural condi-
tions, so that their habits may be closely observed, and where we can
follow out the old precept—first, observation and reflection; then
experiment.

The biological stations of the present day represent, then, a happy
union of the field work of the older naturalists with the laboratory
work of the comparative anatomist, histologist, and embryologist.
They are the culmination of the “Aquarium” studies of Kingsley and
Gosse, and of the feeling in both scientific men and amateurs, which
was expressed by Herbert Spencer when he said: ‘‘Whoever at the
seaside has not had a microscope and an aquarium has yet to learn
what the highest pleasures of the seaside are.” Moreover, I feel that
the biological station has come to the rescue, at a criticai moment, of
our laboratory worker who, without its healthy, refreshing influence, is
often in these latter days in peril of losing his intellectual life in the
weary maze of microtome methods and transcendental cytology. The
old Greek myth of the Libyan giant, Antzeus, who wrestled with Her-
cules and regained his strength each time he touched his mother earth,
is true at least of the zoologist. I am sure he derives fresh vigor from
every direct contact with living nature.

In our tanks and artificial pools we can reproduce the Littoral and the
Laminarian zones; we can see the methods of feeding and breeding—
4 OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 447

the two most powerful factors in influencing an animal. We can study
mimicry, and test theories of protective and warning coloration.

The explanations given by these theories of the varied forms and
colors of animals were first applied by such leaders in our science as
Bates, Wallace, and Darwin, chiefly to insects and birds, but have
lately been extended, by the investigations of Giard, Garstang, Clubb,
and others, to the case of marine animals. I may mention very briefly
one or twoexamples. Amongst the Nudibranchiate Mollusca—familiar
animals around most parts of our British coasts—we meet with various
forms which are edible, and, so far as we know, unprotected by any
defensive or offensive apparatus. Such forms are usually shaped or
colored so as to resemble more or less their surroundings, and so
become inconspicuous in their natural haunts. Dendronotus arbores-
cens, one of the largest and most handsome of our British Nudi-
branchs, is such a case. The large, branched processes on its back,
and its rich purple-brown and yellow markings, tone in so well with
the masses of brown and yellow zoophytes and purplish red seaweeds,
amongst which we tsually find Dendronotus, that it becomes very com.
pletely protected from observation; and, as I know from my own expe-
rience, the practiced eye of the naturalist may fail to detect it lying
before him in the tangled forests of a shore pool.

Other Nudibranchs, however, belonging to the genus Holis, for exam-
ple, are colored in such a brilliant and seemingly crude manner that
they do not tone in with any natural surroundings, and so are always
conspicuous. They are active in their habits, and seem rather to court
observation than to shun it. When we remember that such species of
Holis are protected by the numerous stinging cells in the cnidophorous
sacs placed on the tips of all the dorsal processes, and that they do
not seem to be eaten by other animals, we have at once an explanation
of their fearless habits and of their conspicuous appearance. The
brilliant colors are in this case of a warning nature, for the purpose of
rendering the animal provided with the stinging cells noticeable and
recognizable. But it must be remembered that in a museum jar, or in
a laboratory dish, or as an illustration in a book or on the wall, Den-
dronotus is quite as conspicuous and striking an animal as Holis. In
order to interpret correctly the effect of their forms and colors, we
must see them alive and at home, and we must experiment upon their
edibility or otherwise in the tanks of our biological stations.!

Let me give you one more example of a somewhat different kind.
The soft, unprotected mollusk, Lamellaria perspicua, is not uncommonly
found associated (as Giard first pointed out) with colonies of the
compound Ascidian Leptoclinum maculatum, and in these cases the
Lamellaria is found to be eating the Leptoclinum, and lies in a slight
cavity which it has excavated in the Ascidian colony, so as to be about

Vol. IV, p. 150; and Nature for June 26, 1890.

AAs OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE.

flush with the general surface. The integument of the mollusk is, both
in general tint, and also in surface markings, very like the Ascidian
colony with its scattered ascidiozooids. This is clearly a good case of
protective coloring. Presumably, the Lamellaria escapes the observa-
tion of its enemies through being mistaken for a part of the Leptoclinum
colony; and the Leptoclinum being crowded like a sponge with minute,
sharp-pointed spicules is, | suppose, avoided as inedible by carnivorous
animals, which might devour such things as the soft, unprotected mol-
lusk. But the presence of the spicules evidently does not protect the
Leptoclinum from Lamellaria, so that we have, if the above interpreta-
tion is correct, the curious result that the Lamellaria profits by a
protective characteristic of the Leptoclinum, for which it has itself no
respect, or, to put it another way, the Leptoclinum is protected against
enemies to some extent for the benefit of the Lamellaria, which preys
upon its vitals.

it is to my mind no sufficient objection to theories of protective and
warning coloration that careful investigation may from time to time’
reveal cases where a disguise is penetrated, a protection frustrated, an
offensive device supposed to confer inedibility apparently ignored.
We must bear in mind that the enemies, as well as their prey, are
exposed to competition, are subject to natural selection, are undergoing
evolution; that the pursuers and the pursued, the eaters and the eaten,
have been evolved together, and that it may be of great advantage to
be protected from some even if not from all enemies. Just as on land,
some animals can browse upon thistles whose ‘“‘nemo me impune
lacessit” spines are supposed to confer immunity from attack, so it is
quite in accord with our ideas of evolution by means of natural selee-
tion to suppose that some marine animals have evolved an indifference
to the noxious sponge or to the bristling Ascidian, which are able, by
their defensive characteristics, like the thistle, to repel the majority of
invaders.

Although we can keep and study the Littoral and Laminarian animals
at ease in our zoological stations, it may perhaps be questioned how
far we can reproduce in our experimental and observational tanks
the conditions of the Coralline and the Deep-mud zones. One might
suppose that the pressure—which we have no means as yet for supply-
ing'—and which at 50 fathoms amounts to nearly 100 pounds on the
square inch, and at 80 fathoms to about 240 pounds, or over 2 hundred-
weight on the square inch, would be an essential factor in the life con-
ditions of the inhabitants of such depths, and yet we have kept half a
dozen specimens of Calocaris macandree, dredged from 70 to 80 fath-
oms, alive at the Port Erin Biological Station for several weeks; we

1Following up M. Regnard’s experiments, some mechanical arrangement whereby
water could be kept circulating and aerated under pressure in closed tanks might be
devised, and ought to be tried at some zoological station. I learn from the director
at the Plymouth Station that some of the animals from deep water, such as Polyzoa,
do not expand in their tanks.
OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 449

have had both the red and the yellow forms of Sarcodictyon catenata,
dredged from 30 to 40 fathoms, in a healthy condition with the polypes
freely expanded for an indefinite period; and Mr. Arnold Watson has
kept the Polynoid worm, Panthalis oerstedi, from the deep mud at over
50 fathoms, alive, healthy, and building its tube under observation,
first for a week at the Port Erin Station, and for many months at Shef-
field, in a comparatively small tank with no depth of water. Conse-
quently, it seems clear that with ordinary care almost any marine
animals from such depths as are found within the British area may be
kept under observation and submitted to experiment in healthy and
fairly natural conditions. The biological station, with its tanks, is in
fact an arrangement whereby we bring a portion of the sea with its rocks
and bottom deposits and seaweeds, with its inhabitants and their asso-
ciates, their food and their enemies, and place it for continuous study
on our Jaboratory table. It enables us to carry on the bionomical
investigations to which we look for information as to the methods and
progress of evolution; in it lie centered our hopes of a comparative
physiology of the invertebrates—a physiology not wholly medical—
and finally to the biological station we confidently look for help in
connection with our coast fisheries. This brings me to the last subject
which I shall touch upon, a subject closely related both to oceanography
and bionomics, and one which depends much for its future adyance
upon our biological stations—that is the subject of

AQUICULTURE,

or industrial ichthyology, the scientific treatment of fishery investiga-
tions, a subject to which Professor McIntosh has first in this country
directed the attention of zoologists, and in which he has been guiding
us for the last decade by his admirable researches. What chemistry
is to the aniline, the alkali, and some other HUEIUDIEIOLULe Sp marine
zoology is to our fishing industries.

Although zoology has never appealed to popular estimation as a
directly useful science having industrial applications in the same way
that chemistry and physics have done, and consequently has never had
its claims as a subject of technical education sufficiently recognized;
still, as we in this section are well aware, our subject has many tech-
nical applications to the arts and industries. Biological principles
dominate medicine and surgery. Bacteriology, brewing, and many
allied subjects are based upon the study of microscopic organisms.
Keonomic entomology is making is value felt in agriculture. Along all
these and other lines there is a great future openin g up before biology, a
future of extended usefulness, of popular appreciation, and of value to
the nation—and not the least important of these technical applications
will, I am convinced, be that of zoology to our fishing industries.
When we consider their enormous annual value—about eight millions
Sterling at first hand to the fisherman, and a great deal more than that

SM 95——29
A450 OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE.

by the time the products reach the British public, when we remember
the very large proportion of our population who make their living,
directly or indirectly (as boat builders, net makers, etc.), from the fish-
eries, and the still larger proportion who depend for an important ele-
ment in their food supply upon these industries; when we think of
what we pay other countries—France, Holland, Norway—for oysters,
mussels, lobsters, etc., which we could rear in this country if our sea
shores and our sea bottom were properly cultivated; and when we
remember that fishery cultivation or aquiculture is applied zoology, we
can readily realize the enormous value to the nation which this direct
application of our science will one day have—perhaps I ought rather to
say, we can scarcely realize the extent to which zoology may be made
the guiding science of a great national industry.

The flourishing shellfish industries of France, the oyster culture at
Areachon and Marennes, and the mussel culture by bouchots in the
Bay of Aiguillon, show what can be done as the result of encourage-
ment and wise assistance from Government, with constant industry on
the part of the people, directed by scientific knowledge. In another
direction the successful hatching of large numbers (hundreds of millions)
of cod and plaice by Captain Dannevig in Norway, and by the Scottish
fishery board at Dunbar, opens up possibilities of immense practical
value in the way of restocking our exhausted bays and fishing banks,
depleted by the overtrawling of the last few decades.

The demand for the produce of our seas is very great, and would
probably pay well for an increased supply. Our choicer fish and shell-
fish are becoming rarer and the market prices are rising. The great
majority of our oysters are imported from France, Holland, and America.
Even in mussels we are far from being able to meet the demand. In
Scotland alone the long-line fishermen use nearly a hundred millions
of mussels to bait their hooks every time the lines are set, and they
have to import annually many tons of these mussels at a cost of from
£3 to £3 10s. a ton.

Whether the wholesale introduction of the French method of mussel
culture, by means of bouchots, on to our shores would be a financial
success is doubtful. Material and labor are dearer here, and beds,
scars, or scalps seem, on the whole, better fitted to our local conditions;
but as innumerable young mussels all around our coast perish miser-
ably every year for want of suitable objects to attach to, there can be
no reasonable doubt that the judicious erection of simple stakes or
plain bouchots would serve a useful purpose, at any rate in the collec-
tion of seed, even if the further rearing be carried on by means of the
bed system. .

All such aquicultural processes require, however, in addition to the
scientific knowledge, sufficient capital. They can not be successfully
carried out on asmall scale. When the zoologist has once shown, as a
laboratory experiment in the zoological station, that a particular thing
r ss OCEANOGRAPHY, BIONOMICS, AND AQUICULTURE. 451

can be done—that this fish can be hatched or that shellfish reared—
under certain conditions which promise to be an industrial success,
then the matter should be carried out by the Government! or by ecapi-
talists on a sufficiently large scale to remove the risk of results being
vitiated by temporary accident or local variation in the conditions. It
is contrary, however, to our English traditions for Government to help
in such a matter, and if our local sea fisheries committees have not the
necessary powers nor the available funds, there remains a splendid
opportunity for opulent landowners to erect sea-fish hatcheries on the
shores of their estates, and for the rich merchants of our great cities
to establish aquiculture in their neighboring estuaries, and by so doing
instruct the fishing population, resuscitate the declining industries,
and cultivate the barren shores—in all reasonable probability to their
own ultimate profit.

In addition to the farming of our shores, there is a great deal to be
done in promoting the fishing industries on the inshore and offshore
grounds along our coast, and in connection with such work the first
necessity is a thorough scientific exploration of our British seas by
means of a completely fitted dredging and trawling expedition. Such
exploration can only be done in little bits, spasmodically, by private
enterprise. Irom the time of Edward Forbes it has been the delight
of British marine zoologists to explore, by means of dredging from
yachts or hired vessels during their holidays, whatever areas of the
neighboring seas were open to them. Some of the greatest names in
the roll of our zoologists,and some of the most creditable work in
British zoology, will always be associated with dredging expeditions.
Forbes, Wyville Thomson, Carpenter, Gwyn Jeffreys, McIntosh, and
Norman—one can seareely think of them without recalling—

‘‘ Hurrah for the dredge, with its iron edge,
And its mystical triangle,
And its hided net, with meshes set,
Odd fishes to entangle!” ”

Much good pioneer work in exploration has been done in the past by
these and other naturalists, and much is now being done locally by
committees or associations—by the Dublin Royal Society on the west
of Ireland, by the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth, by the
Fishery Board in Scotland, and by the Liverpool Marine Biology Com-
mittee in the Irish Sea; but few zoologists or zoological committees
have the means, the opportunity, the time to devote, along with their
professional duties, to that detailed, systematic survey of our whole
British sea area which is really required. Those who have not had

We require in England a central board or Government department of fisheries,
composed in part of scientific experts, and that not merely for the purpose of impos-
ing and enforcing regulations, but still more, in order that research into fisheries
problems may be instituted and aquicultural experiments carried out.

experience of it can scarcely realize how much time, energy, and money
it requires to keep up a series of dredging expeditions, how many
delays, disappointments, expensive accidents, and real hardships there
are, and how often the naturalist is tempted to leave unprofitable
grounds, which ought to be carefully worked over, for some more
favored spot where he knows he can count upon good spoil. And yet
it is very necessary that the whole ground—good or bad though it may
be from the zoological point of view—should be thoroughly surveyed,
physically and biologically, in order that we may know the conditions
of existence which environ our fishes on their feeding grounds, their
spawning grounds, their ‘‘ nurseries,” or whatever they may be.

The British Government has done a nobie piece of work, which will
redound to its everlasting credit, in providing for and carrying out the
Challenger expedition. Now that that great enterprise is completed,
and that the whole scientific world is united in appreciation of the
results obtained, it would be a glorious consequence, and surely a very
wise action in the interests of the national fisheries, for the Government
to fit out an expedition, in charge of two or three zoologists and fisheries
experts, to spend a couple of years in exploring more systematically
than has yet been done, or can otherwise be done, our British coasts
from the Laminarian zone down to the deep mud. No one could be
better fitted to organize and direct such an expedition than Dr. John
Murray.

Such a detailed survey of the bottom and the surface waters, of their
conditions and their contents, at all times of the year for a couple of
years, would give us the kind of information we require for the solution
of some of the more difficult fishery problems—such as the extent and
causes of the wanderings of our fishes, which “ nurseries” are supplied
by particular spawning grounds, the reason of the sudden disappear-
ance of a fish, such as the haddock, from a locality, and in general the
history of our food fishes throughout the year. It is creditable to our
Government to have done the pioneer work in exploring the great ocean,
but surely it would be at least equally creditable to them—and perhaps
more directly and immediately profitable, if they look for some such
return from scientific work—to explore our own seas and our own sea
fisheries.

There is still another subject connected with the fisheries which the
biologist can do much to elucidate—I mean the diseases of edible ani-
mals and the effect upon man of the various diseased conditions. It is
well known that the consumption of mussels taken from stagnant or
impure water is sometimes followed by severe symptoms of irritant
poisoning which may result in rapid death. This “musselling” is due
to the presence of an organic alkaloid or ptomaine, in the liver of the
mollusk, formed doubtless by a microorganism in the impure water.
It is clearly of the greatest importance to determine accurately under
what conditions the mussel can become infected by the microorganism,

Pe
‘ole <j

in what stage it is injurious to man, and whether, as is supposed, steep-
ing in pure water with or without the addition of carbonate of soda
will render poisonous mussels fit for food.

During this last year there has been an outcry, almost amounting to
a scare, and seriously affecting the market,' as to the supposed connec-
tion between oysters taken from contaminated water and typhoid fever.
This, like the musselling, is clearly a case for scientific investigation,
and, with my colleague, Professor Boyce, I have commenced a series
of experiments and observations, partly at the Port Erin Biological
Station, where we have oysters laid down on different parts of the
shore under very different conditions, as well as in dishes and tanks,
and partly at University College, Liverpool.

Our object is to determine the effect of various conditions of water
and bottom upon the life and health of the oyster, the effect of the
addition of various impurities to the water, the conditions under which
the oyster becomes infected with the typhoid bacillus, and the result-
ing effect upon the oyster, the period during which the oyster remains
infectious, and, lastly, whether any simple practicable measures can be
taken (1) to determine whether an oyster is infected with typhoid, and
(2) to render such an oyster innocuous to man. As Professor Boyce
and I propose to lay a paper upon this subject before the section, I
shall not occupy further time now by a statement of our methods and
results.

Ihave probably already sufficiently indicated to you the extent and
importance of the applications of our science to practical questions con-
nected with our fishing industries. But if the zoologist has great
opportunities for usefulness, he ought always to bear in mind that he
has also grave responsibilities in connection with fisheries investiga-
tions. Much depends upon the results of his work. Private enter-
prise, public opinion, local regulations, and even imperial legislation,
may all be affected by his decisions. He ought not lightly to come to
conclusions upon weighty matters. I am convinced that of ali the
varied lines of research in modern zoology, none contains problems
more interesting and intricate than those of bionomics, oceanography,
and the fisheries, and of these three series the problems connected with
our fisheries are certainly not the least interesting, not the least intri-
cate, and not the least important in their bearing upon the welfare of
mankind.

1T am told that between December and March the oyster trade decreased 75 per
cent.

BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.!

By W. T. THISELTON-DYER, F. R.S.

The establishment of a new section of the British Association,
devoted to botany, can not but be regarded by the botanists of this
country as an event of the greatest importance. For it is practically
the first time that they have possessed an independent organization of
their own. It is true that for some years past we have generally been
strong enough to form a separate department of the old Biological
Section D, on the platform of which so many of us in the past have
acted in some capacity or other, and on which, indeed, many of us may
be said to have made our first appearance. We shall not start, then,
on our new career without the remembrance of filial affection for our
parent, and the earnest hope that our work may be worthy of its great
traditions,

The first meeting of the section, or, as it was then called, committee,
at Oxford was held in 1852, And though there has been from time to
time some difference in the grouping of the several biological sciences,
the two great branches of biology have only now for the first time
formally severed the partnership into which they entered on that occa-
sion. That this severance, if inevitable from force of circumstances,
is in Some respects a matter of regret, I do not deny. Specialization is
inseparable from scientific progress; but it will defeat its own end in
biology if the specialist does not constantly keep in touch with those
fundamental principles which are common to all organic nature. We
shall have to take care that we do not drift into a position of isolation.
Section D undoubtedly afforded a convenient opportunity for discuss-
ing many questions on which it was of great advantage that workers in
the two different fields should compare their results and views. Bat I
hope that by means of occasional conferences we shall still, in some
measure, be able to preserve this advantage.

BRETROSPECT.

I confess I found it a great temptation to review, however imperfectly,
the history and fortunes of our subject while it belonged to Section D.
But to have done so would have been practically to have written the
history of botany in this country since the first third of the century.
Yet I can not pass over some few striking events.

I think that the earliest of these must undoubtedly be regarded as
the most epoch making. I mean the formal publication by the Linnean
Society, in 1833, of the first description of “the nucleus of the cell,” by
Robert Brown. (Mise. Bot. Works, I, 512.) It seems difficult to realize
that this may be within the recollection of some who are now living
amongst us. It is, however, of peculiar interest to me that the first
person who actually distinguished this all-important body, and indi-
cated it in a figure, was Francis Bauer, thirty years earlier, in 1802.
This remarkable man, whose skill in applying the resources of art to
the illustration of plant anatomy has never, I suppose, been surpassed,
was ‘resident draftsman for fifty years to the Royal Botanic Garden at
Kew.” And it was at Kew, and in a tropical orchid, Phaius grandifo-
lius, no doubt grown there, that the discovery was made.

It was, I confess, with no little admiration that, on refreshing my
memory by a reference to Robert Brown’s paper, I read again the vivid
account which he gives in a footnote of the phenomena, so painfully
taumiliar to many of us who have been teachers, exhibited in the
staminal hair of Tradescantia. Sir Joseph Hooker (Proc. Linn. Soe.,
1887-88, 65) has well remarked that ‘the supreme importance of this
observation, - - - leading to undreamt-of conceptions of the
fundamental phenomena of organic life, is acknowledged by all
investigators.”

It is singular that so profound an observer as Robert Brown should
have himself missed the significance of what he saw. The world had
to wait for the discovery of protoplasm by Von Mohl till 1846, and till
1850 for its identification with the sarcode of zoologists by Cohn, who
is still, [ am happy to say, living and at work, and to whom last year
the Linnzean Society did itself the honor of presenting its medal.

The Edinburgh meeting of the association, in 1834, was the occasion
of the announcement of another memorable discovery of Robert Brown’s.
I will content myself with quoting Hofmeister’s (Higher Cryptogamia,
452) account of it: ‘Robert Brown was the discoverer of the polyem-
bryony of the Conifere. In a later treatise he pointed out the origin of
the pro-embryo in large cells of the endosperm, to which he gave the
name of corpuscula.” The period of the forties, just half a century ago,
looks in the retrospect as one of almost dazzling discovery. To say
nothing of the formal appearance of protoplasm on the scene, the foun-
dations were being laid in all directions of our modern botanical mor-
phology. Yet its contemporaries viewed it with a very philosophical
She ae:

ealm. Thwaites, who regarded Carpenter as his master, described at
the Oxford meeting in 1847 the conjugation of the Diatomacea, and “ dis-
tinetly indicated,” as Carpenter (Memorial Sketch, 140) says, ‘ that
conjugation is the primitive phase of sexual reproduction.” Berkeley
informed me that the announcement fell perfectly flat. A year or two
later Suminski came to London with his splendid discovery (1848) of
the archegonia of the fern, the antheridia having been first seen by
Nageli in 1844. Carpenter (loc. cit., 141) gave me, many years after, a
curious account of its reception. “At the council of the Ray Society,
at which,” he said, ‘‘I advocated the reproduction of Suminski’s book
on the ‘ Ferns,’ | was assured that the close resemblance of the anthe-
rozoids to spermatozoa was quite sufficient proof that they could have
nothing to do with vegetable reproduction. Ido not think,” he added—
and the complaint is pathetic—“‘that the men of the present generation,
who have been brought up in the light, quite apprehend (in this as in
other matters) the utter darkness in which we were then groping, or
fully recognize the deserts of those who helped them to what they now
enjoy.” This was in 1875, and I suppose is not likely to be less true now.

The Oxford meeting in 1860 was the scene of the memorable debate
on the origin of species, at which it is interesting to remember that
Henslow presided. On that occasion, Section D reached its meridian.
The battle was Homeric. However little to the taste of its author, the
launching of his great theory was, at any rate, dignified with a not
inconsiderable explosion. It may be that it is not given to the men of
our day to ruffle the dull level of public placidity with disturbing and
far-reaching ideas. But if it were, I doubt whether we have, or need
now, the fierce energy which inspired then either the attack or the
defense. When we met again in Oxford last year, the champion of
the old conflict stood in the place of honor, acclaimed of all men, a
beautiful and venerable figure. We did not know then that that was
to be his farewell.

The battle was not in vain. Six years afterwards, at Nottingham,
Sir Joseph Hooker delivered his classical lecture on Insular Floras. It
implicitiy accepted the new doctrine, and applied it with admirable
effect to a field which had long waited for an illuminating principle.
The lecture itself has since remained one of the corner stones of that
rational theory of the geographical distribution of plants which may,
I think, be claimed fairly as of purely English origin.

HENSLOW.

Addressing you as I do at Ipswich, there is one name written in the
annals of our old section which I can not pass over—that of Henslow.
He was the secretary of the Biological Section at its first meeting in
1852, and its president at Bristol in 1836. I suppose there are few men
of this century who have indirectly more influenced the current of
human thought. For in great measure I think it will not be contested

458 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

that we owe Darwin to him. As Romanes has told us (Memorial
Notices, 13): “His letters written to Professor Henslow during his
voyage round the world overflow with feelings of affection, veneration,
and obligation to his accomplished master and dearest friend—feelings
which throughout his life he retained with no diminished intensity.
As he used himself to say, before he knew Professor Henslow, the only
objects he cared for were foxes and partridges.”

I do not wish to overstate the facts. The possession of ‘‘ the col-
lector’s instinet, strong in Darwin from his childheod, as is usually the
case In great naturalists,” to use Huxley’s (Proc. R. 8., XLIV, vi)
words, would have borne its usual fruit in after life, in some shape or
other, even if Darwin had not fallen into Henslow’s hands. But then
the particular train of events which culminated in the great work of
his life would never have been started. It appeared to me, then, that
it would not be an altogether uninteresting investigation to ascertain
something about Henslow himself. The result has been to provide me
with several texts, which I think it may be not unprofitable to dwell
upon on the present occasion.

In the first place, what was the secret of his influence over Darwin?
‘My dear old master in natural history” (Life, II, 317), he calls him;
and to have stood in this relation to Darwin! is no small matter.
Again, he speaks of his friendship with him as ‘‘ a circumstance which
influenced my whole career more than any other” (I, 52). The singular
beauty of Henslow’s character, to which Darwin himself bore noble
testimony, would count for something, but it would not in itself be a
sufficient explanation. Nor was it that intellectual fascination which
often binds pupils to the master’s feet; for, as Darwin tells us, “1 do
not suppose that anyone would say that he possessed much original
genius” (I, 52). The real attraction seems to me to be found in Hens-
low’s possession, in an extraordinary degree, of what may be called the
natural history spirit. This resolves itself into keen observation and a
lively interest in the facts observed. ‘ His strongest taste was to draw
conclusions from long-continued minute observations” (I, 52). The
old natural history method, of which it seems to me that Henslow was
so Striking an embodiment, is now, and I think unhappily, almost a
thing of the past. The modern university student of botany puts his
elders to blush by his minute knowledge of some small point in vege-
table histology. But he can tell you little of the contents of a country
hedgerow, and if you put an unfamiliar plant in his hands he is pretty
much at a loss how to set about recognizing its affinities. Disdaining
the field of nature spread at his feet in his own country, he either seeks
salvation in a German laboratory or hurries off to the tropics, con-
vinced that he will at once immortalize himself. But ccelum non animum
mutat; he puts into “pickle” the same objects as his predecessors,

1 As I shail have frequent occasion to quote the Life and Letters, I shall insert the
references in the text.
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 459

never to be looked at again; or perhaps writes a paper on some obvious
phenomena which he could have studied with less fatigue in the Palm
House at Kew.

The secret of the right use of travel is the possession of the natural
history instinct, and to those who contemplate it I can only recommend
a careful study of Darwin’s Naturalist’s Voyage. Nothing that came
in his way seems to have evaded him or to have seemed too incon-
siderable for attention. No doubt some respectable travelers have
lost themselves in a maze of observations that have led to nothing.
But the example of Darwin, and I might add of Wallace, of Huxley,
and of Moseley, show that that result is the fault of the man and not
of the method. The right moment comes when the fruitful opportunity
arrives to him who can seizeit. The first strain of the prelude with
which the “Origin” commences are these words: “When on board
H. M.S. Beagle as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in
the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South America.” But
this sort of vein is not struck at hazard or by him who has not served
a tolerably long apprenticeship to the work.

When one reads and rereads the “ Voyage,” it is simply amazing to
see how much could be achieved with a previous training which we
now should think ludicrously inadequate. Before Henslow’s time the
state of the natural sciences at Cambridge was incredible. In fact,
Leonard Jenyns (Memoir, 175), his biographer, speaks of the “utter
disregard paid to natural history in the university previous to his
taking up his residence there.” The professor of botany had delivered
no lectures for thirty years, and though Sir James Smith, the founder
of the Linnean Society, had offered his services, they were declined on
the ground of his being a Nonconformist (ibid., 37).

As to Henslow’s own scientific work, I can but rely on the judgment
of those who could appreciate it in relation to its time. According to
Berkeley (ibid., 56), “he was certainly one of the first, if not the very
first, to see that two forms of fruit might exist in the same fungus.”
And this, as we now know, was a fundamental advance in this branch
of morphology. Sir Joseph Hooker tells me that his papers were all
distinetly in advance of his day. Before occupying the chair of botany,
he held for some years that of mineralogy. Probably he owed this to
his paper on the “Isle of Anglesey,” published when he was only 26. I
learn from the same authority that this to some extent anticipated, but
at any rate strongly influenced, Sedgwick’s subsequent work in the
same region,

BOTANICAL TEACHING.

Henslow’s method of teaching deserves study. Darwin says of his
lectures “that he liked them much for their extreme clearness.” “But,”
he adds, “I did not study botany” (I, 48). Yet we must not take this
too seriously. Darwin (Voyage, 421), when at the Galapagos, “indis-
eriminately collected everything in flower on the different islands, and

460 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

fortunately kept my collections separate.” Fortunately indeed; for it
was the results extracted from these collections, when worked up sub-
sequently by Sir Joseph Hooker, which determined the main work of
his life. ‘It was such cases as that of the Galapagos Archipelago
which chiefly led me to study the origin of species” (IIT, 159).

Henslow’s actual method of teaching went some way to anticipate
the practical methods of which we are all so proud. ‘He was the first
to introduce into the botanical examination for degrees in London the
system of practical examination” (Memoir, 161). But there was a
direct simplicity about his class arrangements characteristic of the man.
‘“‘A large number of specimens - - - were placed in baskets on a
side table in the lecture room, with a number of wooden plates and other
requisites for dissecting them after a rough fashion, each student pro-
viding himself with what he wanted betore taking his seat” (ibid., 39).
I do not doubt that the results were, in their way, as efficient as we
obtain now in more stately laboratories.

The most interesting feature about his teaching was not, however, its
academic aspect, but the use he made of botany as a general educational
instrument. “He always held that a man of no powers of observation
was quite an exception” (ibid., 163). He thought (and I think he proved)
that botany might be used “for strengthening the observant faculties
and expanding the reasoning powers of children in all classes of society”
(ibid., 99). The difficulty with which those who undertake now to teach
our subject have to deal is that most people ask the question, What is
the use of learning botany unless one means to be a botanist? It might,
indeed, be replied that as the vast majority of people never learn any-
thing effectively, they might as well try botany as anything else. But
Henslow looked only to the mental discipline; and it was characteristic
of the man and of his belief in his methods that when he was sum-
moned to court to lecture to the royal family, his lectures “ were, in all
respects, identical with those he was in the habit of giving to his little
Hitcham scholars” (Memoir, 149); and it must be added that they
were not less successful.

This success naturally attracted attention. Botanical teaching in
schools was taken up by the Government, and continues to receive
support to the present day. But the primitive spirit has, I am afraid,
evaporated. The measurement of results by means of examination
has been fatal to its survival. The teacher has to keep steadily before
his eyes the necessity of earning his grant. The educational problem
retires into the background. “The strengthening of the observant
faculties,” and the rest of the Henslowian programme, must give way
to the imperious necessity of presenting to the examiner candidates
equipped with at least the minimum of text-book formulas reproducible
on paper. I do not speak in this matter without painful experience.
The most astute examiner is defeated by the still more astute crammer.

up is promptly thrown aside. If you supply the apple blossom for
actual description, you are as likely as not to be furnished with a
detailed account of a buttercup. The training of observation has gone
by the board and the exercise of mere memory has taken its place.
But a table of logarithms or a Hebrew grammar would serve this pur-
pose equally well. Yet I do not despair of Henslow’s work still bear-
ing fruit. The examination system will collapse from the sheer
impossibility of carrying it on beyond a certain point. Freed from its
trammels, the teacher will have greater scope for individuality, and the
result of his labors will be rewarded after some intelligent system of
inspection. And here I may claim support from an unexpected quar-
ter. Mr. Gladstone has recently written to a correspondent: “I think
that the neglect of natural history, in all its multitude of branches, was
the grossest defect of our old system of training for the young; and,
further, that little or nothing has been done by way of remedy for that
defect in the attempts made to alter or reform that system.” Iam sure
that the importance and weight of this testimony, coming as it does
from one whose training and sympathies have always been literary,
can not be denied. That there is already some revival of Henslow’s
methods, I judge from the fact that I have received applications from
board schools, amounting to some hundreds, for surplus specimens
from the Kew Museums. Withouta special machinery for the purpose
I can not do much, and perhaps it is well. But my staff have willingly
done what was possible, and from the letters I have received | gather
that the labor has not been wholly misspent.

MUSEUM ARRANGEMENT.

This leads me to the last branch of Henslow’s scientific work on
which I am able to touch, that of the arrangement of museums,
especially those which being local have little meaning unless their pur-
pose is strictly educational. I think it is now generally admitted that
both in the larger and narrower aspects of the question, his ideas,
which were shared in some measure by Edward I'orbes, were not
merely far in advance of his time, but was essentially sound. And
here L can not help remarking that the zoologists have perhaps profited
more by his teaching than the botanists. I do not know how far Sir
William Flower and Professor Lankester would admit the influence of
Henslow’s ideas. But so far as my knowledge goes, | am not aware
that, at any rate in Europe, there is anything to be seen in public
museums comparable to the educational work accomplished by the one
at the College of Surgeons and the Natural History Museum, and by
the other at Oxford.

I have often thought it singular that in botany we have not kept
pace in this matter with our brother naturalists. I do not doubt that
vegetable morphology and a vast number of important facts in evolu-
tion, as illustrated from the vegetable kingdom, might be presented to
462 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION,

the eye in a fascinating way in a carefully arranged museum. The
most successful and, indeed, almost the only attempt which has been
made in this direction is that at Cambridge, which, I believe, is due to
Mr. Gardiner. But our technical methods for preserving specimens
still leave much to desire. Something more satisfactory will, it may be
hoped, some day be devised, and the whole subject is one which is
well worth the careful consideration of our section. Henslow at least
effected a vast improvement in the mode of displaying botanical objects;
and a collection prepared by his own hands, which was exhibited at one
of the Paris exhibitions, excited the warm admiration of the French
botanists, who always appreciate the clear illustration of morpholog-

ical facts.
OLD SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY.

If the old school of natural history, of which Henslow in his day
was a living spirit, is at present, as seems to be the case, continually
losing its hold upon us, this has certainly not been due to its want of
value as an educational discipline or to its sterility in contributing
new ideas to human knowledge. Darwin’s Origin of Species may
certainly be regarded as its offspring, and of this Huxley (Proc. R.5.,
XLIV, xvii,) says with justice: “It is doubtful if any single book
except the Principia, ever worked so great and rapid a revolution in
science or made so deep an impression on the general mind.” Yet
Darwin’s biographer, in that admirable Life which ranks with the
few really great biographies in our language, remarks (I, 155): ‘In
reading his books, one is reminded of the older naturalists rather
than of the modern school of writers. He was a naturalist in the old
sense of the word, thatis, a man who works at many branches of science,
not merely a specialist in one.” This is no doubt true, but does not
exactly hit off the distinction between the kind of study which has
gone out of fashion and that which has come in. The older workers
in biology were occupied mainly with the external or, at any rate,
grosser features of organisms and their relation to surrounding condi-
tions; the modern, on the other hand, are engaged on the study of
internal and intimate structure. Work in the laboratory, with its
necessary limitations, takes the place of research in the field. One
may almost, in fact, say that the use of the compound microscope
divides the two classes. Asa Gray has compared Robert Brown with
Darwin as the “two British naturalists” who have ‘more than any
others, impressed their influence upon science in the nineteenth cen-
tury” (Nature, X, 80). Now, it is noteworthy that Robert Brown did
all his work with a simple microscope. And Francis Darwin writes of
his father: “It strikes us nowadays as extraordinary that he should
have had no compound microscope when he went his Beagle voyage;
but in this he followed the advice of Robert Brown, who was an
authority on such matters” (I, 145). One often meets with persons,
and sometimes of no small eminence, who speak as if there were some
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 463

necessary antagonism between the old and the new studies. Thus I
have heard a distinguished systematist describe the microscope as a
curse, and a no less distinguished morphologist speak of a herbarium
having its proper place on a bonfire. To me I confess this anathema-
tization of the instruments of research proper to any branch of our
subject is not easily intelligible. Yet in the case of Darwin himself it
is certain that if his earlier work may be said to rest solely on the
older methods, his later researches take their place with the work of
the new school. At our last meeting Pfeffer vindicated one of his
latest and most inportant observations.

The case of Robert Brown is even more striking. He is equally great
whether we class him with the older or the modern school. In fact, so
far as botany in this country is concerned, he may be regarded as the
founder of the latter. It is to him that we owe the establishment of
the structure of the ovule and its development into the seed. Even
more important were the discoveries to which I have already referred,
which ultimately led to the establishment of the group of Gymnosperms.
“No more important discovery,” says Sachs (History, 142), “was ever
made in the domain of comparative morphology and systematic botany.
The first steps toward this result, which was clearly brought out by
Hofmeister twenty-five years later, were secured by Robert Brown’s
researches, and he was incidentally led to these researches by some
difficulties in the construction of the seed of an Australian genus.”
Yet it may be remembered that he began his career as naturalist to
Flinders’s expedition for the exploration of Australia. He returned to
England with 4,000 “for the most part new species of plants.” And
these have formed the foundation of our knowledge of the flora of that
continent. Brown’s chief work was done between 1820 and 1840, and,
as Sachs (loe. cit., 139, 140) tells us, ‘“‘was better appreciated during
that time in Germany than in any other country.”

MODERN SCHOOL.

The real founder of the modern teaching in this country in both
branches of biology I can not doubt was Carpenter. The first edition
of his admirable Principles of Comparative Physiology was published
in 1838, the last in 1854. All who owe, as I do, a deep debt of gratitude
to that book will agree with Huxley (Memorial Sketch, 67) in regard-
ing it as “by far the best general survey of the whole field of life and
of the broad principles of biology which had been produced up to the
time of its publication. Indeed,” he adds, “although the fourth edition
is now in many respects out of date, I do not know its equal for breadtb
of view, sobriety of speculation, and accuracy of detail.”

The charm of a wide and philosophic survey of the different forms
under which life presents itself could not but attract the attention of
teachers. Rolleston elaborated a course of instruction in zoology at
Oxford in which the structures described in the lecture room were

464 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

subsequently worked out in the laboratory. In 1872, Huxley organized
the memorable course in elementary biology at South Kensington which
has since, in its essential features, been adopted throughout the coun-
try. In the following year, during Huxley’s absence abroad through
ill health, I arranged, at his request, a course of instruction on the
same lines for the vegetable kingdom.

That the development of the new teaching was inevitable can hardly
be doubted, and I for my part am not disposed to regret the share I
took init. But it was not obvious, and certainly it was not expected,
that it would to so large an extent cut the ground from under the feet
of the old natural history studies. The consequences are rather
serious, and [ think it is worth while pointing them out.

In a vast empire like our own, there is a good deal of work to be done
and a good many posts to be filled, for which the old natural history
training was not merely a useful, but even a necessary preparation. But
at the present time the universities almost entirely fail to supply men
suited to the work. They neither care to collect, nor have they the
skilled aptitude for observation. Then, though this country is possessed
at home of incomparable stores of accumulated material, the class of
competent amateurs who were mostly trained at our universities, and
who did such good service in working that material out, is fast disap-
pearing. It may not be easy, indeed, in the future to fill important
posts even in this country with men possessing the necessary qualifi-
cations. But there was still another source of naturalists, even more
useful, which has practically dried up. It is an interesting fact that
the large majority of men of the last generation who have won distine-
tion in this field have begun their career with the study of medicine.
That the kind of training that natural history studies gives is of adyan-
tage to students of medicine which, rightly regarded, is itself a natural
history study, can hardly be denied. But the exigencies of the medical
curriculum have crowded them out; and this, | am afraid, must be
accepted as irremediable. I can not refrain from reading you, on this
point, an extract from a letter which I have received from a distin-
guished official lately intrusted with an important foreign mission. I
should add that he had himself been trained in the old way.

“T have had my time, and must leave to younger men the delight of
working these interesting fields. Such chances never will occur again,
for roads are now being made and ways cut in the jungle and forest,
and you have at hand all sorts of trees level on the ground ready for
study. These bring down with them orchids, ferns, and climbers of
many kinds, including rattan palms, ete. But excellent as are the
officers who devote their energy to thus opening up this country, there
is not one man who knows a palm from a dragon tree, so the chance is
lost. Strange to say, the medical men of the Government service
know less and care less for natural history than the military men, who
at least regret they have no training or study to enable them to take
an intelligent interest in what they see around them. A doctor nowa-
days cares for no living thing larger or more complicated than a bacte-
rium or a bacillus.”
|

BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 465

But there are other and even more serious grounds why the present
dominance of one aspect of our subject is a matter for regret. In the
coneluding chapter of the Origin, Darwin wrote: ‘I look with con-
fidence to the future—to young and rising naturalists.” But I observe
that most of the new writers on the Darwinian theory, and, oddly
enough, especially when they have been trained at Cambridge, gener-
ally begin by more or less rejecting it as a theory of the origin of
species, and then proceed unhesitatingly to reconstruct it. The attempt
rarely seems to me successful, perhaps because the limits of the labor-
atory are unfavorable to the accumulation of the class of observations
which are suitable for the purpose. The laboratory, in fact, has not
contributed much to the Darwinian theory, except the Law of Recapitu-
lation, and that, I am told, is going out of fashion.

The Darwinian theory, being, as I have attempted to show, the out-
come of the natural history method, rested at every point on a copious
basis of fact and observation. This more modern speculation lacks.
The result is a revival of transcendentalism. Of this we have had a
copious crop in this country, but it is quite put in the shade by that
with which we have been supplied from America. Perhaps the most
remarkable feature is the persistent vitality of Lamarckism. As Dar-
win remarks: ‘“‘ Lamarck’s one suggestion as to the cause of the gradual
modification of species—effort excited by change of conditions—was,
on the face of it, inapplicable to the whole vegetable world” (II, 189).
And if we fall back on the inherited direct effect of change of condi-
tions, though Darwin admits that “physical conditions have a more
direct effect on plants than on animals” (II, 319), I have never been
able to convince myself that that effect is inherited. I will give one
illustration. The difference in habit of even the same species of plant
when grown under mountain and lowland conditions is a matter of gen-
eral observation. It would be difficult to imagine a case of “acquired
characters” more likely to be inherited. But this does not seem to be
the case. The recent careful research of Gaston Bonnier only confirms
the experience of cultivators. “The modifications acquired by the plant
when transported for a definite time from the plains to the Alps, or vice
versa, disappear at the end of the same period when the plant is
restored to its original conditions.” (Ann. d.Se. nat., 7° sér. XX, 355.)

Darwin, in an eloquent passage, which is too long for me to quote
(Origin, 426), has shown how enormously the interest of natural history
is enhanced “when we regard every production of nature as one which
has had a long history,” and ‘‘ when we contemplate every complex
Structure - - - as the summing up of many contrivances.” But
this can only be done, or at any rate begun, in the field, and not in the
laboratory.

A more serious peril is the dying out amongst us of two branches of
botanical study in which we have hitherto occupied a position of no
small distinction. Apart from the staffs of our official institutions,
sm 95—— 30

there seems to be no one who either takes any interest in, or appreciates
in the smallest degree, the importance of systematic and descriptive
botany. And geographical distribution is almost in a worse plight,
yet Darwin calls it ‘‘that grand subject, that almost keystone of the
laws of creation” (I, 356).

I am aware that it is far easier to point out an evil than to remedy
it. The teaching of botany at the present day has reached a pitch of
excellence and earnestness which it has never reached before. That it
is somewhat one-sided can not probably be remedied without a subdi-
vision of the subject and an increase in the number of teachers. If it
has a positive fault, it is that it is sometimes inclined to be too dog-
matic and deductive. Like Darwin, at any rate in a biological matter,
‘“‘T never feel convinced by deduction, even in the case of H. Spencer’s
writings” (III, 168). The intellectual indolence of the student inclines
him only too gladly to explain phenomena by referring them to “isms,”
instead of making them tell their own story.

ORGANIZATION OF SECTION.

I am afraid I have detained you too long over these matters, on
which I must admit I have spoken with some frankness. But I take it
that one of the objects of our section is to deliver our minds of any
perilous stuff that is fermenting in it. But now, having taken leave of
the past, let us turn to the future.

We start at least with a clean slate. We can not bind our succes-
sors, it is true, at other meetings. But I can not doubt that it will be
in our power to materially shape our future, notwithstanding. When
we were only a department, I think we all felt the advantage of these
annual meetings, of the profitable discussion, formal and informal, and
of the privilege of meeting so many of our foreign brethren who have
so generously supported us by their presence and sympathy.

I am anxious, then, to suggest that we should conduct our proceed-
ings on as broad lines as possible. I do not think we should be too
ready to encourage papers which may well be communicated to socie-
ties, either local or central.

The field is large; the laborers, as they advance in life, can hardly
expect to keep pace with all that is going on in it. We must look to
individual members of our number to help us by informing and stimu-
lating addresses on subjects they have made peculiarly their own, or on
important researches on which they have been specially engaged.

NOMENCLATURE.

There is one subject upon which, from my official position elsewhere,
J desire to take the opportunity of saying a few words. It is that of
nomenclature. It is not on its technical side, I am afraid, of sufficient
general interest to justify my devoting to it the space which its impor-
tance would otherwise deserve. But I hope to be able to enlist your
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 467

support for the broad, common-sense principles on which our practice
should rest.

As I suppose, everyone knows we owe our present method of nomen-
clature in natural history to Linneus. He devised the binominal, or,
as it is often absurdly called, the binomial system. That we must have
a technical system of nomenclature, I suppose no one here will dispute.
It is not, however, always admitted by popular writers who have not
appreciated the difficulty of the matter, and who think all names should
be in the vernacular. There is the obvious difficulty that the vast
majority of plants do not possess any names at all, and the attempts to
manufacture them in a popular shape have met with but little suecess.
Then, from lack of discriminating power on the part of those who use
them, vernacular names are often ambiguous; thus Bullrush is applied
equally to Typha and to Scirpus, plants extremely different. Vernacular
names, again, are only of local utility, while the Linnean system is
intelligible throughout the world.

A technical name, then, for a plant or animal is a necessity, as with-
out it we can not fix the object of our investigations into its affinity,
Structure, or properties. (Linn. Phil., 210.) ‘Nomina si nescis perit
et cognitio rerum.”

In order to get clear ideas on the matter, let us look at the logical
principles on which such names are based. It is fortunate for us that
these are stated by Mill, who, besides being an authority on logic, was
also an accomplished botanist. He tells us (System of Logic, I, 132):
“A naturalist, for purposes connected with his particular science, sees
reason to distribute the animal or vegetable creation into certain groups
rather than into any others, and he requires a name to bind, as it were,
each of his groups together.” He further explains that such names,
whether of species, genera, or orders, are what logicians call connota-
tive; they denote the members of each group and connote the distine-
tive characters by which it is defined. A species, then, connotes the
common characters of the individuals belonging to it; a genus, those of
the species; an order, those of the genera.

But these are the logical principles which are applicable to names
generally. A name such as Ranunculus repens does not differ in any
particular from a name such as John Smith, except that one denotes a
species, the other an individual.

This being the case, and technical names being a necessity, they
continually pass into general use in connection with horticulture, com-
merce, medicine, and the arts. It seems obvious that if science is to
keep in touch with human affairs, stability in nomenclature is a thing
not merely to aim at, but to respect. Changes become necessary, but
should never be insisted upon without grave and solid reason. In some
cases they are inevitable unless the taxonomic side of botany is to remain
at a standstill. From time to time the revision of a large group has to
be undertaken from a uniform and comparative pointof view. It then
468 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

often occurs that new genera are seen to have been too hastily founded
on insufficient grounds, and must therefore be merged in others. This
may involve the creation of a large number of new names, the old ones
becoming henceforth a burden to literature as synonyms. It is usual
in such cases to retain the specific portion of the original name, if
possible. If it is, however, already preoccupied in the genus to which
the transference is made, a new one must be devised. Many modern
systematists have, however, set up the doctrine that a specific epithet
once given is indelible, and whatever the taxonomic wanderings of the
organism to which it was once assigned, it must always accompany it.
This, however, would not have met with much sympathy from Linnzus,
who attached no importance to the specific epithet at all: ‘“‘ Nomen spe-
cificum sine generico est quasi pistillum sine campana.” (Phil., 219.)
Linneus always had a solid reason for everything he did or said, and
it is worth while considering in this case what it was.

Before his time the practice of associating plants in genera had
made some progress in the hands of Tournefort and others, but spe-
cific names were still cumbrous and practically unusable. Genera
were often distinguished by a single word; and it was the great reform
accomplished by Linnzeus to adopt the binominal principle for species.
But there is this difference: Generic names are unique, and must not
be applied to more than one distinct group. Specific names might
have been constituted on the same basis; the specific name in that
case would then have never been used to designate more than one
plant, and would have been sufficient to indicate it. We should have
lost, it is true, the useful information which we get from our present
practice in learning the genus to which the species belongs; but theo-
retically a nomenclature could have been established on the one-name
principle. The thing, however, is impossible now, even if it were
desirable. A specific epithet like vulgaris may belong to hundreds of
different species belonging to aS many different genera, and taken
alone is meaningless. A Linnean name, then, though it consists of
two parts, must be treated as a whole. ‘‘Nomen omne plantarum
constabit nomine generico et specifico.” (Phil., 212.) A fragment can
have no vitality of its own. Consequently, if superseded, it may be
replaced by another which may be perfectly independent.’

It constantly happens that the same species is named and described
by more than one writer, or different views are taken of specific differ-
ences by various writers; the species of one are therefore “lumped”
by another. In such cases, where there is a choice of names, it is

bot. de I'rance (XXXIX), ‘‘the real merit of Linnwus has been to combine, for all
plants, the generic name with the specific epithet.” It is important to remember
that in a logical sense the ‘‘name” of a species consists, as Linnzeus himself insisted,
in the combination, not in the specific epithet, which is a mere fragment of the
name and meaningless when taken by itself.

customary to select the earliest published. I agree, however, with the
late Sereno Watson (Nature, XUVIT, 54), that ‘“‘there is nothing what-
ever of an ethical character inherent in a name, through any priority of
publication or position, which should render it morally obligatory upon
anyone to accept one name rather than another.” And, in point of fact,
Linnzus and the early systematists attached little importance to pri-
ority. The rigid application of the principle involves the assumption
that all persons who describe, or attempt to describe, plants are equally
competent to the task. But this is so far from being the case that it is
sometimes all but impossible even to guess what could possibly have
been meant.!

In 1872, Sir Joseph Hooker (Flora of British India, I, vii) wrote:
“The number of species described by authors who can not determine
their affinities increases annually, and I regard the naturalist who puts
a described plant into its proper position in regard to its allies as ren-
dering a greater service to science than its describer when he either
puts it into a wrong place or throws it into any of those chaotic heaps,
miscalled genera, with which systematic works still abound.” This has
always seemed to me not merely sound sense, but a scientific way of
treating the matter. What we want in nomenclature is the maximum
amount of stability and the minimum amount of change compatible
with progress in perfecting our taxonomic system. Nomenclature
is a means, not anend. There are, perhaps, 150,000 species of flower-
ing plants in existence. What we want to dois to push on the task
of getting them named and described in an intelligible manner, and
their affinities determined as correctly as possible. We shall then
have material for dealing with the larger problems which the vege-
tation of our globe will present when treated as a whole. To me the
botanists who waste their time over priority are like boys who, when
sent on an errand, spend their time in playing by the roadside. By
such men even Linneus is not to be allowed to decide his own
names. To one of the most splendid ornaments of our gardens he
gave the name Magnolia grandiflora; this is now to be known as
Magnolia fetida. The reformer himself is constrained to admit ‘the
change is a most unfortunate one in every way.’ (Garden and For-
est, II, 615.) It is difficult to see what is gained by making it, except
to render systematic botany ridiculous. The genus Aspidiwn, known
to every fern cultivator, was founded by Swartz. It now contains
some 400 species, of which the vast majority were, of course, unknown
to him at the time; yet the names of all these are to be changed
because Adamson founded a genus, Dryopteris, which seems to be

‘Darwin, who always seems to me, almost instinctively, to take the right view
in matters relating to natural history, is (Life, Vol. I, p. 364) dead against the new
“practice of naturalists appending for perpetuity the name of the first describer to
species.” He is equally against the priority craze: ‘‘I can not yet bring myself to
reject very well-known names” (ibid., p. 369).
A470 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

the same thing as Aspidium. What, it may be asked, is gained by the
change? To science it is certainly nothing. On the other hand we
lumber our books with a mass of synonyms, and perplex everyone who
takes an interest in ferns. It appears that the name of the well-
known Australian genus Banksia really belongs to Pimelea; the species
are therefore to be renamed, and Sbanksia is to be rechristened Sirmuel-
lera, after Sir Ferdinand von Mueller, a proposal which, I need hardly
say, did not emanate from an Englishman.

I will not multiply instances. But the worst of it is that those who
have carefully studied the subject know that from various causes, which
T can not afford the time to discuss, when once it is attempted to dis-
turb accepted nomenclature, it is almost impossible to reach finality.
Many genera only exist by virtue of their redefinition in modern times;
in the form in which they were originally promulgated they have hardly
any intelligible meaning at all.

it can hardly be doubted that one cause of the want of attention
which systematic botany now receives is the repulsive labor of the
bibliographical work with which it has been overlaid. What an enor-
mous bulk nomenclature has already attained may be judged from the
Index Kewensis, which was prepared at Kew, and which we owe to
the munificence of Mr. Darwin. In his own studies he constantly came
on the track of names which he was unable to run down to their
source. This the Index enables to be done. It is based, in fact, on
a manuscript index which we compiled for our own use at Kew. But
it is a mistake to suppose that it is anything more than the name sig-
nifies, or that it expresses any opinion as to the validity of the names
themselves. That those who use the book must judge of for them-
selves. We have indexed existing names, but we have not added to
the burden by making any new ones for species already described.

What synonymy has now come to may be judged by an example
supplied me by my friend Mr. ©. B. Clarke. For a single species of
Fimbristylis he finds 135 published names under six genera. If we go
on in this way we shall have to invent a new Linnzus, wipe out the
past, and begin all over again.

Although I have brought the matter before the section, it is not one
in which this, or indeed any, collective assemby of botanists can do
very much. While I hope I shall carry your assent with the general
principles I have laid down, it must be admitted that the technical
details can only be appreciated by experienced specialists. AJ] that
can be hoped is a general agreement among the staffs of the principal
institutions in different countries where systematic botany is worked
at; the free lances must be left to do as they like.

PUBLICATIONS.

I have dwelt at such length on certain aspects of my subject that
perhaps, without great injustice, you may retort on me the complaint of
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. ATs

onesidedness. But when I survey the larger field of botany in this
country, the prospect seems to me so vast that I should despair even if
I had my whole address at my disposal of doing it justice. I think
that its extent is measured by the way in which the publications
belonging to our subject are maintained. First of all, we have access
to the Royal Society, a privilege of which I hope we shall always con-
tinue to take advantage for communications which either treat of fun-
damental subjects, or at least are of general interest to biologists. Next
to this we have our ancient Linnean Society, with a branch of its pub-
lications handsomely and etficiently devoted to systematic work. Then
we have the Aunals of Botany, which has now, I think, established its
position, and which brings together the chief morphological and physi-
ological work accomplished in the country. Lastly, we have the Jour-
nal of Botany, a less ambitious, but useful periodical, which is mainly
devoted to the labors of English botanists. I remember there was a
time when I thought that this, at any rate, was an exhausted field.
But it is not so; knowledge in its most limited aspects is inexhaustible
if the laborer have the necessary insight. The discoveries of Mr.
Arthur Bennett among the potamogetons of the eastern counties is a
striking and brilliant instance.

Besides the publication of the Annals, we owe to the Oxford Press a
splendid series of the best foreign text-books issued in our own lan-
guage. If the thought has sometimes occurred to one’s mind that we
were borrowers too freely from our indefatigable neighbors, I at least
remember that the late Professor Eichler paid us the compliment of
saying that he preferred to read one of these monumental books in
the English translation rather than in the original. I believe it is no
secret that botany owes the aid that Oxford has rendered it in these
and other matters in great measure to my old friend the master of
Pembroke College, than whom I believe science has no more devoted

PALEOBOTANY.

I have said much of recent botany; I must not pass over that of past
ages. Two notable workers in this field have passed away since our
last meeting. Saporta was with us at Manchester, and we shall not
readily forget his personal charm. If some of his work has about it a
too imaginative character, the patience and entire sincerity with which
he traced the origin of the existing forms of vegetation in southern
Europe to their ancestors in the not distant geological past will always
deserve attentive study. But in the venerable, yet always useful,
Williamson we lose a figure whose memory we shall long preserve.
With rare instinct he accumulated a wealth of material illustrative of
the vegetation of the Carboniferous epoch, which, I suppose, is unique
in the world. And this was prepared for examination with incompar-
able patience either by his own hands or under his own eyes. He
illustrated it with absolute fidelity. And if he did not in describing it

always use language with which we could agree, nothing could ruffle
either his imperturbable good nature or the noble simplicity of his
character. Truth to tell, we were often in friendly warfare with him.
But I rejoice to think that before his peaceful end came he had patiently
reconsidered and abandoned all that we regarded as his heresies, but
which were in truth only the old manner of looking at things. And
I think that if anything could have contributed to make his departure
happy, it was the conviction that the completion of his work and his
scientific reputation would remain perfectly secure in the hands of Dr.
Scott.
VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY.

Turning again to the present, the difficulty is to limit the choice of
topics on which ! would willingly dwell. In an address which I deliv-
ered at the Bath meeting in 1888, I ventured to point out the impor-
tant part which the action of enzymes would be found to play in plant
metabolism. My expectations have been more than realized by the
admirable work of Professor Green on the one hand, and of Mr. Horace
Brown on the other. The wildest imagination could not have foreseen
the developments which in the hands of animal physiologists would
spring from the study of the fermentative changes produced by yeast
and bacteria. These, it seems to me, bid fair to revolutionize our whole
conceptions of disease. The reciprocal action of ferments, developed
in so admirable a manner by Marshall Ward in the case of the ginger-
beer plant, is destined, I am convinced, to an expansion scarcely less
important.

But, perhaps, the most noteworthy feature in recent work is the dis-
position to reopen in every direction fundamental questions. And
here, I think, we may take a useful lesson from the practice of the
older sections, and adopt the plan of intrusting the investigation of
special problems to small committees, or to individuals who are willing
to undertake the labor of reporting upon special questions which they
have made peculiarly their own. These reports would be printed in
extenso, and are capable of rendering invaluable service by making
accessible acquired knowledge which could not be got at in any other
way.

We owe to Mr. Blackman a masterly demonstration of the fact, long
believed, but never, perhaps, properly proved, that the surface of
plants is ordinarily impermeable to gases. Mr. Dixon has brought for-
ward some new views about water movement in plants, which I confess
I found less instructive than many of my brother botanists. They are
expressed in language of extreme technicality; but as far as I under-
stand them, they amount to this: The water moving in the plant is
contained in capillary channels; as it evaporates at the surface of the
leaves a tensile strain is set up, as long as the columns are not broken,
to restore the original level. I can understand that in this way the
‘‘transpiration current” may be inaintained. ButwhatI want to know
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. 473

is how this explains the phenomena in the sugar maple, a single tree of
which will yield, I believe, 20 to 30 gallons of fluid before a single leaf
is expanded.

We owe to Messrs. Darwin and Acton the supply of a ‘‘ Manual of
practical vegetable physiology,” the want of which has long been
keenly felt. Like the father of one of the authors, “I love to exalt
plants” (I, 98). I have long been satisfied that the facts of vegetable
physiology are capable of being widely taught, and are not less signifi-
cant and infinitely more convenient than most of those which can be
easily demonstrated on the animal side. How little any accurate knowl-
edge of the subject has extended was conspicuously demonstrated in a
recent discussion at the Royal Society, when two of our foremost chem-
ists roundly denied the existence of a function of respiration in plants,
because it was unknown to Liebig.

ASSIMILATION.

The greatest and most fundamental problem of all is that of assimi-
lation. The very existence of life upon the earth ultimately depends
upon it. The veil is slowly, but I think surely, being lifted from its
secrets. Wenow know that starch, if its first visible product, is not its
first result. We are pretty well agreed that this is what I have called
a ‘*protocarbohydrate.” How is the synthesis of this effected? Mr.
Acton, whose untimely end we can not but deeply deplore, made some
remarkable researches, which were communicated to the Royal Society
in 1889, on the extent to which plants could take advantage of organic
compounds made, so to speak, ready to their hand. Loew, in a remark-
able paper, which will perhaps attract less attention than it deserves
from being published in Japan (Bull. College of Agric. Imp. Univ.
Tokio, Vol. I), has from the study of the nutrition of bacteria arrived
at some general conclusions in the same direction. Bokorny appears
recently to have similarly experimented on alge. Neither writer, how-
ever, seems to have been acquainted with Acton’s work. The general
conclusion which I draw from Loew is to strengthen the belief that
form-aldehyde is actually one of. the first steps of organic synthesis, as
long ago suggested by Adolph Baeyer. Plants, then, will avail them-
selves of ready-made organic compounds which will yield them this
body. That a sugar can be constructed from it has long been known,
and Bokorny has shown that this can be utilized by plants in the pro-
duction of starch.

The precise mode of the formation of form-aldehyde in the process
of assimilation is a matter of dispute. But it is quite clear that either
the carbon dioxide or the water, which are the materials from which it
is formed, must suffer dissociation. And this requires a supply of
energy to accomplish it. Warington has drawn attention to the strik-
ing fact that in the case of the nitrifying bacterium, assimilation may
go on without the intervention of chlorophyll, the energy being supplied
A474 BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION.

by the oxidation of ammonia. This brings us down to the fact, which
has long been suspected, that protoplasm is at the bottom of the whole
business, and that chlorophyll only plays some subsidiary and indirect
part, perhaps, as Adolph Baeyer long ago suggested, of temporarily
fixing carbon oxide like hemoglobin, and so facilitating the dissociation.

Chlorophyll itself is still the subject of careful study by Dr. Schunck,
originally commenced by him some years ago at Kew. This will, I fio
give us eventually an accurate insight into the chemical concn
of this important substance.

The steps in plant metabolism which follow the synthesis of the
protocarbohydrate are still obscure. Brown and Morris have arrived
at the unexpected conclusion that “cane sugar is the first sugar to be
synthesized by the assimilatory processes.” I made some remarks
upon this at the time (Journ. Chem. Soc., 1893, 673), which I may be
permitted to reproduce here:

“The point of view arrived at by botanists was briefly stated by
Sachs in the case of the sugar beet, starch in the leaf, glucose in the
petiole, cane sugar in the root. The facts in the sugar cane seem to be
strictly comparable. (Kew Bulletin, 1891, 35-41.) Cane sugar the bota-
nist looks on, therefore, as a ‘reserve material.’ We may call ‘glucose’
the sugar ‘currency’ of the plant, cane sugar its ‘banking reserve.’

“The immediate result of the diastatic transformation of starch is
not glucose, but maltose. But Mr. Horace Brown has shown in his
remarkable experiments on feeding barley embryos that, while they can
readily convert maltose into cane sugar, they altogether fail to do this
with glucose. We may conclude, therefore, that glucose is, from the
point of view of vegetable nutrition, a somewhat inert body. On the
other hand, evidence is apparently wanting that maltose plays the part
in vegetable metabolism that might be expected of it. Its conversion
into glucose may be perhaps accounted for by the constant presence in
plant tissues of vegetable acids. But, so far, the change would seem
to be positively disadvantageous. Perhaps glucose, in the botanical
sense, will prove to have a not very exact chemical connotation.

“That the connection between cane sugar and starch is intimate is a
conclusion to which both the chemical and the botanical evidence seems
to point. And on botanical grounds this would seem to be equally
true of its connection with cellulose.

“Tt must be confessed that the conclusion that ‘cane sugar’ is the
first sugar to be synthesized by the assimilatory processes seems hard
to reconcile with its probable high chemical complexity, and with the
fact that, botanically, it seems to stand at the end and not at the begin-
ning of the series of metabolic change.”

PROTOPLASMIC CHEMISTRY.

The synthesis of proteids is the problem which is second only in
importance to that of carbohydrates. Loew’s views of this deserve
attentive study. Asparagin, as has long been suspected, plays an
important part. It has, he says, two sources in the plant. ‘It may
either be formed directly from glucose, ammonia (or nitrates), and sul-
phates, or it may bea transitory product between protein decomposition
and reconstruction from the fragments” (loe. cit., 64).
BOTANICAL WORK OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION. AIT5

In the remarks I made to the Chemical Society, I ventured to express
my conviction that the chemical processes which took place under the
influence of protoplasm were probably of a different kind from those
with which the chemist is ordinarily occupied. The plant produces
a profusion of substances, apparently with great facility, which the
chemist ‘can only build up in the most circuitous way. As Victor
Meyer (Pharm. Journ., 1890, 773) has remarked: ‘In order to isolate
an organic substance we are generally confined to the purely accidental
properties of crystallization and volatilization.” In other words, the
chemist only deals with bodies of great molecular stability; while it
can not be doubted that those which play a part in the processes of
life are the very opposite in every respect. Iam convinced that if the
chemist is to help in the field of protoplasmic activity he will have to
transcend his present limitations, and be prepared to admit that as
there may be more than one algebra, there may be more than one
chemistry. I am glad to see that a somewhat similar idea has been
suggested by other fields of inquiry. Professor Meldola (Nature, X LIL,
250) thinks that the investigation of photochemical processes ‘may
lead to the recognition of a new order of chemical attraction, or of the
old chemical attraction in a different degree.” Lam delighted to see that
the ideas which were floating, I confess, in a very nebulous form in my
brain are being clothed with greater precision by Loew.

In the paper which I have already quoted, he says of proteids (loc.
cit., 13): ‘“‘They are exceedingly labil compounds that can be easily
converted into relatively stable ones. <A great lability is the indispen-
sable and necessary foundation for the production of the various actions
of the living protoplasm for the mode of motions that move the life
machinery. There is a source of motion in the labil position of atoms
in molecules, a source that has hitherto not been taken into considera-
tion either by chemists or by physicists.”

But I must say nomore. The problems to which I might invite atten-
tion on an occasion like this are endless. I have not even attempted
to do justice to the work that has been accomplished among ourselves,
full of interest and novelty as it is. But I will venture to say this,
that if capacity and earnestness afford an augury of success, the pros-
pects of the future of our section possess every element of promise.

ZOOLOGY SINCE DARWIN!

By Lupwic v. GRAFF.

We of the younger generation, whose scientific training began within
the domain of Darwinism, can only with difficulty realize what an agita-
tion was produced almost forty years ago in the “descriptive” natural
sciences by Darwin’s Origin of Species.” It fell like a thunderbolt
in a quiet period of descriptive work, when it was commonly thought
that the philosophical ideas of the early part of the century were
airy plays of fantasy, undemonstrated and undemonstrable, and that
all speculation should therefore be distrusted, while the solid ground
of fact should be clung to with anxious care.

How the theory of natural selection suddenly vivified that dry descrip-
tion, what wings it lent to the scalpel of the anatomist, and what wide
vistas did it open to the eyes of the systematists, already becoming so
shortsighted !

The mummies of species which filled our collections, each fenced off
from each by well-arranged Latin diagnoses, were suddenly linked
together by blood relationship. The fossil remains of extinct forms—
hitherto shut out from the common realm of living things—were en-
dowed with flesh and blood and arranged with the fauna and flora of
to-day in a single great family tree representing the entire history of
life upon the globe.

It is indeed well known that the idea of a natural, genealogical
descent of existing animals and plants from the simplest primitive
forms was expressed long before Darwin, and was specially and

thoroughly formulated by Lamarck.! But the theory of natural selec-
tion proposed by the illustrious Briton for the first time attempted to
place it on a scientific basis. The manifest phenomena of inheritance
and variation are the main supports of his bold doctrine, the axis on
which revolves the great loom of life which is propelled by the struggle
of all living things to maintain themselves and to bring forth new life.
The cause of the countless varieties of suitably modified forms has
been made clear by Darwin, for he has shown that both the mainte-
nance of the individual and that of the species require a perpetual
struggle with the influences of the environment and with competing
individuals, a struggle in which that only survives which is best
adapted and most suitable to the existing conditions. Therefore there
occurs a natural selection, the existing species undergoing an adapta-
tion, a transformation, a division, and a completion. In the course of
the immeasurably great spaces of time which have elapsed since the
appearance of the first elementary living being, there has arisen the
entire ascending series of vegetable and animal organisms, at whose
head man now regards himself.

The Darwinian theory has become common property, and we can
trace its influence in almost all departments of intellectual activity.
Its opponents—who, by the way, outside the circle of naturalists, did
not combat in Darwin so much his own work, the theory of selection,
as the older theory of descent—have become ever fewer and more quiet
as the doctrine has ceased to be put forward as a definite philosophical
theory of life and has become the object of special scientific investiga-
tion. And the time appears to be not far distant when the Darwinian
theory will be no more considered as a matter for controversy than is
the Copernican theory of the solar system.

We can, therefore, dispassionately turn to the question, ‘‘ What
influence has Darwin’s work had upon the development of zoology?”

First, it should be pointed out that the Darwinian theory encountered
the two great branches of natural history under very different con-
ditions. While in the science of botany, physiology had already
obtained its proper place, there still prevailed in zoology a tendency
to exclusive systematic morphology. What wonder that a doctrine
whose highest aim consisted in the elucidation of forms should effect a
much more powerful evolution in zoology than in botany! That Dar-
win himself was specially trained as a zoologist and hence took most
of his examples from the animal kingdom, and that, besides, the phe-
nomena of the ‘struggle for existence,” as well as those of ‘natural
selection,” are much more striking and manifold in that domain than
in the vegetable kingdom, should be considered as secondary causes in
explaining why the Darwinian theory took so much quicker and bape
root in zoology than in botany.

_ Finally, however, it affected both in the same way, and there are but
few examples in the history of the development of the human mind
that show such a revolution in the elementary principles of a science
as the theory of natural selection has affected in the above-mentioned
‘studies. Instead of being contented with mere description and lucid
arrangement, there was undertaken the higher task of determining the
E -eausal relations of forms: ant-like descriptive industry had to associate
itself with the comparative method; the eye had to seek assistance
from the imagination.
As the first and most urgent task, appeared the changing of the
classification hitherto followed according to the lines laid down by
Linneus and Cuvier into one which should correspond with the his-
tory of the descent of living beings. The fiery spirit of EK. Haeckel
tried to accomplish this, when, in his brilliantly devised system of the
organic natural sciences, the General Morphology of Organisms,! he
attempted to determine the primitive stocks. However rash this may
have been, considering the state of zoology at that time, it rendered
an inestimable service by giving the first impulse toward that great
development of animal morphology that has taken place during the
last decade. Modern morphology first dates from that time, when, as
formerly stood Schiller and Goethe, Haeckel, and Gegenbaur worked
_ side by side. Since that time it has become so essential a part of
scientific zoology that the text-books of to-day are only too much given
up to comparative morphology.
The “fundamental law of biogeny” formulated by Haeckel, namely,
that ontogeny (the development of the individual) is a short recapitu-
lation of phylogeny (the development of the stock), soon dominated all

_ paleontology. Since the ancestral stages traversed by an animal are
_ repeated in a more or less recognizable manner in the transitory forms
x assumed during the development of each individual, so embryology
- came in the post-Darwinian times to be considered as a necessary
_ study. To this is chiefly due the enormous increase in zoological pub-
_ lications, which, during the period from 1845 to 1860, amounted to a
yearly average of 2,900, but in that from 1860 to 1880, increased to
about 5,400 per year.’

Simultaneously with this increase in literary production, there
occurred an improvement in the technical methods of research. Innu-
merable staining methods enabled the investigator to study more
accurately the structure of the cell, to separate its nucleus from its
plasma, as also to define the constituent portions of each according
to their various susceptibilities to staining.

480 ZOOLOGY SINCE DARWIN.

The tissues of the body, such as muscle, nerve, and connective tissue,
indeed the cells of a single organ acting under separate functional con-
ditions, as those of glands, were separated from each other in the
microscopical field by means of newly invented methods of staining and
impregnation. The old methods of teasing and compressing tissues
were superseded by the microtome, which has become indispensable in
these investigations because it enables us to divide an animal into an
unbroken series of extremely thin slices. Since by such means one
can again restore after section the structure of objects even as to their
most elementary parts, we obtained the means of investigating the
intimate structure of animals whose small size had hitherto made it
impossible to dissect them with the scalpel and whose opacity pre-
vented us from obtaining any information concerning them by the
compression method. <A great advance was also made in the efficiency
of the microscope by the construction of apochromatic lenses.

These all redounded to the benefit of morphology and at no previous
period of zoology were there produced so many comprehensive and
exhaustive monographs on zootomic and embryological subjects. The
purpose of most of these was the establishment of the ancestral tree.
But while comparative anatomy was of the first importance in the
elucidation of the relationships of existing living forms, embryology
lent itself particularly to the task, because it assisted to fill the gaps in
the paleontogical record, by comparing the older stages of animal life
with the phases of individual development. One result of this activity
was the theory of the homology of the germinal layers. As certainly as
the egg of all animals has the morphological value of a cell and points
to unicellular primitive beings (protozoa) as the beginning of all higher
organization, so surely must also the subsequent embryonal stages of
multicellular animals (metazoa) afford reminiscences of common ances-
tral forms. And Haeckel, starting from this premise, believed that
in the “gastrula” developmental stage—a widely extended form con-
sisting of two concentric cell layers and a primitive mouth—he had, in
fact, found the type of that ancestral form common to all multicellulai
animals (the Gastrea).! Its two cell layers must necessarily have the
same morphological value in all, and thereby was presented the pos-
sibility of tracing the homology of organs, not only in single stocks,
but also throughout the entire kingdom of the metazoa.

But when we examine the facts cited in support of this wide-reach-
ing generalization, we are obliged to admit that it has not as yet been
established. The more profound our embryological knowledge becomes,
and the more exact our comparative researches are, the higher loom
the difficulties. But the essential trouble lies not so much in the diffi-
culty of readily bringing under the gastrula scheme all the observed

phases of development, nor in the circumstance that organs of developed
animals having similar structure and formation arise from different
germinal layers, but in the fact that the primary germinal layers arise
not only in different related animal stocks, but sometimes even within
one and the same phylum, in such a diverse manner that it would
certainly be a reversal of the old conception of homology! if, in spite of
this, they should be considered as morphological equivalents.

The morphological point of view, which has hitherto exclusively pre-
vailed, will hardly serve us in this case. Experimental inquiry must
first, tracing out the causes of the different kinds of development,
seek to make clear to us “‘the internal mechanism of the phenomena.”
Only in this way can we succeed in properly separating the ‘“‘kenoge-
netic,” or secondary, deceptive changes of form from the *‘ palingenetie”
characters that represent originally inherited, developmental phases.’
And until a more solid foundation for this shall be obtained, the theory
of the germinal layers, that has often been advanced with so much
confidence, can not be authoritatively formulated.

Of double value, therefore, appear the facts that have been contrib-
uted to morphology from another phylogenetic source, that of the
natural history of extinct forms. Once an accessory of geology, this
has, during the period that we are considering, been developed into an
independent branch of study, and has borne richer and richer fruit in
proportion as it has recognized the necessity of correlating its advances
with the knowledge of living animals.”

Zoology and paieozoology have both the same chief aim—the elucida-
tion of the history of the animal forms of our gicbe, and a collection
corresponding to modern views, which require a complete representa-
tion of the material available for reconstructing the history of the race,
ought to place, side by side with the forms of animals now living, the
petrified remains of their ancestors. The generalized types, transition

homology) as ‘‘the relation between two organs that had a common origin; that is

size, and other relations, has constantly maintained its position and connections
unchanged.” (Grundziige der vergleichenden Anatomie, 2 Autl., pp. 80-81, Leipzig,

forms, and complete series of successive developments, with which
paleontology has supplied us, are all the more valuable because the
exactitude of its descriptions, resting in part upon petrified material,
and the ease with which its fundamental facts can be reverified, lend to
most paleontological expositions a certainty and trustworthiness that
must often be denied to those that relate to the morphology of recent
animals,

Darwin has carefully avoided the consideration of a number of ques-
tions whose discussion is of no great weight for his theory of selection.
So it is, in fact, of no importance for the latter what our conceptions
may be as to the origin of the simplest forms of life upon the earth, if
we only establish indubitably that such did exist. So also the theory
of descent, as well as the theory of selection, is unaffected by the fact
that at the time they were first advanced there was no intelligible con-
ception of the material basis of heredity, nor of the causes of variation.
The actual existence of these processes sufficed, and served as a satis-
factory basis for the theory. As soon, however, as—first by German
naturalists and philosophers—the theory of descent was expanded to a
new system of biological philosophy, these important questions were
necessarily brought forward for discussion.

As regards the first of these questions, the primary evolution of
organisms, we have not yet been able to formulate a satisfactory
theory. As there are no chemical elements or “vital materials” pecu-
liar to living beings, and no special “vital force” has been demon-
strated, there remains only the supposition that the first evolution of the
simplest organisms must have taken place from inorganic material by
the action of the forces that operate in its own domain. As, however,
the material basis of vital processes, protoplasm, consists of combina-
tions of carbon belonging to the group of albuminoid bodies, the
attempt was made to refer the phenomena of movement that charac-
terize life to the peculiar chemico-physicai peculiarities of carbon.
But neither this so-called carbon theory of Haeckel, nor the endeavor
made in recent years by O. Biitschli and others to imitate by artifi-
cial mixtures! the structure and movements of protoplasm, informs
us how a mixture of dead albuminoid compounds can become living
protoplasm.

A conception in any way satisfactory as to the first evolution of
living beings must be still more difficult at this time, as not only can
chemistry afford us no satisfactory insight into the molecular structure
of protoplasm, but it appears from theoretical considerations that the
much-cited ‘‘ simple lump of protoplasm” may have a highly complicated

structure and should not, without further evidence, be compared to an
albuminoid mixture.

By this time the enthusiasm which hailed bathybius as the represent-
ative of Oken’s “primitive slime,” an undifferentiated protoplasmic
mass covering the bottom of the ocean, has considerably cooled.' The
alleged nonnucleated primitive beings disappear more and more since
we have had the means of demonstrating the cell nucleus where it had
escaped observation when treated by the technical methods formerly
used, and the hypothesis of “free cell formation” in organic fluids has
given place to the maxim “omnis cellula e cellula.”

There will, then, on the day when we learn that the last of the moners
possesses a nucleus like other cells, be seen a much greater gap between
the simplest known living being and the inorganic individual—the
erystal—than is realized to-day.

Zoology has obtained more satisfactory results from the numerous
researches, which, either with or without the knowledge of their con-
ductors, contributed to bring nearer to a solution the problems of
heredity and variation.

Darwin consicered heredity as a fact of experience demonstrated by
the specific similarity of child and adult, without attempting to seek
for its material vehicle.? Since, however, all living beings are made up
of cells, and even the most complicated organism has at the beginning
of its development the morphological value of a single cell, such a
vehicle can be only a part of a cell. ‘To find it we must have a deeper
insight into the structure of the cell and into the significance of its
various parts.

For example, as soon as the structure of the cell substance and that
of the nucleus which it contains were investigated by the new methods,
the surprising discovery was made that movement and irritability, as
well as respiration, are functions that the cell substance exercises inde-
pendently from the nucleus; that, on the contrary, assimilation and
secretion take place only under the influence of the latter and that the
nucleus is the only organizing morphogenic factor of the cell. Further
investigations showed that the cell consists of two substances, chro-
matin and achromatin, distinguished by their behavior with staining
fluids, the first of which plays an important role in cell division, as its
distribution inaugurates the multiplicative process and leads through
a regular succession of metamorphoses (mitosis) first to the bipartition
of the nucleus, and then to that of the extranuclear cell substance.

1The bathybius, recently discovered by Bessels, appears to be nothing more than
a plasmodium-like organism having only a local distribution. (See Bronn’s Classen
und Ordnungen des Thierreichs, Protozoa, recently reedited by O. Biitschli, pp.
179-181. Leipzig and Heidelberg, 1880.

‘The pangenesis hypothesis of Darwin, which supposed that the germ was
influenced by the form of the body which held it as well as by external conditions
of existence by means of small particles attracted to it from all parts of the body,
is without any evidential basis, and is, as Weismann (Germplasma, p. 7) has
remarked, more a statement than a solution of the question of heredity.

484 ZOOLOGY SINCE DARWIN.

The conclusion that chromatin is the special vehicle of heredity could
not, however, be brought forward with convincing precision until
bisexual (digenous) propagation was studied. Here, where two cells,
usually of very different shape, unite to form the ecoppecnet ed egg, it
is proved that during the act the chromatin of the latter is formed in
equal proportions from the chromatin of the two parent cells.

So the century-old problem of fecundation has been solved, a prob-
lem whose history shows in the most instructive and at the same time
amusing manner how preconceived ideas may becloud observation, and
how ingenious the human mind is when it tries to replace the want of
facts by dialectics.

The researches on cell division and fecundation, together with the
tendency to phylogeny, have given to the post-Darwinian period of zool-
ogy its character. They are among the most glorious achievements in
the realm of natural science. Those who in the zoological field have
specially interested themselves in these investigations—W. Flemming,
O. and R. Hertwig, Ed. van Beneden—have for the first time made it
possible to formulate a theory of heredity. For, however important
may be the knowledge quite recently acquired that all changes in the
chromatin are passive, conducted and controlled by a newly discovered
source of power, the ‘ centrosome,” it can in no way change our con-
ception of the chromatin as the substance by which the parental quali-'
ties are transmitted.

As all cell nuclei are derived from the nucleus of the egg, every cell
of the body must contain a minute portion of the parental chromatin
and thereby is secured the transmission of the parental qualities.
Upon this basis is founded A. Weismann’s theory of heredity,’ which
has certainly performed one service that can not be controverted, in
that it has at last clearly formulated the question.

Are the lines of development exactly predetermined by the constitu-
tion of the germ, or is the germ to a certain extent an indifferent
constructive material, whose future shaping depends solely upon the
conditions of peence to which it is exposed ?

On the one hand, the derivation of existing living forms Ae ances-
tors dissimilar in cane and, on the other, the phenomena of heredity
which teach us that parent and child, or to express it otherwise, the
successive generative cycles of the same species, always pass through
specifically similar morphological states, enable us to find an answer to
these questions. It is expressed thus by the orthodox Darwinians:
Every organism is a resultant of heredity and adaptation—what the
parent inherits he transmits wholly to the child, but he adds thereto
what he has himself acquired.

1A. Weismann: Das Keimplasma, eine Theorie der Vererbung, Jena, 1892. Among
the other numerous writings of this author on the same subject the following are
especially worthy of attention: Die Allmacht der Naturziichtung, eine Erwiderung
an Herbert Spencer, Jena, 1893; Aussere Hinfliisse als Entwicklungsreize, Jena, 1894;
Neue Gedanken zur Vererbungsfrage, Jena, 1895.
ZOOLOGY SINCE DARWIN. 485

On the contrary, Weismann’s neo-Darwinism denies the inheritance
of acquired characters, and there exists no well-authenticated fact that
contradicts his views nor any theory that can give a plausible explana-
tion of the transmission to the organs of the body of new structural
elements for the germ cells.

Should we accept this inheritance of acquired characters, or, what is
the same thing, an immediate morphogenic and hereditarily transmis-
sible action of external forces, then it would be equivalent to admitting
the possibility of the production of new living and fertile animal forms
of the most varied kinds by changing the conditions of existence in
the eggs of the same species. This is the last consequence, and one
contrary to all experience, of the hypothesis that external conditions
are the factors that determine form.

Oscar Hertwig and Y. Delage seek to avoid this conclusion, which
they also recognize as absurd, by tracing back the essential similarity
of child and parent to the specific chemico-physical constitution of the
germ-plasm derived from the latter.'! The derivation of a species from
the germ of another is prevented because every germ must perish that
does not find the environment adapted to its specific constitution.
But this is only removing the causes of morphogenesis to the intimate
constitution of the germ.

To attribute the same causal significance to these true causes of
morphogenesis which le in the intimate constitution of the germ as to
the influence of external conditions is, however, evidently arbitrary,

problemes de la biologie générale. Paris, 1895. Delage’s views on the heredity
question are the exact opposite of those of Weismann. Characteristic of this is
Delage’s statement that for the elucidation of the morphological and physiological
agreement between parent and child we no more need to accept a tendency to inher-
itance residing in the germ than we do to explain why the cadaver of an earth-
worm, of an insect, of a frog, and of a mammal under the same external conditions
all pass in the same way, typical for each animal named. through the processes of
decomposition.

O. Hertwig, Priiformation oder Epigenese? Grundziige einer Entwicklungstheorie
der Organismen. Jena, 1894. Hertwig harmonizes the opposing views of Weismann
and Delage, in that he does not assign the causes of the generation of form either
exclusively to the germ, nor exclusively or preponderatingly to the environment,
but gives to each an equal determining value. Hertwig himself says of his theory
(pp. 182-133): ‘‘This theory may be called evolutionary, because it accepts for the
basis of the processes of development a specific and highly organized primitive sub-
stance; it is, on the contrary, epigenetic in so far as it considers that the primitive
substance increases only by the fulfillment of innumerable conditions, in which, for
example, I include the chemical processes that begin with the first segmentation of
the cell, gradually shaping itself, step by step, till it finally produces a maturely
developed result as different from its first primitive condition as the completely
organized plant or animal is from the single cells which compose it.”

confounding of cause and condition contrary to the ordinary use of the
terms.

Systematic zoology and the comparative anatomy of living beings
show us that the possibilities of development for germs are almost
infinitely varied, and though any particular germ can only pass over
the same path as did the innumerable generations of its ancestors, this
can only be due to internal causes; that path must have been there
ready to be traversed; that is to say, there must be fixed external
circumstances (conditions) present if the causes are to make their
operation manifest.

E. Haeckei has said! that with the inheritance of acquired peculiari-
ties the entire theory of descent must stand or fall. This would only
be correct if there were no other explanation for the variability of
organisms. But Weismann does not deny that the conditions of exist-
ence may have an alterative influence upon the constitution of the germ-
plasm, and during long spaces of time many components of the conge-
ries of forces belonging to the latter may increase in power, others
decrease; indeed even new sources of force may be introduced. But
these operations are direct and not caused by the action of any of the
other organs of the body.

To support the hypothesis of such a direct influencing of the germ-
plasm by external agents, we are forced to refer to those organisms
that are propagated asexually (monogenically), for in germs which are
produced bisexually (digenically) there are already possible, because of
the intermixture of hereditary material from two different parents, an
extraordinary number of combinations in the composition of the germ-
plasm, so many that it is probable that the separation of a portion of
the nucleus (the polar bodies), which is observed to occur before the
beginning of segmentation, is an operation for the elimination of a
superfluous number of hereditary tendencies.”

The cause of variation lies, therefore, in the individual changes that
occur in the composition of the germ-plasm, and what we call ‘‘adapta-
tion,” is not an active and immediate achievement of a single indi-
vidual, but the result of a more or less complicated process of selection
that extends throughout generations of individuals. The external
conditions, to whose influence animals respond in a definite manner
peculiar and appropriate for each species, are therefore in no way the
true causes of such reactions, but merely release a morphogenic force
that already resides in the germ and can only be put in action by just
these precise circumstances.

If we accept the view here presented, there will be noted a remark-
able contrast between the germ cells an the “soma,” that multiform

and often extraordinarily complicated assemblage of the remaining
organs of the body. It is in this, that in the segmentation that has
occurred during the preceding development of the ovum, those cells
which are to play the part of germ cells in the future mature organism
have assigned to them all portions of the ovum necessary for the recon-
struction of the entire body, while to the somatic cells only those sub-
stances are assigned which are required for the construction of a
definite organ or apparatus. In this way the soma becomes eventually
an organ of the propagating cells that completes the work of metabo-
lism, moves, feels, and thinks, but yet only serves, as may be said, for
the evolution of the germ cells and so assures the continuity of life.
Since we have seen what are the chief new lines along which zoology
has developed since Darwin’s time, we may now be permitted to con-
sider what modifications have been given to the old problems, once the
only ones, namely, the description of the existing material of animal
forms and the observation of their life history; that is to say, systematic
natural history and biology in the restricted sense. The latter, although
it had been for a long time neglected, gave the theory of natural selec-
tion a new and mighty impulse. It has been for this science a flourish-
ing period, which can only be compared with that epoch at the end of
the eighteenth century when were made the striking discoveries of
Reaumur, Roesel, De Geer, Bonnet, Schiffer, and others. How import-
ant now, from a Darwinian point of view, were the correlation of animals
with each other and with plants, the influence of climate and food and
of light and heat to the struggle for existence, and to the phenomena of
natural selection! The entire world offered material for this study, and
there appeared books like H. W. Bates’s Naturalist on the River
Amazon and A. R. Wallace’s Malay Archipelago, which were models for
biological studies. A great number of excellent English and German
investigators applied themselves to this work and found in the biologie
history of plants and animals ever new evidence of the truth of the
Darwinian theory, yet at the same time often encountering puzzling
phenomena whose elucidation has baffled the acuteness of naturalists
even to the present time. It is evident that here, as in other depart-
ments, we have not yet reached the end of knowledge, or, better, that
of search for knowledge, and of means for investigating the truth.
Under biological facts there was formerly always placed geographical
distribution. This was, indeed, only because it was customary to
explain faunal variations by referring their causes to environmental
conditions. As these did not usually afford a plausible explanation,
zoogeography was essentially a collection of lists whose perusal was of
not much more value to zoologists than a glance through a menag-
erie. The new foundation for the theory of descent has made a funda-
mental change in this, as it makes possible for the first time a scientific
treatment of the facts of zoogeography. The faunal character of a
region is determined by its geological age, the phylogenetic condition
of the animal kingdom at the time of its deposition and its varying
488 ZOOLOGY SINCE DARWIN.

geographical relations to other faunal areas during the different phases
of the earth’s history. It follows from this that it is not so much the
phenomena of adaptation as the phylogenetic forces that are of the
first importance in determining the typical character of a fauna. Zoo-
geography becomes, therefore, an important branch of phylogeny. 1
A.R. Wallace brought forward this conception in his famous work, The
Geographical Distribution of Animals,’ and he thereby becomes the
master teacher of modern zoogeography. As a preliminary for its
further extension it appears to be necessary to pursue with the utmost
conscientiousness the laborious and petty task of systematically
describing species.

Descriptive systematic zoology has not gained from the new doctrine
so much directly as indirectly, through the general increase of interest
in zoology and botany which led to more work in these branches than
ever before. Besides, it would be easy to show that the colossal increase
in our inventory of animal forms, rising from about 50,000 species in
1832 to about 150,000 to-day, shouid be ascribed not only to the greater
number of investigators in the field, but also to the development of
geography. Since the latter has been promoted from a servant of his-
tory to the rank of an independent science, and oceanographic questions
have become prominent, those great expeditions have been organized
which have given a wider character to the zoology of this period. When
we learn that as regards marine life the Challenger expedition of 1872-
1876 alone obtained nearly 8,000 new species, we are involuntarily
reminded of the times of Piso, Maregravius, and Bontius, who at the
beginning of the seventeenth century astonished mankind by showing
for the first time pictures of the dodo and of ‘‘homo sylvestris” brought
from “both Indies.” The description of these species gave hun-
dreds of new races, families, and orders; and, published in thirty-two
quarto volumes with 2,629 plates, kept 60 zoologists of all the culti-
vated nations employed for twenty years.’ The result of this single

1In geographical distribution, the genealogical relations come out with special
clearness in those cases where it can be shown that there is a regular proportion
between the geographical separation and the morphological differences. This
important conformity to law was first stated by H. Spitzer in his excellent Beitriige
zur Descendenztheorie (Leipzig, 1886), and was shown to exist in the orders of apes
and struthious birds (p. 259 etseq.). This relation ought to be demonstrable in many
other groups of the animal kingdom. It may be stated that one of the most decided
opponents of the transformistic theory of descent, A. Wigand, has made his agree-
ment to that doctrine dependent upon the possibility of proving such a relation
between geographic separation and morphological difference. (A. Wigand, Der
Darwinismus und die Naturforschung Newton’s und Cuvier’s. Braunschweig,

expedition has increased the number of known species in many groups
of animals four or five fold.

The increase in the collective number of forms described has had, in
the first place, one result, in that it has obtained for the description of
Species a wider basis and a more positive meaning, in contrast to the
Linnean principle, that, looking only to practical exigencies of the
moment, declared that new species must be separated from those already
known by means of well-marked characters. We must now seek such
a conception of specific qualities as may enable us to separate each
specific form from those yet to be discovered. This requirement, which
was already considered by careful systematists before the time of Dar-
win, is especially difficult, and can not be met unless one possesses the
sense of form required for an artist. But at the same time the Dar-
winians often fell into a willful neglect of systematic work, a neglect
which arose from despising the hair-splitting systems of the museums
which were commonly unfriendly to the new theory, partly from exag-
gerated ideas of the fluidity of species—ideas which led to the most
extraordinary abortions in the systematic field.

Happily, this period of fermentation is over, and we are learning
again to prize systematic description as it is, for example, employed in
the too long neglected science of entomology. We need these methods
not only for the purpose of lending depth to our studies through the
more extended retrospect of comparative anatomy and embryology, but
in order to better express, by means of a system, the natural relation-
Ship of forms. One thing is certain, that the minutiose recital of diag-
nostically important external characters, which is customary in entom-
ology, has done much less harm than the neglect with which external
form relations have been treated by the “scientific ” zoology of the last
ten years. To this neglect is to be ascribed the fact that modern mono-
graphs are almost useless for conscientious zoogeographers, because
they treat systematic subjects so superficially, and the reproach, some-
times not entirely without justice, is made against German zoology,
that it produces excellent theorizers, distinguished comparative anato-
mists and embryologists, but no zoologists. As if the knowledge of
form were not the basis of all zoology, and as if one could obtain a
living conception of the phenomena of variation without having trained
the eye by exact systematic studies in at least one group of animals!
Darwin himself, at the very time when he was revolving in his mind
his undisclosed theory of natural selection, gave in his monograph on
the cirripeds,'! an example of exact systematic description. And what
systematic zoologist does not know the important fact that there often
exists between apparently unessential external characters and impor-
tant points of internal organization so profound a correlation that

artificial systems built upon these alone are found to correspond to the
grouping according to natural relationships?

it is well knéwn that a change in this policy is required. So the
Deutsche Zoologische Gesellschaft resolved, soon after its successful
establishment in 1890, to publish an immense, systematic work! embrac-
ing all the forms of animals known up to this time, and also undertook
a new editionof the Systema Nature of Linneus.? These are eloquent
signs of the necessity for profound systematic work.

- Yet it should not be overlooked that the best modern descriptions of
species are pure abstractions that seek to embrace in a single specially
colored picture the result of the researches made upon a greater or less
number of individuals. By a synthesis of this sort we form ideas of
species to which no single individual ever exactly corresponds, and
which, while they suffice indeed for the prime necessity of lucidity, can
never give the materials needed for the scientific construction of the
theory of descent. For that purpose there would be required descrip-
tions, aS exact and bare as possible, of numerous single objects. It
would be necessary to exactly portray the collective examples of several
generations with all their individual traits, especially in the case of such
species aS were considered variable. If the race then encountered dif-
ferent external conditions, it would in this way be possible to separate
the constant, inherited characters from the variable ones. In the botan-
ical field there exists, in Nageli’s work on the Hieracez, an investiga-
tion of this kind which has given to that acute thinker an opportunity
to remark on the importance of a sharp distinction between uniformity
and constancy, as well as between multiformity and variation.’ In the
animal kingdom, while such experiments are much more difficult, they
are certainly not impossible, and yet they are entirely wnknown.? In
this direction there is open to the systematists of the future a great and
remunerative field for work. :

So we find that systematic zoology, which in the “descriptive” age
before Darwin, confined itself to short differential diagnoses and inven-
tories arranged for clearness only, but afterwards took upon itself the
office of an ancestral tree, defining true blood relationships, is to become,
in the next period of our science, quite indispensable to the experi-
mental method.

On looking back, we see that in all the principal branches of zoolog-
ical science the theory of descent founded by Darwin has become the
leading motive of an investigating activity such as was unknown in
any former period.

This activity is characterized by a preponderance of morphological
interests which has led to such an unjust neglect of physiology that
to-day, when it has become necessary to consider morphological
development in order to state problems whose solutions can only be
obtained by experiment, neither the working methods nor even the
workers are to be found who can solve such problems.

Therefore, morphology, seeking for light, threatened to have recourse
to a new edition of Schelling-Oken’s Natural Philosophy, since the new
way out of the difficulties was not yet staked out by sound experience.

Although controlled by an exclusively morphological tendency
opposed to its own proper ends, zoology has begun to recognize as a
new branch of work the “causes of organic morphogeny,” and Roux has
already founded a special journal! for it. But this name does not indi-
cate the entire scope of the effort, which would be much better char-
acterized as ‘‘comparative physiology ” or “ biomechanies.” ?

Darwinism has filled the old descriptive zoology with a philosophical
spirit, and given it a historical character; it now remains the duty of
the coming generation to so shape it that it will become a causal science,
resting upon an experimental basis.

THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORA-
TORIES.!

By WILLIAM H. WELCH, M. D.,
Professor -of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University.

The scientific discoveries of the present century have had such a
profound influence upon inventions, upon industries, and upon the
comfort, health, and welfare of the people in general, that there is
widespread, even if not always adequate, appreciation of the value of
scientific study and investigation. But it may be doubted whether
there is any proper understanding, in the minds even of the educated
public, of the material circumstances which surround scientific dis-
covery and which make it possible. The average man, if interested at
all, is interested that the discovery is made, not how it is made.

In this country, where we must rely mainly upon enlightened private
beneficence, and not upon governmental aid, to furnish the pecuniary
resources which are essential for scientific progress, it is important that
there should be some general information not only regarding the results
of scientific work, but also regarding the external material conditions
necessary for the fruitful prosecution of such work.

At the present day the systematic study and advancement of any
physical or natural science, including the medical sciences, requires
trained workers who can give their time to the work, suitably con-
structed workrooms, an equipment with all of the instruments and
appliances needed for the special work, a supply of the material to be
studied, and ready access to the more important books and journals
containing the special literature of the science.

All of these conditions are supplied by a well-equipped and properly
organized modern laboratory. Such laboratories are, with the partial
exception of the anatomical laboratory, entirely the creation of the
present century, and for the most part of the last fifty years. They
have completely revolutionized during the past half century the mate-
rial conditions under which scientific work is prosecuted. They are
partly the result, and in larger part the cause, of that rapid progress

of the physical and natural sciences which characterizes the era in
which we are living.

The evolution of the modern laboratory still awaits its historian.
It is not difficult to find incidental references to historical facts bear-
ing upon this subject. The development of the chemical laboratory
has been traced with some fullness. But it is curious that there is no
satisfactory monographie treatment of the general subject of the his-
torical development of scientific laboratories. The subject seems to
me an attractive one. It would surely be interesting to trace the
development of the teaching and the investigating laboratory back to
its beginnings, to learn about the material circumstances under which
the physicists, the chemists, the morphologists, and physiologists of
former generations worked. What share in the development of labora-
tories had the learned academies of the Renaissance and of the subse-
quent centuries? What share had public and private museums and
collections of instruments of precision? What share had the work
of the exact experimentalists, beginning with Galileo, of physicians, of
the alchemists, and of the apothecaries? What individuals, universi-
ties, corporations, and governments were the pioneers in the establish-
ment of laboratories for the various physical and natural sciences?
The detailed consideration of these and many other questions perti-
nent to the subject would make an interesting and valuable historical
contribution.

There is evidence that in Alexandria, under the early Ptolemies in
the third century before Christ, there existed State-supported insti-
tutes, in which students of man and of nature could come into direct
personal contact with the objects of study, and by the aid of such
appliances as were then available could carry on scientific investiga-
tions. The practical study of anatomy, physiology, pathology, and
other natural sciences was here cultivated. We are very imperfectly
informed as to the results and the material circumstances of this
remarkable period in the history of science. We know that after about
a century of healthy activity the Alexandrian school gradually sank
into a place for metaphysical discussions.

Fifteen hundred years elapsed before we next find any record of the
practical study of a natural science. In 1231, the great Hohenstaufen,
Frederick the Second, who has been called the most remarkable historic
figure of the Middle Ages, commanded the teachers at Salernum dili-
gently to cultivate the practical study of anatomy. After the passage
of this edict occasional dissections of the human body were made, but
it can not be said that there was any diligent cultivation of anatomy
on the part either of teachers or of students during the following two
centuries.

In the latter half of the fifteenth century there developed that active
interest in the practical study of human anatomy which culminated in
the immortal work of Vesalius, published in 1543, After this the study
EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. 495

of anatomy by dissections gradually assumed in the medical curriculum
that commanding position which it has maintained up to the present
day.

For over six hundred years there has been at least some practical
instruction in anatomy, and for over three hundred years there have
existed anatomical laboratories for purposes of teaching and of inves-
tigation, although only those constructed during the present century
meet our ideas of what an anatomical laboratory should be. It isa
matter of no little interest, both for the history of medicine and for that
of science in general, that the first scientific laboratory was the anatom-
ical laboratory. Private laboratories for investigation must have existed
from the earliest times. Doubtless Aristotle had his laboratory. But
the kind of laboratory which we have on this occasion in mind is one
open to students or investigators or both. There was no branch of
physical or natural science, with the exception of anatomy, which stu-
dents could study in the laboratory until after the first quarter of the
present century. Only in anatomy could students come into direct
contact with the object of study and work with their own hands and
investigate what lay below the surface. .

The famous Moravian writer on education, Amos Comenius, over two
hundred and fifty years ago, gave vigorous expression to the concep-
tion of living, objective teaching of the sciences. He said: ‘Men
must be instructed in wisdom so far as possible, not from books, but
from the heavens, the earth, the oaks, and the beeches—that is, they
must learn and investigate the things themselves, and not merely the
observations and testimonies of other persons concerning the things.”
‘‘Who is there,” he cries, ‘*who teaches physics by observation and
experiment instead of by reading an Aristotelian or other text-book?”
But how little ripe were the conditions then existing for the successful
carrying out of ideas so far in advance of his times is illustrated by
the very writings of the author of “Orbis Pictus” and “Lux in
Tenebris.” .

It would lead too far afield to trace, in detail, on this occasion, the
development of physical and of chemical laboratories, but on account
of the intimate connection between the development of physics and
chemistry and that ef medicine, especially of more exact experimental
work in the medical sciences, a few words on this subject will not be
out of place.

Methodical experimentation in the sciences of nature was definitely
established by Galileo, and was zealously practiced by his contempora-
ries and successors in the seventeenth century. It was greatly pro-
moted by the foundation, during this century, of learned societies, such
aS the Accademia dei Lincei and the Accademia del Cimento, in Italy,
the Collegium Curiosum, in Germany; the Académie des Sciences, in
Paris, and the Royal Society, in England. Much of the classical
apparatus still employed in physical experiments was invented at this
- A96 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES.

period. Experimental physics from the first acquired a kind of fash-
ionable vogue, and this aristocratic position it has ever since main-
tained among the experimental sciences. These sciences must concede
to physics that commanding position which it has won by the genius of
the great natural philosophers, by the precision of its methods, and the
mathematical accuracy of its conclusions, and by the fundamental
nature and profound interest and importance of its problems. The
debt of the medical sciences to the great experimental physicists, from
Kepler and Galileo and Newton down to Helmholtz, is a very large
one, larger than is probably appreciated by medical men who have not
interested themselves in the history of experimental and precise
methods in medicine.

There existed in the last century cabinets of physical apparatus to
be used in demonstrative lectures, but they were very inadequate, and
suitable rooms for experimental work scarcely existed. It was not until
about the middle of the present century that we find the beginnings of
the modern physical laboratory. Lord Kelvin, then William Thomson,
established a physical laboratory in the University of Glasgow about
1845 in an old wine cellar of a house. He tells us that ‘‘this, with the
bins swept away and a water supply and sink added, served as a phys-
ical laboratory for several years.” It was as late as 1863 that Magnus
opened in Berlin his laboratory for experimental physical research.
Since 1870 there has been a rapid development of those splendid phys-
ical institutes which are the pride of many universities.

Humbler, but more picturesque, was the origin of the chemical labo-
*ratory. This was the laboratory of the alchemist searching for the
philosopher’s stone. In the painter’s canvas we can still see the vaulted,
cobwebbed room, with its dim and mysterious light, the stuffed serpent,
the shelves with their many-colored bottles, the furnace in the corner
with the fire glowing through the loose bricks, the fantastic alembics,
the old alchemist in his quaint armchair reading a huge, worm-eaten
folio, and the assistant grinding at the mortar. Fantastic and futile
as it all may seem, yet here was the birth of modern chemistry. The
alchemists were the first to undertake the methodical experimental
investigation of the chemical nature of substances. No more powerful
stimulus than the idea of the philosopher’s stone could have been
devised to impel men to ardent investigation. But search for gold
was not all that inspired the later alchemists. Paracelsus, the alche-
mist, that strange but true prophet of modern medicine as he was of
modern chemistry, said, “Away with these false disciples who hold
that this divine science, which they dishonor and prostitute, has no
other end but that of making gold and silver. True alchemy has but
one aim and object, to extract the quintessence of things, and to pre-
pare arcana, tinctures, and elixirs which may restore to man the health
and soundness he has lost.” And again he says of the alchemists,
“They are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush or
EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. 497

velvet garments, often showing their rings upon their fingers, or wear-
ing swords with silver hilts by their sides, or fine and gay gloves upon

their hands, but diligently follow their labors, sweating whole days

and nights by their furnaces. They do not spend their time abroad
for recreation, but take delight in their laboratory. They wear leather
garments with a pouch and an apron wherewith to wipe their hands.
They put their fingers among coals and into clay, not into gold rings.”

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the doctrines and
work of the alchemists had profound influence upon medicine. Alchemy
was not completely overthrown until Lavoisier gave the deathblow to
the phlogistic theory of Stahl. But for a considerable time before
Lavoisier introduced the new spirit into chemistry its methods and its
problems were gradually approaching those of modern times. It was,
however, over thirty years after the tragic death of Lavoisier before
the first chemical laboratory in the modern sense was established. One
can not read without combined feelings of wonder and pity of the
incommodious, forlorn, and cramped rooms in which such men as Scheele
and Berzelius and Gay Lussae worked out their memorable discoveries.
Liebig has graphically deseribed the difficulties encountered by the
student of that day who wished to acquire practical training in chem-
istry. With some of the apothecaries could be obtained a modicum of
practical familiarity with ordinary chemical manipulations, but Sweden
and France were the centers for those with higher aspirations.

It was the memory of his own experiences which led Liebig, imme-
diately after he was appointed professor of chemistry in Giessen in
1824, to set about the establishment of a chemical laboratory. Liebig’s
laboratory, opened to students and investigators in 1825, is generally
stated to be the first modern public scientific laboratory. Although,
as we Shall see presently, this is not quite correct, it is certain that
Liebig’s laboratory was the one which had the greatest influence upon
the subsequent establishment and organization not only of chemical
laboratories, but of public scientific laboratories in general. Its
foundation marks an epoch in the history of science and of scientific
education. This laboratory proved to be of great import to medical
science, for it was here, and-by Liebig, that the foundations of modern
physiological chemistry were laid.

The significance of this memorable laboratory of Liebig is not that
it was a beautiful or commodious or well-equipped laboratory, for it
possessed none of these attributes—indeed, it is said to have looked
like an old stable, but that here was a place provided with the needed
facilities and under competent direction, freely open to properly pre-
pared students and investigators for experimental work in science.

The chemical laboratories of to-day are, in general, the best organized
and the best supported of-scientific laboratories.

The need of establishing physiological laboratories was recognized
several years before the foundation of Liebig’s laboratory. The

important results to be derived from the application of the experimental
method to the study of vital phenomena had been demonstrated first,
and most signally, by Harvey, and after him by many experimenters,
The fecundity of exact experimentation by physical and chemical
methods appiied to the phenomena of life had been shown by the clas-
sical researches of Lavoisier on respiration and animal heat. Magendie
had entered upon that remarkable scientific career which entitles him
te be regarded as the founder of modern experimental physiology,
pathology, and pharmacology.

In 1812, Gruithuisen, who, after the custom of the times, filled an
encyclopedic chair, being professor in Munich of physies, chemistry,
zootomy, anthropology, and later of astronomy, published an article
advocating the establishment of physiological institutes. In 1823, Pur-
kinje, one of the most distinguished physiologists of this century,
accepted the professorship of physiology in Breslau, this being the first
independent chair of physiology in any German university. In 1824,
Purkinje succeeded in establishing a physiological laboratory, which
therefore antedates by one year Liebig’s chemical laboratory in Giessen,
although it can not be said to have exercised so great an influence upon
the organization of scientific laboratories in general as did the latter.
In 1840, Purkinje obtained a separate building for his laboratory.

With two or three exceptions, ali of the separate physiological labora-
tories worthy of the name have been established since the middle of
the present century. Bernard, that prince of experimenters, worked
in a damp, small cellar, one of those wretched Parisian substitutes for
a laboratory which he has called “the tombs of scientific investiga-
tors.” There can be no greater proof of the genius of Bernard than
the fact that he was able to make his marvelous discoveries under such
obstacles and with such meager appliances. France was long in sup-
plying her scientific men with adequate laboratory facilities, but no
more unbiased recognition of the value and significance of the German
laboratory system can be found than in the reports of Lorain, in 1868,
and of Wurtz, in 1870, based upon personal study of the construction
and organization of German laboratories.

Of modern physiological laboratories, the one which has exerted the
greatest and most fruitful influence is unquestionably that of the late
Professor Ludwig in Leipzig. This unequaled position it has won by
the general plan of its organization, its admirable equipment, the num-
ber and importance of the discoveries there made, its development of
exact methods of experimentation, the personal character and genius
of its director, and the number of experimenters there trained from all
parts of the civilized world.

To-day every properly equipped medical school has its physiological
laboratory. This department is likely to continue to hold its place as
the best representative of exact experimental work in any medical
science. A good knowledge of physiology is the best corrective of
pseudoscientific, irrational theories and practice in medicine.
EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. 499

Physiological chemistry has been an important department of research
for over half a century, but it is only within recent years that there have
been established independent laboratories for physiological chemistry.
A large part of the work in this branch of science has been done hitherto
in laboratories of general chemistry, of physiology, of pathology, and
of clinical medicine. A physiological laboratory can not well Be with-
out a chemical department, and the same is true of several other med-
ical laboratories; but it seems to me that physiological chemistry has
won its position as an independent science, and will be most fruitfully
cultivated by those who with the requisite chemical and biological
training devote their entire time to it. The usefulness of independent
laboratories for physiological chemistry has been shown by the work
done in Hoppe-Seyler’s laboratory in Strassburg since its foundation
in 1872. This was the first independent laboratory of physiological
chemistry.

The first pathological laboratory was established by Virchow, in
Berlin, in 1856. About this time he wrote: “As in the seventeenth
century anatomical theaters, in the eighteenth clinics, in the first half
of the nineteenth physiological! institutes, so now the time has come to
call into existence pathological institutes, and to make them as accessi-
ble as possible to all.” It can not be doubted that the time was fully
ripe for this new addition to medical laboratories. Virchow secured
his laboratory as a concession from the Prussian Government upon his
return from Wurzburg to Berlin. Virchow’s laboratory has been the
model as regards general plan of organization for nearly all patholog-
ical laboratories subsequently constructed in Germany and in other
countries. Itembraced opportunities for work in pathological anatomy,
experimental pathology, and physiological and pathological chemistry.
This broad conception of pathology and of the scope of the patholog-
ical laboratory as including the study not only of diseased structure,
but also of disordered function, and as employing the methods not
only of observation, but also of experiment, should never be lost
sight of.

The first to formulate distinctly the conception of pharmacology as
an experimental science distinct from therapeutics and closely allied
by its methods of work and by many of its problems to physiolog
was Rudolph Buchheim. This he did soon after going to Dorpat, in
1846, as extraordinary professor of materia medica, and it was appar-
ently not long after he there became ordinarius, in 1849, that he estab-
lished a pharmacological laboratory in his own house and by his private
means. Later, this laboratory became a department of the university
and developed most fruitful activity. Buchheim’s laboratory was the
first pharmacological laboratory in the present acceptation of this term,
The conception of pharmacology advocated by Buchheim has been
adopted in all German universities, and in not a few other universities;
but it can not be said to have been as yet generally accepted in the
500 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES.

medical schools of this country and of Great Britain, although it seems
destined to prevail.

The medical science which was the latest to find domicile in its own
independent laboratory is hygiene. To Pettenkofer belongs the credit
of first establishing such a laboratory. Since 1847 he had been engaged
with hygienic investigations, and in 1872 he secured from the Bavarian
Government the concession of a hygienic institute. This admirably
equipped laboratory was opened for students and investigators in 1878.
By this time Koch had already begun those epochal researches which,
added to the discoveries of Pasteur, have introduced a new era in med-
icine. The introduction by Koch of new methods of investigating
infectious diseases and many hygienic problems became the greatest
possible stimulus for the foundation of laboratories of hygiene and
bacteriology, and to some extent also of laboratories of pathology.
The results already achieved by these new methods and discoveries in
the direction of prevention and cure of disease, and the expectation of
no less important results in the future, constitute to-day our strongest
grounds of appeal to governments and hospitals and medical schools
and the geweral public for the establishment and support of labora-
tories where the nature, the causes, the prevention, and the cure of
disease shall be investigated. You have established here, in this city,
and in connection with this university, the first hygienic laboratory of
this country, housed in its own building and assured, I believe, of a
future of great usefulness.

It is apparent, from the brief and imperfect outline which I have
presented of the evolution of modern scientific laboratories, that the
birthplace of these laboratories, regarded as places freely open for
instruction and research in the natural sciences, was Germany. Such
laboratories are the glory to-day of German universities, which possess
over two hundred of them. By their aid Germany has secured since
the middle of the present century the palm for scientific education and
discovery.

Great scientific investigators are not limited to any country or any
time. There are those of surpassing ability who will make their own
opportunity and will triumph over the most discouraging environment.
This country and every civilized country can point to such men, but
they are most exceptional. The great majority of those even with the
capacity for scientific work need encouragement and opportunity. We
now have sufficient knowledge of the workings of scientific laboratories
to be able to assert that in general where the laboratory facilities are
the most ample and the most freely available, there are developed the
largest number of trained workers, and there the discoveries are the
most numerous and the most important. At the present day no coun-
try, no university, and no medical school can hold even a respectable
place in the march of education and progress unless it is provided with
suitable laboratories for scientific work.
EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. 501

A properly equipped and properly conducted. scientific laboratory is
a far more expensive institution than is usually conceived. It must be
suitably domiciled either in a separate building or in rooms commo-
dious and well lighted. The outside architectural features are of sec-
ondary importance. The instruments and appliances necessary for
exact observation and experiment, even in those sciences which appar-
ently require the least, are numerous and costly. A working library,
containing the books and sets of journals most frequently consulted,
is most desirable, if not absolutely indispensable. The director of the
laboratory should be a man of ability and experience, who is a master
in his department of science. He must have at least one assistant,
who is preferably a young man aiming to follow a scientific career. A
person of no small value in the successful working of the laboratory is
the intelligent janitor or “‘diener,” who can be trained to do the work
of a subsidiary assistant and can be intrusted with the care and
manipulation of instruments. There must be funds for the purchase
of fresh supplies and new instruments when needed. The running
expenses of a first-class laboratory are not small.

But costly as may seem the establishment and support of a good
laboratory, the amount of money expended for laboratories would seem
to us ridiculously insignificant if we could estimate the benefits to
mankind derived from the work which has been done in them. Wurtz
has truly said of the money required for laboratories, “It is a capital
placed at a high rate of interest, and the comparatively slight sacri-
fice imposed upon one generation will bring to following generations
increase of well-being and knowledge.” —

The educational value of the laboratory can not well be overesti-
mated. For the general student this is to be found primarily in the
development of the scientific habit of thought. He learns that to
really know about things it is necessary to come into direct contact
with them and study them. He finds that only this knowledge is real
and living, and not that which comes from mere observation of external
appearances, or from reading or being told about things, or, still less,
merely thinking about them.

The problem of securing for the student: of medicine the full bene-
fits of laboratory instruction in the various medical sciences is a
difficult one, and can not, I believe, be solved without considerable
readjustment of existing schemes of medical teaching; but this subject
is one which I can not attempt to consider here.

The whole face of medicine has been changed during the last half
century by the work of the various laboratories devoted to the med-
ical sciences. Anatomy, physiology, and pathology now rank among
the most important of the sciences of nature. They have been
enriched with discoveries of the highest significance and value not
only for medicine, but also for general biology. Although we have
not penetrated, and perhaps may never penetrate, the mystery of life,
502 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES.

we are coming closer and closer to an understanding of the intimate
structure and the fundamental properties of living matter. We
already know that living matter is not that homogeneous, formless
substance which not many years ago it was believed to be, but that
it possesses a complex organization.

Practical medicine has been profoundly influenced by the unparal-
leled development of the medical sciences during the last fifty years,
and especially during more recent years. Scientific methods have
passed from the laboratory to the hospital. Cases of disease are now
studied with the aid of physical and chemical and microscopical and
bacteriological methods. The diagnosis of disease has thereby been
greatly advanced in precision, and if Boerhaave’s motto, ‘‘ qui bene diag-
noscit, bene medebitur,” be true, there should be a corresponding
advance in the results of the treatment of disease. Whether or not
this dictum of the old master be true—and I have serious doubts as to
its entire truth—it can not be doubted that great progress has been
made in medical, and especially in surgical, treatment as a result of
scientific discoveries, although the treatment of disease still rests, and
will doubtless long continue to rest, largely unon empirical foundations.

We are assembled here to-day to assist at the opening of a laboratory
which gives the fittest and strongest possible expression to the influence
of scientific work upon practical medicine. The generous founder has
marked with characteristic insight the direction in which the current
is Setting.

The conception of a thoroughly equipped laboratory as an integral
part of a hospital and intended for the study and investigation of dis-
ease is of recent origin. The germs of this idea, however, may be
traced back to such men as Hughes Bennett and Beale in Great Britain,
and to Frerichs and Traube in Germany, who in their hospital work
made fruitful application of microscopical, chemical, and experimental
methods. A little over ten years ago, Von Ziemssen, in Munich, estab-
lished a well-conceived clinical laboratory, containing a chemical, a
physical, and a bacteriological department, a working library, and
rooms for practical courses and the examination of patients. A similar
laboratory was secured by Curschmann in Leipzig in 1892.

The growing recognition of the need of such laboratories is the result
of the great progress in scientific medicine during recent years. The
thorough clinical examination of inany cases of disease now requires
familiarity with numerous technical procedures, physical, chemical,
microscopical, and bacteriological. The laboratory outfit required
simply for routine clinical examinations is considerable. A microscope
and a few test tubes and chemical reagents for simple tests of the
urine no longer suffice. As illustrations of this, I call attention to the
clinical value of examinations of the blood, of the contents of the
stomach, of fluids withdrawn from the serous cavities, of the sputum and
various secretions, of fragments of tissue removed for diagnosis. Such
EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES. 503

examinations require much time, trained observers, and considerable
apparatus. To secure for the patients the benefits in the way of diag-
NOSis, prognosis, and treatment to be derived from these methods of
examination, a hospital should be supplied with the requisite facilities.

A hospital, and especially one connected with a medical school,
should serve not only for the treatment of patients, but also for the
promotion of knowledge. Where this second function is prominent,
there also is the first most efficiently and intelligently carried out.
Herein we see the far-reaching beneficence of a laboratory, such as this
one, thoroughly equipped to investigate the many problems which
relate to clinical medicine.

The usefulness of an investigating laboratory in close connection
with a hospital has already been abundantly demonstrated. Chemical
studies, more particularly those relating to metabolism iu various acute
and chronic affections, microscopical and chemical investigations of
the blood and bacteriological examinations of material derived directly
from the patient, may be mentioned as directions in which researches
conducted in hospital laboratories have yielded important results and
will garner still richer harvests in the future.

There need be no conflict between the work of clinical laboratories
and that of the various other medical laboratories. Each has its own
special field, but it is not necessary or desirable to draw around these
fields sharp boundary lines beyond which there shall be no poaching.
It will be a relief to pathological and other laboratories to have certain
examinations and subjects relating directly to practical medicine con-
signed to the clinical laboratory, where they can receive fuller and
more satisfactory consideration. The subject-matter for study in the
clinical laboratory is primarily the patient and material derived from
the patient. Anatomical, physiological, pathological, pharmacolog-
ical, and hygienic laboratories must concern themselves with many
problems which have apparently no immediate and direct bearing upon
practical medicine. In the long run, their contributions are lkely to
prove most beneficial to medicine if broad biological points of view,
rather than immediate practical utility, are their guiding stars. The
clinical laboratory will concern itself more particularly with questions
which bear directly upon the diagnosis and the treatment of disease.

To the small number of existing well-equipped clinical laboratories

‘the William Pepper Laboratory of Clinical Medicine is a most nota-

ble addition. It is the first laboratory of the kind provided with its
own building and amply equipped for research in this country, and it
is not surpassed in these respects by any in foreign countries. It is
intended especially for investigation and the training of advanced
students. Itis a most worthy memorial of the father of its founder.
William Pepper, the elder, was a very distinguished physician and
trusted consultant of this city, for many years an attending physician
at the Pennsylvania Hospital, where he was a clinical teacher of great
504 EVOLUTION OF MODERN SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES.

influence, and for four years the professor of the theory and practice of
medicine in this university. He belonged to that remarkable group
of American physicians, trained under Louis, who brought to this
country the best methods and traditions of the French school of medi-
cine at the time of its highest glory. His diagnostic powers are said
to have been remarkable. With his broad sympathies, his lofty ideals,
and his active and enlightened efforts for the promotion of clinical
medicine, how he would have welcomed such opportunities as will be
afforded by this laboratory to contribute to a better knowledge of the
nature, the diagnosis, and the treatment of disease.

Our country has, until within a very few years, been deprived of
the encouragement and opportunities for original investigations in the
medical sciences afforded by large and thoroughly equipped labora-
tories. We can still count upon the fingers of one hand our medical
laboratories which are comparable in their construction, organization,
and appliances to the great European laboratories. Notwithstanding
these obstacles, there have been American physicians of whose con-
tributions to medical science we may feel proud.

But a new era has dawned. Of that we are witnesses here to-day.
The value of medical laboratories is now widely recognized among us.
To those of us who appreciate the underlying currents in medicine,
who follow with eager interest the results of the almost feverish activi-
ties in foreign laboratories, who recognize the profound interest and
importance of the many medical problems which await only patient
investigation and suitable facilities for their solution, and who would
like to see our country take the prominent position it should in these
investigations, our laboratories may seem slow in coming, but they will
in time be provided by enlighted benevolence. The individual or insti-
tution or hospital which contributes to the establishment of a good
laboratory devoted to any of the medical sciences merits in unusual
degree the gratitude of all medical men; yes, of every true friend of
humanity. Such gratitude we feel for the generous and public-spirited
founder of this laboratory, who has contributed Jargely to the advance-
ment of medicine in this country, and of whose splendid services to
this university I need not speak in this presence.

I congratulate this city and this university and this hospital upon

THE YELLOW RACKS.!

By Dr. E. T. Hamy.

Last year’s course was mainly devoted to the study of that large
group of peoples which are collectively known by the name of Yellow
Races, although their color forms a chromatic scale, which at times is
perceptibly removed from what is properly called yellow. This group
of races, this main stem (trunk), to borrow a happy expression imported
into science by M. de Quatrefages, is, numerically speaking, the most
important of all those the great whole of which might be considered
as the human forest. In fact, the number of yellow men could not,
properly speaking, be estimated at less than 540,000,000; this is more
than one-third of the whole number of mankind,’ and I ought surely
not curtail the study of so important a fraction of the human family,
although I must acknowledge that the precise facts concerning the
yellow races are as yet far from sufficient.

With a very few exceptions, our anatomical data are in fact only
isolated documents. Our numerical observations, our special photo-
graphs, are few in number, and the conclusions drawn from the
examination and the deseription of such indifferent materials must
consequently be looked upon as eminently provisional only.

Such as I had formulated them quite recently, f have been compelled,
after many fruitless efforts, to present them to you once more in this
course of instruction, where one after the other, and in systematic
order, each human group becomes the object of special inquiry, founded
above all upon scientific investigation. And Ihave been very fortunate
to find that, on the whole, my conclusions are not opposed by any
opinion maintained elsewhere, and that, making full allowance for out-
ward appearances, they still have nothing that could possibly shock
the professional Orientalists, who are accustomed to use for the most
ordinary purposes only linguistic characters.

The first observation which we have been called upon to make, as we
enter into this subject, has reference to the relative antiquity of the

yellow races in a widely extended area. There are indeed certain
facts which justify us in supposing that one of these ancient, but now
extinct races, knew the vanished mammalia of the valley of the Rhone,
and that other old Mongolians lived in the east of Europe and in Upper
Asia at a certainly less remote, but still very ancient epoch.

Restricted from the beginning to a rather septentrional habitat, the
yellow peoples remained unknown to the ancient Egyptians until the
time of the invasion of the Shepherd race, certain leaders of whom,
depicted on the monuments of San or the Fayoum, bear truly Mongo-
lian features. In Mesopotamia they may have furnished the elements
of one of the two ethnical groups which in the dawn of history com-
peted for preeminence under the names of Accad and Sumer. <Accad,
whose language is akin to the so-called Turanian idioms, ruled at
Babylon, and displays on the few monuments on which its image is
preserved very striking features.

The Mongolian features continue a process of aE on cer-
tain more recent figures, where we see, as, for instance, at Behistun,
among the prisoners of Darius, genuine Mongols with turned-up noses,
delicate mustaches, high and prominent cheek bones, etc. Still other
Mongolian faces are represented in the famous ruins of Sanchi(Malva),
etc. We must, nevertheless, come down as far as Attila’s invasion
to collect some fragments of description, in which the Hun may
appear with increased horror, owing to the fright with which he had
filled the Christian world. Forma brevi, lato pectore, capite grandi-
ori, minutis oculis, barba rara, simo haso, tetro colore, originis suc
signa restituens—thus writes Jordanes, describing Attila himself.

Many other historians, both Eastern and Western, have since that
time depicted the immigrant hordes who passed through the breaches
made by the Huns and opened for themselves a road to the very heart
of the Empire: Avars, Chazars, Komans, and those Hungarians
and Bulgarians, the fathers of the ogres of our legends, the bugaboos
of popular speech. None of these portaits is more striking than that
which is inserted by Mathieu Paris in his Grande Chronique. The
clerk Yvon, of Narbonne, wrote from Neustadt, in 1243, to Girauld,
archbishop of Bordeaux, to inform him of the devastations of the
barbarians, and thus described these invaders, who became ever after
known under the name of Tartars:

‘““Their breast,” he says, ‘is solid and robust, habent autem pectora
dura et robusta; their face is lean and pale, facies macras et pallidas;
their shoulders are straight and high, scapulas rigidas et erectas; a short
and turned-up nose, nasos distortos et breves; the chin is prominent and
pointed, menta prominentia et acuta; the upper jaw is low and deep,
superiorem mandibulum humilem et profundum; their teeth are long and
few, dentes longos et raros; the eyelids hang from the eyebrows down
to the nose, palpebras a crinibus usque ad nasum protensas; their eyes
are mobile and black, oculos inconstantes et nigros; their look is a side-
way and fierce look, aspectus obliquos et torvos; their extremities are all
bone and nerve, extremitates ossosas et nervosas; finally, their thighs

are big, but the legs short; in stature, however, they are our equals,
for what may be wanting in the legs is made up in the upper part of the
body, crura quoque grossa, sed tibias breviores, statura tamen nobis
cequales; quod enim in tibiis deficit id in superiore corpore compensatur.”!

This portrait of the Tartar, drawn by Yvon, of Narbonne, is very
remarkable in spite of its exaggerations and mistakes.

It shows, in fact, how the attention of the observer was at that
time called to some of the principal features of that exceptional mor-
phology which make of the true Mongol one of the fundamental
anthropological types. From that time on Huropeans, missionaries,
merchants, ete., who shall approach the mysterious countries of the
East will collect impressions less and less limited, less and less vague.
And if in their reports they still continue to confound in one and the
same great body races which have since been found to be infinitely
varied, they will at least gradually establish a kind of general group-
ing, a first essay at coordination, which later on will lead to a rational
classification.

Bernier is a fair representative of this phase of Asiatic studies in
his famous letter, ‘‘On the different varieties of races of men,” inserted
in the Journal des Savants of 1684. ‘The third variety,” he says,
after having spoken of the whites and blacks, ‘“ the third variety com-
prehends a part of the kingdoms of Arakan and of Siam, of the islands
of Sumatra and Borneo, the Philippines, Japan, the Kingdom of Pegu,
Tonquin, China, Cochinchina, Tartary, which lies between China, the
Ganges and Moscovia, Usbeg, Turkistan, Zaquetay, a part of Mosco-
via, the Little Tartars and the Turkomans, who live on the banks of
the Huphrates toward Aleppo.” ‘The inhabitants of all these coun-
tries,” adds the illustrious traveler, ‘“‘ are really whites, but they have
broad shoulders, flat faces, a small, crushed nose, small pig eyes, long
and deep sunk, and three hairs for a beard.”

This third variety of men of Bernier’s is almost exactly the yellow
trunk of modern anthropologists. The Americans alone are wanting,
because Bernier with his imperfect knowledge of them did not see in
them a sufficiently great difference to warrant making of them a
Special variety that would difter from ours. Mongols and Turks, Indo-
Chinese, Japanese, and Malays are here all of them put into one and
the same mold, which is to be broken up only much later by ethnolo-
gists, linguists, and anthropologists.

The names of Pallas, Castréro, Baér, and many others recall the vig-
orous efforts made for more than a century now to introduce a little
order into Mongolic studies. The linguists insist upon it that we should
not mix up in ove and the same great whole people who speak mono-
Syllabic languages and others who use the agglutinative system. The
ethnologists also find it easy to show clearly the profound divergences
which result from entirely different social systems, as from entirely

508 THE YELLOW RACES.

different moral codes. The anthropologists finally claim the great impor-
tance of physical characteristics which are now studied for this purpose,
with the aid of exact instruments, applied to living subjects as well as
to skeletons. And from the coordination of all these combined studies
there results a classification, which no doubt will yet have to undergo
important changes, but which already, and however insufficient if may
remain as yet, may give to instruction on this subject the frame work,
so to say, which it needs, even though it be only provisional.

It is no longer sufficient, in fact, aS it was for Buffon, to compile the
reports of travelers and to put them side by side in geographical order.
Now, those descriptions which have become more accurate and more
scientific must be presented in the most logical connection that is pos-
sible, and the characteristic features must appear subordinated in natu-
ral succession. It is only by applying these principles that we have
succeeded in combining a classification which, before going any further,
we deem it proper to present here in a summary arrangement.

Let us first of all recall the fact that we began by putting aside pro-
visionally the American and the Malayan races, for a complete study
of which this year’s course will hardly suffice. Having thus gained
more space for our purposes, we have set aside eight fairly kindred sub-
jects, which are more or less voluminous, more or less ramified, which
we will for the present mention by the names of Mongol, Turk, Indo-
Mongol, Aleut, Tungus, Aino, Chinese, and Eskimauan.

The first is the properly so-called Mongolian branch, which has
occasionally, by a mistake, given its name to the whole family, and
which, on account of the exaggerations of all kinds that flourish con-
cerning the subdivisions of which it consists, well deserves to occupy
the first place at the head of our group. The word which designates it
(Mongkou), and which means brave, bold, generous, is, however, the
name of that fraction of the Chi-houéi to which Gengis Khan belonged,
which sufficiently explains the part that such a name has played and
still plays in the nomenclature of races.

The Mongolians constitute a mass of 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 souls
almost all of whom dwell between Siberia and China, Manchuria and
Turkestan; they are actually subdivived into Eastern Mongolians, the
most numerous of whom, the Khalkas, are sometimes called Exterior
Mongolians (the Interior Mongolians form the tribes Chakhan, Ourote,
Ordo, etc.); Western Mongolians, called Kalmuks by the Turks, and
subdivided into Songares or Tchoroses, Derbethes, Torgotes or Tar-
goutes, and Khochotes or Khochooutes of the Ala-Chan, and finally
Bouriats, sometimes called Northeastern Mongolians.

To whichever group they may belong, these Mongolians are, as I
have said before, the most marked of all yellow men; they exaggerate
all their characteristic features to such a degree that in endeavoring
to sketch the points that specially distinguish them, we have been
able to form, as it were, a kind of large canvass, on which, afterwards,
all our other Asiatic designs could be fitted, one after the other.
THE YELLOW RACES. 509

We have at the very first microscopically examined their hair, the most
liotrichian that can be found, circular in form, at the same time very
coarse, very black, very stiff, and very hard. We have analyzed the
elements of that only slightly pigmented skin in its shades varying from
citrine white to yellowish or reddish brown. We have next tried to
explain to ourselves the morphology of those so-called bridled eyelids
which are so characteristic of the race, and we have found, with Siebold,
that they owe their peculiar aspect to a cutaneous fold which masks
the corner of the eye until it makes the lacrymal caruncle invisible and
covers the inner third of the tarsus cartilage, and to a thickening of
the same cartilage under the upper eyelid, which covers and half hides
the lashes. The opening of an eye thus “ bridled” is curtailed, trian-
gular, and often even oblique. We have found that these peculiar
appearances of the Mongolian eye are independent of the facial skele-
ton, since there are in existence very many Asiatic subjects—I have
exhibited several to you—in whom a nose of very great elevation and
cheek bones very closely resembling our own may coexist with the
most strikingly deformed eyes that could possibly be found in Mongo-
lian countries.

The study of the skeleton has shown us that the Mongolian skull is
hyperbrachycephalous; its cephalic index exceeds 87; it is a genuine
Mongolian skull, which, for the present, represents the extreme limit of
brachycephalism, free from deformity, with the index 98, 21 (Huxley).
Shortened, enlarged, and at the same time elliptical, it is perceptibly
less high than broad, and well deserves the name of platy brachycepha-
lous, which I have recently bestowed upon it.’ The face is in perfect
harmony with this low skull, expanded transversely; it looks like a
more or less shortened lozenge. The external orbital apophyses, long
and divergent, form a connection with cheek bones of coarse nature,
with angular cheeks pressed back on the outside by upper maxillaries
of anexaggerated size. Turned down, forward and outward, these cheek
bones, at the same time that they bend in a right angle upon their
upper and inner edge so as to give to the orbit its remarkable breadth,
overreach below in a characteristic projection on which Pruner-Bey
has often very justly insisted. This is what he called the daylight orbit
(orbite a jour); a part of the orbitary edge becomes really visible in
the vertical direction. The Mongolian skull is, moreover, generally
pheenozygous; in other words, seen from above it shows its zygomatic

arch more or less removed and convex. The maxillaries, which are

transversely flattened, become rather hollow at a level with the canine
cavities and afterwards develop largely, both transversely and upward.
The nasal orifice, which they surround, is quite large, but at the same
time very much elongated, and the indication which a comparison of
these two dimensions gives is platyrrhinian. The bones of the nose,
properly speaking, rise in a prominent ridge, and thus trace in the very
center of the facial lozenge a quite characteristic relievo.

510 THE YELLOW RACES.

The dental arch is hardly prognathous, below the nasal aperture,
to which it frequently adheres in an oblique slope which dispenses with
the sharp edge of the prenasal vestibule. This arch is, however, large,
short, almost semicircular, and is armed with teeth which present
nothing remarkable, neither as to size nor as to shape.

The rather low, very powerful mandible is remarkable for the angular
aspect of its symphysis, and of its posterior angles, which are promi-
nent, often extroversated, and which extend on either side in a kind of
voluminous heel.

To assist me in this description, I have placed before you some very
striking specimens recently brought home from Mongolia by Dr.
Ernest Martin, and by placing by the side of these skulls from Hul
She Sou Go, some Turkish, Annamite, Chinese skulls, and others, I
have given you from the beginning of my demonstration a very pre-
cise impression of the large polymorphism of these races, which, though
so varied among themselves, are habitually confounded in a veritable
amalgam.

All the other characteristic features peculiar to the Mongolians have
been examined with the same attention as the anatomical features. In
this summary I shall not return to what I have told you at that time of
their intellectual and moral nor of their social and religious peculiar-
ities. Availing myself of the descriptions given by the best indorsed
writers, I have endeavored to show you the most perfect picture of the
life on the steppes, and certain photographs, with a visit to the Guimet
Museum, have fortunately come to the assistance of my very unsatis-
factory descriptions.

What I have thus done for the true Mongolians, I have next done for
the Kalmuks, assisted by a good monograph by M. Deniker for the
Bouriats, with the aid of divers documents collected by Messrs.
Malieff and Bogdanoff, and we have thus been enabled to recognize
how this last race of men, who of all Mongolians assimilated most
easily, have in our day most essentially changed in consequence of
their repeated alliances with their masters, our friends the Russians.

The second branch which we had to examine was that of the Old
Turks, very much nearer to the source from which the Mongolians
sprang than they have remained since, but one branch of whom, sep-
arated from the others by the great invasions toward the close of the
Middle Ages, has in part preserved their archaic aspect. These North-
ern Turks are the Yakuts, permanently settled to the number of
200,000 souls, as this map shows, on the banks of the lower Lena, and
they show us in several tribes, especially in those called Utsha, Cheta,
etc., to judge by Middendorf’s arguments, very striking Mongolian
affinities.

The other Turks (perhaps 20,000,000 souls), those whom we call Turko-
mals in our works on history. and whose daring invasions into Europe
and into Africa have wondrously enlarged their original domain, are
THE YELLOW RACES. 511

much more mixed, and it is only from the countries whence they drew
their historic origin that we can learn something of their character.
With Baron de Bode and Colonel Duhousset we have visited them south
of the Caspian Sea, under the name of Yamouds, Goklanes, ete., in the
Caucasus under the name of Abreks, and we have been able to ascer-
tain that the few practical observations made among these tribes
coincide very exactly with those suggested by the Yakuts, their north-
ern near relatives. In examining the skulls of the Turkomans, it
becomes, however, necessary to bear in mind that certain of their tribes,
and especially the Kurds and the Bakhtyaris have a peculiar custom;
they deform the head by exaggerating the parieto-occipital flattening
which is common to all Turks, a kind of matural curtailment, which
almost constantly presses the top of the skull into a point behind.

This very habitual and very visible distinctive feature at once enables
us to establish between the Turks and the Mongolians an immediately
perceptible difference. There exists a second that is still more striking,
and which, combined with the first, gives to the skull capsule of the
Turk, whether he be a Yakut or a Turkoman, a cuboid aspect. This is
the tendency of the head to develop upward, consequently just in the
opposite sense to the vertical flattening of the Mongolian.

The Turk’s head is, therefore, both taller and shorter; it is also a
little less large in proportion, and the cephalic index is only subbrachy-
cephalous. The face, adapting itself as is natural to the skull, which
is thus slightly curtailed, is less open; on the other hand, the nasal
Skeleton is even more pronounced in the Turk than in the Mongolian,
and you have been able to notice in some Ansariehs, for example, truly
amazing instances of large noses.

Before leaving the Turkish branch, we had to examine long lines of
types lying intermediate between the Turks and the Mongolians, such
as the Uzbeks, the Kirghiz, the Bashkirs, the Nogais; between the
Turks and the finns, such as those extremely mixed subjects of the gov-
ernments of eastern Russia, whom the reports of travelers erroneously
designate without distinction as Tartars; finally, between the Turks and
the Caucasians, the Slavs, the Greeks, even the Arabs, the Osmanlis of
Constantinople, Kourouglis of Algiers, ete. We proceeded from one
race to the other by insensible transitions, and we were thus able to
appreciate the extreme difficulty which continually confronts us in sepa-
tating scientifically the yellow men from the white men. We should
meet with the same embarrassment if we went farther north in the course
of similar inquiries. The lowlands of western Siberia are in the higher
northern latitudes overrun by races like the Samoyedes, Kanirs, and
others, among whom the individual varieties are really very extensive,
and lead, almost without a break, from the Mongolian to the Lapp.
Elsewhere in the same zones intermediate types produce other almost
imperceptible transitions from the Lapp to the Finn, and from the Finn
totheSlav. Weare thus able to establish unbroken lines of observation

between the most exaggerated of the yellow men and certain unmis-
takable white men. It is these transitional populations, if I may eall
them so, which Prichard, in his desire to designate them by a single
collective name foreign to that great western body which he ealls
Indo-European, had proposed ‘for the present” to call Allophylian
races. Thus he would have fused together, under a perfectly vague
appellation, groups as thoroughly distinct, for example, as the Basque,
the Finns, the Tschudes, the Ugrians, the Samoyedes, the Ostiaks, and
all those East Siberians collectively known under the name of Para-
lians, etc., a kind of enormous rising en masse of the incerta sedis
of the Old World ethnology. These Allophylians of Prichard, however
provisionally only the famous author of the Physical History of Mankind
may have wished to introduce them, have not yet entirely disappeared
from the language of anthropology. Some special writers have retained
them faithfully. It can, however, easily be seen that they are losing
ground every day, and in some of last year’s lectures you may have
noticed that careful studies methodically pursued have perceptibly
diminished the geographical area of populations which till then had
been relegated into the caput mortwum of ethnological analysis, because
they were not known at all or only very vaguely known.

But let us return to the series already classified, and having got rid
of Mongolians and Turks, let us pass on to the races of the Himalaya,
their southern and southeastern neighbors, grouped by Prichard under
the name of Indo-Tartars, and whom, on account of their geographical
position and of their affinities, we think it would be more proper to
call Indo-Mongolians.

As far as scattered and incomplete observations will permit us to
judge, these people are in almost every aspect intermediate between
Turko-Mongolians and Indo-Chinese. In Tibet, where they call them-
selves Bhot, they show themselves to be near akin to the Mongolians,
with their high cheek bones, “bridled” eyes, and straight noses, which
are sometimes even convex, and in certain individuals sufficiently
developed to remind us of the redskins of the prairies of the Amer-
ican Plains of the Great West. Their skull is subbrachycephalous.
This type, very sharply marked on the high table-lands, gradually
becomes less decided as we descend into the lowlands. The crossings,
which gradually absorb it, are, moreover, of a greatly mixed nature,
borrowing here even from a more or less white race, and there from
Dravidians or Kolarians. In Assam, especially, our Indo-Mongolians
have contracted alliances with certain tribes of mountaineers, of whom
we Shall have to say more after the first lectures of this year’s course—
men who are very marked representatives of the Indonesian element,
and who will furnish the subject of our first studies in the ethnology
of the Malayan races.

In Indo-China, as at the foot of the Himalaya, there are here and
there in the most elevated parts of the country small agglomerations of

piss...
THE YELLOW RACES. FES

evidently Indonesian origin. There are here also, but in vastly larger
numbers in Cambodia and the Tsiampa, descendants of ancient Hindoo
immigrants. Finally, there exist, especially in the south, a few small
tribes of Negritos.

All the remaining population, Birmans, Thais or Siamese, Annaimites,
is bound up with that of Upper Asia, of which we have spoken before,
so that they all form a tolerably homogeneous totality, which approaches
the Tibetan very nearly. This Indo-Chinese type, subbrachycepha-
lous like the Tibetan, is subdivided into Burmah or Birman, Thai, and
Annamite. We have studied these three groups, one after the other,
and we have followed their progress downward from the mountains to
the deltas of the rivers, the basins of which they now occupy. A
primitive, fairly homogeneous population, of which we shall have to
speak again presently, at first occupied these lowlands; these people
had, however, to give up the parts adjoining the great water courses
to invaders of a different origin, who have gradually reached the
south. .

Some of these imported into the Eastern Peninsula elements of a
civilization which was evidently borrowed from India. I have endeay-
ored to present to you as complete a history of it as was possible, and
we have studied together with the greatest carefulness the admirable
monuments of their power and their art which they have left us in
Jamnbodia and the Tsiampa. Others were those Burmans, those Thais,
(Siamese, Laotians), those Annamites, whose fierce conflicts with
Tsiampa and Cambodia we have followed from the beginning of this
bloody quarrel to the French occupation, which has saved the last
remnant of the Khmer people from utter destruction. I paid special
attention to the study of those ethnical elements that are peculiar to
_the lands which we possess in the extreme East; and the examination
of the characteristic features of all kinds, which are noticed among the
former and the present inhabitants of the lowlands of the Me-Kong
and the Song-Koi, has detained us a long time. I was specially inter-
ested in proving their perfect ethnical independence, as far as their north-
ern neighbors, the Chinese, are concerned, although they were their
masters long enough to impose upon them their mode of writing, their
system of mandarins and many other things, but whose supremacy has
never succeeded in altering, in any way whatever, the ethnical charac-
teristics of their subjects. The Annamites, who have been thoroughly
studied, as a race, in French Cochin China and Tonquin, have undergone
no external modifications that could be ascribed to these intermarriages.
To say the most, there have been found among the Tonquin people
some taller and mesaticephalous people, a fact which has been ascribed
to the intervention of Hos, immigrants from China, who were taller
in size and longer of skull. Jn the Eastern Peninsula, as everywhere
else, the Chinese who marries a native woman finds that the offspring
of this union, Minh-Huong, reproduces the features of the mother. At

Saigon, as at Batavia, Manila, etc., grandchildren retain next to no
mark of their grandfathers.

In the pursuance of our investigations, and while getting gradually
farther and farther away from the initial Mongolian type, we have
examined in its minutest details the Indo-Chinese or Trans-Gangetic
branch; then we have analyzed two other groups of races, of far less
importance, and which, before my own researches, had never been
thought of as constituting small ethnical groups of their own.

The first of these small branches, broken off, if we may say so, from
Prichard’s allophylous bush, comprehends the majority of the popu-
lations of the northeastern coasts from the Sea of Okhotsk to the penin-
sula of Alaska, Koriaks, Kamechadals, Chukluks, Chukchis on the
Shores of Asia, Aleuts, or Ununguns in America, on the islands and
at the point of the peninsula, which constitute this ethnical group
of 25,000 men at best, imperfectly bounded no doubt, especially east-
ward, but existing beyond all doubt. It is interesting to ascertain that
the geographical area of this group, which until now has had no name
of its own, exceeds the size of the Continent of Asia and very evidently
enecrcaches upon the New World. We shall later on meet with other
similar facts, which, we are convinced, will not fail to throw a certain
light upon the fact ‘hee the majority of the tribes of the New cons
nent owe their origin to Asiatic ancestors.

However this may be, we place systematically after the Tibetans
and the Indo-Chinese, who are subbrachycephalous, the Chukluks,
whose average indication, 79.9, stands at the extreme limit of mesati-
cephally, and not far from them, the Tungus-Manchu (300,000 indi-
viduals), another breaking up of Prichard’s ‘‘ Allophylians,” with their
clearly mesaticephalous skull, which is at the same time excessively
flattened. This is, I repeat, an entirely systematic process; we shall
be justified in pursuing it, since it has enabled us to avail ourselves of
the only characteristic features which are known with tolerable accu-
racy, the anatomical features. For they alone permit us, thanks to
their clearly pronounced nature, to form a small, quite solid group,
which may later on serve as a Starting point for new efforts at classifi-
cation. The whole of this remotest Siberia, the whole of this grand
northern China, are territories overrun by small agglomerations of
Nomads, which are usually only known by a few, rare photographs
and a few tools seen here and there in collections. There are certainly
among them some who, according to Pruner-Bey’s expression, establish
a connection with the boreal American. The Ghiliak of the Trans-
Amour appears thus like a kind of intermediary between the Tungus
and Inuit or Eskimo.

This last group, which contains 27,000 to 28,000 individuals, consti.
tutes an ethnical whole of its own, relatively quite homogeneous,
which once more presents to us the sight of a race having one end of
its habitat in Asia, but having slowly reached, all along the boreal

ocean, the extreme northeastern part of the New World, Greenland, at

‘the very time when it sent forth its most advanced tribes to reach the
Falls of Niagara, though without going beyond them. I have here only
briefly indicated the most essential features in the history of these
Hyperboreans. It seemed to me more convenient to give youa detailed
account of these various groups when I should present you the other
natives of the far north of America. I do not, on that account, attach
less importance to the ideas which I have always maintained as to the
position which ought to be assigned to the Eskimos at one end of the
line, of which the Mongolians occupy the other end. They are the true
dolichocephalous members of Mongolism, as I shall show you in a few
days. In the order of campaign which we have adopted they are sepa-
rated from the Aleuts, with whom quite recently M. Virchow confounded
them, by the Tungus-Manchu, whom we have just slightly reviewed,
and by the Chinese, whom we shall yet have to investigate rapidly, so
as to make an end of our studies as far as this whole great yellow host
is concerned. : ‘

The Chinese, who are the most numerous of all yellow races (the
least exaggerated numbers still give to China a population of more
than 300,000,000), differ decidedly from all the other Asiatics whose
essential features I have recalled before. Their hair, their complexion,
their eyes, itis true, do not present any very decided peeuliarity, but
the bones of the skull and of the face offer forms and proportions
which are not met with outside of what might be called the zone of
Chinese influence.

Von Baer, who was the first to call attention to this special morphol-
ogy of the Chinese head, expressed himself in a very picturesque
manner when he tried to describe it. He had spoken of Buriat and
Kalmuck skulls. “Imagine,” he added, ‘“‘you had the mold of a Kal
muck skull, made of some elastic material, such as gutta percha, and
you were to compress with both hands the two sides of the top so as to
make the brow rise and the top of the head and the occiput to stand
out more boldly; compress then,” he added, ‘the zygomatic arches so
as to make them narrower and so as to cause the jugal bones, and espe-
cially the maxillaries, to appear in profile toward the front, and you will
have the Chinese type.”

The skull of the Chinese is, in fact, both longer and higher in pro-
portion than those of all other yellow men. His cephalic index falls
down to subdolichocephalism (the average indication of 142 skulls of
the two sexes=77.24) and its height slightly exceeds its width. The
face, harmonizing completely with the skull, is always of medium dila-
tation, with high and prominent cheek bones, and jaws which protrude
in narrow and lengthened prognathism.

All true Chinese, whatever their origin may be, maintain more or
less strictly the osteological type that I have here defined. No doubt
the external features vary at times, vary very greatly, indeed; the
516 THE YELLOW RACES.

complexion, for instance, which at the north is white with a tinge of

citrine, nay at Canton darken to a deep brown; the almost horizontal ”

eye may change into one more or less oblique; the nose may become
flatter or be raised higher; the face may change to one more ample and
more massive; the figure, the corpulency may undergo serious changes.
But beneath all these external variations the osteological type always
continues most tenaciously, and the anthropologist may ascertain that
the collections of heads preserved in France, in England, in Holland,
or elsewhere, give the same measurements with unfailing constancy.

The morphological changes are, therefore, all on the surface, and the
absolute uniformity of the skeleton is complemented by a correspond-
ing identity of costume, manner of walking, etc. This vast nation, the
first in the world in point of numbers, is almost entirely subject to
common usages and identical manners. The queue, which the con-
quering Tartars compelled them to wear in the seventeenth century,
dangles now on the back of all Celestials, and the long nails, protected
by metal sheaths, are at the south as at the north symbols of idleness
and wealth. On the other hand, the custom of deforming women’s
feet, so characteristic in central China, has never been adopted by
Chinese women in the south, and the wives of Manchus, the princesses
of the now reigning Imperial family especially, have feet like everyone
else.

We have given very special attention to these various ethnographic
peculiarities and we have left the Chinese only after having summed
up as exactly as it could be done all that can aid us in improving our
knowledge of this people, of their intellectual manifestations as well
as of their physical appearance.

I have taken especial pains to trace the history of their legendary
migrations, starting from the northwest, and to show you how the
first occupants of the lowlands near the great streams of the east were
driven back, step by step, toward the mountain regions of the south
and southwest, where we shall meet them again under the name of
Lolos, of Miao-tsé, etc., in our search for the cradle of the Indonesian
tribes. ;

I have as yet said nothing of Korea, which was so long looked upon
as a simple annex of China; nor of Japan, which ethnologists quite
recently considered only another Cochin China.

The Koreans and the Japanese belong without contradiction, at least
up to a certain point, to the great mass of peoples of the yellow race.
The Koreans, whom I have shown you in photographs, used so greatly
to resemble Tibetans, that they were often mistaken the one for the
other; but there are others who make the impression as if they were
the offspring of intermarriages, and more than one modern traveler,
unable to explain some national variations that might be called out of
order, has brought in the most unexpected elements to account for

prise
THE YELLOW RACES. lee

these strange mixtures, from the Aleutian (Chaillé-Long-Bey) to the
Turk himself (Varat).

As to the Japanese, the immense anthropological collection (54 skele-
tons, 403 skulls, 27 pelves, etc.), sent to the Museum by M. Steenackers,
shows the superabundant multiplicity of their various sources. It can
hereafter no longer be doubted that the population of the Archipelago
of the Rising Sun is connected by bonds of kinship with its neighbors
on the Yellow Continent. But it is also becoming more and more cer-
tain, that some southern elements have played a very important part
in their history as a nation. The Malays (to adopt a very general term),
whose fleets ravaged the coasts of Tsiampa as late as the eighth cen-
tury, had at times previous to that a powerful influence on the northern
islands, and have left behind them numerous traces of their interven-
tion. I shall take pleasure in seeing the ingenious and varied argu-
ments brought to light by which M. Metchnikoff supports the very
precise views which he has formed on that subject.

One last national element, wlich has remained very modest in its
influence, because it was driven out with a kind of repugnance, by the
Japanese, is the Aino, the hairy race of Kuriles, of Sakhalin, and of
Yeso. I have told you what little I knew of these singular islanders,
whom for the moment I am utterly unable to classify. The Ainos are,
on an average, akin to the Chinese by their cephalic index, and I have
provisionally placed them between the Chinese and the Eskimo, whilst
most readily admitting that this classification is altogether provisional
only.

Of the different branches of the yellow trunk, whose general physiog-
nomy I have placed before you, those that could be gathered together
in a tolerably homogeneous group without doing much mischief, have
thus been passed in review. There remain to us to be studied a cer-
tain number of others, more or less irregular, and who, since Blumen-
bach, have been generally set apart under the names of the Malay
branch and the American branch. This year’s course of lectures will
be devoted to the examination of documents of all kinds relating to
these two branches.

We shall pass in review, successively, the material referring to the
Korean and the Japanese races, considered in the light of intermediaries
between those of the Asiatic Continent and those of the large islands
which are dependent on them. Next weshall approach the facts which
have reference to Malay land and its ethnological connections, Mada.
gascar on one side, Polynesia and Micronesia on the other. This first
series of studies will bring us to Easter. After vacation we shall begin
the study of the races of the New World, which will occupy the whole
remainder of the course.
COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

By OTTO SITTIG.

The fact that the first voyagers around the world found all the archi-
pelagoes in the Pacific Ocean inhabited as far as Easter Island in the
extreme east appeared to present an indecipherable enigma to anthro-
pogeography, and although the remarkable skill of the Oceanic peoples
in swimming, and the high degree to which they had developed the art
of navigation were known, even these did not afford adequate connect-
ing links for the origin of these islanders. Therefore, the first oppor-
tunity of considering the question with a prospect of success was
afforded when instances of longer voyages, which exceeded the dis-
tances ordinarily traversed, became known and—this is the main point—
also the fact that they occurred involuntarily. In connection with
their accounts of such voyages, most travelers have expressed an
opinion concerning the origin of the inhabitants of Polynesia. The
view that they were indigenous to the soil met with no permanent
approval, since from the very beginning there has been a conviction
that there is a relationship not only between the Polynesians, but also
between them and the inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago, and the
idea of indigenous origin is on the whole mythical, so far as our knowl-
edge of the people is concerned. The theory of their derivation from
the islands southeast of Asia is therefore strenuously defended. But
the opposite opinion, which assumes America to be the starting point
of the population of Polynesia, is also mooted and finds its principal
champion in Ellis. This view denies the possibility of a derivation of
the Polynesians from the west, since the prevailing winds and currents
move in that very direction and, moreover, there is no lack of ethno-
graphical points of resemblance between the people mentioned and the
original inhabitants of America. Of minor importance, in our consid-
eration, are the individual opinions of Bary, Lesson, and, later, Qua-
trefages, who attribute the origin of these islanders to New Zealand.

The purpose of the present article is to make the most complete com-
pilation possible of the cases recorded by history in which vessels have
been driven out of their proper course in the Pacific Ocean, whose
examination altogether may afford us an insight into the naturai hypo-
theses of migrations across the ocean.

520 COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

The chart upon which have been mapped out the course of compulsory
voyages shows very distinctly four separate districts in which craft are
driven out of their way, according to which this discussion is naturally
divided. These four districts, which will be examined successively,
are the following:

District T.\—The islands between the Philippines and Gilbert Archi-
pelago from 0° to about 15° north.

District [1.—The islands west of Samoa and Tonga from 0° to 22°
south (western boundary of New Guinea).

District III.—The islands east of Samoa in the same latitudes (east-
ern boundary, Crescent Island).

District I Vi—The northern basin of the Pacific Ocean.

The results of our argument will form anthropogeographic conelu-
sions, to which we shall be led by the material gathered.

DISTRICT I.

The first of the districts marked out above lies in the monsoon region
of southeastern Asia; here the vicinity of the continental masses of
land exerts an influence which greatly modifies the action of the winds.
Henee, just in this region, instances of compulsory migrations accumu-
late, and we find a fitting motive to the first field for examination in
the accidental voyages which start from the Malay Archipelago or find
their goal there. Reports of such in former times exist in the descrip-
tions which Spanish missionaries and travelers give of the Philippine
Islands and neighboring groups. In the year 1638, a ship called Con-
ception was driven from Manila to Tinian, one of the Ladrones.? From
the letters of the missionaries, De Brosses states’ that, in the year 1696,
twenty-nine Pelew islanders, or natives of islands previously unknown,
were driven in two boats to Guivam, on the island of Samal. The wind -
tossed them about for seventy days, and five of their number died from
the exertions and privations of this voyage of 800 kilometers. At the
same time two women were found on the same island who had been

1We have intentionally avoided the usual names Micronesia, Polynesia, etc.,
because the natural conditions compel us to assume a uniform population of the
Oceanic islands, and such a distinction in the nomenclature might easily lead to an
opposite comprehension.

One of the castaways died soon after the arrival; there is also a difference of ten
persons; but this seems later to have been merely an error in print. According to
Semper: Pelew Islands, page 356, it appears from the statements of Father Murillo
Velarde (Histoire, etc., page 375, and following Manila, 1749) that these islanders
can not have been natives of Pelew, which the name of the island, Panlog, contro-
verts, but must have come from Yap, or still farther eastward. (The lettres édif,
also oppose it.)
COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. 521

brought there by a similar accident. It might be supposed that
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands would also have been carried to
the Pelew Islands, but this conjecture is not confirmed. There is not
a single instance of such a compulsory voyage, but there are transac-
tions which can explain this phenomenon. These are the futile efforts
made by the Spaniards to reach the Pelew Islands from the Philip-
pines, which are related by De Brosses and Burney' from the travels
of Franciscus Padilla. The first effort of the Spaniards to discover
the “‘New Philippines” occurred in 1707, after a shipwreck suffered by
some of the inhabitants of these islands, whereby they became known.’
But this was frustrated, as were also four other attempts, which were
undertaken in the years 1708, 1710, 1711, and 1729. The first time any
one succeeded in sailing from the Philippines to the Pelew Islands?
was in 1731. These noteworthy circumstances teach us the close con-
nection existing between accidental voyages, and thus also the migra-
tions of the Oceanic peoples, and the mechanical movements of the
wind and the sea.

There are, however, instances of vessels being swept from more
southern regions to the Pelew Islands. Captain Wilson, after his ship-
wreck in the year 1738, found at Pellilu a Malay who, with six compan-
ions, had been carried thither from Ternate in the Celebes.t| Dumont
D’Urville also mentions this case.” A thoroughly analogous event
happened, according to Johnson’s statement, in the year 1859 and in
the following one, when two boats from Salibago were driven upon the
northwestern side of the Pelew Islands. The crews landed at the vil-
lage of Aibukit, and Kubary afterwards found one of the castaways still
there.6 Micklucho-Maclay, during his brief stay in Yap and Pelew,
also frequently met persons from other islands who had been cast away
on them; for instance, he found on the main island, Baobel-taop, in the
village of Malogiok, a man from Bul, on the northern coast of Celebes,’
who made his voyage in eighteen days.

In the first group is one of the most remarkable and at the same
time also the best known voyage which is related of Kadu. The Rus-
sian captain, O. v. Kotzebue,’ met him on the island of Aur. Chamisso,
Kotzebue’s traveling companion, was induced by this singular case to
pay special attention to compulsory migrations. Kadu was a native
of the Ulie Islands, and with two of his countrymen and an inhabitant of

the island of Yap, while on a voyage from Ulie to Fais, was overtaken
by a storm, and after drifting a long time was cast ashore upon the
Aur group of the Radack chain.! Thus, the wind had driven the luck-
less voyagers a distance of 2,700 kilometers. Kadu was taken on
board of the Rurik, where Chamisso especially interested himself
in him, and from the narratives of our man of Ulie noted a series of
similar cases which he himself deems reliable. An event precisely
analogous to this is the casting ashore of seafarers from Yap upon this
same group of Aur where Kadu was found. The latter distance even
exceeds the former by 300 kilometers. In Chamisso’s time there were
also five natives of Lamotrek living on the southeastern side of the
Arno group, who had been borne there by the wind and currents. In
1857 people from Ule were driven to the Marshall Islands in the same
way.

It is not without some astonishment that we find ourselves in the
presence of this immense number of compulsory voyagers, since their
course is exactly opposite to what we should expect from the mechanical
movements of the waves and the wind in this group. In fact, there is
also no lack of accidental sea voyages in the contrary direction which
appear to us much more significant. Thus, Chamisso met at Guahan a
native of Lamotrek who knew the names of Radack and Ralick, and
this circumstance, though not with absolute certainty, indicates a cast-
away from the chain of islands farther westward.’

There is a noteworthy event which occurred about the year 1807,
when a boat was driven from Tuch to Guahan, that is, about 800 kilo-
meters, in a northwestern direction.t De Brosses gives two similar
instances from the letters of A. Cantova.® On the Lith of June, 1721,
and two days later people from Faraulep who wished to go to Ulie, but
were driven about twenty days by wind and tempest, were stranded
here.© According to Cook,’ who, in his third voyage, also mentions
these events, there were twenty-four people in the first boat, while the
latter contained only six. In the same way, during the previous year,
two canoes were swept from a distant island to one of the Marianne
group, but it is not stated whence they came. It is, however, certain
that in the period between 1760 and 1770, a boat from Yap, lying 800
kilometers toward the southwest, was cast ashore on the same island of

‘Reise um die Welt, I, page 103.

*The estimate of the length of such voyages is especially unreliable, where months
are taken as the basis of the measurement of time. Kadu gave eight months; M.
Waitz (Anthropologie, I, p. 225, and V, p. 21), only five months are named.

the Marianne cluster.' A chief from Faraulep, just mentioned, was once
driven by accident upon Mogmog, near Yap. He set sail for Guahan,
but missed his way; and the same voyage was once made by a little
boat which carried only three men, but sailed faster than the two larger
vessels with which it came.? A very remarkable case was related by
Rua, a native of Nukuor. He left his home on the 6th of December,
1876, and with a coverlet for a sail tacked about for seventeen days to
reach Ponapl, but missed it and was stranded on the Minto Reef, 450
meters due north of his starting point, where he was obliged to support
life until September, 1878, when the schooner Lotus found him and
brought him to Tuch.’

The other instances of compulsory voyages in our first district belong
to the eastern islands, and bring these groups into connection with each
other and also with the western ones. Radack and Ralick maintain a
constant intercourse and therefore accidental voyages frequently occur
here, though of less length than in the examples previously cited.
While Chamisso remained in Ailuk a young chief from Mesid (probably
Mejit, only 100 kilometers eastward) was driven ashore there in a little
fishing boat by a tempest;* and many years before five persons from
Repith-Urur, an island of the Gilbert Archipelago,’ were cast upon the
island of Relich in the Ralick chain. Besides, there were on the island
of Airik of the Kaben group, a man and a woman, and on Arno, for-
merly mentioned, two men and a woman, also from Repith-Urur, who
had been borne thither by the winds and current. During Kaduw’s res-
idence on Aur two boats, each containing a man and a woman, arrived
there from the same island of the Gilbert Archipelago.’ Lastly, a case
very interesting in itself and analogous to that of castaways, though
less important, is the appearance of driftwood and the floating of the
wreckage of ships, when the question is the possibility of the disper-
sion of peoples over the ocean in connection with the mechanical move-
ments of the atmosphere and the sea... On Tabual Island, of the Aur
group, Chamisso found a woman from Bogha, who, while trying to carry
leaves of the cocoanut palm from one island to another, was caught by
the tide and swept away; her cocoanut fronds served as a raft, and
five days after she was washed ashore on Utirik.®

21t is known that people from the Caroline Islands often sail to Guahan; there-
fore instances of vessels driven out of their course frequently occur in this region.

7We might here express the conjecture that the dissemination of the cocoa palm,
and especially of certain land animals, would be found associated with the disper-
sion of human beings. For instance, there are uninhabited islands, and these are
destitute of these palm trees, as the Ducie Islands (Paumotu); Timoe, on the con-
trary, lying about 10 degrees westerly is inhabited, but has no cocoa palms.

524 COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

But still larger numbers of the inhabitants of the Marshall and Gil-
bert islands were carried out of their course and cast away farther
westward in the center of the Carolines. This fact may already be con-
jectured from Kaduw’s tales. According to his statements, ‘‘ Fanopé”
must be groups of low islands, whose existence became known by the
frequency of voyagers from thence being cast upon Puluhot; besides,
Kadu had learned on Puluhot a song in which a distant group of
islands, Malilegotot, is mentioned.1. Fanopé is scarcely identical with
Ponape, which shows a series of names that have a similar sound,
because the latter island is mountainous. Nor do we suppose that
Funafuti or Fuana-tapu of the Ellice Islands is meant; but at any rate,
long compulsory voyages from west to east must be the foundation of
such traditions. Besides, we do not lack well-authenticated eases of
the same kind. In the year 1856, a boat was swept from Ralick upon
Kusaie of the Caroline group, and a few days later another was driven
ashore upon the island of Mokil or Wellington, lying still farther west;?
that is, a compulsory voyage of nearly 1,100 kilometers was made with
the wind and the current. It is also worthy of note that the inmates,
in spite of the forces working against them, succeeded in returning
home. Men from the Marshall Islands were also cast ashore upon the
Gilbert Islands lying toward the southeast; for instance, in the year
1861; and, on the other hand, inhabitants of the former were swept
upon Radack and Ralick.? Hernsheim reports‘ the indubitable fact
that inhabitants of the Marshall Islands were carrie farther to the
Carolines, to Pleasant Island, and still westward for distances of 2,700
kilometers. For instance, he himself took from Hongkong to their
home, the Kingsmill Islands, four native Mainas who, while on a short
cruise from one island to another, were surprised by a violent storm,
and in ten days carried to 2 degrees south and 161 degrees east—that
is, a distance of 1,300 kilometers. There they were taken on board a
French ship. The authenticity of a similar event is vouched for by the
French missionary Maigret. During his residence in Ponape, in the
year 1837, he saw a man who had landed there by accident from Mara-
kai, in the Tarawa group; on the other hand, it is asserted that this
very Marakai obtained its population from Ponape; the islands are
1,500 kilometers apart, and therefore, in this instance, it is an especially
favorable circumstance that the migration is compulsory. At the
same time two boats came to Tarawa from an island of the same Gil-
bert Archipelago,’ lying southeast of it, called by Hale Amoi.°

DISTRICT II.

In leaving the first and most diversified of our districts, we can name
only a single instance of a compulsory voyage, which forms a bridge
across the region of calms to the group of islands mentioned in the
introduction as belonging to the second district. It is a fact that an
inhabitant of the Kingsmill Islands was once driven to Rotumah.' An
inhabitant of this latter island was carried to Samoa, and this voyage
must have lasted not less than three months. Another Rotumah man
reached Viti. Almost the opposite voyage, in a little more easterly
direction, was made by Kow Muela, a Tongan, who had gone with a
band of young men to the Viti Islands on an expedition. After he had
harassed this archipelago for two years he sailed for Tonga, but at
Vavau encountered unfavorable winds and was compelled to shape his
course for Samoa, but reached Fotuna,’ lying to the northwest. All
the other accidental voyages in our present district show a common
noteworthy characteristic—they all, with slight modifications, take the
Same main direction from west to east.

Cook and the Forster brothers noticed the kinship which the inhabit-
ants of certain islands of the New Hebrides showed to the Tongans
and Samoans, but there was no attested fact which could have explained
the necessity of such a relation. The second voyage*® which Captain
Bligh’s boat, after his landing in Toto, made in a westerly direction—
it finally landed at Timor—sufficiently proves that compulsory migra-
tions from central Polynesia do take place for considerable distances
with the trade winds. Of course, in such occurrences the Viti Archi-
pelago could not remain exempt, and, in fact, through the reception of
Tongan blood, a mixed race has been formed, which occupies the wind-
ward side of these islands, and about 200 pure Tongans also live on this
group.’ Here, it is true, the normal relations of traffic also exist, and
the Tongan boat building in Viti, etc., must not be overlooked. It is
the eastern winds which drive them there. Lakemba became their prin-
cipal settlement, and when the missionaries arrived there were three
Tongan colonies on this island.” But Tongans and Samoans were also
driven still farther westward. Thus Erskine found in Nengone three
descendants of Tongans who had been swept ashore there many years

long time on the western group of islands in the Pacific, found at Vate
the blind chief Bula, his interpreter, and several young people who
were descendants of Tongans, and had also come there by accident.!
Bula called himself Sualo. He left Samoa in a double canoe about the
time of the Atua war (1825) in company with fifty other persons, princi-
pally Tongans. They lived a number of years in the new home to which
the wind had borne them, but when they set out to seek the old one
they missed their native isiands, and remained permanently on Vate.
Turner also found on the island of Lifu Polynesians who, like Bula and
his companions, had been carried to this western island. It is also
stated that people have been driven upon Tanna from Samoa and Tonga.
The islands of Erromanga and Immer have undoubtedly been peopled
from the east by a race whose dialect is akin to that of Tongan. Their
inhabitants had thus made the same journey as their countrymen on
Tanna.’ Codrington, who is well acquainted with the Melanesian lan-
guages, mentions in the western range of islands in our second district
a large number of localities which have received Polynesian elements
of population, and he, too, attributes these immigrations to accidental
causes. Besides Uvea of the Loyalty Islands, he cites Fotuna, which
is identical with Krromanga or Eranan, already mentioned, and Vate.
This influence also extends to several islands of the Shepherd group,
and shows itself especially in the one seen by Cook and named from its
position Mai, or Three Hills. But he goes still farther, and not only
includes the district north of the Banks Islands (Tikopia) and the
Swallow group:(Matema), situated near Santa Cruz, but, with Bennell
and Bellona, embraces the southern, and with Ongtong Java, near Isa-
bella, the central Solomon group. Codrington himself met on the island
of Ureparapara, one of the Banks group, a man and woman with their
son, who had been cast ashore there from a Polynesian island; and even
at Saddle Island? he found children who were descendants of Poly-
nesians who had been stranded there. Lastly, just before his stay on
the Banks Islands people had arrived two successive years from Tonga
and remained a considerable time.*

Murray, Missions in Western Polynesia, also relates this event, page 233. According
to him, there were Samoans in the party.

taken a man prisoner on Taumako, who told him that arrows had been brought to
this island from a distant country called Pouro. He supposes Pouro to be in the
Indian Ocean and thinks that the arrows must have come from India; but Guppy cor-
rects this, and says that the place meant is Bouro, which lies only 500 kilometers west
of Taumako, while Pouro is more than 3,600 kilometers. (United States Exploring
Expedition, VY, p. 195. See also Burney, History of the Discoveries, II, page 308.)

DISTRICT II.

The farther we go from the masses of land forming the continents
lying eastward and approach the third district, where vessels are driven
from their course, the shorter becomes the series of instances recorded
by history of compulsory voyages which are to give us a clearer com-
prehension of the intermingling of the Polynesians; yet even here they
are not wholly lacking, and present almost the greatest wealth in regard
to the line of direction.

The province now to be considered is united with the former one by
three long accidental voyages. The boat of the Englishman Williams
was once driven from Rarotonga to Tongatabu, that is, a distance of
more than 1,500 kilometers, and on his last voyage he himself conveyed
to their home several natives of Aitutaki who had been carried by the
wind to Probys Island (Niue Island), which lies 1,500 kilometers west-
ward of Cooks or Herveys Island.’ The third connecting route pre-
sents itself in 10 degrees south, and extends far beyond the eastern
limit of the second district. In the year 1861, inhabitants of Manihiki
or Humphrey (10° 8., 161° 1’ W.) were swept away by a storm and
reached Nukulailai; one of them, Elkana, on this occasion gave there
and in Funafuti (the Ellice group) the first Christian instruction.2. An
inhabitant of the austral island Rurutu was once transported to this
same island, Manihiki; his wanderings lasted six weeks.* And in the
year 1820 a canoe, also from Rurutu, arrived at Uliatea, in Maurua,
having accomplished this voyage of 900 kilometers in from two to three
weeks.* From this region of Maurua we have to note two cases which
extend to the Hervey group. In 1824, a boat which belonged to Mr.
Williams left Raiatea (Uliatea) with a westerly wind to sail to Tahiti,
but the wind changed, and the boat, several months later, was found
1,400 kilometers toward the southwest. Another time Williams’s own
boat was driven from Tahiti to Atui. Shipwrecked voyagers were
found by Cook on the same island. During his second voyage he took
with him to England Omai, a native of Raiatea, who accompanied him
on his third voyage. When they reached Atni, Omai found three of his
countrymen who had been driven ashore there when they were sail-
ing homeward from Tahiti. Besides Omai’s acquaintances there were
seventeen others in this party.” Captain Bligh found on Miatea a boy
and a woman, the sole survivors of an unfortunate band who had been
carried there some time before his arrival from Tubuai.° Ellis reports

that frequently people from eastern islands of which nothing had been
previously known on the Society Islands were cast on the shores of
Tahiti.)

In the small number of instances in this eastern district of the region
where boats are driven out of their course, compulsory voyages against
the wind are not largely represented; but they are not entirely want-
ing. Thus it is positively proved that the austral island Tubuai,? pre-
viously mentioned, was peopled at a recent date, 1840, by natives of
an island lying westward, probably Rimitara, and the immigrants were
brought there by unfavorable winds.? Timoe or Crescent Island also
received its population accidentally and from the west, namely, from
Mangarera.‘ Lastly, the case of voyagers being driven from Raiatea
to Tubuai is also assured to us.

It would be of special value to our position if we could record an
instance of an accidental voyage to Haster Island,° but though this is
not possible, there are two actually certified voyages against wind and
eurrent from the Paumotu group which are analogous to the case we
must assume in order to bring the Easter Islanders into connection
with the other Polynesians. Captain Beechey?’ found on the island of
Byam (Martin) forty Tahitians—men, women, and ehildren—who had
been swept in a double canoe against the prevailing wind from Chain
Island to Barrow Island (Wana Wana), a mere reef, that is, a distance
of about 1,000 kilometers. Beechey took one of these unfortunates,
Tuwarri, on board, and when they reached Bow Island this Tahitian
found his brother and various friends, who had been stranded there by
the same disaster. The latter had first made a voyage with the wind,
so that the total length of their passage was about the same distance—
1,000 kilometers.®

There is probably no doubt that Easter Island has also been peopled from the
west. Beechey gives excellent reasons for it (1,79). Micklucho-Maclay informs Bas-
tian in a letter that Easter Island was known to the inhabitants of the nearest
island as Rapa nui (Zeitschr. d. Ges. f. Erdk. Berlin 1879,7). According to tradition,
the population of this island came from Oparo, lying 1,900 miles westward. Images
and stone slabs, like those in Easter Island, have been found there (Palmer, p. 29).
Geiseler also supports this; but mentions a tradition, according to which the Easter
islanders are said to have come from the Galapagos Islands; but this tradition is
opposed to the opinions of other natives; besides, the Galapagos Islands were
uninhabited. (Master Island, an abode of prehistoric civilization in the South
Seas, p. 43.)

‘It is also an important circumstance that Wilkes found driftwood at Enderbury
(3° & §.,171° 8’ W.) which must have come from the west. (Behm, in Petermann,

DISTRICT IV.

After connecting the individual groups of islands in the Pacific
Ocean from Pelew to Paumotu, there is still the basin of the North
Pacific. Instances of accidental voyages, whose point of departure
lay within one of the districts already discussed, do not occur, and the
point in question concerns only vessels from the continents, especially
Asia, which have been swept out of their course.

The Bonin Islands (properly Bunin-Siam, that is, uninhabited islands)
were discovered in the year 1675, when a Japanese junk was cast
ashore there;' and in 1690 Japanese, who often made voyages to the
Ladrones, were carried away to Manila.? In the year 1869, a Chinese
junk, which had been swept from the Liukiu Islands, was stranded
upon Baker Island. In 1836, the figurehead of a ship from China was
found in Metalanim at Ponape.’ It is singular that no connection from
the groups of islands already established can be made with the Sand-
wich Islands. Vague traditions and ethnographical characteristics
among the Hawaiians, it is true, point to Polynesia, but there is no
event which would permit us to deduce positively that the natural con-
ditions for bringing the Hawaiians into a necessary connection with the
other islanders have existed.*. Yet there are abundant reasons of a

Fakuafo (9° 20’ §.,171° 4’ W.) of the Union group; also of the floating ashore of
clubs which must have come from Viti or Samoa. The instance of a craft being
carried out of her course to Raratonga is only to be inferred from the traditions
existing there; people from the Society Islands are said to have arrived at various
times by accident, but the Raratongans also trace their origin to Raiatea, and this
coincides with the beliefs of the inhabitants of this latter island. (Ellis I, p. 126.)
Beechey (I, p.60) mentions various errors of reckoning, which we will pass over
here. Behrens, a traveling companion of Roggewein, was driven, during his short
voyage from the island of Juan Fernandez to Easter Island, 318 (corrected to 204)
English miles farther west than he expected to be. With Blossom the difference in
the same region amounted to 270 miles; and when La Peyrouse went from Con-
ception to Hawaii, during which passage he touched at Easter Island, he noticed
that he had made an error in his reckoning of 300 miles.

1Geogr. Handbuch, by R. Andree (for school atlas), page 370.

2F'rom similar events in earlier times the fact may bo inferred that in the eastern
portions of the Malay Archipelago, for instance Ceram, legends of white immigrants
had existed before the arrival of the first Europeans. (See Bastian Inselgruppen,
p 242.) On the other hand, Rein (Japan, p.449 and following) maintains that nat-
ural conditions existed for tracing the population of Japan from the Malay Archi-
pelago; other reasons, however, are decidedly ayainst this conjecture.

*“Waitz I, page 225; V, page 20; F. Ratzel: Vélkerkunde II, page 340 and following.

4A ship was once wrecked on Fakaafo (Union group). Hale supposes that it came
from Hawaii, because the word ‘“‘debolo” (in Fakaafo, it is true, with a different
meaning (is found in both places (United States Exploring Expedition, V,p. 157.)
Traditions of voyages to Nukahiva are not lacking in Hawaii; voyages to Tahiti are
even said to have been undertaken (Bastian-Inselgruppen, p.286.) The general
opinion is that the boats of the Hawaiians were formerly larger; voyages were
Said to last two or three months. (Ellis: Tour through Hawaii, p. 441.) A direct
relation is even said to have existed between the New Zealanders and the Sandwich

different character, which compel us to believe in a kinship between
the Hawaiians and the other Polynesians. In the ancient population
of Malden and the vanished one of Fanning, we find the unmistakable
bridge between the Society and the Sandwich islands.! There has
always been a conviction that an influence from China, and especially
from Japan, has asserted itself here. Cases of craft from eastern Asia
being driven to Hawaii remove any doubt of this fact. Besides, these
cases are especially calculated to prove to us how closely the population
of Polynesia is united to that of Asia.

According to the statements of the Hawaiians themselves, such oceur-
rences are not infrequent. Jarves relates that in December, 1832, a
Japanese junk was driven ashore at Oahu, near the harbor of Waialea.
Nine of its occupants were still alive, after having been tossed to and
fro eleven months upon the sea.? The remark made by Hawaiians
upon the arrival of these people is worthy of consideration. They
said: “It is plain now we come from Asia,” when they saw that the
strangers showed a strong resemblance to themselves. In the time of
Opili also, white men landed on the southwestern coast of Hawaii, and
a reliable statement informs us that a short time after the departure of
these strangers another band of white men were also stranded on the
western side of Hawaii. The boat had neither mast nor sail and was
painted. The people were dressed in yellow and white, and one wore
a hat adorned with plumes. They long exerted an influence in Hawaii.
Later, a boat is said to have arrived at the same place, and about the
year 1620 a second one came to the southern side of the bay just men-
tioned, in Palekai. The ship was wrecked and only the captain and
one white woman reached theland. Two vessels are also said to have
once been cast upon the northeastern shore, but no one gained the
beach. Wilkes states that a whaler received on board five Japanese
and took them to the Sandwich Islands. There is a mythical story
that, under the government of King Kamaloohua, in Maui, a Hawaiian
vessel brought in four strangers, whose complexion was only moderately
dark, and who were probably the crew of a wrecked Japanese boat.
With the frequency of such cases, it can not surprise us that instances
of compulsory voyages have been recorded which extend over the entire

Islanders; both cultivated—the former according to tradition—the sweet potato,
which did not exist in the Society Islands. (Shortland: Traditions and Superstitions
of the New Zealanders, p. 34.) Williams found in New Zealand 2 dog which lived in
a wild state in Maurua (Samoa). He therefore seeks Sawaii there, and notin Hawaii,

connection between the Hawaiians and New Zealanders. (Mitheil. d. Geogr. Ges.

basin of the Northern Pacific to the American Continent. The voyages
to Hawaii may be regarded as transition stages to those to America.
The analogy applies to two compulsory voyages, also of Japanese ves-
sels, the first, which sailed for Osaka, was cast away on Cape Lopatka
in July, 1729; the other was carried to the southern end of the island
of Kadiak.

Kotzebue! states that Japanese have been carried to America, and
about the time when the Japanese junk reached Oahu such a boat also
landed near Cape Flattery, north of the mouth of the Columbia.
Sometimes Chinese ships were even driven to the northwestern coast
of North America.” In the examination of the Sandwich Islands, the
fact is specially worthy of note that articles are transported here which
show their origin in North America with the same cogency as the voy-
ages previously mentioned indicate Asia. Vancouver found in Kauai
a canoe 614 feet long, which was hollowed from a single log.®

The prospects in the investigation in the case of New Zealand are
meager. Probably no one doubts that this pair of islands obtained its
population from an island centrally situated among the groups formerly
discussed, and a glance at the mechanical relations of the Pacifie suf-
fices to make this easy of comprehension; but there is no positive proof
of it. The report that a ship on the way from Savaii to Tonga was
overtaken by a storm, driven toward Viti, and finally reached the coast
of New Zealand is shrouded in obscurity; and it seems almost super-
fluous to cite the instance of a vessel driven out of her course, which
occurred on the northeastern coast of New Zealand. In June, 1844, a
boat from Opotiki was carried to Tauranga, which is only about 120
kilometers westward. The single point worthy of note here is the fact
that the incident occurred in consequence of a northeast storm.

The Chatham Islanders trace their origin to New Zealand, and have
the tradition that about the year 1750 their ancestors were driven on
shore by a westerly storm; but these must not be confounded with the
New Zealanders who came there later for the purpose of trade.” We
deem this fact of importance, as it lays stress upon the point that the
primary act was the driving out of the course, and the secondary one

2North Pacific Sailing Directory, page 1209. In Hawaii (eastern side) two anchors
were found; Kotzebue supposes that they came from one of the ships which were
driven out of their course (see Jarves, p. 102); and the iron which Cook found in
the same place is said to have belonged to Spanish voyagers from Manila. (Bastian:
Inselgruppen, p. 242, note 2. Cook: Third Voyage, II, p. 402.) Cook thinks it
entirely a matter of course that this iron must have come from the east. The fre-
quency with which driftwood washes ashore along the whole northern rim of the
Pacific is generally known.

ham Islands, ibid., page 148, note.

5d2 COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

the formation of commercial relations.' Yet other factors which com-
pelled the Oceanic peoples to leave their native islands must not be
overlooked. It is the nature of these islanders to trust themselves
confidently to the sea, hoping soon to find an island where they can
settle.

itis not surprising that we can record no vessel driven out of her
course in the Southern Hemisphere, which extended to South America.
Probably no one would. assert that such an event happened, though it
is not impossible. Dillon mentions, as a noteworthy example, that in
June, 1824, an American ship ran into the harbor of Valparaiso, which
had sailed from Mulgrave Achipelago, past Samoa, with the wind
blowing constantly from the west and northwest. In the higher
southern latitudes “the brave west winds” are proverbial with mari-
ners. Since, under force of natural conditions, an immigration into
South America from the west is not absolutely impossible, there is in
some degree an analogy in the northern and southern basins of the
Pacific with regard to the possibility of the dispersion of human
beings.

But this analogy can exist only so long as the relations of the wind
and currents in both basins are the same. Im the vicinity of the
equator—in point of fact slightly north of it—these relations are sym-
metrical, and complications of these relations first become operative
when the groups of islands on the continents place obstacles in their
way. But while the ocean north of the equator is closed by masses of
land, and the northern equatorial stream is thus forced back upon itself,
in the eastern portion of the southern part there is a movement of the
masses of water toward the equator, and in the western a similar one
toward the pole; in the center the sea, so to speak, is neutral.

Our chart shows that compulsory voyages become more and more
infrequent the farther we go eastward from Asia, and, south of the
equator, voyages with the trade wind are largely in the majority. This
proves on one side that the accident of such a journey is most closely
connected with the wind, and, on the other, that the continent of Aus-
tralia is capable only in a small degree of transforming the relations of
the wind sufficiently to produce the phenomena we encountered in the
first district, when the huge masses of land in Asia exactly reverse the
directions of the wind and currents.’ In fact, the currents of the air

‘Lesson believes that the Polynesian colonies in the New Hebrides were founded
only in a limited degree by castaways; but we think that we have cited so many
examples that the priority of the compulsory voyage is evident. There is no doubt
that in addition to such incidents, intentional voyages must also have been made;
otherwise the ethnographical picture of our islands would be even more motley
than itis.

~The cause of the circumstance that we find no instance in our second district of
a vessel being driven out of her course from the west toward the east appears to be
that the inhabitants of the Hebrides, Solomon Islands, etc., undertake only yoyages
along the coast, as O. Finsch (Reise in die Siidsee, p. 37) has pointed out.

COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. 533

and of the sea are much stronger and more steady in the Southern Hem-
isphere than in the Northern. Besides the aggregation of the islands in
the Malay Archipelago, this is of special importance with regard to the
western migration of the Malays, in the Indian Ocean. In our first
district compulsory voyages are especially frequent; therefore the im-
portant inference follows that it is the modifications and complications
of the mechanical conditions of the air and sea which carry people far
out of their course into the ocean. It is also evident where we are to
seek the point of departure of the Polynesians, namely, where the
Oceanic islands are intertwined with those of the Malay Archipelago.
The question would find but a doubtful answer, even if America on the
west was closely wreathed with islands. But this is not the case and,
besides, Revilla Gigedo, Galapagos, Juan Fernandez, and Salas y Gomez
were, indeed, uninhabited. This fact speaks effectually against a migra-
tion from America across the ocean to our island groups.

If, in the examination of the first three districts, where boats are
driven out of their course, the conviction has forced itself upon us that
even the most remote Paumotu isles have received their inhabitants
from the Malay Archipelago, in the presence of the Sandwich Islands
still more comprehensive speculations open before our eyes. We see
that the Hawaiians must naturally be mingled with Chinese and
Japanese elements, and even in the Carolines this is not excluded.
Perhaps herein lies the basis of the mental superiority of the inhab-
itants of these two groups over those of many others, and anthropo-
geography teaches that in reality it finds eastern Asiatic resemblances
in the Carolines. If we look still farther eastward, we shall see that
Bering Strait does not form the sole bridge between the Old and the
New World. Migrations from Asia to America have undoubtedly
taken place in more southern latitudes.' Nay, it even appears that
the possibility of a migration backward from northwestern America to
Hawaii is not excluded. With regard to South America, no material
exists which could justify us in making deductions.

It seems to us, however, that the proof is furnished that the natural
conditions, according to which we can judge the migration of the
Malays across the sea, entitle us to group the original inhabitants of
America with the Polynesians, Australians, and Malays in a single
great family of peoples, the Mongoloid, who inhabited the coasts of two
oceans, the Pacitic and the Indian. The great capacity for journeying
possessed by the Malays is an established fact. The power of separa-
tion which the Pacitie Ocean has by reason of its width is diminished
on the other hand, by the numerous islands; and as a continent favors
commerce more when it is divided, so do islands when they are so
numerous and so situated as the Oceanic ones. Here land and water

1 We notice that, for instance, in the northwestern part of America, myths have
existed which point to a migration across the sea; the Americans also have tradi-
tions of a western origin besides the one that they came from the north. (Chamisso:
Bemerkungen. )
534 COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

have exchanged their vocations; as, on the continent, man clings to the
soil, here he is closely connected with the sea and the winds moving
it—that is, he becomes a toy of the winds and waves. If by this time
we have gained a comprehensive idea of the migratory capacity of the
inhabitants of Oceanica, the natural result will be a perception of
the inanity of the hypothesis which, to explain the dispersion of the
peoples over the oceans, the Pacific and the Indian, makes a continent
vanish,' instead of starting from the natural factors as they exist at
the present day. Finally, the opinion that the people of Oceanica
came from New Zealand is destroyed by merely looking at our chart.

Of course, no deductions of a positive character can be drawn con-
cerning the individual acts of the migrations of the Oceanicans. The
chart is still too incomplete, and besides, the voyages often change to
the contrary direction. Only where numerous instances of vessels
being carried in a certain course could be recorded are special infer-
ences admissible. According to Kubary, the fact that the inhabitants
of the Carolines were not infrequently carried to the Philippines, and
that, in going there, they always reached the island of Samal or the
southernmost portion of Luzon, is a proof that the northern equatorial
stream breaks just at this point. On the other hand, inhabitants of
the Philippines have never, so far as known, been carried to Pelew,?
an evidence that the northeastern stream makes a circuit around these
islands. -The force of the current here must be very great, as it seems
to conquer the first impulse of driving ships out of their course, which
is most frequently the impact of the wind; for we have seen in the
majority of voyages that they always occurred in consequence of
storms. During long voyages, as in the case of those to America, the
impelling principle, on the contrary, is to be attributed to the currents
of the sea, for tempests are not sufficiently permanent. Even where
the point in question concerns driftwood and other articles, the motive
force is the current and not the wind, for the exposed surface is too
small to permit the wind to wrest it from the dominion of the current;
true, the wind acts indirectly through the stream all the more
powerfully.

The aspect of our second group of castaways is a thoroughly char-
acteristic one. The one-sided direction of the voyages leads us, with
the previous deductions, to perceive distinctly a transfer of Polynesian
blood to the Hebrides, ete.; but Viti must have been touched at each
time on the way from Samoa to Tonga, and hence follows the constant
intercourse between these last island groups.

3etween our first northern district and the two southern ones is to
be noticed a free space; there is scarcely a single instance of an acci-
dental migration to record here; and the cause is not solely the scarcity

being obliged to assume a submerged portion of the globe.
2F, Ratzel: Volkerkunde II, page 341.
COMPULSORY MIGRATIONS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. 535

of islands in this region, but also the neighborhood of the zone of
calms, which again affords a proof that the compulsory voyages and
migrations of the nations across the sea are connected with the winds.!

We can now, with each distance traversed in a compulsory voyage
as a radius, draw acircle around the point of departure and thus obtain
an ideal conception of the migratory capacity of our islanders. It
would be more in harmony with reality to unite in a curve the extreme
points of voyages starting from a limited district, in order to obtain in
the form of a plane a comprehensive expression of the mobility of the
Mongoloid race. In the passages from Japan it is directly obvious
with what remarkably mobile people we are dealing; this is a fact
which ought not to be considered as trivial, which is frequently the
case.

1Perhaps this circumstance explains why so few traces of Polynesian elements
have existed between Samoa and the Moluccas. (See Meinicke in the Zeitschr. der
Ges. f. Erdk., Berlin, 1869, p. 378. )

THE OLD INDIAN SETTLEMENTS AND ARCHITECTURAL
STRUCTURES IN NORTHERN CENTRAL AMERICA.

By Dr. CARL SAPPER.

The ruins of northern Central America have for some time past
enlisted the attention of large numbers of scholars, their scientific
investigation having, in fact, begun more than a century ago. (Antonio
del Rio in Palenque, 1787.) Nevertheless, we possess but few accurate
accounts of old Indian towns and edifices, and a complete series of
important new studies can not probably be expected for several
years to come. Such are the accounts of ruins in Yucatan by E.
Thompson and T. Maler, the thorough exploration of the ruins of
Palenque by A. Maudslay, and of the ruins of Copan by an American
commission, the plans of Comalcaleo and Menché Tenamit, drawn by
engineers of the Mexican Boundary Commission, and others, of the
ruins on the table-land of Guatemala and Chiapas, although deserving
as much interest as the majority of the lowland ruins; only very few
have as yet been examined more thoroughly. Icanrecall here, besides
Stephens’s? descriptions, only the examination of Iximché by Dr. Gus-
tav Brihl,’ and thus I am compelled in my statements mainly to rely
on my own observations. Now, although these are generally nothing
more than the result of hasty visits and of rough sketches of the single
places where ruins are found, I can not but hope that they may be of
some interest, since I have made myself personally familiar with some
examples of old Indian towns—settlements and edifices in almost every
one of the separate ethnographie districts. I must mention here that
I have not examined these ruins with the eye of the artist or the archi-
tect, but as a geographer, desiring to establish the characteristic pecu-
liarities of the shapes adopted in building towns and rearing houses, as

they differed in the various tribes, hoping that | might thus, if possi-
ble, secure some points of contact with the prehistoric migrations and
the ethnographic connection of the tribes.. I have also tried to show
how far the architecture of men depends on the physical and orographie
nature of the land and the character of the building material found in
the vicinity wherever this could be shown. Under the influence of the
above-mentioned views, | have paid but little attention to the ruins
already investigated by more competent men, and in examining unknown
or only imperfectly known ruins of settlements, I have confined myself
to simple, rough measurements by the aid of the compass. The ground
plans and sectional plans given here must, therefore, not be considered
as accurate, but are merely intended to give a generally correct view
of the disposition and the structure of the single buildings—more did
not seem to be required for my purpose. As I have spoken elsewhere
of the old Indian settlements of Guatemala and Chiapas, I need not
return to them here. As, however, many ruins have not yet been inves-
tigated (like those of Chiapa, Tonala, and Agua Hscondida in Chiapas;
of Piedras Negras, Yaxche, and Jolomax in Peten; of Benque Viejo in
British Honduras; of 8. Jorge, Aguacatan, Sacapulas, Mixco, Chajul,
Canilla, Mita, etec., in Guatemala), aud as, moreover, many other ruins
have probably never yet been discovered, my material must needs be
very imperfect, and the results I have obtained will have to be com-
pleted and reexamined, I shall therefore limit myself here to what is
most important.

1. THE DISPOSITION OF OLD INDIAN BUILDINGS WITHIN THE
SETTLEMENTS.

All the Indians of northern Central America have in earlier days
lived, as they still do in our day, in wooden huts covered with grass
or palm leaves, and more durable edifices were raised only for purposes
of worship or of warfare, perhaps also to serve as homes for the highest
spiritual and other dignitaries, in which cases earth and stone, and in
times of higher refinement, even mortar, were employed. Of such
only ruins are in existence, and they will therefore form the principal
subject of this work.

The fact that in our day the majority of Indians live in remote
regions, far from Spanish influences and scattered in separate homes,
or in small clusters of houses, would seem to justify the presumption
that a similar system may have prevailed in pre-Columbian times.
Nevertheless, the Indians had besides, in those days, larger centers of
population, such as surrounded their places of worship, within carefully
fortified iocalities, or their royal residences, the salines, gold washings,
and the like. It must be borne in mind, however, that these centers
of population held only at fixed times larger numbers, as at times of
religious festivals and devotional meetings; the fortresses only in times
of war, the salines in the dry seasons, when alone salt could be made,

ete. During the larger part of the year it is probable the majority of
Indians, and even those who owned a house of their own in the towns,
lived in the country in simple huts, surrounded by their cornfields, as
the case at this day in partsof Alta Verapaz. It was only the Spaniards
who led the Indians to congregate in real towns and villages; and as an
evidence of the strangeness which this mode of life had for them, it
may be mentioned that many tribes of the Maya family never had a
word in their language for this idea, and hence adopted for it the Mexi-
can designation ‘“‘tenamit”. Only in Yucatan a stronger tendency to
concentrate seems to have prevailed from of old, as the people there
were forced to do so by the small number of permanent ponds (aguadas),
of caves through which rivers were passing (cenotes), and of real
springs.

The true nature of old Indian population centers can only be guessed
at, since not a trace has survived of what constituted the principal
part of a town, or that which was inhabited by the poorer classes who
dwelt in mere huts. It is true the Spanish conquerors tell us much of
streets and squares, but the actually existing ruins only show that
Squares, often very extensive, did exist; that in many towns they were
exceedingly numerous and beautiful, but streets, in the modern sense
of the word, [ have never been able to find. Only at Iximché andina
few religious structures (Sajacabaja, Pasajon, 8S. Isidoro), have I found
indications of such a design. Generally it is noticed that the ruins of
the principal buildings (tumuli and stone structures) show no definite
arrangement. A similar state of things exists even now in many
Indian villages which have never been subjected to the Spanish rule
of straight streets, intersecting each other rectangularly. They show
nothing but a confused conglomeration of separate houses, with
crooked and much intersected ways between them, but with no streets
in our sense of the word. As the church, with its open square around
it, now forms the center of these villages, it may be that the groups of
public buildings may formerly have also formed, as it were, the kernel
of similarly shaped settlements.

The old Indian towns of Guatemala and Chiapas have certainly, in
ordinary times, harbored no very considerable population, for the space
lying within the fortification line is generally very confined, and it is
highly improbable that outside of this line other parts of the town
Should have been added, since such a proceeding would in war times
have been as diastrous for those who lived outside as for the fortress
itself.

It may be argued, on the other hand, that the older Spanish writers
have left us very minute descriptions of many old Indian towns, but I
must confess that I am very skeptical as to their accuracy in such mat-
ters. They seem to have indulged with great pleasure in large numbers,
feeling sure of not being contradicted. Thus, Fuentes tells us that the
chief commanders of the Quiches, Tecum Uman, in the year 1524, had
540. INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

drawn 72,000 warriors from the capital, Gumarcah (Utatlan), alone, and
the royal palace of Utatlan was said to have been 728 steps long and 376
steps wide. If we now recall these astonishing numbers in the light of
the ruins of Utatlan, we can hardly keep from smiling, for the habitable
surface of the real table-land of Utatlan is not quite 100 meters long,
and would, therefore, at best not be able to contain an edifice of dimen-
sions like the above mentioned. In order to be quite certain about this
question, I measured the plateau by walking along the edges, when I
visited the ruins in August, 1894, with my brother Richard, but I had
not the time necessary to measure the buildings also. We agreed,
however upon the fact that the principal court of the so-called palacio
is only 100 yards long and 60 yards wide, and that the disposition of
the surrounding buildings is almost identical with that of the so-called
Resguardo. (I have inserted in the plan of the site (fig. 10) the place
of the most important buildings from memory, because I subsequently
saw that the plan in Stephens’s Incidents in Travel, page 235, gives an
erroneous impression.) These ruins have, moreover, since Stephens
and Catherwood visited them, suffered much from dilapidation, mainly
by the tault of diggers for treasures, who foolishly turned the whole
plateau upside down.

It might, to be sure, be assumed that the table-land of Utatlan con-
tained only the palace of the ruler with the accessory buildings and the
temples, while the rest of the city might have covered the surrounding
plain. In fact, there are at some distance from Utatlan a few tumuli
rising in the plain which might be considered detached forts, built to
protect the parts of the town in which the poorer people lived. But the
Spanish writers say nothing of such an outer town, and the surface of
Utatlan is no smaller than that of many other Indian fortified places
like Saculeu, Comitancillo, [ximché, and others.

The nature of old Indian centers of population differed, of course,
according as the settlement was made principally for defense or for the
performance of religious worship, or merely for the maintenance of a
king or a prince. In the table-lands of Guatemala-and Chiapas, where
a number of warlike peoples and independent hostile tribes of one and
the same nation dwelt in close proximity to each other, the fortified
character of their buildings naturally prevails, and they usually con-
tained also the palaces of their rulers, and the temples of the deities.’
Nature here offered in abrupt eminences, which were entirely or par-
tially severed from the adjoining table-land by deep ravines, or on
mountains with a level plain on their summit, places that could easily
be defended and were really used for that purpose by the Indians. In
pie towns here, where nature had limited the space, the builders

saw themselves compelled to crowd the structures as much as could be
done, and this closely compressed disposition is hence characteristic of
the ground plans of towns on the table-land of Chiapas and Guatemala.

As an example, I may here mention the well-known ruins of Tonina
(that is, stone house), of which, however, I have only drawn the upper
part (fig. 8a). The mass of the ruins lies upon a narrow ridge of hills,
which in the direction of Tonina Creek, terminates the principal build-
ings (Shown in fig. 8a) at the eastern end of the same. Already,
below in the plain, considerable artificial hills are found. Then we
ascend four distinct terraces, also quite high and artificially produced,
the second of which is tolerably wide and bears some cross tumuli; and
thus we reach at last the fifth, with the palacio (stone house E), which
since Stephens’s visit has evidently suffered much. Higher up still
stand the two great pyramids. All the buildings are closely crowded
to save space and evidently mainly intended for defense.

In Yucatan, however, where the supply of water was always a seri-
ous question, and where nature, moreover, had not provided such easily
defensive localities, the principal buildings are much more freely seat-
tered about, and some of them might have served for defense. But the
whole arrangement is such and the decoration of the outer walls so pro-
fuse, that these towns must rather be looked upon as places of residence
for their princes and high priests than as fortified places. It is true
that I know only a very few such settlements in Yucatan, but if I may
judge from Charnay’s statements and from the still unpublished plans,
drawings, and photographs of Mr. Tompson, in Merida, a like scattered
disposition seems to prevail elsewhere as well as in Uxmal or Tzibinoeae.

The southernmost Maya buildings, that is to say, the town ruins in
Peten, like S. Clemente, and especially grandiose Ticul, show, on the
other hand, clearly that they were intended for fortifications. The
crowded position, the variety of isolated buildings, and the arrange-
ment of many around a court, each one of which formed a new center
for defense, prove this beyond all doubt. In spite of Mr. Maudslay’s
careful researches, we have as yet no really complete account of Ticul,
and I was unfortunately unable to trace the ground plan of these grand
old town ruins, which are slumbering here in the shade of primitive
forests. I can only say that here may be seen a whole series of easily
defensible courtyards, which in part lie in the form of terraces one
above the other, while in the vicinity of the principal court, surrounded
by magnificent buildings of stone, a number of steep, defiant pyramids
arise, each bearing a grand stone building on the summit.

Much simpler and less important, and on that account also much
more easily understood, are the ruins of S. Clemente (fig. 9), which
had long remained unknown, concealed as they were in the forest,
although they were within 200 yards of the riding path from Peten to
Belize. The ruins cover a somewhat long hill, over which the buildings
were so scattered that they formed a number of courtyards or squares,

542 INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

almost everyone of which might have been most easily defended by
itself. The courts B and C are on the same level, while the square
marked A is one story higher, and the square D, separated from A by
a narrow ravine, lies perhaps 4 meters higher. The stone houses I and
IJ show on the outside only a smooth wall, at the foot of which begins
a sheer precipice. The rooms in I and II are accessible from it, but
the stone house III has its doors of entrance on the south side, now
sadly in ruins, from whence they can easily be reached across a steep
parapet. The upper plateau of III continues eastward at the same
height, so that the continuation (II1a) viewed from B looks two-storied,
until, at the end of the edifice, it becomes once more one-storied. A
narrow passage leads from the southwestern corner of B through Illa
to C. The western termination of B is formed by a wall, which rises
as high as the square A; the eastern and northern ends consist simply
of stone walls, and in the same way the eastern and western termina-
tions of C and EH. The walls 4 and 5 are built of cut stone and 3 to 4
meters high. On top of the rampart 9 a small much-decayed stone
house is standing. Between C and D two tall, strongly-built stone
houses are seen, each of which contains but a single room, open to the
north, upon high artificially modified eminences. What is very remark-
able is that at the foot of the hill, looking toward the northwest, a
round hole has been found, barely large enough to let a man pass
through. This leads to a subterranean story below, which I, however,
did not dare to examine, as I had neither a rope nor sufficient light.

In the former Chol territory also similar connections of houses seem
to exist, built in the shape of terraces side by side (e. g., Las Quebra-
das). Copan, also, otherwise in its disposition perhaps the most
remarkable creation of Indian architecture, shows certain features of
the same system.

The ruins in southern Yucatan are inferior in extent to those of the
Maya territory. They often display the clearly pronounced character
of fortifications, walled-in courtyards on high hills (as in Ixtinta, fig. 2)
or extensive stone walls, or buildings on high passes, aS upon the
height of Caca de Xkanja, which may have served for the defenses, but
may also have been used by travelers for the offering of prayers and of
sacrifices (fig. 3). At all events, the type of fortified places is less pro-
nounced here than in Peten. The buildings are less crowded, and the
houses, built of stone, show much more careful, almost artistic, treat-
ment of the outer walls. On the other hand, the structures are still
not quite as much seattered as in the towns of northern Yucatan, and
they lack the ornamental sculptures of the latter, so that the ruins of
southern Yucatan occupy an intermediate position between the edifices
of northern Yucatan and those of Peten.

In like manner we find in Menché Tenamit certain features which
connect Tical with Palenque, and Tonind recalls in its buildings the
towns of the lowlands, but follows in the arrangement entirely the habits

of the tribes on the highlands. There can be no doubt that the cul-
ture of a nation in northern Central America has always had its
influence on the neighboring tribes, and thus we notice frequently,
especially in frontier districts, features which remind us of the puculi-
arities of the architecture of adjoining districts. The isolated western
court of Chama presents very clearly the type of Verapaz, while the
eastern buildings remind us more of the Chol buildings, and thus also
the ruins of Pueblo Viejo, whilst the nearly adjoining ruins of Chacujal,
which probably once formed part of the whole, are entirely original.

In Verap.z we know only of small ruins of edifices, which in their
simplicity contrast strikingly with the more complicated disposition of
buildings in the settlements of both the lowland and the highland dis-
tricts, although they share with them the fundamental typeof a court-
yard walled in all around or only in part, within which ordinarily small
terraced pyramids have been standing. Wealso know of fortifications
attempted in Verapaz, such as walls closing a narrow pass (at Las
Pacayas), or mountain summits fortified or rendered inaccessible by
piled-up masses of stone, e. g. Yaltenamit. As I have not examined
the few remains of settlements which I know near Elbarrizal and Gua-
temala, I am not able to state whether the ruins within the Pokomam
territory bear the Verapaz imprint or the character of the highlands.

Old Indian establishments for purposes of worship have been com-
paratively rare(e. g., Kalamté) and they also (as, for instance, Sajacabaja,
Copan) were at the same time arranged for defenses, as of course the
temple buildings with their walled-in courtyards and their terraced
pyramids furnished groups of buildings that could easily be defended.
Palenque I consider, with Charnay, a city for priesteraft and higher
culture, also Quirigua and the ruins on the Rio de la Pasion, where F.
Artes in 1892, commissioned by the Guatemalan Government, obtained
photographs of the monoliths and exhibited them at the Chicago
Exposition.

A survey of the ruins within the Maya territory, as far as they are
known to us, convince us that everywhere the fundamental type of
inclosed courtyards reappears. In the highlands of Chiapas and
Guatemala the disposition of the buildings is compact, since the build-
ings bore mainly the character of fortifications, and on that account
localities were chosen which were naturally already confined, such as
ravines, sudden precipices, etc. In Peten also the buildings are much
crowded, evidently on account of warlike events which then occurred,
although on the whole the settlements in the lowlands are more open
and without any signs of defensive works in the foreground.

In all Maya ruins the buildings are, if not uniformly, at least very
generally, built so-as to face a certain direction; among the lowland
tribes, toward the cardinal points. In the Verapaz tribes and among
the Quichés, Tzutuhiles, Uspantecos, Aguacatecos, and other high-
land tribes (the Tzendal group, Mame group, and Cakchiquel), the
544 INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

buildings face more generally in intermediate directions, but always in
such a manner that within each town one certain direction prevailed.

In eastern Chiapas I have seen at Mazapa and Motozintla certain
ruins which differ from the Maya type. although the people there now
speak Maya languages. Besides other peculiarities, the absence of
clearly defined courts must be noticed and the long drawn out charac-
ter of the general plan (see fig. 11). Quite near by, at Chimalapal, I
saw from a distance old Indian settlements, with clearly defined courts
of the Maya type, facing the cardinal points (fig. 13).

In the Chiapas territory no such clearly defined courts as the Mayas
have can be found. The courts, if at all existing, are not completely
walled in, the buildings do not seem to face any one direction decidedly,
but to be scattered about without any rule. The choice of locality,
however, and walls evidently built for defensive purposes, show clearly
that the builders intended to give to the whole the character of
fortifications.

In western and southern Chiapas, in Soconuseo and southern Guate-
mala, I found but few old Indian settlements, and those I did see were
so completely ruined that I was not able to discern any striking
peculiarities.

In the territory of the northern Pipiles, in the upper Motagua Val-
ley, and in lower Verapaz, I have frequently seen traces of old Indian
settlements, but they were almost completely effaced and beyond rec-
ognition. The ruins near 8. Agustin Acasaguastlan are long stretched
out, resting in one direction on a mountain slope, somewhat like the
ruins of Mazapa. They show terraces and half courts and always face
the cardinal points.

2. SINGLE BUILDINGS AND GROUPS OF BUILDINGS.

I have above called attention to the fact that the Indians of northern
Central America lived in the days before Columbus in straw huts, as
they do now, and there is no reason to assume that they have changed
since in the construction of their houses. There existed, therefore, in
those days the same difference in building among the various tribes
and groups of tribes as I have been able to see in the present time and
to describe elsewhere.’

For the larger buildings, however, and especially for the substruc-
ture, other materials were employed which promised greater durability.
Where civilization was still lagging behind, walls of earth and of stone
had to suffice, or terraced pyramids were erected of the same material,
and probably bore on the summit wooden structures adapted to the
desired purpose.

The most primitive shape of these walls were probably simple walls

of earth which, as refinement increased, were incased in a covering of
stone. Frequently, however, the whole wall was built of stone, and

-even the terraced pyramids consisted only of a kernel of earth, some-
times containing stone chambers within, while a covering of stone on
the outside gave to the building a suitable outward form and durability.
This is the point of development where the majority of the buildings
of Chiapas, southern Guatemala, and Verapaz remained stationary,
and even among the Maya tribes, who are so much further advanced,
similar structures are still met with. At this time the stones that form
the outer case were either not cut at all or only roughly; really well-
cut stone is very rarely met with in such structures. This depended,
naturally, very largely on the nature of the stone found in these dis-
tricts. In Alta Verapaz and parts of central Chiapas the material is
an easily split dolomite or limestone; in the Chiapas and Motozintla
districts granite prevails; in the districts of the Tzotzil and the
southern Pipiles other eruptive stones of more recent origin, which
the Indians with their extremely imperfect tools must have found very
hard to cut. The same difficulty no doubt also accounts for the fact
that we find in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas compara-
tively few sculptures in stone, and that wherever any are found the
nature of the material on hand has been specially favorable. Andesite,
of recent origin or disunited, has frequently been used for the purpose,
more rarely sandstone or even limestone; for small articles sometimes
argillaceous schist, but never dolomite. In proportion as the available
stone material was less fit for building and sculpture the love of
ceramics increased, and, to mention but one example, the Indians
of Alta Verapaz remained far behind their neighbors in all that con-
cerned architecture; but, on the other hand, they furnished pottery of
such admirable good taste and true artistic skill that they do not seem
to have been surpassed by any of the Maya tribes. This would lead
to the conclusion that architecture is not a standard by which we can
measure the culture possessed by a people, because the absence of
suitable material may easily interfere with their development and force
their artistic predilections into other channels. Nor must it be for-

* gotten that architecture is fostered and improved in proportion as it is
favored by a nation politically and financially powerful. This seems
to have been much less the case in Alta Verapaz than in Yucatan or in
the highlands of Guatemala.

Edifices consisting merely of earth and of stone, simply piled one
upon the other, are generally found in a lamentable condition, and it
is but rarely possible to trace the outlines of such buildings accurately.
The same difficulty applies to the nature of the steps which are almost
always found on pyramids, and frequently on ramparts. As far as my
researches go, the ground plan is generally square, rarely (by cutting off
the corners) of five or more sides, but in spite of these variations, in the

_ upper part of the buildings, square once more. Round foundations

I have never been able to trace with any certainty; a careful inves-
tigation led me in almost every case, even in apparently round or
rounded-off structures, to trace the originally rectangular lines. The
steps in the Maya buildings seem always to have been produced by an
alteration of horizontal with perpendicular or nearly perpendicular
planes; they are at the same time usually of the same height and
depth. A very striking difference appears, however, in the structures
of the Chiapas and Motozintla tribes, as they ascend sideways and
leave only a smail space horizontally open (fig. 11a). It is possible that
this peculiarity betrays a certain dependence on the building material,
as the rolling, rounded-off bowlders of granite which abound in that
region can not very easily be piled up perpendicularly, and henee the
building would acquire greater durability by steps ascending in a side
wise direction. However this may be, the fact is that the method of
building here differs essentially, and I feel justified in concluding from
it that the districts of Motozintla and Mazapa, where now Maya idioms
are in use, were formerly inhabited by a race of foreign origin. What
race of men this may have been I can not even guess; I only believe
that they could not even have been Chiapas, partly because the build-
ings in the Motozintla district seem to be more carefully arranged than
among the Chiapas and partly because in front of several tumuli in
Masapa and Motozintla (fig. 2, A, B, and C) carefully wrought pave-
ments of flat granite tiles may be seen, such as I have until now never
met with in the Chiapas district.

When we meet with perpendicular or nearly perpendicular walls of
cut stone we may assume that this indicates a higher style of architec-
ture, even though these walls may be erected without the aid of mor-
tar. Such buildings are met with here and there, asin S. Agustin
Acasaguastlan, frequently also in towns, where already stone houses
are found standing, e. g., the stone tumuli 4 and 5 in the court C of the
ruins of S. Clemente (fig. 9). The most remarkable of such edifices
are those of Chacujal (Alta Verapaz), where primitive argillaceous
slate, carefully carved on the outside, has been employed without any
kind of cement for the purpose of raising perpendicular or very steep
walls, and which bear on the upper platform a kind of parapet. The
inner kernel of these walls consists of rounded-off river shingles. I
have never found this same method of building anywhere else.

Still greater progress in architecture is seen in those structures on
the high table-land of Guatemala, in which the stones forming the walls
are held together by an abundant use of mortar. Mortar is, by the
way, also found elsewhere (e. g., in Alta Verapaz), but not to such an
extent that its use should have essentially influenced architecture.
Even in Iximehé, mortar seems to have been but of secondary impor-
tance. In Kalamté and Comitancillo, in Utatlan and Saculeu, how-
ever, many edifices consist simply of walls, and in order to secure steps
these walls were erected perpendicularly; but where higher walls had

to be raised without steps they were erected with a steep inclination,
and separate staircases led up to the platforms. And it was the same
with terraced pyramids that had especially high steps. A casing of
smooth mortar formed the outer covering of these walls. Similar appli-
cations of liquid mortar formed the floor of the more important places
and of the platforms of tumuli. In Utatlan, even now and in spite of
the general destruction of the buildings, traces may be seen of paint-
ings on the walls, and on some of the platforms the evidently griev-
ously injured casing of mortar has been covered by a second and even

a third application.

In the highlands of Chiapas, these last-mentioned architectural forms
seem to be wanting, and the tribes of the Mam and the Quiché family
appear therefore to be in some way technically opposed to the Tzendal
group. Yet the highland tribes of Guatemala and Chiapas show not
only in the manner of laying out their towns, but also in the erection
of any definite temples, a surprising unifornity. We speak of a
temple building consisting of two main structures which are alike, lie
parallel to each other, and display on the side that faces the other a
small, low terrace resembling a trottoir. Between these two -<ifices
the temple court appears, deeply sunk, but spreading out wider beyond
the two main buildings and almost altogether walied in, so that the
shape of the court assumes a resemblance to a large letter H or |.
From El Sacramento in Chiapas to Sajacabaja and Kalamteé these
H-shaped temple courts reappear with the same ground plan, but yet
each one has its somewhat modified form. LIinsert a few slight sketches
of such courts (figs. 12 and 10a).

Itis very remarkable that in Iximché this kind of temple building
is altogether wanting, or at least there are hardly any traces of such
fundamental ideas to be discovered there, and yet the Cakchiquel
have displayed in their architecture, which they have developed with
great originality, no small correspondence with the same art among
their neighbors. Thus we find in Iximché a rectangular, lengthy
tumulus (“A” in Briihl’s Plan of Iximecheé, Globus, vol. 66), the platform
of which is walled all around, and this shows a courtyard which,
relatively to the edges of the tumulus, is sunk deeply. The same
manner of building I found twice in Sajacabaja and once in Saculeu,
though here not quite according to the type.

It may be presumed that on all the edifices which have so far been
discussed, unless they were intended to serve exclusively for defense,
wooden huts must have been standing on the uppermost platforms,
which either contained the images of their idols or may have served as
reception rooms or residences for eminent personages. Among the
lowland tribes of the Maya family, however, architecture has taken
a Step further in advance by substituting for these mere wooden build-
ings structures of stone with durable and habitable inner rooms. The
fact that in Yucatan, northeast Chiapas, and in Peten well-stratified,

asad

level limestone appears, has evidently caused and favored this improve-
ment, as the appearance of finely grained limestone, resembling the
slate of Solenhofen at Palenque and Menché Tenamit, must have caused
the flourishing industry of relievo painting in that district. In the
Chorti territory, where, near Copan, an easily worked building material
appears in abundance (a decomposed, eruptive stone), architecture has
progressed in a very peculiar manner, but the stone houses, while other-
wise apparently of the same construction, appear less large and impos-
ing than in the more northern districts. In the low plains of Tabasco
(Comalealco) the Indians (Chontal) have erected stone houses by the
help of an artificially produced building material (bricks), beyond
doubt in imitation of the stone houses of their eastern and northeastern
neighbors.

Stone houses, so far as is now known, have not been built by any
but the lowland Maya family in North Central America—that is, by the
Mayas and the tribes of the Chol group (Choles, Chontales, and Chor-
ties). These are the same tribes which even now differ from the other
Maya people by certain peculiarities in their house architecture
(advanced walls). Such stone structures as the Mam and the Quiché
tribes possess are here entirely wanting, as are also the temple courts
resembling the letter H.

In the territory of the Chontales only the ruins of Comalealco, and
in that of the Chorties, only those of Copan are known tolerably well.
As I do not know the former from personal knowledge, and during my
visit to the latter (January, 1894) only found a beginning made of a_
more careful examination, I can add nothing new to what has been
stated before. I limit myself, therefore, in the remarks that follow to
the observations which I made in the Chol territory in Peten and
Yucatan.

The ground plan of almost all stone houses is rectangular, and
wherever wings or other additions appear they also are rectangularly
added to the main building. In Yucatan I saw several rounded-off
edges on tower-like side wings (Ixtinta, Tzibinocac), and I thought it
remarkable that these exceptions from the general rule should occur
there alone, where the dwelling houses of the Indians uniformly show
rounded-off ground plans.

These stone houses are in their simplest form narrow buildings with
but one inner apartment, to which access is had from the side of a
passage (e. g. the stone houses V, Vi, and VII inS. Clemente). Where
the buildings show any progress, the one inner room appears sub-
divided by niches, passages, and additions, and is approached by
several doors of entrance on one side (fig. 5a, the principal temple of
Menché Tenamit), or several separate rooms are found in the same
stone house, connected with each other, but each having its own means
of entrance from without—e. g. the stone houses I, II, and III in 8.

find two or three rows of rooms, one behind the other, which are con-
nected with each other and have exits, on one or the other of their
longer sides (fig. 7). It is not my intention here to pursue the almost
boundless variety of plans of stone houses at the various places of
ruins; I only mention here that where architecture has progressed still
further, side wings are found—added to the main building (barely indi-
cated in fig. 7, Ticul, more clearly in the stone houses of Tzibinocac,
fig. 4, and Ixtinta, fig. 1), or the building incloses a court partly (Ticul,
fig. 6) or entirely (Palenque, Uxmal). In Palenque the front wall is
sometimes reduced to a number of pillars by the frequency, the height
and width of the door openings, so as to change the wide, outer room
in its great length into a kind of well-lighted portico.

The stone houses of Tonina,'’ the only ones known to exist in the
territory of the Highland tribes, are, as far as the ground plan is con-
cerned, most nearly related to the structures at Palenque.

The outer walls of the stone houses rise either perpendicularly or
they are steeply inclined, parts occasionally extend even beyond the
foot of the walls. On the whole, however, the horizontal section through
the building diminishes in proportion as itis made at a greater height—
that is, the building grows smaller from below upward. The outer
walls are partly shaped by a smooth layer of mortar (so usual at Peten),
partly adorned with stucco (Menché Tenamit, a few houses in Ticul),
partly ornamented with separate tablets, showing images or hiero-
glyphics (Palenque), or cased with a smooth covering of stone (South
Yueatan), which in North Yucatan is adorned with sculptures. ‘The
substance of these buildings inside the casing consists, where no well-
Stratified calcareous schists are found, of bowlders and an abundance of
mortar.

All around the edifice continuous cornices are seen, which produce
the appearance of a building of several stories, as they occur at almost
equal distances, one above the other. This impression is aided by
the fact that the external divisions of the outside occur exactly at the
place where the cornices appear. Thus one meets with buildings of one
or four stories, though ordinarily they are only of two or three stories.
Sometimes, again, cel'tain parts of astone house are higher than others,
and when in this way (asin the stone houses of Ixtinta and Tzibanocac)
the main body and the wings seem to be of different height, such
structures gain a certain variety of forms which is pleasantly felt in
contrast with the general uniformity of all Maya buildings.

The inner rooms of stone houses are small and rather badly lighted,
Since no daylight enters except through the door openings. Only
rarely little low windows are found, which are pierced through the

1In Kalamté I saw the scanty remains of asmall stone house, the thin walls of
which, however, caused the presumption that these could not have supported a
massive upper story, such asis characteristic of Maya buildings. Itseems, therefore,
to have been a different kind of construction.
550 INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

outer walls, if they do not contain several inner rooms of the same
house (Ticul, fig. 6). The upper closing of a room is brought about
by the gradual approach of the longitudinal walls, till they are near
enough to each other to allow the space between to be closed by a few
flat, stone tiles. This reduction of space is produced by overreaching
stones, each upper row protruding over the one below. The edges thus
produced are smoothed over with mortar (e. g., in Tonina fig. 8b) or they
are entirely concealed. Where more careful work was required, the
stones were cut obliquely, so that when laid one upon the other they
would show a straight-lined reduction (fig. 7b, in Ticul), and in Uxmal
may actually be seen, in a few cases at least, a few slightly curved lines
of reduction, convex or concave. Between the two walls which are
thus treated to lead to a closing above there are commonly found some
cross pieces of wood, generally zapote wood, which were meant to
increase the durability of the structure, and perhaps in dwelling
rooms, to suspend hammocks. Above the door openings, which are
simply covered flat at the top, without any effort to approach the
sides, strong cross beams, mostly of zapote wood, serve as supports;
in Palenque and Menché Tenamit huge slabs of stone. Where the
inner rooms are long and narrow, only the long sides are shortened;
on the two short sides the walls go up straight and unreduced; but if
the four sides do not differ much (as in Tonina), all are shortened in the
above-mentioned way. In small and narrow passages the closing is
brought about by horizontal slabs of stone. In Tonina a peculiar way
of forming a ceiling is noticed as shown in fig. 8b.

The inner rooms of a stone house are generally of the same height.
Staircases in the interior of houses, I have never seen—excepting the
famous tower of Palenque—unless it be in the tower-like raised side
wings of Ixtinta, where they only lead on the outside to the upper plat-
form.'

The inner rooms of Maya stone houses are, as a rule, lacking in orna-
ments; only rarely wall paintings are seen (as in Chichenitza, Tonina,
Tzibinocac), or stucco ornamentations (Tonina), or in separate niches
relievo tablets and hieroglyphies (Palenque), or statues (Menché Tena-
mit). Most structures of this kind show their principal ornamentation
on the outside. The outside of stone houses in North Yucatan are
specially rich in sculpture adornments; and here the contrast of the
architectural style with that of Mitla in Oaxaca (the Zapotec district)
is most startling, for the above-mentioned edifices, whicli also differ
fundamentally from the Maya buildings in the construction of their
roots and in the introduction of round pillars of stone have their prin-
cipal adornment in the interior, while the external walls are left com-
paratively plain and unadorned. This great simplicity of the small
inner rooms in a building which is on the outside almost too richly
adorned, as is the case in the Casa del Gobernador at Uximal, makes a

very peculiar impression upon the beholder and reminds him involun-
tarily of the narrowness of views which seems to be a universal weak-
ness of the Maya family, who otherwise possess so many most attract-
ive characteristics.

Besides the stone houses, several towns of Yucatan and Peten possess
still another remarkable type of edifice—steep stone pyramids, which on
their uppermost platform bear a somewhat long stone house.' I have
seen these structures only in Uxmal and Ticul, and the four stone pyr-
amids at the last-mentioned place were so entirely overgrown with
forest trees and dense shrubbery that I could not obtain a clear view,”
although I climbed up to the top of one with great trouble. The stone
pyramid of Uxmal rises in two unequal terraces, over which a compara-
tively low, perpendicular terrace leads to the upper platform which
bears the stone house. In the middle of one of the long sides (from
the east) a very steep staircase with nearly one hundred steps leads to
the platform. This kind of pyramid seems to be peculiar to the Mayas
(in Yucatan and Peten) and to Copan, for in the territory of the Chol and
the Chorti we find only the ordinary terraced pyramid, with perpendic-
ularly ascending steps of equal height and depth. The same applies
to the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, where it is true the steps
occasionally seem to lose their original purpose and to assume gigantic
dimensions (1 to 2 meters in height and depth), as in Saculeu and
Tonina. In the two great pyramids of Tonina we notice, from the
bottom to the uppermost small platform, six to eight lofty steps. These
steps, however, being so very high, do not ascend perpendicularly (as
at Saculeu), but at a great inclined angle. That Catherwood’s Recon-
struction of the Pyramids, in Stephens’s Incidents of Travel (p. 384), is
incorrect, is best seen from the northwest, where both show their best
preserved side. I am sure I do not wish to blame Catherwood, but
only to point out the great difficulties which arise at every such attempt
at reconstruction. It is extremely difficult to form by means of decay-
ing ruins a picture of former proportions, and often a mere glance from
an accidentally chosen but favorable standpoint gives a clearer sight
than a long study of the ruins themselves. To this must be added
that the generally poor state of preservation of all such ruins has led
almost everyone to add to this sketch or ground plan a number of
reconstructions; my own very trifling sketches must not-be considered
final in any way. I shall be well content if I should have succeeded
in giving my reader a tolerably correct idea of the old Indian structures
in North Central America and of their great variety. An exhaustive
description of old Central American architectures, which should enter
into all details and state their peculiar manner of forming settlements,
must needs be preserved for future generations, and I shall be satisfied
if I may state here the conclusions which the available material has
enabled me to form.

3. COMPREHENSIVE REMARKS AND CCNCLUSIONS.

The old Indian edifices of northern Central America display in various
parts of this territory an unusually great variety both as regards the
disposition and the construction of the single buildings. Upon closer
investigation we find, however, that the structures of special districts
show certain peculiarities which are common to all of them, but are
not found in the structures of adjoining districts. These common pecul-
iarities, however, apply only to general features, whilst we never meet
with slavish imitation of a definite style of architecture. On the con-
trary, even within the boundary lines of a certain style there exists
still an almost indefinite variety of disposition and outward formation
among the Central American Indians. As the edifices in the neighbor-
hood of a style of building often already show hints suggested by the
peculiarities of a neighboring style, we may conclude from this that
the Indians maintained among themselves a lively intercourse and pos-
sessed a great capacity for acquiring knowledge and taste from their
neighbors. Everywhere we find the fundamental idea of walls and
terraced pyramids, but in their erection many varieties of style at once
appear. Unfortunately, I must here limit myself to the structures on
the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and to those of Kast Guate-
mala, Peten, Tabasco, and Yucatan. Within this district I think I may
define the following styles of architecture:

I. The steps of the pyramids and walls are ascending. The build-
ings are not distinctly grouped around courtyards (squares).

1. Chiapas style: The buildings of a settlement are rather irregularly
arranged.

2. Motozintla style: The buildings of a settlement show a tendency
to face a certain direction. In front of many tumuli tile pavements are
mace.

Il. The steps of the pyramids and walks are perpendicularly ascend-
ing. The buildings of a settlement face any one decided direction.
The larger settlements show a part of their buildings arranged entirely
or in part around an inclosed courtyard or square.

ARCHITECTURAL STYLES OF THE MAYA PEOPLE.

A. Varapaz style-—The settlements are mostly small. The buildings
face the four cardinal points. Mortar was but imperfectly used. In
Chacujal stone buildings with perpendicular walls, parapets on the
platform.

B. Architectural styles of the highland tribes.—The settlements show
a crowded disposition of their buildings. In the whole district temple
courts shaped like H make their appearance.

(a) No mortar is used in the buildings.

1. Tzenal style: The buildings of a settlement are not arranged so
as to face the cardinal points, but preferably intermediate directions.
INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. 553

(b) In many buildings mortar is used in erecting stone houses.
2. Mame style: The buildings of a settlement are generally made to
face intermediate directions.

3. Quiché style: The buildings of a settlement face the cardinal
points.

C. Architectural styles of the lowiand tribes —In many buildings stone
walls, cemented with mortar, are found. Stone houses with habitable
inner rooms. The buildings mostly face the cardinal points.

1. Maya style: At times steep pyramids. The door beams made of
zapote wood.

la. Peten type: The buildings of a settlement are closely crowded.
Formation of many courts (Squares). Character of fortification. The
walls show a casing of mortar. Mostly unadorned houses.

1b. Type of South Yucatan: Transition type. The arrangement of
buildings is less crowded. The walls of the stone houses are often
ineased in stone, carefully cut, but simple.

le. Type of North Yucatan: The arrangement of the buildings is
rather a scattered one. The outer walls of the stone houses are often
richly adorned with sculptures.

2. Chol style: The door openings are generally closed above with
level slabs of stone. The ornamentation of stone houses consists in
stucco ornaments or in tablets containing images or hieroglyphies.

3. Chortistyle: Very peculiar development of the pyramidical strue-
ture and of courts (squares). In Copan a steep pyramid.

The stone houses of Tonina belong to the Chol style, while the other
edifices and the general arrangement follow the Tzenal style. The
ruins are now situated in the land of the Tzenal people, but not very
far from the line, since the nearest Lacandon and Chol settlements are
hardly 30 or 40 kilometers distant, and it can not be absolutely asserted
that Tonina may not originally have been a Tonina or a Chol settlement.
However this may be, Tonina has always shown a mixed style, at all
events borrowing from a neighboring style, so that I do not feel justi
fied, by the occurrence of a single instance, to attribute the existence
of stone houses to the Tzenal style.

The Indian edifices of northern Central America very frequently
show a striking want of symmetry. The very simplest buildings, to be
sure, are almost always symmetrical, because in their very great sim-
plicity there was no scope for unsymmetrical arrangement. But the
more varied single buildings and central structures, like great temples,
show almost always an unequal development on the two sides from a
middle line, and although the gradual development of architectural art
led step by step to a better observance of symmetry, it is nevertheless
curious to observe how, after all, only the very best edifices of Yucatan
and Palenque ever attained unto fullsymmetry. It is true that fre-
quently only mere trifles display a want of this kind, but on examining
a building of this kind, or even a ground plan, we always feel as if this
554 INDIAN SETTLEMENTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA,

unsymmetrical arrangement were not so much the result of negligence
as of aset purpose. And how capriciously even the inner rooms of the
stone houses may be differently adorned on both sides of the entrance
can be seen in the plan of a room in Tical (fig. 15). Hven the richly
ornamented inner room of the principal temple of Menché displays in
the different positions of the entrances relatively to the most external
side apartments constant neglect of symmetry.

(42) In this connection it may be noticed that the Indians of the Maya
family showed the same tendency to an unsymmetrical cultivation of
development of the individual members in their musical melodies
also.!

(13) These side apartments seem to have been used by the Lacondons
mainly for their sacrifices, since it was in these rooms that I feund, in
1891, most of their sacrificial vessels made of clay.

Ail the tribes which belong to the Maya family” have certain pecu-
liarities in their manner of building, and it is of the utmost impor-
tance that within the territory they at present occupy, and according
to the limits of the knowledge which we at present possess, no buildings
are known to us which betray a foreign style, except only the few at
Motozintla, of which [ have spoken above. This would justify the same
conclusion which I also reached in studying the local names—that the
Maya tribes have for a long time already occupied their present homes
in northern Central America.

A comparison of the architectural features which all the Maya tribes
have in common suggests also a certain conclusion as to the degree to
which their architectural skill had raised among them before the tribe
separated. ‘This is a very low degree—walls and terraced pyramids of
moderate size, facing a fixed direction, and frequently grouped around
a court or square.

It appears, however, as if the lowland tribes had already parted with
the primitive Maya people at a time when the Verapaz tribes (the Poco-
man group) were still in close contact with the highland tribes, since
their straw huts (dwelling houses) are in their construction perfectly
identical, while the lowland tribes differ in having an advanced wall.
At the same time the Chol and Chorti Indians, dwelling near by, still
adhere to the rectangular ground plan of the highland huts, while
Chontals and Mayas abandon this type in favor of rounded-off ground
plans.

While the Verapaz tribes thus remained on a lower grade of archi-
tecture, the tribes of the highlands and the lowlands both developed
the art in their own peculiar manner. Among the highland tribes,
the Quiché and Mam group made great progress in architecture,

‘Compare the New Journal for Music, year XI (1895), Nos. 7 and 8, and year XIII
(1892), Nos. 22 and 23.

*J have, anfortunately, here to omit the Huastecs, since I have no information as
to their buildings.
| ie

which the Tzenal group, however, did not share, while the lowland
tribes, each in its most original manner, attained high success in the
same art, no doubt largely assisted by the favorable stone material
which they found at hand. In like manner the peculiar qualities of the
outcropping stone no doubt Jed in the Chol territory to making relievo
works, in the Chorti territory to monolithic sculpture, and in northern
Yueatan to a sculptural adornment of their houses.

A very long time must, of course, have elapsed between the time
when simple buildings were raised by the primitive Maya family and
the days when the beautifully developed architecture of temples in
Sajacabaja of original Copan pyramids, of excessively adorned stone
houses in Yucatan, of defiant Ticul structures, and of harmoniously
composed and ornamented edifices in Palenque began to show itself.
Hence, we assume with certainty that each one of the Maya tribes here
mentioned may have occupied their present homes for a more or less
extended period of time, and that their architecture was developed
only within this time. The influence of the surrounding stone material
on this architecture may here and there become perceptible, and the
locally limited origin, as well as the locally varying development of
this architecture, will clearly show that any influence of Asiatie styles
of architecture is absoiutely excluded. It is true that so far the study
of the architectural ruins has given no clew to the original home and to
possible former migrations of the Maya family. [| can, therefore, here
only express the wish and the hope that future and more extensive
studies, made on a broader basis, may succeed in establishing the views
here suggested more firmly in determining the exchange of culture by
comparing the architecture of neighboring races, and in thus providing
a Safe basis for prehistoric research.

PRELIMINARY ACCOUNT OF AN EXPEDITION TO THE
CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY, AND
THE TUSAYAN RUINS OF SIKYATKI AND AWATOBI,
ARIZONA, IN 1895.

By J. WALTER FEWKES.

I left Prescott, Ariz., on June 1, 1895, making my way with all possi-
ble dispatch to Old Camp Verde, and from there to the cavate dwellings,
opposite Squaw Peak, 8 miles south of the post. After an examination
of these troglodytic habitations, occupying a week’s time, I followed
the Rio Verde northward to one of its tributaries, Beaver Creek, exam-
ining Casa Montezuma, Montezuma Well, and neighboring ruins.
Crossing the divide to Oak Creek, another tributary of the Verde, near
Beaver Head, I camped near Schiirman’s ranch, where I remained a
few days studying house ruins, fortifications, and aboriginal irrigation
canals in that neighborhood.

Leaving all trodden roads at that point, my expedition penetrated
into the Red Rocks, where a few days less than three weeks were con-
sumed in exploration of that region. Later, I returned to Oak Creek,
made a detour around the Red Rocks, over the Mogollon escarpment
to Flagstaff, where I arrived on the last day of June.

Two days later I reoutfitted at Holbrook, Ariz., and camped at
Awatobi on July 5. Three weeks were spent at that ruin, but owing to
the defection of my Indian workmen, [ was reluctantly obliged to pre-
maturely suspend work there, and moved my camp to Sikyatki, where
ereat good fortune awaited me. On the 29th of August I was again at
Holbrook, where I disbanded my expedition at the close of the month.

I was accompanied by two paid men throughout the summer; one,
a cook and driver; the other, a photographer. Two additional men
were employed for a few days to assist in excavations at the ruins of
the Red Rocks.

My force of laborers at Awatobi numbered eight, and during the
excavations at Sikyatki fifteen, all Moki Indians, were employed.
While in my employ they lived at the expense of the expedition.

‘While the cost of this expedition was defrayed from the appropriation of the
Bureau of Ethnology of the Institution, this preliminary account seems to possess
such popular interest that it has been deemed desirable to give it early publication
here.

558 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

My force of laborers at Awatobi numbered eight, and during the
excavations at Sikyatki fifteen, all Moki Indians, were employed.
While in my employ they lived at the expense of the expedition.

I was joined at Sikyatki by Mr. I. W. Hodge, of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, who rendered most valuable aid, and by Mr.
James S. Judd, a volunteer, who contributed much to the suecess of the
expedition. Mr. G. P. Winship, whose translation of the Spanish text
of Castaneda’s account of Coronado’s expedition is about to be pub-
lished by the Bureau of Ethnology, was a guest of the expedition at
Sikyatki for two weeks.

The objects collected during the three months will increase the
Museum catalogue by 966 entries, of which nearly 500 represent speci-
meus of the finest pottery, fully two-thirds of which are decorated.

In addition to objects collected, the expedition took many photo-
graphs, made copious notes, and prepared a few ground plans, neces-
sarily rough, as material for an extended systematic report. The
following pages¢give a fair idea of the scope and character of the work
accomplished, but its significance in all its bearings can be adequately
presented only by an elaborated discussion of the subject.

SCOPE OF THE WORK.

The general plan of my field work in Arizona during the summer of
1895 was an examination of cliff dwellings and other ruins of the val-
ley of the Rio Verde and an archeological exploration of two ancient
ruins in the old province of Tusayan, the ancestral and present home
of the Moki Indians. The reason which determined my choice of the
Verde Valley ruins as a field of investigation was a wish to obtain
archeological data bearing on certain Tusayan traditions. A study of
the ritual and mythology of these people for several years had familiar-
ized me with a rich collection of folklore consisting of tales of cosmog-
ony, heroic stories of supernatural beings, and migration legends.
These stories, existing in many variants, are the sole histories which
the Mokis have, and are transmitted verbally from one generation to
another. They have come down to our day from a remote past, often-
times highly embellished, doubtless more or less modified in trans-
mission, but presenting the only material which is available, so far as
records are concerned, of their origin aid migrations previously to their
settlement in their present homes. The legends of cosmogony are
manifestly outside the realm of scientific verification, but migration
stories are evidently of much greater import to the student of arche-
ology. These stories are repeated, notwithstanding their variations,
with an exactness which is highly suggestive of truth in their general
character. The old story-tellers recount with detail the places where
their ancestors halted in their migrations, and declare that they built
homes or villages near certain springs, mountains, or in well-known
valleys, where, they declare, the visitor may still see the ruins. vi-

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK cCoUNTRY. 559

dently here we have an opportunity to test the legends by archeological
research.! We can visit the sites of villages claimed by the ancients
and find out if the evidence supports the legends of the present Mokis,
or whether the stories are true or false. The present article is therefore
a report on an attempt to apply archeological methods to the verifica-
tion of legendary histories, which was the main thought in mind when
J entered upon my explorations in Arizona.

The Tusayan villagers are divided into several phratries, each com-
posed of a number of gentes. One of these phratries is called the
Patki or Water House people, whose legends are very definite that
they came from the far south, which is called Palatkwabi, Red Land.
The situation of this mythic land is a matter of conjecture, but it was
thought that an examination of the country at or near the headwaters
of the Rio Verde and its tributaries west of south from the present
villages of Tusayan and due south of some of their ruined towns might
shed light on this tradition.

A complemental fragment of Pima folklore in southern Arizona con-
nects the numerous ruins of the Gila Valley, of which Casa Grande is
the best known, with the ancestors of the Tusayan Indians; and as the
tradition which has been mentioned declares that their ancestors came
from the far south, we have a correspondence in traditions which, to
say the least, is highly suggestive. That archeology might give valu-
able information on the theory of former connection of northern and
southern prehistoric peoples of Arizona had long been my conviction,
and was the main influence which led to the choice of this field for
exploration, of which this report is a preliminary record.

THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

An examination of a map of Arizona will show that one of the most
natural pathways or feasible routes of migration between the southern
Arizonian prehistoric peoples of the vicinity of Casa Grande and the
northern, north and south, would be along the valley of the Rio Verde.
Oak Creek, a tributary of this stream, rises in the neighborhood of
ruins whose inhabitants were ancestors of the Tusayan Indians, and
empties, through the Verde, into the Gila not far from the great ruins
which mark the center of the flourishing aboriginal population of
southern Arizona. Along the banks of this stream was a natural high-
way, which presents favorable conditions for migration. My problem
was to examine this roadway to see whether or not there are archo-
logical evidences of former habitations.

Exploration of the antiquities of this region had gone far enough to

1 As this paper is about to go to press (September, 1896), reports have been received
from Dr. Fewkes regarding his recent excavations at the prehistoric Moki puebio of
Homolobi, near Winslow, Ariz., which fully bear out his statement of nearly a year
previously and testify to the accuracy of the native traditions concerning the settle-
ment of the Moki at the place named prior to their occupancy of the present villages

560 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

prove that the banks of this river and the walls of neighboring mesas.
were formerly the sites of many and popvlous towns. From its june-
tion with the Gila to Montezuma Well, several miles north of Old Camp
Verde, there had been described a succession of ruins indicative of
former habitations. But Montezuma Well is a long distance from
any Tusayan ruin, and between it and the Moki country is situated the
rugged, untrodden Jand called the Red Rock country. There was, in
other words, a break here in the almost continuous series of ruins from
Tusayan as far south at least as the large forgotten towns of the Gila
Valley. At either extremity the chain of aboriginal dwelling places
was unbroken, but middle links were wanting.

All conditions imply former habitations among these untrodden fast-
nesses of the Red Rocks, and the existence of former villages had been
vaguely reported by ranchmen. So far as the evidence went, these
reports confirmed my suspicions, but no archeologist had examined
the ruins and their character was problematical. The color of the
rocks of this country, as implied in the name, fulfilled the Tusayan
legend of Palatkwabi, the Red Land, and it was situated directly
south of ancient Tusayan ruins. When the opportunity came to me to
conduct an archeological expedition, | determined to penetrate into
this broken, inaccessible region and discover whether it, too, possessed
ruined villages related to those of the Rio Verde and the Tusayan
province, thus completing the chain of aboriginal abandoned towns
from the Gila Valley to the Moki country. It remains for me to show
in this report that the discoveries which were made by me in this region
prove that it was in old times the site of a flourishing population, and
to point out that the character of the people, as indicated by archeo-
logical evidences, bore many similarities to those of the ancient people
of Tusayan.

Having demonstrated that the known ruins of the Verde Valley _

were continued into the Red Rock country, it was desirable to compare
them with those at the two ends of the series—the Verde ruins and
those of Old Tusayan. This necessitated reexamination of ruins already
known, near Camp Verde, and a careful exploration of ancient Tusayan
towns. The former work was carried on in the early part of June;
the latter in July and August. I entered the Verde Valley by way of
‘Prescott and the military post, Camp Verde, following the river down
to Squaw Mountain, and examining groups of cavate dwellings, cliff
houses, and ruins in the open country as far as the Red Rocks as the
three representative types of the former housebuilders of this inter-
esting valley. I then turned north and penetrated to the southern
border of the Red Rock country, from which I continued to Flagstaff.
The two Tusayan ruins which I chose as sites of my work were
Awatobi and Sikyatki, the former a historical pueblo destroyed at the
close of the year 1700; the latter a ruin deserted before the advent of
the Spaniards in 1540,

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK CoUNTRY. 561

The reader will notice that I accept without question the belief that
the so-called cliff dwellers were not a distinct people, but that the cliff
houses were results of special adaptation to environment of a race who
sometimes excavated cavate Cwellings or built houses in open plains. JI
am sure that all these three types were built and inhabited at the same
time by the same people. Moreover, the reasoning is cogent, as long
acosuggested by others, that the existing pueblos are inhabited today
by descendants of the cliff peoples, which have been no doubt somewhat
modified in consanguinity by intermarriage with nomadic stocks, but
have preserved the cliff-dweller cultus stage down to our own day in a
partially but not greatly modified form. But while recognizing the
kinship of the cliff dwellers with the modern Pueblo Indians, I can not
restrict this relationship to any one modern pueblo to the exclusion of
others. The evidences which are adduced that the cliff dwellers are
ancestors of Zunis can be paralleled by similar likenesses among the
Mokis; indeed, the resemblances are even closer, since the Tusayan
Indians are today less modified by foreign influences than any other
pueblo peoples. ‘The cultus stage of the so-called cliff dwellers is con-
served to our times, with modifications, by the existing pueblos; and
those members of the latter which are least modified stand nearest the
ancestral conditions, and therefore nearest the cliff peoples.

Perhaps the most remarkable type of aboriginal dwellings in the
Rio Verde Valley are the so-called cavate rooms which are found at
various places where the rock is soft enough to permit their construc-
tion. These caves have been hewn out of the solid rock, and in places
the cliffs are honeycombed with these habitations of aboriginal troglo-
dytes. The largest cluster examined was about 8 miles south of Old
Camp Verde, opposite Squaw Mountain, where their number is not far
from a hundred. Each subterranean chamber or suite of rooms bore
evidence of past habitation, and many objects of archeological interest
were collected from their floors and the débris immediately at their
entrances.

The accompanying illustration shows the external appearance of a
row of cave dwellings south of Camp Verde; a huge buttress of soft
stone of a character almost light enough to float, standing out from
the lofty hills which flank the left bank of the river, and riddled on each
side by caves, passages, and subterranean recesses. We clambered up
the broken talus, shown in the view, and entered the caves through
passages hardly high enough to admit a man of ordinary stature. Once

‘Inside the cave, the excavation enlarges, and we find ourselves in a
roomy chamber, high enough to permit the visitor to stand upright,
with lateral platforms, side rooms, closets, and recesses. These were
living rooms, for there are fireplaces, well-plastered walls, and even the
holes for former pegs for clothing. An enumeration of the number of
‘rooms or cave habitations which exist at various points in the hills and
-mhesas overlooking the Verde conveys little idea of the population

which once found shelter in them. There are evidences that the num-
ber was large, and warrant the conclusion that the caves were once
alive with these troglodytes. The makers of these caverns chose for
their work a soft tufa rock, which was easily excavated, rareiy, if ever,
attempting to excavate the hard lava or red sandstone. The aborig-
inal people riddled the hills in places with their burrowings, some-
times choosing caverns which they walled up, and when driven by
exigencies, such as the hardness of the rock, plastered their commnu-
nal dwellings like wasp nests to the face of the cliff which overhung
them like great protecting roofs. The plan of the cavate rooms may be
indicated by the selection of a typical form, shown in the accompany-
ingecut. Someof these dwellings are simpler; others more complicated,
but a marked feature of all are lateral platforms raised a few inches
above the floor of a central chamber. It is instructive to note that
this feature is paralleled in the construction of the floor of a inodern
kiva or sacred room, in which a raised dais or spectator’s platform is a
constant feature.

From the character of the archeological objects which were gath-
ered from the rooms of these troglodytes, it is probable that they were
of the same cultus stage as the cliff people of not distant mesas, or of
extensive villages, the ruins of which now dot the Verde Valley or
crown the hills at various points in this region. Wedo not have to go
far for evidences that this is so, for even the promontories in which the
cavate chambers are carved are surmounted with the remains of well-
laid walls of dwellings, identical with those of the river valley.

The new ruins which I have discovered in the Red Rock country
belong to the type called cliff houses, and are the largest of this kind
already reported from the valley of the Rio Verde or its tributaries. So
far as I know, these ruins have never been described, and one of the
largest had never been visited by white men.

For convenience in my descriptions, I have given to the more impor-
tant of these ruins the names Palatki and Honanki, Red House, and
Bear House. The former would, at alow estimate, accommodate, when
restored, 50 people; the latter, about 310.

Historical sources shed no light on their age, but I think there is
hardly a doubt that they are older than the invasion of Arizona by the
Spaniards early in the sixteenth century, while their general appear-
ance speaks of a much greater antiquity.

The ruins of the Red Houses consist of two communal dwellings, sit-
uated a few hundred feet apart, about 6 miles west of Court House
Rock, a prominent pinnacle overlooking the left bank of Oak Creek.
These ruins lie in a box canyon on the south side of the Red Rocks,
and are perched on the top ofa talus of fallen débris from a perpendic-
ular cliff to which they are plastered like chimney-swallow nests. The
cliff rises precipitately behind the houses, and arching far above affords
protection from falling rain which, so far as appearance goes, has never
flooded their floors.

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY. 563

There is no evidence that these ruins had been entered in recent
years, and they were discovered by chance in side excursions while we
were camped at Honanki, a few miles to the west. When weclambered
into the deserted inclosures of the walls we saw basketry, stone imple-
ments, and fragments of cotton cloth lying in the alkaline dust, a sure
indication that the collector had not preceded us. But aborigines had
found shelter here before us, since the housebuilders disappeared, for
the fragments of basketry are very similar to that made by Apaches,
whose characteristic pictographs were represented on the walls. These
were the vandals, no doubt, who, in their greed for firewood, had devas.
tated the place, torn down the walls in places, and stripped the villages
of many objects of ethnologic value.

The Red House ruins are approached by an easy trail through a
grove of stunted trees which cover the fallen walls and the débris from
the cliff. The first which was entered stands out in relief from the per-
pendiculayr face of the vertical cliff to which it is firmly cemented. The
front walls consist of a number of curved sections, each corresponding
with an inclosure, and giving greater capacity to the chambers between
them and the eliff. This succession of bow-window like curves is. not
common in cliff houses, and seems to present a transition from between
circular and rectangular houses. It is a cliff house in name, but it
simply uses one side of the cliff as a wall to which the others are plas-
tered. In the construction of the bulging facades, the builders utilized
huge bowlders for parts of the foundation, so that the base of the wall
follows the inequalities of the ground. The masonry is constructed of
unhewn slabs of red sandstone, laid in adobe of the same color, and in
places covered with plastering. When seen from the exterior, we detect
evidences of three-storied rooms. The central portion of the ruin is
almost intact, but on either wing time has dealt roughly with it, and
there is little doubt that the nomadic tribes of Apaches, who replaced
the sedentary agriculturists of the Verde Valley, have had a hand in the
overthrowing of some of the fallen walls.

Clambering into the inclosure of the middle part of the ruin through
an irregular opening at its base, we find ourselves in a roomy chaniber
inclosed by three walls 20 feet high. Halfway up the wall the holes, in
which were placed the beams of the floor of a second story, can be
easily seen, but the beams themselves have disappeared. This is but one
of seven such inclosures each communicating with the next or opening
externally by passageways a few feet square. The right-hand rooms
have suitered much more than those in the middle or on the opposite
wing.

The disappearance of wooden rafters and beams from this and neigh-
boring ruins is accounted for by the fact that in the scarcity of fire-
wood they were rivped out of the walls for use as fuel. Under the
débris on the floor, hidden from sight, these logs are frequently found,
showing that the roof had fallen in and covered them as it fell. It

‘was noticed that the ends of these beams were literally gnawed off,

ws
564 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

evidently by the use of some stone implement, a laborious process, as
may well be imagined. A good illustration of this method of wood
cutting can be seen in a log which I collected in one of the best preserved
rooms of Bear House.

The second ruin of Palatki is built in a cavern of the same cliff, 70
feet across, and is totally covered by a projecting roof of overhanging
rock. Its front wall is much broken, but enough remains to show that
the rooms were in two series, one behind the other, and that at one time
it was three stories high. There were six inclosures in each series, indica-
tive of three stories in each, of eighteen rooms, the habitation of proba-
bly 30 persons. Such walls as were standing were of well-laid masonry
smoothly plastered and were tolerably well preserved.

Excavations were attempted on a small scale in both the Red Houses,
and numerous objects characteristic of cliff people were dug from the
débris on the floor. Fragments of basketry, stone implements, woven
fabrics of cotton cloth, and ropes of agave fiber were found in several
rooms. Even fireplaces could be readily discovered, and in the ashes
of that in a central room I found a fireboard identical with those now
used to kindle fire in a New Fire ceremony at Walpi. In aniche near by
there was a section of a large reed, closed at one end by an internode,
and with a wad of cotton in the open end. It has been suggested, with
great probability of truth, that this was a slow match for conserving a
light after fire had been obtained by the fire drill. The specimens of
cotton cloth were finely woven, in one case ornamented with an open
mesh, an art in weaving still retained among Pueblo Indians.

Want of water and other practical difficulties made it impossible for
me to carry on extensive excavations commensurate with the possibil-
ities of discovery which these ruins present. There was unfortunately
no available spring near these ruins, and we were obliged to bring
drinking water from a long distance. The indications, however, are
that this difficulty could be minimized, or if excavation of these prom-
ising ruins were undertaken at the proper season the supply of water
and fodder for horses would be sufficient for all requirements.

Passing by several smaller cliff houses which I discovered in the Red
Rock country, we may tarry for a few lines descriptive of the largest
ruin of this region, to which I have given the name Honanki. The
existing remains of this ruin show that it was a rambling row of two-
storied houses extending for an eighth of a mile along the foot of a cliff,
culminating in a large communal house, built in an extensive cavern
with overhanging roof. Evidently this was a populous pueblo, large
enough to accommodate at least 300 people, about the same population
as Walpi today. Although there was good evidence that Honanki
had been visited by other white men before us, we search in vain in
archeological literature for even a mention of this prehistoric village.
Fortunately enough of the structure remained to show the finished
character of the masonry, and the large size of the former rooms. In

the main part of the ruin the walls still rise to a height of over 30 feet,
and the wooden rafters still project from the masonry in several places
at the level of the former floor. Thirty inclosures, some of which were
four-storied, attest the former capacity of this forgotten village. In sev-
eral of the rooms were ancient fireplaces filled with ashes of extinct fires,
which long ago had blackened the walls with soot which was still visi-
ble. The well-worn stones on which the former people ground their
corn were in place, and fragments of pottery were present everywhere
in the débris which covered the floors. The fallen rubbish yielded a
rich harvest of objects connected with the life of the former inhabitants,
and in its alkaline dust, shielded from the rains by a common roof cover-
ing the whole settlement, we dug up many cotton fabrics, sandals of
yucea fiber, objects used by prehistoric weavers, warriors, and farmers.

A problematical stone implement made of a small slaty stone
mounted in a wooden handle, to which it was cemented by black pitch,
was found a few feet below the surface on the floor of one of the rooms.
This implement is unique, for so far as known it has not been duplicated
from any cliff house near or remote. Opinions of experts as to its use
are divided, butits double handle suggests an implement held in both
hands when used.

Among most of the objects from these cliff ruins, however, there is
a striking similarity to those reported by others from other cliff dwell-
ings, which leads me to the conclusion that in studying them we have
to deal with the productions of a people in a like stage of culture,
extending from Utah on the north to the southern boundary of Arizona
and beyond on the south, the limits of the so-called Pueblo peoples.
As arule, also, there is a remarkable similarity in the objects dug out
of these ruins and those of the pueblos which have become extinct,
which in turn are almost duplicated among the survivors in the inhab-
ited pueblos. We are, in fact, dealing with the works of a people
which, if not the same in blood, were practically the same in culture.

No aspect of southwestern archeology presents more interesting
problems than aboriginal rock pictures, on which account especial
attention was given by me, wherever I wandered, to the forms and
import of figures cut or painted near the ruined towns on adjacent
cliffs. Two radically different kinds of pictographs, ascribed to two
distinct peoples, the house builders and the nomadic Apache-Mohave,
are found on the rocks, yet but little experience is necessary to dis-
tinguish the two varieties. As a rule, the pictography of the cliff
dwellers is pecked out, evidently with a stone, through a superficial
layer of rock exposing a different colored, deeper layer. The Apache
pictographs, however, are ordinarily painted or drawn on the surface
of the rock and are not incised.

J have not here the opportunity to discuss the various figures char-
acteristic of each kind of picture writing which was found, but will not
omit reference to the pictured rocks of Cliff Ranch and those near the
cavate rooms.

The majority of these pictures are totems of clans, but with them are
many conventional symbols which have a widespread distribution in
our Southwest. The most elaborate single figure of all, which covers
a bowlder about 6 miles south of Camp Verde, is composed of a net-
work of lines, recalling an irrigation system, a map of aboriginal ditches,
remains of which may be traced for many rods over the surface of the
plain at the base of the hill where it stood.

THE PROVINCE OF TUSAYAN.
ARCHZOLOGY OF THE REGION.

Notwithstanding the country immediately around the inhabited Moki
villages is one of the richest in ruins of any territory of like size in Ari-
zona, up to the present no systematic attempt to carry on excavations
in this region has been attempted. Yet archeologists are not wholly
ignorant of the contents of these ruins, for collections of pottery, notably
that made by the trader, Mr. T. V. Keam, have shown the general char-
acter, beauty of form, and rich decoration of ceramic ware found in them,
and a memoir by Mr. Victor Mindeleff recounts some of the legends con-
nected with these ruins and makes known the architectural character
of the same. Unfortunately for the exact purposes of the archeologist,
the special localities from which archeological objects previously gath-
ered in Tusayan is doubtful or unknown, and their association too often
problematical. If our conclusions are to be trustworthy we must have
accurate data respecting the locality from which objects have been
taken, and this may be made possible only by excavations at the ruins -
themselves.

With a view of arriving at this exactitude in data, | chose for my
work in this country two well-known ruins, one of which is called
Awatobi, the other Sikyatki. The names of both of these villages are
known to Moki legends, and both are claimed as ancestral homes of
the tribe. Guided by these legends, excavations in the ancient ruins
I believed would be most fruitful, and it is not too much to say that the
results formed the most vaiuable part of my summer’s explorations in

the Southwest.
THE RUIN OF AWATOBI.

The first reference in print in modern times to the ruin of Awatobi
is found in the late Capt. J. G. Bourke’s account of the Snake Dance of
the Moquis, where be showed that the mounds called Tally Hogan by
the Navahoes were ruins of Awatobi of Spanish conquerors. Later this
ruin was described and figured by Mr. Victor Mindeleff in a report of
the Bureau of Ethnology. Captain Bourke’s reference to Awatobi, how-
ever, is very brief, and Mindeleft’s ground plan defective, including
only the ruin of the Mission of San Bernardino and adjacent houses,
omitting the older or main part of the village—the western mounds.
This omission I have already rectified, and in 1892 published the first
complete ground plan of the ruin of Awatobi.
PLATE XLIII.

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY. 567

While the eastern part of the ruin, which is that figured by Minde-
jeff, undoubtedly supports his conclusion that this portion was “built
about three sides of a rectangular court,” had he recognized the origi-
nal form, as shown by the western mounds, he would doubtless have
modified his conclusions, for this part shows that the original Awatobi
was a compact pueblo, destitute of an inclosed plaza or rectangular
court, and that the eastern end, including the Mission of San Bernardino,
is of comparatively recent construction.

When Tobar, the lieutenant of Coronado, with a handful of men,
discovered the Tusayan towns, in 1540, the village of Awatobi was the
first which he saw, and was one of the most populous. At that time,
with the exception of Oraibi, it was the only Moki pueblo which was
perched on a mesa top, all the others being in the plains or among the
foothills. Tobar approached the town by stealth, during the night,
and when discovered in the morning the intrepid Spaniard had his first
encounter with a people who, unconquered by his successors save for a
comparatively brief period, preserved their independence to the time
Arizona passed under the control of the United States.

Awatobi joimed with the other Moki towns in the great rebellion of
1680, when every Spaniard who was not killed was driven back into
Old Mexico. In the early part of the seventeenth century, through the
zeal of Padre Porras many Awatobeans had been converted to Chris-
tianity, and while other Moki towns hardened their hearts against the
long-gowned men, as the priests were called, there lurked in the minds
of the people of Awatobi a desire for the return of the priests. In
1692 Vargas came to the reconquest, and baptized many children at the
spring near the ruin. What the hated Spaniards did not do, the other
Mokis did. They combined together, and at the close of the year 1700
Awatobi was burned and razed to the ground. There can hardly be a
doubt that this deed ean be traced directly to the too cordial way in
which, as they looked at it, Awatobi had received the dreaded Span-
jards and the new religion which they taught. The tragic destruction
of the place was a martyrdom of a town of 800 souls for its acceptance
of Christianity, and had a similar tragedy, for a like cause, happened
almost anywhere else save in the United States, or to any other race
than Indians, its startling history would have been universally known.

The story of the destruction of Awatobi, thus forgotten by all save
descendants of the actors, is the overthrow of a town of 800 people;
a somber tragedy, where men were massacred in their sacred rooms
after having been tortured with burning fagots and fumes of red
peppers; captives, men and women, mutilated and slain, with all the
barbarity known to a savage, because they looked with favor on
Christianity. If the histories of our country were written from the
Indians’ point of view, this episode would long ago have attracted the
attention of our historians. But historical documents are very meager

_ in regard to the destruction of Awatobi. From scanty records we can

568 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

fix the date of the deed at 1700, but that is about all, and we know
little of the event from these sources. Indian traditicns concerning it
have survived now for two centuries, and each succeeding generation

of Mokis has told to its children the tale of Awatobi. From these
“stories we can learn something of the great tragedy which befell the
town of the Bow people two centuries ago. Several variants of this
legend of Awatobi are current at Walpi, but I have found that of
Saliko, the oldest woman of the Snake family, one of the most com-
prehensive. She is particularly cognizant of the legends of events of
those stirring times, as her maternal ancestor is claimed to have received
from one of the women of Awatobi, who was saved, the badge of chief-
taincy of a sacerdotal society, which she inherits. The story of Saliko
runs as follows:

‘‘The chiefs Wiki and Simo, and others, have told you their stories,
and surely their ancestors were living here at Walpi when Awatobi
was occupied. It was a large village, and many people lived there, and
the village chief was called Tapolo, but he was not at peace with his
people, and there was quarreling and trouble. Owing to this conflict
only a little rain fell, but the land was fertile and fair harvests were
still gathered. The Awatobi men were bad (powako, sorcerers). Some-
times they went in small bands among the fields of the other villagers
and cudgeled any solitary workers they found. If they overtook any
woman they ravished her, and they waylaid hunting parties, taking the
game, after beating and sometimes killing the hunters. There was
considerable trouble in Awatobi, and Tapolo sent to the Oraibi chief
asking him to bring his people and kill the evil Awatobeans. The
Oraibis came and fought with them, and many were killed on both
sides, but the Oraibis were not strong enough to enter the village, and
were compelled to withdraw. On his way back, the Oraibi chief stopped
at Walpi and talked with the chiefs there. Said he, ‘I can not tell
why Tapolo wants the Oraibis to kill his folks, but we have tried and
have not succeeded very well. Even if we did succeed, what benefit
would come to us who live too far away to occupy the land? You Walpi
people live close to them and have suffered most at their hands; it is
for you to try.’ While they were talking Tapolo had also come, and
it was then decided that other chiefs of all the villages should convene
at Walpi to consult. Couriers were sent out, and when all the chiefs
had arrived Tapolo declared that his people had become sorcerers
(Christians), and hence should all be destroyed.

“It was then arranged that in four days large bands from all the
other villages should prepare themselves, and assemble at a spring not
farfrom Awatobi. <A long while before this, when the Spaniards lived
there, they had built a wall on the side of the village that needed pro-
tection, and in this wall was a great, strong door. Tapolo proposed that
the assailants should come before dawn, and he would be at this door
ready to admit them, and under this compact he returned to his village.
THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY. 569

During the fourth night after this, as agreed upon, the various bands
assembled at the deep gulch spring, and every man carried, besides his
weapons, a cedar-bark torch and a bundle of greasewood. Just before
dawn they moved silently up to the mesa summit, and, going directly
to the east side of the village, they entered the gate, which opened as
they approached. In one of the courts was a large kiva, and in it were
a number of men engaged in sorcerer’s rites. The assailants at once
made for the kiva, and plucking up the ladder, they stood around the
hatechway, shooting arrows down among the entrapped occupants. In
the numerous cooking pits fire had been maintained through the
night for the preparation of food for a feast on the appointed morning,
and from these they lighted their torches. Great numbers of these
and the bundles of greasewood being set on fire were then cast down
the hatchway, and firewood from stacks upon the house terraces were
also thrown into the kiva. The red peppers for which Awatobi was
famous were hanging in thick clusters along the fronts of the houses,
and these they crushed in their hands and flung upon the blazing fire
in the kiva to torment their burning occupants. After this, all who
were capable of moving were compelled to travel or drag themselves
until they came to the sand hills of Miconinovi, and there the final
disposition of the prisoners was made.

‘“My maternal ancestor had recognized a woman chief (Mamzrau
monw1), and saved her at the place of massacre called Maski, and now
he asked her whether she would be willing to initiate the woman of
Walpi in the rites of the Mamzrau. She complied, and thus the obsery-
ance of the ceremonial called the Mamzrauti came to Walpi. I can not
tell how it came to the other villages. This Mamzrau monwi had no
children and hence my maternal ancestor’s sister became chief, and her
badge of office or tiponi came to me. Some of the other Awatobi
women knew how to bring rain, and such of them as were willing to
teach their songs were spared and went to different villages. The
Oraibi chief saved a man who knew how to cause the peach to grow,
and that is why Oraibi has such an abundance of peaches now. The
Miconinovi chief saved a prisoner who knew how to make the sweet,
small-ear corn grow, and this is why it is more abundant there than
elsewhere. All the women who knew song prayers and were willing to
teach them were spared, and-no children were designedly killed, but
were divided among the villages, most of them going to Micoiinovi.
The remainder of the prisoners, men and women, were again tortured
and dismembered and left to die on the sand hills, and there their
bones are, and the place is called Mastcomo or Death Mound. This is
the story of Awatobi told by my old people.”

One of the most definite statements of this and all variants of the
surviving legends of Awatobi is that many of the men were killed in
akiva. It is manifestly of interest to verify the tradition by exeava-
tions. In my limited work at the ruins in the summer of 1892, I
570 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

opened a chamber 28 by 14 feet in the middle of the rectangular court
of the eastern portion of Awatobi, 100 feet north of the mission, and dis-
covered a human skull and other bones which evidently had not been
buried with care. This accorded with Hopi tradition pointing to this
room as the kiva in which some of Awatobeans died on the fatal night
of the massacre. I was at that time deterred from further excava-
tions in the kiva by the horror of my workmen at desecrating the
place. This summer, however, I determined to continue the excayva-
tions there and to follow the walls of adjacentrooms. The results led to
a discovery which sheds new light on the character of the rooms in the
middle of the rectangular court of the eastern part of Awatobi.
Instead of a single room at this point, three square chambers of about
the same size were found, side by side, and in the center of the floor of
the middle room, 6 feet below the surface of the ground, I came upon
a Square stone shrine. As the workmen excavated to the level of the
floor, I noticed in the middle of the room a large slab of stone through
which had been cut a rectangular orifice. This slab was removed and
below it was laid bare a crypt, the walls of which were made of four stone
slabs, each set on edge, making a receptacle about 24 feet square. This
crypt was evidently a shrine or sacred receptacle in which prayer ofter-
ings were deposited in old pagan rites, for its floor was covered with
remains of prayer sticks, some of which, colored with green pigment,
were well preserved. It was without doubt a place of offerings to rain
gods, for on each of the four stone walls which inclosed it a rain-cloud
symbol was drawn in black pigment. The figure of the rain cloud thus
outlined on the slab at the north side was colored yellow, that at the west
green, that at the south red, and the slab at the east white, showing
an association of colors with world quarters which still forms a prom-
inent feature in Tusayan rituals.

The situation of this shrine in the middle of an ancient dance place
is interesting in comparisons with modern usages, for even to the pres-
ent day, in several of the inhabited Tusayan towns, the middle of the
plaza, where ceremonial dances are performed, is occupied by a stone
shrine in which prayer sticks are placed, as I have repeatedly described
im my accounts of religious observances of these people. In modern
conceptions this centrally placed shrine is said to be symbolic of a
mythic opening out of which, in their cosmogony, races came in the
beginning, from the Underworld, and there is little doubt that the
same belief was associated with the buried cyst excavated at Awatobi.

The western or ancient portion of Awatobi is a high mound rising
steeply from the south at the edge of the mesa and sloping gradually
toward the north and west. Itis probable, judging from the configura-
tions, that when inhabited the buildings, the débris of which forms
this mound, rose vertically froin the edge of the cliff to a height of four
stories and sloped by terraces to the level surface of the mesa on the
north. By cutting into the mound on the steep side, we were able to

examine jn vertical section the arrangement of rooms one above another.
We excavated a number of almost parallel walls, apparently converg-
ing to the middle of the mound, and found the intervals between them
to be cut off by cross walls into series of rooms. The deeper we pene-
trated the mound, following the level of the mesa surface, the higher
the walls became; and if, as I suspect, these slightly converging walls
penetrate to the heart of the mound, there is no doubt that the old
part of Awatobi was a compact communal building four stories high.
It is likewise evident from the shape of the mound that the western
portion of Awatobi was of pyramidal shape, without inclosed court,
although possibly penetrated by passageways or narrow streets.
Drifting sand and falling walls have combined to form these compact
mounds, from which no section of a wall rises above the general level;
but wherever we penetrated below the surface there the walls remained
unchanged, and if we dug down to the floor through the débris we
found the remains of household utensils used by the former occupants.

The general features of rooms on the south or steep side of the west-
ern mound, as shown in the annexed plate, are similar. The masonry
of the walls is composed of aligned stones, showing evidences of hay-
ing been hewn or dressed with some care at construction. Plastering
was generally present, and in many instances was as well preserved as
the day the village was deserted. Lafters and floor joists had fallen
and been buried in débris, but when dug out were found in such a good
State of preservation that they were available for fuel. The builders
who put them in place centuries ago had not known the saw or metallic
ax, for each log had been laboriously cut with the stone implements
with which he was familiar.

The appearance of an excavated room of the northern slope of the
western mound may be seen in the accompanying plate. Here all indi-
cations point to the belief that we have a single-storied room, the raft-
ers and other remains of the roof having been removed from the débris
excavated from the floor. In one corner there was a small, square
closet, and filling the interval between it and the opposite wall a raised
seat. The walls were made of small stone blocks with nicely polished
plaster, while the floor was paved and covered with adobe. The adjoin-
ing rooms over the whole northwestern area of the mounds showed
little variation save in details.

Tf, therefore, I may be permitted, in the light of my explorations, to
reconstruct the original pueblo of Awatobi, as it appeared to the eager
eyes of the Spaniards early in the sixteenth century, I should say that
it consisted of a large communal building of pyramidal shape, four
stories high at the apex, rising abruptly from the edge of a precipice
on the south, and sloping gradually northward by a succession of
terraces to a range of one-storied rooms. At that time there was
probably a spur of rooms extending eastward and facing a dance plaza,
in the middle of which was a kiva and shrine. At the close of the

next century there had been added the eastern part of the pueblo,
the Mission of San Bernardino, erected at the edge of the cliff and
connected with the spur on the north side by a lofty wall in which was
a wide gateway, remnants of the buttresses of which can still be.
traced. Through this gate the hostiles poured on that fatal night,
almost two centuries ago, admitted to the doomed village by a treach-
erous chief, and in the southeast corner of the court, in front of the
church, transpired one of the most brutal tragedies of the times. That
many persons were massacred a few feet from the church is shown by
the many skeletons which have been found there, evidently thrown
promiscuously in a heap, without pious regard or the sympathetic
offering of food in mortuary vessels.

It was evident from my excavations that the fury of the assailants
was especially directed against the eastern quarter where the mission
was situated, which is easily expiained on the ground that the dwell-
ings of the party favorable to Christianity would naturally be in that
section. The evidences of a great conflagration, which appeared every-
where in this part, showed in several houses where granaries of corn had
formerly been. A hostile band would not have thus destroyed food
material unless its rage had been great or the conflagration beyond its
control. It was not apparently the purpose of the hostiles to sack Awa-
tobi, but to effectually root out its sorcery—the dreaded innovations in
pagan belief which the zeal of the padres was making in its midst.

For prehistoric customs of the aboriginal life, unmodified by the
Spaniards, we must look to the western section. The excavations in
different regions of this part brought to ight a strange mortuary prac-
tice. It has long been known that the prehistoric villagers of our
Southwest buried persons of distinction in or on the floors of their
dwelling rooms. Instances of intramural burials have been reported
from the Gila and Salado Valley ruins and the ancient ruins of Cibola
called Haiona (Zuni) and Heshotau‘hla, but up to the present no case
of Tusayan house burial has been found. My studies of Awatobi, how-
ever, Show the existence of this custom in that town.

One of the best of these house burials was found in a chamber on
the south side of the western mounds, near the edge of the cliff. On
opening a room at that point we found unmistakable evidences that it
was a burial chamber, for resting on the floor a skeleton was discovered
stretched at fuil length, the head slightly turned to the northeast.
Around this skeleton had been placed as mortuary offerings or symbols
of rank, a collection of objects of such a nature as to indicate that it
was that of a chief, and Kopeli, a competent authority, declared that
the evidence showed this to be the remains of a warrior priest. Eight
pieces of pottery lay near the bones of the head and breast of the dead
chieftain. Four of these vessels were small, globular paint bowls,
made of black and white ware, and placed inside a beautiful vase of
red color. These small receptacles contained the warrior’s paint, red

and yellow pigments, and a micaceous hematite, which is still used by
the Snake priests and other warriors to decorate their cheeks on cere-
; monial occasions.

A beautifully decorated black and white ware vase stood near by,
covered with an inverted ladle, and containing several arrowpoints of
finest workinanship. There were no food vessels or basins as in ordi-
nary burials, and no original means of entrance into the chamber of
death could be found. The chief had been entombed in the room with
pious care, and afterward the walls of masonry were sealed about him.
There were no evidences of post-mortem entrance to the chamber, and
nothing to show that it was a living room subsequently to the burial.
The mode of intramural interment was not common at Awatobi, but
most of the dead were buried outside the town, as the cemeteries north
and west of the village abundantly prove. It is significant that this
solitary instance of house burial was found in the oldest part of the
ruin, and it is probable that after the advent of the Spaniards the cus-
tom was abandoned, except in those instances where the walls or floor
of the mission were used for that purpose.

The Awatobeans buried most of their dead outside their village in
the shifting sand dunes north and west of their old town, and in the foot-
hills at the base of their mesa. The interments in the sand were gen-
erally, as in modern Tusayan burials, found to be accompanied with
food bowls of finest yellow ware, or with rude cooking pots or bowls
and slipper-shape jars, in all of which fragments of food were detected.
Most of the skeletons from these cemeteries which were examined had
been placed in a sitting posture, the knees brought up to the chin, and
the pottery offerings were deposited at one side. Several of the dead
had wooden slats painted green, which, in one instance, was held in
the left hand. This offering, called a prayer stick, was decorated with
two figures of the dragon fly painted in black outlines.

The interments at the base of the mesa seem to have been made in
shallow graves among the rocks, and were accompanied with food
offerings deposited in decorated bowls. In one of these graves I found
two nests of food bowls, each composed of six specimens, one at the
side of the other. At another grave, which was identified as that of a
person high in sacerdotal standing, there was a colander pierced with
a double row of holes arranged in the form of a Greek cross, and filled
with stone arrowpoints, charm stones, and pigments. This colander
may have been used by the priest in sifting sand on the floor of the
kiva or sacred room when he made the sand picture, an important
accessory of the altar. At the skull of the same priest there was a
stone fetish of the puma, and near his breastbone an elaborately carved
prayer stick, upon which the impression of a feather was still to be seen.
How long ago these objects were placed by the survivors on the graves
of their kindred I can not say, suffice is it to know that funeral habits
still practiced by the Mokis find their counterpart in villages of their

574 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

kin which were destroyed centuries ago. The ethnologist who reads
aright the evidences can no longer ascribe the custom of placing food
upon the grave as one derived from the Spaniards. It is aboriginal,
and, as we shall later see, was customary in Tusayan before a single
christian had trodden the soil of Tusayan.

From the rich collection of objects which were brought to light by
my excavations at Awatobi, I will mention only a few of the more inter-
esting. The town was directly under Spanish influence sporadically
from 1540 to 1700, and it is not astonishing to find traces of this influ-
ence. During that time was built the Mission of San Bernardino, a
large building differing in architecture from the aboriginal houses. In
excavations near the ruins of this mission, I found metallic objects, a
rusty knife blade, copper fragments, nails, glass, and glazed pottery.
These and similar objects seem to have been introduced in considerable
quantity, considering the isolation of the province and its difficulty of
access. We may well suppose that the influence of the Catholic priests
on manners and customs was even greater than that indicated by the
foreign objects which were brought with them. At heart, no doubt
Awatobi was still pagan when the other pueblos destroyed it, and
the majority of the objects found are therefore strictly aboriginal in
character.

The pottery which was collected at Awatobi belongs for the most
part to the fine yellow ware for which Tusayan is famous, with here
and there bowls made of black and white ware, the distinctive pottery
of the cliff builders. It consists of coarse coiled ware, cooking vessels,
and shoe-form vases, with ladles, jars, and amphoras, numbering in
all about a hundred pieces. To articles made of clay baked in the sun
and fired by the heat of coal are referred bird-like pendants, some of
which are in the form of shell gorgets, painted and incised.: The Awa-
tobi priest used a cigar-holder form of pipe, in which native tobacco
was smoked during ceremonials. |

A single small clay bell, similar in form to copper bells from Old
Mexico, is unique, having never before been duplicated in Tusayan
ruins.

We know from historical sources that the Awatobi priests at the

ime of the Conquest wore cotton kilts, and in early documents it is
stated that they presented many ‘“‘cotton towels” to Antonio de Espejo
when he made his way to Tusayan in 1583, Although woven ropes were
found in one of the older houses, no cotton fabrics rewarded our search.
The ropes and strings which were found were made of the tough fiber
of the agave. The bones of the turkey and other birds were worked
into awls, bodkins, needles, and pins. Cut into sections, the leg bones
of birds were used as necklaces, and one of the longer of these sections
was pronounced by the Indians a whistle, such as is now employed in
the secret rites of the inhabited pueblos.

The turquoise was prized then, as now, as ::n ornamental stone, and

the nicely perforated and skillfully cut beads of this material made by
the ancient people of Awatobi are similar to those used today. These
turquoises, however, traveled many miles before they fell into the
hands of the Awatobi people.

With the exception of the pottery it was in stone implements that
our collections were richest of all. Axes, arrowheads, spearpoints, and
grinding and polishing stones occurred in great numbers, and several
nicely fashioned grooved stones used to straighten arrowshafts, stone
slabs for paint grinding, metates, and pestles of similar shape and
manufacture to those universally found in the ruins of the Southwest
were added to our collection.

The ancient Awatobi priests, as do their descendants to-day, prized
any botryoidal stone, quartz crystal, stalactite, fossil cephalopod, or
bright-colored rock. So closely similar is the life at Walpi to-day to
that which existed in Awatobi at the close of the seventeenth century
that the intelligent workmen whom I employed from the former vil-
lage were able to name and tell me the use of almost every object
found, thus verifying my interpretations. Where customs change so
little in so many generations, archeology is simply an ancient aspect
of ethnology.

THE RUIN OF SIKYATKI.

Three miles east of the pueblo of Walpi, among the footbills which
skirt the mesa on the south side, lies a collection of mounds which
were said to be the site of an old pueblo called Sikyatki, or Yellow
House.

My knowledge of this ruin dates back to 1892, when, in strolling over
the hills, it was pointed out to me by an Indian, and the romantic his-
tory of its destruction by the Walpians told by my companion. Although
this pueblo, judging from the size of the mounds, must have been one
of the most populous in Tusayan, comparatively nothing is known of
the character of the people who inhabited it.

The destruction of Sikyatki occurred, according to tradition, before
the coming of the Spaniards, and therefore in prehistoric times. To
the definite statements to that effect made by old priests at Walpi, cor-
roboratory evidence of their truth is found in the fact that the place is
nowhere mentioned in ancient documents relating to the history of the
country. No doubt is entertained by anyone that Sikyatki is a prehis-
toric Indian pueblo, but there_are no data at hand to determine its age.

The probable antiquity of this ruin imparts to the rich-collection of
archeological objects collected from it a special value, revealing the
character of Tusayan life in prehistoric time. According to tradition-
ists, the village of Sikyatki was settled by a phratry of Mokis called the
Kokop or Fuel people, which are still strong in numbers at Walpi. It
took its name, they say, from the color of the water of the neighboring
spring, which still preserves its yellowish appearance. The cause of its
destruction was a culmination of bickerings and altercations between
576 THE CLIFF VILLAGES-OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

its inhabitants and those of Walpi, which was then situated on foot-
hills to the west of the mesa, not having yet been moved to its com-
manding position on the summit. The outcome of many disputes
between the two pueblos brought on a tragic destruction of the place,
after which such of the hostile element as escaped fled to Awatobi, then
a flourishing village, 15 miles away; the remainder were incorporated
with the population of the victorious town. A sanguinary story of
adventure is woven into the legends relating to the causes of this
destruction of a whole village. One of the youths of Sikyatki, disguised
as a dancer and wearing a mask, killed a woman spectator while a
ceremony was in progress at Walpi. He escaped from the town, ran
along the cliffs, taking off his mask and boasting of his deed. These
taunts inflamed the Walpians to vengeance, and when the men of
Sikyatki were occupied in the fields their warriors fell upon the town
and destroyed it. There is no way to prove the truth of this legend,
but there can be little doubt that Sikyatki fell many years ago. Itis
interesting to remember that in those old days Walpi was probably the
only other Tusayan town at the Hast mesa, and therefore the only
rival which Sikyatki had near by. The Tanoan people, whose descend-
ants now inhabit Hano, the nearest village, had not migrated from the
tio Grande, and the little town Sitcomovi, midway between Hano and
Walpi, had not been built on the mound covered with flowers which
gave it its name.

As one crosses the plain following the road from the entrance to
Keams Canyon to the modern Moki settlement near Isba or Coyote
Spring, the main water supply of Hano, he sees far to the right, on
the mesa top, two conical mounds, which are conspicuous for miles.
These teocalli-like elevations are called Kiikiitcomo, and are circular
ruins, possibly contemporaneous with Sikyatki, of which they were
defensive outlooks. They are situated just above the mounds which
mark the ruins of that village on the foothills beneath, and were no
doubt wisely chosen for defense against the Walpians. Between them
and the present towns the mesa narrows, and what was once a strong
defensive wall can still be traced, crossing the mesa at its narrow
point. Sikyatki lies among foothills, surrounded by stretches of sand,
elevated a few hundred feet above the plain. Elsewhere than in
Tusayan its site would be regarded most desolate, but an enterprising
Indian, claiming the ruin from the relationship of his wife, still har-
vests from these barren sands a considerable crop of melons and
squashes, planting his vines where the plaza once was. Other Indians
claim the stunted peach trees which grow near by. Not a trace of the
walls of ancient Sikyatki stand above the mounds, although the outlines
of houses can be followed everywhere on the surface. Since the village
became a ruin roofs have fallen in, drifting sand has blown into the
chambers, and the sagebrush and other desert plants have taken root
in the covering débris, forming a succession of mounds of rectangular

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY. 577

arrangement, whose only habitants are reptiles and noxious insects.
Such is the desolation of an ancient pueblo where once lived a people
who manufactured in prehistoric times some of the most artistic pot-
tery ever made in North America. Even the Indians from the neighbor-
ing villages who visited me and saw the beautiful ware which I exhumed
from these desolate mounds and sands did not fail to contrast the past
with the present. ‘The best potter of the East mesa, an intelligent
woman from Hano, named Nampio, acknowledged that her productions
were far inferior to those of the women of Sikyatki, and she begged per-
mission to copy some of the decorations for future inspiration. The
sight of this dusky woman and her husband copying the designs of
ancient ware and acknowledging their superiority was instructive in
many Ways.

The northeast corner of the rectangular mounds of Sikyatki rises
into a rocky pinnacle, steep on the north and sloping by a gentle rise
from the south and east. This elevation was formerly crowned with
houses, as will soon be made evident, and from its commanding position
was early in our work called an acropolis. The accompanying plan of the
whole village shows that it was rectangular, with northern and western
ranges of houses much higher than the southern and eastern. This is
readily referred to the contour of the foothills chosen by the ancient
builders as the site of their town, the high rock of the acropolis being,
without doubt, the first part on which houses were erected. The four
elongated sides which give the rectangular form to the mounds inclosed
a rectangular court in which are smaller mounds, remnants possibly of
kivas, and level spaces now marked off with rows of stones inclosing
modern fields of melons and squash plants. At the southern angle
two significant buttresses in the bounding mound suggest a gateway by
which the court of the village was entered. Some archeologists have
insisted that the rectangular form of pueblos is a modern type, but the
ruins of Sikyatki take this form back to prehistoric times.

In considering a ruin as large as Sikyatki, itis quite impossible for me
in the limited space allowed in this preliminary report to do more than
choose a few typical rooms in order to give an idea of the character of
the architecture of the habitations of the Sikyatkians. I have, there-
fore, chosen as a type the rooms of the acropolis, which were carefully
excavated under my direction by Kopeli, the Snake chief, one of the
best Indian workmen employed.

When f began excavation at this part of the ruin, we had no trace of
walis to guide us, but by removing the surface débris we found a
double line of rooms forming a ridge extending about north and south,
following the rise to the top of the rock, which was about level at this
point. The rooms were excavated to their floors, where a stone pave-
ment resting on the rock was found 5 feet below the surface. The
walls were constructed of squared stones, set in adobe mortar and
smoothly plastered with the same material.

SM 95——37

578 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

The accompanying cut shows the ground plan of nine of these rooms,
which for purposes of study are Jettered A to J, accourpanied with
dimensions. It will be seen that the largest were about 8 feet square,
of regular shape, and that the smallest was a narrow recess not com-
municating with the others. Several of the chambers had passage-
ways connecting them as indicated, and no doubt belonged to the same
household.

On the sides of the walls I found several niches or cubbyholes nicely
plastered, in which objects used in daily life had been left over three
hundred years ago when the rooms were abandoned, and the soot of
ancient fireplaces still intact had not been obliterated during the gen-
erations during which the walls had been buried. In one corner of room
A we found a large, coarse jar, in which no doubt water for daily use
had been kept or possibly the food cooked, and numerous other jars
littered the floor. The plastering of the masonry in rooms G and H
was especially well done, and a portion of it when removed and cut in
section exhibited many strata, showing the many times some careful
housewife had replastered her house, or transmitted this task to
descendants.

The majority of the objects found at Sikyatki were obtained from
extramural cemeteries which are situated in sandy places, on three
sides of the town, a few hundred feet beyond the outer walls. A
choice collection of food basins of remarkable fineness and beauty of
form and decoration were obtained from these burial places. These
and the many smaller objects found with them present a most instruc-
tive picture of prehistoric mortuary customs.

It was customary for the Sikyatki, as for the Walpi Indians, to place
pottery, with food and prayer sticks, fetiches, and stone implements
in the graves of their dead. As these objects from the graves bear
unmistakable evidence of having been in use previously to burial, we
can obtain from an examination of them a good idea of household
utensils used by the Sikyatkians. Moreover, the dead were at times
buried with their personal ornaments and ceremonial paraphernalia—
insignia of rank, and the like—all of which, when rightly interpreted,
are most important in the study of the life of prehistoric Tusayan.

The number of skeletons which were found reached into the hun-
dreds, and as almost every burial was accompanied by one or more
food vessels, vases, or ladles, the number of objects obtained was
correspondingly large. The majority of the skeletons, on account of
their great age, were in a very poor state of preservation, and in most
cases only a fine dust indicated the presence of the dead.

From my knowledge of surviviiig customs at Walpi, it was possible
in some instances to determine the sex and standing in the tribe of the
dead from votive offerings, a work in which I was aided by intelligent
priests who visited me during the excavations. No trace of metal or
other material which showed the influence of white man was discovered

at Sikyatki, and the conclusion is logical that in studying the objects
from this ruin we are considering the unmodified, purely aboriginal
cultus of Tusayan.

The bowls and other kinds of pottery found in the Sikyatki ceme-
teries in most instances contained the remains of votive food offerings,
the character of which obviously could not be made out. In addition
to perishable foods, other objects, like stones, arrowheads, beads, and
prayer sticks, were likewise placed in the earthenware pottery by the
side of thedead. One of themostinteresting of these mortuary offerings
was a small, textile fabric—the only one of this kind which occurred—
resembling a feather cloth. As the production of feather garments,
blankets, cloth, and the like was extensively practiced by the cliff
dwellers, and its fabrication is recounted in many Tusayan legends, it
is instructive to find evidence of it in this old Tusayan ruin.

By far the most novel of wooden mortuary objects found in Sikyatki
graves were the so-called prayer sticks, of which a number of different
kinds were exhumed. These prayer sticks varied in form from simple
wooden slats to pencil-like rods carved with ferules. Considering, as
we must, that they were cut out with stone implements by people ignorant
of metal knives, they are fine examples of Stone Age wood carving,
even although the wood of which they were fashioned is soft and
easily worked. As a rule, they were painted with pigments of two
colors, green and black. The green is a powdered carbonate of cop-
per, fragments of which were likewise found in the graves. Certain
of the prayer sticks were identical with those now used by the Flute
fraternity at Walpi, thus supporting the claim made by this society
that their ancestors were among the most ancient people in Tusayan,
and were early represented at Sikyatki. The presence of a prayer
offering similar to that characteristic of the Flute priesthood would
seem to indicate that the person in whose grave it was found belonged
to that family. One of the largest of these prayer sticks was that
shown in the accompanying illustration, which is a remarkable form,
not used at the present day. So well preserved are some of these
wooden prayer offerings that the imprint of feathers and pine needles
can still be detected upon them. Many of these prayer sticks are
undoubtedly offerings to Masauwth, the Death God, and it is inter-
esting in this connection to mention the fact that at the close of work
each day the Indian laborers prepared a twig with attached feathers,
which they placed in the trenches, sprinkling them with sacred meal,
and at the same time breathing a prayer to the dreaded Death God,
whose realm they had invaded in disturbing the graves. The horror
at disturbing the dead, and the superstitious fear which led the Mokis
to refuse to touch a human bone, was thus, to them, satisfactorily offset
by propitiatory observances.

Several pipes, one of which was of especially fine workmanship, were
_ found in the graves. These pipes were shaped like cigar holders, short

580 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

and stemless, the surface, in a few instances, decorated with incised
lines. Their presence in graves is readily explained when we remem-
ber that originally smoking was a ceremonial habit, and a certain
reverence is still paid by the priest to the pipe, which he uses in the
celebration of the mysteries. The fragments of one herb found in one of
the food basins has been identified as probabiy belonging to the genus
Nicotiana, the native American tobacco plant, and it is well known
that even to the present day food offerings, sprinkled with dried
tobacco leaves, are made before certain feasts following great ceremo-
nials. A well-made stone fetish of a mountain lion, found with abowl
of arrowheads, was thought to indicate that the dead with which they
occurred belonged to a warrior society. The lips of this fetish still
showed the red pigment with which they had been painted.

Fragments of obsidian were apparently highly prized by the ancient
people of Sikyatki. From this material, which had been carried along
distance to reach Tusayan, arrowheads were made. As a substance
of value it was deposited in masses in the mortuary vessels.

There is evidence that the ancient people of Tusayan used coal for
fuel, seams of which underlie their pueblos, but in course of time this
substance had fallen into disuse, so that it is unknown as a fuel today.!
Coal in the form of lignite was also polished into ornaments, a slab of
which, perforated for suspension, was taken from one of the graves.
Similar polished lignite slabs also occur in graves and elsewhere in
ruins as far south as the Gila, and from the provinee of Cibola or Zuni.

The well-known turquoise beads were prized for ornamental purposes
by the ancient Sikyatkians, and their existence in prehistoric graves
implies barter with distant people of the Rio Grande. Slabs of mica
and selenite were drilled and fashioned into pendants to be worn on the
neck or in the ears. The most common form of necklace was made of
short segments of the leg bones of some birds strung together. These
were stained green; and from around the neck bones of one skeleton
which was exhumed a many-stranded necklace of this kind was taken,
some of the beads of which still preserved the green color. A saucer-
like basin contained several scores of hard seeds, each perforated and
apparently used for beads.

A large number of mortuary food basins contained small, smooth
stones similar to those still used in polishing pottery. With these
were likewise coneretionary nodules, quartz crystals, fragments of
stalactites, and in one instance a fossil] cephalopod. A similar shell ~
is one of the most sacred objects contained in the badge of chieftaincy
of a woman’s society called the Lalakonthi at the present day,
and we may rightly suspect that it was held in like reverence in old
Sikyatki.

'This change probably took place at the introduction of sheep, whose dried drop-

THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK couNTRY. 581

Repeated questioning of the Snake chief, who was one of my work-
men, failed to elicit any legend that the Snake family once lived at
Sikyatki, but a rattle of the rattlesnake found in a mortuary food ves-
sel calls to mind the reverence with which this reptile is held by the
two societies of priests which biennially celebrate the well-known snake
dance.

The small red disks punctured near the rim are regarded as ear orna-
ments. Some of these are notched on the border, as if to facilitate
winding with string, while others were unperforate, slightly convex
on each side. Some of these pendants were rectangular, but generally
smooth and highly polished. Twospecimens of the shell, Oliva angulata
Lam., were found in one food basin, which indicates either that the
Sikyatkians traded with those tribes who obtained it from the Gulf of
California or that it passed by barter among peoples who did. Their
occurrence likewise shows that in prehistoric times seashells were
prized by the Sikyatkians in much the same way as at present.

Most problematical of all mortuary objects are the large white disk-
shape fragments of kaolin, which are artificially fashioned and perfo-
rated at the axis. One of these was found upon the cranium of askull,
over which it fitted like a crown.

The cylindrical clay object, with reticulated surface, was immedi-
ately identified by Indian workmen as an imitation of a corn fetish,
whose surface was formerly studded with seeds of maize. A similar
ceremonial object is displayed at the present day on the altar of a
woman’s society called the Lalakonti, and in elaborate purification
ceremonies called Powamt. ‘The presence of these ceremonial objects
in prehistoric graves, in form almost identical with those at present
used in secret ceremonials, shows the great antiquity of portions of
the Tusayan ritual and opens a vista into prehistoric rites of these
Indians.

Many graves had votive dippers, ladles, or small square clay boxes,
with or without handles, resembling medicine bowls, holding fragments
of green or red. stones or finely ground pigment of the same colors. The
frequency of these paints indicates that the Sikyatki priests attached
considerable reverence to these colors, and that red and green played
the same important part that they do today in ceremonial and divina-
tory practices.

The ancient Sikyatkians evidently deposited large stones on the

grave in order to prevent animals from digging up the body. The only
approach to a gravestone was a stone slab of rectangular outline, one
edge of which had been cut into a terrace form and the face decorated
with a symbolic figure of a rain cloud drawn in black outline. This
stone can hardly be said to designate the name of the dead, but is more
or less talismanic. The modern Tusayan Indians believe that the dead
have certain occult powers over rain deities. “You have come to be
a Rain God,” is the import of their prayer to a deceased friend or

a
582 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

relative. Possibly a somewhat similar conception suggested the act of
depositing the stone slab with a rain-cloud symbol in the prehistoric
graves of Sikyatki.

Objects made of clay, or pottery, are by all odds the most artistic
found in the Sikyatki cemeteries. It seems almost inconceivable that
these symmetrical forms could have been made without knowledge of
the potter’s wheel, yet such is the truth. Itis not too much to say that
this collection contains objects more finely made and elaborately deco-
rated than any ceramic work of any aboriginal tribe of North America,
and that it will compare favorably with that of the eultured stocks of
Central America. It is far superior to modern pottery made in adja-
cent pueblos in form, fineness of parts, and beauty of decoration. It
is ornamented with an elaborate polychrome symbolic decoration, which
differs in character from that of any modern pueblo near or remote.
It is obvious, I believe, that the value of this large and beautiful collec-
tion of ornamented pottery lies primarily in the study of the symbolic
decorations. These symbols, rarely duplicated, form a body of paleog-
raphy which is an important index of ancient thought and feeling.
Never before has such a great variety of ancient picture writing been
taken from any one ruin of our Southwest, and as a consequence never
has a larger amount of ancient pueblo pictography been placed before
the student. If it were possible to interpret these pictures aright, our
knowledge of ancient pueblo conceptions would be vastly enlarged.

Articles included in the designation “ pottery” include rough, undee-
orated vessels made with coils of clay, which are readily traced on the
exterior, and finely decorated smooth ware in which the appearance of
the coils has been obliterated by polishing. The Sikyatkians made
both kinds, apparently in the same way as do their descendants.

The former kind includes cooking pots, slipper-shape food recepta-
cles, and water jars. In most instances these were blackened by use,
but the coarse clay and embedded grains of sand were easily seen.
The decorated pottery, on the other hand, was not blackened, and
includes food basins, bowls, jars, vases, dippers, and other household
ware. These may be classified according to character or color into
three groups: (1) Black and white pottery, (2) yellow pottery, and (3)
red ware.

The few specimens of black and white pottery in the collection are —
small bowls and jars, and were not made by Sikyatki potters, but were
heirlooms from ancestors who derived them from cliff-house people, of
whom this colored ware is characteristic. The red ware is likewise, I
believe, intrusive in Sikyatki, and not a product of their skill, for it is
characteristic of older rather than more recent. times. The style of
decoration of both black and white and red ware is mainly geometric
designs, meanders, frets, key patterns, and spirals. Figures of animals,
plauts, and human beings are rare or unknown. ‘The larger number of
articles of pottery from Sikyatki are of the fine yellow ware, consisting

of almost all kinds of household utensils, food basins, jars, vases, medi-
cine bowls, ladles, dippers, and cups.

The colors used in their decoration are red, brown, yellow, and
black; and while many pieces are not decorated, these are exceptional,
as the figures have in several instances been obliterated by age or wear
in household use before burial. A method of ornamentation by spat-
tering with pigment was popular, and details of some of the more elabo-
rate figures are helped out by finely incised lines made after painting.
The food basins were most elaborately decorated on their interiors;
vases on the exterior. While in this respect cups were more like the
former, dippers resembled the latter, when ornamentation was employed.

In considering the ornamental symbolism of the Sikyatki pottery,
much aid can be had from present belief of the Indians, and some heip
may be derived from the character of modern symbolic decorations.
Many symbols can be interpreted by these aids; more are unintelli-
gible and the knowledge of the most intelligent of the living priests
can shed only an uncertain light on some of the more elaborate figures °
employed in ornamentation. The paleography of old Tusayan is yet
to be satisfactorily deciphered, and will tax the closest attention of the
student.

For purposes of study, the symbolism of the Sikyatki pottery is
grouped under three headings, according to the objects represented,
I will briefly consider pictures from each of these groups, which may
be designated as follows: (1) Figures of anthropomorphic gods and
human beings; (2) figures of animals and plants; (3) geometric designs,
terraces, bars, frets, and spirals.

The collection of bowls with figures of supernal and human beings
are among the most interesting. The favorite organ of the human
body to delineate was the hand, which is often beautifully drawn and
decorated. As arule, however, figures of animals are better made than
those of men, aud even more care seemed to have been given to purely
conventional patterns than to accurate delineations of objects by which
the artist was surrounded. Decorations often betray the antiquity of
modern customs. Asis well known the unmarried women of the modern
Tusayan towns dress their hair in two coils, one over each ear, but
after marriage their coiffure is of a wholly different character. In idols
used in secret ceremonials the heads of female personages are indicated
in the same way. The figures on several of the food basins from Sik.
yatki show that this peculiar method of dressing the hair is a very old
one among these people. At the time of Coronado, in 1540, it was
regarded so singular by the Spaniards, that one of the chignons used
by the Indians was sent with other presents to the King. We now
know that the fashion was older even than this, for Sikyatki was a ruin
before Coronado’s time, and no one ean tell how long before pious rever-
ence placed food basins with pictures of women whose hair was dressed

im this fashion in Sikyatki graves. 'The hair dresser knows of few

584 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

styles of coiffure older than this which has persisted continuously for
over four hundred years.

In the elaborate ceremonial system of both Pueblos and Navahoes, the
rite of stick-swallowing is introduced, in which a stick is forced down
the esophagus. In recent times, although sometimes attempted, this
repulsive performance has degenerated into a clever deception on the
part of the performer. If I am right in my interpretation of the deco-
ration of one of the food vessels from Sikyatki, the habit is of great
antiquity, for we have a figure represented on it of a person engaged in
this revolting act, thus verifying a widely spread tradition that in old
times the rite was practiced as a part of the Tusayan ritual. It is no
longer performed at Walpi, but is reported from Zuni and elsewhere.

One of the most important of all Tusayan mythic characters is a
heroic personage called the Little War God. He was a eultus hero,
and in early days is reputed to have freed the world of monsters which
afflicted earth and sky. This heroic demigod is personated today, and
his image occupies a convenient niche in many households. His con-
stant emblem are two parallel lines of pigment drawn across the cheeks
or breast, arms or legs. ,

This cultus hero is of no mean antiquity, but is as old as the time
when Sikyatki was in its prime, for a picture of him shooting an
unknown animal is drawn on a fragment of a food bowl. Asin modern
pictures, he bears on his face the two parallel marks which custom has
prescribed must be worn by the God of War today. Students of the
development of the arrow may find in this figure an indication of
the kind of arrow the prehistoric warrior of Sikyatki used, viz, a long
shaft with a short articulation to which the point is attached, as with
certain other American tribes.

The ancient ceramic picture writing of Sikyatki gives, in many
instances, Something more than the bare symbolism of the mytholog-
ical personage depicted. Of such a nature is a large fragment of a food
basin from the graves of that ancient village, which is adorned with a
representation of the Tusayan Harpy, Kwataka.

in existing folklore Kwataka or the Man Eagle was a bird-like mon-
ster, akin to the Thunderbird of other tribes of America, who afflicted
the ancient people by carrying off their wives and devouring their
children. His home was in the sky, and he is said to wear a garment
covered with flint arrowheads.

The fragment in question represents the Man Eagle about to devour
a problematical being. He is represented with the wings of a bird;
his claws are eagle talons; his eye has the cross, symbol of the heart of
the sky, or the star. But most interesting of all, he wears the flint-
covered armor represented by four lozenge-shape figures which recall
the Nahuatl symbol of the flint arrowpoint, techpatl.

As is known through Dr. Matthews’ studies, the Navahoes likewise
have a mythological being of similar import to that of the Hopi. By

the discovery of this picture at Sikyatki, four centuries or more old, we
are prepared to ask our Navaho students whether they can show an
equal antiquity of this conception among the people they study, and
to suggest the inquiry whether the Navahoes derived their idea from
the Pueblos.

It is not without some deep-seated meaning that of all organs of the
body, the Tusayan people of the ancient settlement at Sikyatki chose
the human hand for decorative purposes. We know that oriental people
do the same, and I have seen old Tusayan ware decorated with a human
hand, but never such beautiful representations as that which occurs on
the food vessels from Sikyatki. A figure of one of the best of these
will serve to show the care with which this member was used for decora-
tive purposes, but I must confess my inability to decipher the strange
appendage which it shares with other decorative elements of very dif-
ferent character.

Mammalian animals are sparingly used as decorative forms, but
among others may be mentioned the antelope, mountain lion, mountain
sheep, and rabbit. Especially instructive is the figure of a puma drawn
on the middle of the inside of a food vessel. The figure of a mountain
sheep is one of the best in the collection. There seems hardly a doubt
that these animal forms refer to mythic conceptions which are paralleled
in the beliefs of the inhabited pueblos today.

Serpents and bizarre reptilians figure conspicuously in decorative
animal pictography from Sikyatki, and betray in one or two instances
the antiquity of a cult which is strong at Walpi today. Prominent
among these is the great Plumed-head Serpent, the effigies and cere-
monials pertaining to which at Walpi I have elsewhere described
in detail. The serpent depicted on one of the food vessels is so close in
its symbolism to this mythic being of Tusayan folklore that it is prob-
able ophiolatry of a kindred sort was practiced in the ancient pueblo
of Sikyatki where it was found.

One of the most bizarre figures of reptiles in Sikyatkian ceramic
paleography adorns the inside of a reddish-colored food basin of rather
coarse construction. This figure reminds one of the horned toad, but
mythic rather than realistic elements preponderate in its delineation.
The most striking anatomical feature is without doubt the serrated dor-
sal fin, but like the Plumed Serpent it bears on the head horns and
feather appendages. There are two or more mythological reptilian
personages recognized in the modern Tusayan olympus to which this
picture may be referred, and it is not unlike the mythic lizard, who
guards the traditional entrance to the under world, called the sipapt.

A fragment of pottery from Awatobi was found to have a head iden-
tical with that of this lizard from Sikyatki, showing that the cult was
recognized in this neighboring village.

Of problematical reptilian forms, none are more conventional and
highly symbolic than the decoration of another food basin. Here we
586 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

have the plumed head, the curved claws, the elongated snout, and the
lizard-like body. I am ignorant of the proper identification of this
animal, which perhaps is pardonable, for the best informed of living
priests, whom I consulted, were also at a loss to explain the meaning
of this highly conventionalized figure.

The tadpole and frog are constant decorative elements in Sikyatki
picture writing as on modern ceremonial vessels, and no doubt had the
same purport—the hastening of copious rains sorely needed in that arid
land.

When we remember how large a part the bird and feathers play in
modern symbolism, and how extensively they permeate the Tusayan
ritual, it is not strange that by far the most widespread motif in Siky-
atki ceramic decoration is referable to this element. The feather ia
many forms, mostly conventionalized, is represented again and again
on basins, vases, and jars, and the bird is one of the most constant ani-
mals depicted in decorations.

The number of mythic birds with which the modern Tusayan mythol-
ogy is crowded suggests caution in ascribing avian figures, of which
there are many on Sikyatki pottery, to any one in preference to another
of these supernaturals. We may rightly identify the pictures of sey-
eral food basins as prehistoric representations of the High Sky Hagle,
the dreaded Harpy, Kwataka. ‘Two forms of feathers are recognized
in decoration which have been determined from their position on the
corresponding regions of these mythic birds. These are the tail feather
and the breast feather, both of which are prescriptive in modern
ceremonials.

Itis customary at the present day for the priests in the performace
of mysteries of their cults to use water from sacred springs for asperg-
ing and other purposes. This venerated liquid is brought to the sacred
rooms with ceremonials, and is transported and kept in small jars
during the rites. The custodians of this water tie a cotton string
around the neck of these vessels, and to this encircling string attach
others with appended feathers as prayer offerings. A similar custom
with modification was current at Sikyatki, except that instead of tying
the strings to the sacred jars, the feather was used as a decorative ele-
ment, and carefully painted on the side of the vase or jar.

The use of the dragon fly and moth or butterfly symbols has come
down to the modern priests from a remote antiquity, and no doubt at
Sikyatki, as at Walpi today, the former was an emblem of moisture;
the latter of fecundity. One of the most regularly formed and beauti-
fully decorated of these ancient vases is adorned with six figures ot
moths, and it is interesting that during all the lapse of time since a
clever Sikyatki woman painted it, the same signs of male and female
have survived. A well-drawn figure of a butterfly appears on the
interior of several food basins, and it is instructive to notice with what
care the antennve were depicted.

The ancient artists of Sikyatki recognized the flower as a decorative
element, but strangely enough, overlooked the leaf, which later came,
through foreign influence, to play such an important part in ornamental
possibilities. I find no instance in all decorations of the adaptation
of leaves to the adornment of ceramic productions by the Tusayan
ancients.

Of strange conceptions, none are more foreign to’ Aryan habits of
thought than that of a feathered rainbow, but such a tenacious hold had
this on the ancient potters of Sikyatki that they reproduced it in figures
in many of their pictures.

Geometrical figures form by far the majority of decorative elements
of the ancient pottery of Sikyatki. We have the key and terrace pat-
terns, spirals, frets, and scrolls. In their artistic productions, all the
elements of crosshatching, rectangular figures, stars, and circles, were
made to contribute to the ornamentation of their ceramics. Many of
these passed into conventional symbols, many were purely decorative,
but all testify the degree of artistic feeling which the ancient potters
of this town possessed. As works of esthetic feeling no less than
objects of scientific interest, the revelations of the Sikyatki cemeteries
are of greatest importance in the history of the evolution of geometrical
ornament.

Many of the encireling bands decorating vases and food basins are
broken at one point in their course. This break, ordinarily called the
line of life, is found in ancient pottery from the mounds of the Gila and
Salt rivers in southern Arizona, and is common in old Cibolan ware.
Jts meaning is symbolic, and probably the same as in modern ware as
pointed out by others.

Many of the food basins and some vases have parallel bars drawn at
intervals exteriorly on the rims or lips.’ These lines, two or three in
number, are sometimes so arranged as to form the letter H and recall
similar lines, four in number, made with sacred meal on the fuor walls
of a room during certain secret rites. This mode of decoration was
likewise a widespread one in ancient pueblo pottery, and is at times
followed by modern potters.

Of encircling lines, none are more problematical, from the point of
view of interpretation, than those with bars or dots at intervals, so
common on the exterior of many food basins. While distinetly con-
ventional, these decorative elements have a deeper symbolic meaning,
which would require many pages to elaborate.

The character and decoration of pottery from the two ruins, Awatobi
and Sikyatki, are very close to each other, and markedly different from
modern ware still manufactured at Hano and Walpi, only 3 miles dis-
tant from the latter ruin. These characteristics of resemblance are
common features of all ancient Tusayan ceramics. In other words,
modern pottery has greatly deteriorated, old decorative motifs have
passed out of use, and, what is more significant, new symbolic decorative
588 THE CLIFF VILLAGES OF THE RED ROCK COUNTRY.

elements have replaced the ancient. The answer to the question,
whence came these innovations, is outside the limits of this report.
The similarities of the ancient pottery found in Tusayan ruins far dis-
tant from each other implies a homogeneity in the people of Tusayan
which was indicative of closer kinship. Since the overthrow of Sik-
yatki and Awatobi, the consanguinity of the pueblos has been changed
by assimilation of foreign blood from other pueblos of Arizona and
New Mexico, as we know also from documentary and legendary history.
Groups of peoples from the Rio Grande pueblos have fled to Tusayan,
bringing their pottery with them, thus introducing other decorative
motifs as well as novel rituals and mythologies. It has thus resulted
that the ornamentation now used by the Tusayan potters is radically
different from that of the ancients.

By Prof. W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE, D.C. L., LL. D.

In a subject as yet so unmapped as anthropology there is more room
for considering different points of view than in a thoroughly organized
and limited science. The future structure of this science depends
largely on the apprehension of many different modes of treating it.
The time has not yet come when it can be handled as a whole, and
therefore at present we may frankly consider various questions from an
individual standpoint, without in the least implying that other considera-
tions should be taken into account. It is only by the free statement,
however one-sided, of the various separate views of the many PuDyeen:
involved in such a science that any comprehensive scheme of its
organization can ever be built up. In remarking, therefore, on some
branches at present I shall not attempt a judicial impersonality, but
rather try to express some views which have not yet been brought into
ordinary currency.

Elaborate definitions of anthropology have been formulated, but such
are only too lable to require constant.revision as fresh fields of research
are added to the domain. In any new country it is far safer to define
its limits than to describe all that it includes, and all that can yet be
done in anthropology is to lay down the ‘‘sphere of influence,” and
having secured the boundaries, then develop the resources at leisure.
The principle bordering subjects are zoology, metaphysics, economics,
literature, and history. So far as these refer to other species, as well
as to man, or to individuals rather than to the whole race, they stand
apart as subjects; but their relation to the human species as such is
essentially a part of anthropology. We must be prepared, therefore, to
take anthropology more as a study of man in relation to various and
often independent subjects than as an organic and _ self-contained
science. Human nature is greater than all formule; and we may as
soon hope to compact its study into a logical structure, as to construct
an algebraical een for pretee its course of thought.

590 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

Two of the commonest and most delightful elastic words in the sub-
ject may be looked at once more—‘‘ race” and “ civilization.” The defi-
nition of the nature of race is the most requisite element for any clear
ideas about man. Our present conception of the word has been modi-
fied recently more than may be supposed by our realizing the antiquity
of the species. When only a few thousand years had to be dealt with
nothing seemed easier or more satisfactory than to map out races on
the assumption that so many million people were descended from one
ancestor and so many from another. Mixed races were glibly sepa-
rated from pure races, and all humanity was partitioned off into well-
defined divisions. But when the long ages of man’s history and the
incessant mixtures that have taken place during the brief end of it
that is recorded come to be realized the meaning of ‘“‘race” must be
wholly revised. And this revision has not yet taken effect on the
modes of thought, though it may have demanded the assent of the
judgment. The only meaning that a ‘‘race” can have is a group of
persons whose type has become unified by their rate of assimilation
and affection, by their conditions exceeding the rate of change pro-
duced by foreign elements. If the rate of mixture exceeds that of
assimilation, then the people are a mixed race, or a mere agglomera-
tion, like the population of the United States. The greatest problems
awaiting solution are the conditions and rate of assimilation of races,
namely, what period and kind of life is needed for climatic and other
causes to have effect on the constitution and structure, what are the
causes of permanence of type, and what relative powers of absorption
one race has over the other. Until these problems are reduced to
something that can be reasonably estimated we shall only grope in the
dark as to all racial questions.

How, then, can these essential problems be attacked? Not by any
study of the lower races, but rather by means of those whose history
is best recorded. The great mode of isolation on which we can work is
religious difference, and oppressed religious minorities are the finest
anthropological material. The first question is (given a mixture of
various races in approximately known proportions, isolated, and kept
under uniform conditions), how soon does uniformity of type prevail,
or what proportions of diversity will be found after a given number of
generations? A perfect case of this awaits study in the Copts, who
have, by monogamy and the fanaticism of a hostile majority, been
rigorously isolated during twelve hundred years from any appreciable
admixture, and who before this settling time were compounded of eight
or ten different races, whose pature and extent of combination can be
tolerably appraised. A thorough study of the present people and their
forefathers, whose tombs of every age provide abundant material for
examination, promises to clear up one of the greatest questions—the
effect of climate and cenditions on assimilating mixed peoples. The
other great problem is, how far can a type resist changes of conditions,
4

.

RACE AND CIVILIZATION. 591

provided it be not mixed in blood so as to disturb the equilibrium of
constitution? This is to be answered by the Jews and the ‘Parsis. As
with the Copts, an oppressed religious minority has no chance of mix-
ture, as all mixed marriages are abhorrent to its exclusiveness and are
at once swept into the hostile majority. The study is, however, far
more difficult, owing to the absence of such good conditions of the preser-
vation of material. But nothing could throw so much light on this as
an excavation of some Jewish cemeteries of a thousand years or so ago
in various Huropean countries, and comparison of the skeletons with the
proportions of the Jews now living. The countries least affected by
the various proscriptions and emigrations of the race would be the proper
ground for inquiry. When these studies have been made we shall being
to understand what the constants of a race really are.

We will now look at another word which is incessantly used—* eivili-
zation.” Many definitions of this have been made, from that of the
Turk drinking champagne, who remarked about it that “ after all, civili-
zation is very nice,” up to the most elaborate combinations of art and
science. It is no doubt very comfortable to have a word which only
implies a tendency, and to which everyone can assign his own value;
but the day of reckoning comes, when it is brought into arguments as
aterm. Civilization really means simply the artof living in a commu-
nity, or the checks and counterchecks, the division of labor, and the
conveniences that arise from common action when a group of men live
in close relation to each other. This will perhaps be objected to as
including all, or nearly all, nankind in its scope. Quite true; all civill-
zation is relative and not absolute.

We shall avoid much confusion if we distinguish high and low types
of civilization, and also perfect and imperfect civilization. Like organ-
isms, we may have a low type of civilization very perfect in its strue-
ture, capable of endless continuance, and of great shocks without much
injury. Such are some of the civilizations of the African races who
have great orderliness and cleanliness of arrangements, and are capable
of active recuperation after warfare, without any internal elements of
instability. Again, some low types are very imperfect, and can only
exist by the destruction of others, while any severe shock destroys their
polity; the governments which only exist by raids and plunder, such
as that of the Zulus, illustrate this. Turning to high types of civiliza-
tion, we may see them perfect or imperfect. Countries of financial sta-
bility, not undergoing any rapid organic changes, are the more perfect
in type; while those deeply in debt and in continual revolution have
but imperfect civilization, of however high atype it may be. With
these types of all variety, from the highest complexity to the lowest
Simplicity, and of all degrees of perfection, or stability and completion,
in any given level of complexity—with these distinctions some of the
vagueness of verbal usage may perhaps be avoided.

592 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

Turning now from words to things, we may perhaps see some ground
for further consideration in even one of the best elaborated depart-
ments.

Jn the much vexed questions of skull measurements, the paucity of
clearly defined racial characteristics may make us look more closely as
to whether we are working on an analytic or empirical method. In
any physical problem the first consideration is the disentangling of
variables and isolation of each factor for separate study. In skulls,
however, the main measures are the length, which is compounded of a
half dozen elements of growth, and the breadth and height, each the
resultant of at least three elements. Two skulls may differ altogether
in their proportions and forms, and yet yield identical measures in
length, breadth, and height. How can any but empirical results be
evolved from such a system of measurement alone?

A departure from this mechanical method has appeared in Italy last
year by Professor Sergi. He proposes to classify skulls by their forms—
ellipsoid, pentagonoid, rhomboid, ovoid, ete. This, atleast, takes account
for the obvious differences which the numerous measurements wholly
ignore; and if skulls were crystals, divisible into homogeneous classes,
such a system would work, only, like all organic objects, they vary by
infinite gradation.

What, then, lies behind this variety of form? The variety of action
im the separate elements of growth. Sergi’s ellipsoid type means slight
eurvatures, with plenty of frontal growth. His pentagonoid means
sharper curvatures. His rhomboid means sharp curvatures, with small
frontal growth. And so in each class we have not to deal with a geo-
metrical figure, but with varying curvatures of the center of each
plate of the skull and varying extent of growth from the centers.

The organic definition of a skull must depend on the statement of
the energy and direction of each of the separate elements out of which
itis built. The protuberances or eminences are the first point to notice.
They record in their curves the size of the head when it attained rigid-
ity in the centers of growth. Every person bears the fixed outline of
parts of his infant skull. Little, if any, modification is made in the
sharpness of the curves between infancy and full growth; perhaps the
only change is made in course of the thickening of the skull. Hence,
the maximum radius of curvature of each plate of the skull is a most
radical measurement, as implying early or late final ossification. In
higher races finely rounded skulls with slight curvatures are more often
found; and this agrees with the deferred fixation of the skull pointed
out by the greater frequency of visible sutures remaining, both effects
being probably due to the need of accommodating a more continued
growth of the brain. Thelength of growth of each plate from its cen-
ter in different directions regulates the entire form of the skull. The
maximum breadth being far back implies that the parietals grow mostly
toward the frontal, or vice versa. The top being ridged means that the
ss Meee

RACE AND CIVILIZATION. 593

parietals grow conical and not spherically curved, and hence meet at
an angle.

It seems, therefore, that looking at the question as a physical prob-
lem, we are far more likely to detect racial peculiarities in the separate
data of the period of fixation of the skull, and of the amount of growth
in different directions, than by any treatment of gross quantities which
are compounded out of a number of variables. The practical develop-
ment of such a view is the work of the embryologist; here we only
notice a principle of treatment of a most complex question, which
seems to have too often been dealt with as if it were as simple as the
definition of a crystal.

When we next turn to look at the works of man, it seems that the
artistic side of anthropology has hardly been enough appreciated. In
the first place, the theory of art has been grounded more assuredly by
anthropological research than by all the speculations that have been
spun. The ever-recurring question, ‘‘ What is art?” whether in form or
in literature, has been answered clearly and decidedly. When we con-
trast a row of uninteresting individualities with the ideal beauty and
expression of a composite portrait compounded from these very ele-
ments, we are on the surest ground for knowing how such a beautiful
result is obtained. In place of the photographie verity of the person,
we have the artistic expression of a character. Whatever is essential
remains, and is strengthened; whatever is transient and unimportant
has faded away. No one can look, for instance, at the composite heads
of Jewish boys and their individual components, published some years
ago in the Anthropological Journal, without feeling the artistic beauty of
the composite and the unbalanced characters of the individuals. What
the camera does mechanically by mere superposition, the artist does
intelligently by selection. The unimportant, unmeaning phases of the
person, the vacuities of expression, the less worthy turns of the mind
are eliminated, whether in form or in words, and the essence of the
character is brought out and expressed. Such is the theory of artistic
expression which anthropology has established on a sure basis of exper-
iment, and which is thus proved to be neither fanciful nor arbitrary,
but to be a truly scientific process.

And as anthropology has thus aided art, the converse is also true—
art is one of the most important records of a race. Each group of
mankind has its own style and favorite manner, more particularly in
the decorative arts. A stray fragment of carving without date or
locality can be surely fixed in its place if there is any sufficient knowl-
edge of the art from which it springs. This study of the art of a peo-
ple is one of the highest branches of anthropology and one of the most
important, owing to its persistent connection with each race. No
physical characteristics have been more persistent than the style of
decoration. When we see on the Celtic work of the period of La Tene,
or on Irish carvings, the same forms as on medieval ironwork, and on

SM—95 38

594 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

the flamboyant architecture of France, we realize how innate is the
love of style, and how similar expressions will blossom out again from
the same people. Even later we see the hideous C-eurves, which are
neither foliage nor geometry, to be identical on late Celtic bronze, on
Louis XV carvings, and even descending by imitation into modern furni-
ture. Such long descent of one style through great changes of history
is not only characteristic of Celtic art, but is seen equally in Italy.
The heavy, stiff, straight-haired, staring faces of the Constantine age
are generally looked on as being a mere degradation of the imported
Greek art; but they are really a native revival, returning to old Italian
ideals, so soon as Greek influence waned. In the Vatican is an infant
Hercules of thorough Constantinian type, yet bearing an Etruscan
inscription, proving the early date of such work. Farther East the
long persistent styles of Egypt, of Babylonia, of India, of China, which
outlived all changes of government and history, show the same vitality
of art. We must recognize, therefore, a principle of ‘‘racial taste,”
which belongs to each people as much as their language, which may be
borrowed like languages from one race by another, but which survives
changes and long eclipses even more than language. Such a means of
research deserves more systematic study than it has yet received.

But if we are to make any wide comparisons and generalizations, a
free study of material is essential, and the means of amassing and
comparing work of every age is ‘the first requisite. This first requisite
is unhappily not to be found in England. The conception of collecting
material for the study of man’s history has as yet little root, and strug-
gles to find a footing between the rival conceptions of the history of
art and the life of modern man. The primary difficulty is the character
of the museum accommodation at present provided. This is all of an
elaborate and expensive nature, in palatial buildings and on highly
valued sites. 'o house the great mass of objects of either ancient or
modern peoples in such a costly manner is impracticable, and hence, at
present, nothing is preserved but what is beautiful, strange, or rare.
In short, our only subjects of study are the exceptional aud not the
usual products of races. The evil traditions of a “collection of curiosi-
ties” still brood over our materials, and until we face the fact that for
study the common things are generally more important than the rare
ones, anthropology must remain much as chemistry would if we were
restricted to the study of pretty colors and sweet scents.

Until we have an anthropological storehouse on a great scale we can
not hope to preserve those materials which are now continually being
lost to study for lack of reasonable accommodation. Such astorehouse
should be on the cheapest ground near London, built in the simplest
weather-tight fashion, and capable of indefinite expansion without
rearrangement or alteration of existing parts. It should contain no
baits for burglars, all valuable objects being locked up in the security
of the British Museum, to which such a storehouse would form a
Cr

RACE AND CIVILIZATION. 59

succursal, greatly relieving the present overcrowded state of many
departments. To such a storehouse for students all that does not serve
for public education, or that is not portable or of much saleable value,
should be consigned. There the piles of architectual fragments which
are essential for study, but are useless to show the public, should be
stacked in classified order. There the heaps of pottery of ancient and
modern races should all be arranged to illustrate every variety of form
and style. There the series of entire tombs of other races and of our
own should be set out in their original arrangement, as in the Bologna
Museum. ‘There whole huts, boats, etc., could be placed in their proper
order and sequence, while photographs of the showy educational speci-
mens and valuable in the public museums could fill their places in the’
arrangement. That such a storehouse is needed may be illustrated
by a collection gleaned in a few months’ work this year. It represents
the small products of a little village and a cemetery of a new race in
Egypt. But there is no possibility of keeping such a collection together
in any London museum, and but for the new Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford having been lately built with a wide view to its increase, it is
doubtful if in any place in England such a collection could be kept
together. What happens to one excavator this year may happen to a
dozen excavators per annum in a generation or two hence, and so long
as Space is not available to preserve such collections when they are
obtained, invaluable material is being irrevocably wasted and destroyed.
Besides the theoretical and scientific side of anthropology, there is
also a very practical side to it which has not received any sufficient
development as yet. Anthropology should in our nation be studied
first and foremost as the art of dealing with other races. I can not do
better than quote a remark from the address of our previous president,

Gen. Pitt Rivers, a remark which has been waiting twenty-three years

for further notice. He said: ‘“ Nor is it unimportant to remember that
anthropology has its practical and humanitarian ‘aspect; and that as
our race is more often brought into contact with savages than any
other, a knowledge of their habits and modes of thought may be of the
utmost value to us in utilizing their labor, as well as in checking those

inhuman practices from which they have but too often suffered at our

hands.”

The foremost principle whith should be always in view is that the
civilization of any race is not a system which can be changed at will.
Every civilization is the growing product of a very complex set of con-

- ditions, depending on race and character, on climate, on trade, and every

minutia of the circumstances. To attempt to alter such a system apart
from its conditions is impossible. For instance, whenever a total change
is made in government, it breaks down altogether, and a resort to the
despotism of one man is the result. When the English constitution
was swept away Cromwell or anarchy was the alternative. When the
French constitution was swept away Napoleon was the only salvation
596 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

from anarchy. And if this is the case when the externals of govern-
ment alone are altered, how much more is it the case if we attempt to
uproot the whole of a civilization and social life? We may despotieally
force a bald and senseless imitation of our way on another people, but
we Shall only destroy their life without implanting any vitality in its
place. No change is legitimate or beneficial to the real character of a
people except what flows from conviction and the natural growth of
the mind. And if the imposition of a foreign system is injurious, how
miserable is the forcing of a system such as ours, which is the most
complex, unnatural, and artificial that has been known—a system
developed in a cold country, amid one of the hardest, least sympathetic,
and most self-denying and calculating of all peoples of the world. Such
a system, the product of such extreme conditions, we attempt to force
on the least developed races, and expect from them an implicit subservi-
ence to our Ulogical law and our inconsistent morality. The result is
death; we make a deadhouse and call it civilization. Scarcely a single
race can bear the contact and the burden. And then we talk compla-
cently about the mysterious decay of savages before white men.

Yet some people believe that a handful of men who have been muti-
lated into conformity with civilized ideas are better worth having than
a race of sturdy, independent beings. Let us hear what becomes of
the unhappy produets of our notions. On the Andaman Islands an
orphanage, or training school, was started and more than forty children
were reclaimed from savagery,or torn from a healthy and vigorous life.
These were the results: “Of all the girls two only have continued in
the settlement, the other survivors having long since resumed the cus-
toms of their jungle homes. - - - Physically speaking, training has
a deteriorating effect, for of all the children who have passed through
the orphanage probably not more than ten are alive at the present time,
while of those that have been married two or three only have become
parents, and of their children not one has been reared.”! Such is the
result of our attempts on a race of low but perfect civilization, whom
we eradicate in trying to improve them.

Let us now turn to our attempts on a higher race, the degenerated and
Arabized descendants of a great people—the Egyptians. Here there
is much ability to work on, and also a good standard of comfort and
morality, conformable to our notions. Yet the planting of another
civilization is scarcely to be borne by them. The Europeanized Egyp-
tian is in most cases the mere blotting paper of civilization, absorbing
what is most superficial and undesirable. The overlaying of a French
or English layer on a native mind produces only a hybrid intellect,
from which no natural growth or fertility can be expected. Far the
more promising intellects arethose trained by intelligent native teachers,
where as much as can be safely assimilated has grown naturally as a
development of the native mind.

RACE AND CIVILIZATION. 597

of raising the intellect in some cases if we can not do it in all? The
harm is that you manufacture idiots. Some of the peasantry are taught
to read and write, and the result of this burden which their fathers
bore not is that they become fools. I can not say this too plainly; an
Egyptian who has had reading and writing thrust on him is, in every
ease that I have met with, half-witted, silly, or incapable of taking care
of himself. His intellect and his health have been undermined and
crippled by the forcing of education. With the Copt this is quite
different; fathers have been scribes for thousands of years, and his
capacity is far greater, so that he can receive much more without dete-
rioration. Observation of these people leads to the view that the aver-
age man can not receive much more knowledge than his immediate
ancestors. Perhaps a quarter or a tenth more of ideas can be safely
put into each generation without deterioration of mind or body; but, at
the best, growth of the mind can in the average man be but by fractional
increments in each generation, and any large increase will surely be
deleterious to the average mind, always remembering that there are
exceptions both higher and lower. Such a result is only what is to be
expected when we consider that the brain is the part of man which
develops and changes as races reach a higher level, while the body
remains practically constant through ages. To expect the brain to
make sudden changes of ability would be as reasonable as to expect a
cart horse to breed racers, or a greyhound to tend sheep. Man mainly
develops by internal differences in his brain structures, as other ani-
mals develop by external differences in bones and muscles.

What, then, it may be asked, can be done to elevate other races?
How ean we benefit them? Most certainly not by Europeanizing them.
By real education, leading out the mind to a natural and solid growth,
much can be done; but not by enforcing a mass of accomplishments
and artificialities of life. The general impression in England is that
reading, writing, and arithmetic are the elements of education. They
might be so to us ‘“‘in the foremost files of time,” but they assuredly are
not so to other races. The complex ideas of connecting forms and
sounds is far too great a step for many brains, and when we succeed,
to our delight, in turning out finished readers, Nature comes in with the
stern reply, ‘‘Of their children not one has been reared.” Our bigoted
belief in reading and writing is not in the least justified when we look
at the mass of mankind. The exquisite art and noble architecture of
Mykene, the undying song of Homer, the extensive trade of the
Bron. e Age, all belonged to people who never read or wrote. At this
day some of my best friends, in Egypt, are happily ignorant of such
accomplishments, and assuredly I never encourage them to any such
useless waste of their brains. The great essentials of a valuable char-
acter—moderation, justice, sympathy, politeness and consideration,
quick observation, shrewdness, ability to plan and prearrange, a keen
sense of the uses and properties of things—all these are the qualities
on which I value my Egyptian friends, and such qualities are what

598 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

should be evolved by any education worth the name. No brain, how-
ever humble, will be the worse for such education which is hourly in
use; while in the practical life of a simple community the accomplish-
ments of reading and writing are not needed for perhaps a week or a
month at a time. The keenest interest is taken by some races, and
probably by all, in geography, modes of government, and social sys-
tems; and in most countries elements of hygiene and improvements in
the dwellings and arts of life may be taught with the best results.
There is, therefore, a very wide field for the education of even the
lowest races, without throwing any great strain on the mental powers.
And it must always be remembered that memory is far more perfect
where a less burden of learning is thrown on the mind, and ideas and
facts can be remembered and brought into use more readily by minds
unstrained by artificial instruction.
The greatest educational influence, however, is example. This is
obvious when we see how rapidly the curses of our civilization spread
among those unhappily subjected to it. The contact of Europeans with
lower races is almost always a detriment, and it is the severest reflec-
tion on ourselves that such should be the case. It is a subject which
has given much room for thought in my own dealings with the Egyp-
tian peasant to consider how this deleterious effect is produced and
how it is to be avoided. Firstly, it is due to carelessness in leaving
temptations open to natives, which may be no temptations to ourselves.
To be careless about sixpenees is as demoralizing to them as a man who
tossed sovereigns about the street would be tous. HExamples of care-
lessness in this point are among the worst of influences. Another
injury is the inducement to natives to imitate the ways and custom of
Europeans without reason. Every imitation, aS mere imitation, 1s a
direct injury to character; it teaches a man to trust to some one else
instead of thinking for himself; it induces a belief in externals consti-
tuting our superiority, while foresight and self-restraint are the real
roots of it; and it destroys all chance of any real and solid growth of
character which can flourish independently.’ A native should always
be discouraged from any imitation, unless he attempts it as an intelli-
gent improvement on his own habits. Another sadly common eyil is
the abuse of power, which lowers the sense of self-respect, of honor, and
of honesty which can be found in most races. If a man or a govern-
ment defrauds, it is but natural to the sufferer to try to recompense
himself by any means available; and thus an interminable system of
reprisals is set up. Such is the chronic state of the Hast at present
among the more civilized races. The Egyptians are notorious for their
avarice, and are usually credited with being inveterate money grabbers;
yet no sooner do they find that this system of reprisals is abandoned
and strict justice maintained, than they at once respond to it; and I
may say that when confidence has once been gained it is almost as com-
mon to find a man dispute an account against his own interest as for
himself, and scarcely ever is any attempt made at false statements or
RACE AND CIVILIZATION. 599

impositions. Such is the healthy response to straightforward dealing
with them.
It is therefore in encouraging a healthy growth of all that is worthy
; and good in the existing systems of lower civilization, in repressing all
mere imitations and senseless copying, and in proceeding on a rigor-
ously just yet genial course of conduct, that the safe and true line lies
for intercourse with inferior or different civilizations.

And, lastly, the question comes home to us, In what way is this
practical anthropology to be fostered? It is so essentially important
to us as a race that we should take good care that it is understood.
Whether it be a question of interference with the customs of higher
races, as the Hindu, or of lower savages, as the Australian, momentous
questions may often depend on public cpinion among a mass of people
in England who have no conception at present of the race with whom
they are dealing. And still more needful is it for those who take part
abroad in the government of other races to have a wide view of the
character of various civilizations. Until the present generation, there
have been two great educative influences on the view of life taken by
Englishmen—the Old Testament and the classics. So long as a boy
had his ideas formed in contact with Oriental polygamy and Greek
polytheism, he was not in danger of undue narrowness in dealing with
the Muslim or the Hindu; but with the pressure of modern require-
ments both of these excellent views of other civilizations are being
crowded out, and we meet men now to whom the world’s history began:
when they were born. There is great danger in such ignorance. All
the painful and laborious experiments in social and political problems
during past ages are ignored, rash trials are made on lines which have
been repeatedly proved to be impossible, and the real advance in any
direction is thwarted by useless repetitions of the well-known failures
of the past. .

Itis the business of anthropology to step in and make a knowledge
of other civilizations a part of all decent education. In this direction
our science has a most important field before it, at least as valuable as
geography and history, and far more practical in developing ideas than

| many of the smatterings now taught. To present a view of another
| civilization, we require to give an insight into the way of looking at
the world, the modes of thought, the aims of life, the checks and counter-
: checks on the weaknesses of man, and the construction of society and
of government in each case. The origin and utility of the various cus-
toms and habits need to be pointed out, and in what way they are rea-
Sonable and needful to the well-being of the community. And, above
all, we ought to impress on every boy that this civilization in which he
grows is only one of the innumerable experiments of life that has been
tried; that it is by no means the only successful one, or perhaps not the
most successful, that there has been; that there are many other solu-
tions of the problems of community and culture which are as good as
our own, and that no one solution will fit a difierent race, climate, or set
of conditions.

600 RACE AND CIVILIZATION.

How such a sense of proportion in the world is to be attained, and
what course of instruction will eradicate political fanaticism and plant
a reasonable tolerance of other forms of civilization is the problem
before us as practical anthropologists. The highest form of this per-
ception of other existence is reached in the best bistory—writing or
fiction—which enables the reader to strip himself for the time of his
prejudices and view of life and reclothe the naked soul with an entirely
different personality and environment. Very few writers, and those
only in rare instances, can reach this level. It needs consummate
knowledge, skill, sympathy, and abandon in the writer, and if without
these, it is neither accurate nor inspiring. The safer course is to care-
fully select from the best literature of a civilization, and explain and
illustrate this so as to leave no feature of it outside of the reason and
feelings of the reader. Here we run against the special bigotry of the
purely classical scholar, who looks on ancient literature as a peculiar
preserve solely belonging to those who will labor to read it in its orig-
inal dress. No one limits an acquaintance with Hebrew, Egyptian, or
Arabie authors to those who can deal with those tongues, and Greek
and Latin authors ought to be as familiar to the English reader as
Milton or Macaulay. To say that because it is impossible in a business
education to give several years to a working knowledge of ancient lan-
guages, that therefore all thought written in those languages shall be a
sealed book, is pedantry run mad. A few months or even weeks on
translation will at least open the mind and give an intelligent sense of
the variety and the standpoint of the intellect of the past. And such
a course is certainly better than the total ignorance which now prevails
on such lines where the classics are not taught.

What seems to be the most practical course would be the recognition
of civilization or social life as a branch of general reading to be stimu-
lated in schools and encouraged by subsequent inquiry as to the extent
to which it is followed and understood, without making it an additional
fang of the examination demon.

The books required for such reading should cover the life of “ieee
Rome, Babylon, Egypt, and Mexico in ancient times; and China, India,
Persia, Russia, Spain, and one or two low rilhae ims, such as the
Andamans and the Zulus, in modern times. Neither histories nor
travels are wanted for this purpose, but a selection of the literature
which shall most illustrate the social life and frame of the community,
with full explanation and illustrations. We need not to excite wonder,
astonishment, or disgust, but rather to enable the reader to realize the
daily life, and to live in the very minds of the people. Where no liter-
ature is available, a vivid study of the nature of the practical working
of their civilization should take its place.

Such is the practical scope of anthropology in our daily life, where
it needs as inuch consideration and will exercise as great an influence
as any of the other subjects dealt with by this Association.
POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY.!

By MAXIME COLLIGNON.

In the days when Hittorff had proven conclusively in his writings
that Greek architects constantly employed polychromy, an archeolo-
gist, a determined adversary of the new theory, traveled all over Greece,
resolved to see nothing that could be opposed to his views. One of
his followers had climbed to the cornice of a temple, and while explor-
ing it, the following dialogue was heard: ‘‘Do you find any traces of
color?” “Yes!” “Come down instantly!” Uniess we employ the same
method, it is very difficult nowadays to doubt that the Greeks painted
their statues. The question is a matter of fact, and arguments drawn
merely from «esthetics, or from sentiment, can not prevail against abun-
dant testimony.

Not only do excavations in Greece, in Olympia, Athens and Delphi
furnish us many an imposing series of sculptures, uninjured by indis-
creet restoration and still preserving, as they came forth from the soil,
traces, and sometimes actually startling traces, of painted decorations,
but the catalogues of the great museums of Europe report periodically
among their new acquisitions Greek marbles on which the practiced eye
very quickly discovers unmistakable vestiges of painting. And who
could possibly measure the harm that has been done in this respect by
the fatal mania of so-called restoration and of thorough cleansing, from
which we are now happily delivered? The principle of polychromy
itself is no longer contested. The account of former controversies
would now hardly offer more than one single kind of interest. This
would be to see how a prejudice gradually declined that had been born
in the days of the Renaissance, defended in the name of modern iesthet-
ics, and yielding, step by step, and with frequent rebellions, to the
reality of facts. But though on this point all discussion is at an end,
yet the question remains open. In fact, it is evident that polychromy
has been applied in various ways, and that during the five or six cen-
turies in which Greek art has enjoyed an independent life, the progress
made in technical matters, as well as in style, has modified the rules
which controlled the painting of statues. The problem which in our
day preoccupies the historians of antique art is mainly historical.
What is the nature of the evolution through which polychromy has
passed from the beginning of Greek art to the masterpieces produced

by such great masters as Scopas and Praxiteles? Can we possibly
mark all the steps and landmarks, can we determine for each period
what were the rules that governed the painters of statues? The most
conclusive answer would certainly be a systematic statement of the
facts that have been observed. Without claiming such accuracy here,
I shall endeavor to characterize, with the assistance of the most import-
ant testimony, the principal phases through which Greek pclychromy
has passed.' |
Il.

In order to explain the use of polychromy in Greece, frequent refer-
ence is made to the influence of the climate, to the peculiarity of an
intense light which often blinds the sight, and which on hot summer
days, drowns, as it were, the shapes of things and their outlines. At
hours when the heat is less fierce, this diffusion of light seems to
have no other end than to caress colored forms, and this ‘‘all joyous
sky,” to quote a Greek poet, would look almost offended by the cold
and dim “tones,” with which we must be content in our climate. This
argument has not lost its value because it has so often been invoked,
and we are still quite ready to acknowledge that a privileged sky has
evoked in the Greeks, as in the Egyptians and the Asiaties, an instinet
and a necessity for color. But polychromy exists already in primitive
Hellas, long before art was sufficiently advanced to understand its
laws and to analyze its harmonies. It has the same origin as the plas-
tic art, and a very modest beginning it is. At a time when statuary
was represented, all in all, by a few wooden statues, which wandering
image carvers squared with the ax and shaped with the saw and the
gauge, painting was the never-failing complement of the work of these
implements; if serves to conceal its shortcomings and gives to the
work a semblance of life. Ancient writings allude more than once to
old idols, painted or gilt, and we know that when religious traditions
require it, even in the classic period such wooden images were produced
and adorned with colors. Thus at Delos, in the third century, a statue
of this kind was ordered to be made every year, to be worshipped on
the great festive day of Dionysius; it passed through the hands of the

‘Quatremére de Quincey was the first to undertake a systematic study of antique
polychromy in the Jupiter Olympien (Paris, 1815). Much has been written on this
question, and as for ancient works we must refer the reader to the list of writings
given by Mr. Sittl, Archzeologie der Kunst, page 414, in the Handbuch der klassi-
schen Altertums-Wissenschaft of Iwan von Miiller, Munich, 1895. We shall quote

painter, who received the same compensation as the sculptor.! What
such daubing may have been toward the eighth century before our
era, we can at least imagine easily enough, when we look at the
primitive terra-cotta figures, and the popular images which have come
down to us like so many cheap reductions of idol statues. This vio-
lent daubing, these red patches that stain the cheekbones, give us an
impression of what this barbarous coloring may have been; and the
impression would no doubt be very much the same if the impossible
should happen, and we should dig up some wooden statue. To look for
laws which define the use of polychromy in works that no longer exist
would be building castles in the air. But what these ancient records
teach us is to make allowance for the religious sentiment that dwells
in these naive esthetics which associate color with shape. According
to old Greek ideas, the statue of the god is really animated by a divine
power; these idols are living beings. Statues are believed to move
their hands, perspire drops of blood, and impart to such as touch them
a supernatural strength. They change miraculously their habitation—
a Statue of Apollo goes and defends the walls of Corcyra. They are
adorned with jewels and with clothes; they are perfumed like other
beings of flesh and blood. As a matter of course, the image of the god
must have every appearance of life, and art must employ all its resources,
giving them both shape and color. This coloring will at first be a crude
daubing, but it will please the god and the Xéavov under its layer of
vermillion or of “lees of wine”, and will fill the devout worshippers
with the same awe with which they were later on inspired by the Athene
of Phidias, resplendent at the Parthenon in all the brillianey and glory
of her rich, metallic polychromy.

We will now leave those obscure days and turn our attention to
others still very distant, but such as have left us unmistakable evi-
dence—we mean monuments. During the seventh century before our
era, Greek sculpture began to employ a material that is more durable
than wood. Certain privileged schools already used marble that came
from Paros or Naxos, but in continental Greece the sculptors were still
content with softer stone—first a friable limestone, full of shells and
abounding in cavities; later, as their tocls improved and they were
better able to choose their material, a stone of closer grain and more
resistance. The study which we are able in our day to devote to these
primitive sculptures extends already over a considerable number of
monuments. From the metopes of Sélinonte to the recently discovered
sculptures at Delphi, belonging to the treasure of the Sycionians, a
large number of such examples might be enumerated. The tufa pedi-
ments, sculptured in bas-relief or in high-relief, which were found from
1882 to 1888 in the excavations of the Acropolis at Athens, occupy a
place of honor in this remarkable series of works.’

604 POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY.

If wooden statuary already requires the use of colors, sculptures of
soft stone exact it likewise as an indispensable complement. The
sculptor who uses this friable material that yields so readily to the
chisel can not reproduce all the details of the shapes that make up his
model. And even if he wished it, even if he had the talent that is
needed, he would not be able to do it because of the imperfect tools
and the quality of the stone. It has been very justly asserted that the
monuments themselves attest the inefficiency of the tools that these
primitive artists used; it was always the saw and the gauge with which
these image makers shaped their wooden idols. A sculptor of the sixth
century might have carved a stone so as to produce a statue or a pedi-
ment, but would he have considered his work completed when he had
summarily modeled large, level surfaces and hollowed out the limestone
with his gauge so as to shape the curls of the head or the folds of the
drapery? His eye will be shocked by the defects in the stone, by the
rough and uneven aspect it presents. ‘There will be a call for painting
that is here also to play its part, to conceal the imperfections of the
material, to beautify the work, and to give to the statue its final, definite
aspect. In such cases, polychromy ought to be as complete as possible,
and it is thus, indeed, that the monuments show it to us, especially the
pediments of the Acropolis, in which color, freely diffused over all the
sculptured parts, covers them with simple, quiet tints liberally dis-
tributed. Thus we obtain a well-established law for primitive Greek
art, whether the work be a statue or a bas-relief—sculpture in soft stone
requires complete coloring.

What is, on the other hand, the representative value, so to call it, of
such polychromy? Does it aim at reproducing the reality of the colors,
to give within the limits of its resources the semblance of life? As far
as statuary, properly so called, is concerned, we hardly possess any-
thing more than mere fragments—some heads and parts of draped
statues.' They show us some reds and some blues applied to the gar-
ments. At times the flesh is painted red. As we meet with the same
colors in monumental sculptures, we may take it for granted that poly-
chromy follows the same laws in both cases and preserves the same
character. Now it is, beyond all doubt, purely conventional. Hxam-
ine with a view to this point the most remarkable of the pediments
carved in soft stone that has been found on the Acropolis of Athens,
that which contains, among other figures, the strange shape of Typhon,
consisting of three busts of men, each of them provided with a ser-
pent’s tail.2, The prevailing colors are red and blue. They alternate in
long stripes, which cover the bodies of the serpents, in the ornamenta-
tion of the unfolded wing belonging to one of the busts. The absolute
indifference of the painter with regard to truthfulness, or even proba-
bility, is clearly enough shown by the eccentric coloring of the heads.

POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY. 605

Who does not nowadays know the head of one of the triple busts of
Typhon, or “Blue Beard,” to give its popular name?! With his blue
hair and beard, his big eyes and their yellow eyeballs, his green iris
hollowed out inte a black hole to represent the pupil, this head would
seem to have been a challenge to good sense if we did not know that
the painter had purposely remained within the bounds of conventional
rules. In like manner we see, with no very great astonishment, among
the fragments of another pediment, two lions with pale pink bodies tear-
ing with their claws the body of a blue bull, on which long red lines
represent streams of blood. Blue and red are evidently the favorite
colors of architectural polychromy, and their choice is easily explained.
The painter who colored these pediments desired, first of all, to bring
them in harmony with the architecture. He therefore employed the
same warm and vibrating tones which enliven the architraves and the
ogees.

Painting all over, because the material requires it, conventional paint-
ing, because it had to conform to that used in architecture—such is
the nature of polychromy in monumental sculpture toward the middle
of the sixth century before our era. When this rule is applied to
bas-reliefs it leads to consequences which are original enough to be
pointed out here. In fact, the polychromy of bas-reliefs, looked at in
the light of what in the language of studios is known as the relation of
values, may be considered under two aspects, either the figures stand out
vigorously from a light background or they are disappearing in the clear
from a dark background. The primitive artist who worked in soft stone
naturally preferred the former method. One of the pediments of the
Acropolis of Athens, that in which Hercules fights the hydra of Lernea,
shows us a kind of silhouette reproduction of figures painted all over
on a ground which preserves the natural color of the stone.?. The com-
bined effect recalls quite forcibly that produced by vases with black
figures, on which the various personages contrast with a ground of
clay. This analogy with the painting of vases has seemed more strilk-
ing since we have become acquainted with the tufa metopes of the treas-
ure of the Sicyonians discovered at Delphi. Notonly has the background
on these metopes never been touched by the brush of the painter, but by
the side of personages, colored with bister or an orange-red, inscriptions
in black letters indicate their names.’ We could not imagine a more
perfect resemblance to the decoration of a Corinthian vase. Such facts
lead us to think that the polychromy of the bas-reliefs has pretty closely
followed the traditions of painting. Thus, it also feels effects of the

revolution which about 520 or 530 modified the technics of painted
vases. Under the influence of the progress made by painting, and car-
ried away by an impulse due perhaps to the innovations of Cimon of
Cléones,' the ceramists abandoned their old methods. In the place of
those black silhouettes, set off by a kind of slip or white paste, but
rather sad of aspect, they now prefer clear figures enclosed in a brilliant ~
black ring; in other words, they reverse the relation of values. Will
the painters of bas-reliefs remain faithful to superannuated customs?
We know they did not. Here, for instance, is a well-known monument,
contemporary with the first Attic vases with red figures—we mean the
Stela of Véladinéza—in which an Athenian, Aristion, is represented
in war costume. The ground has preserved a somber tint that sets
off the bright effects of the flesh parts and the nets of the hair, which
are skillfully managed so as to isolate certain details, like the shoulder
piece of the armor.? One of the most important discoveries which we
owe to the excavations made by the French School at Delphi furnishes
an additional argument. In the magnificent frieze of the Treasure of
the Siphnians the ground had been painted blue, and if the armor and
the clothes have kept some traces of color, no such are seen on the uncoy-
ered parts. The artist had, moreover, taken care to prevent the colors
of the accessory parts from being confounded with those of the ground.
A warrior may have a blue helmet on his head, but this part of his
armor is very cunningly surrounded by a red edging, and thus the eye
perceives the outlines very accurately. The painting of bas-reliefs is

evidently inclining toward a new system, which will cause sustained
efforts to be maintained, and in order to continue a comparison borrowed
from ceramic painting, a polychromatic painting will, as far as the total
effect is concerned, recall the effect of a vase on which red figures stand
out from a dark ground.

The stela of Véladinéza and the frieze of the Siphnians are marble
sculptures. The evolution of which we are speaking coincides, as we
have shown, with the employment of a material finer than soft stone,
and which, toward the middle of the sixth century, almost everywhere
took the place of the tufa, so dear to old sculptors. With the use of
marble for sculptures, polychromy also entered upon a new phase.

Marble is for us a rare and costly material; there is, as it were, a feel-
ing of economy in our regard for it, and this is no doubt one of the

kind of sacrilege. To apply an artificial coloring to beautiful Greek
marble, with its pure grain, seemed to be almost a profanation. No
doubt the Greeks knew its full value. The marble of Paros was an
article of exportation, and, notwithstanding the richness of their own
Pentelicon, the Athenians bought it and paid a good price for it. But
marble was still only ‘“‘“white stone” for them; in other words, a stone of
greater beauty and greater consistency than limestone, offering in
these very qualities greater advantages to the architect and the seulp-
tor. The use of this new material did not at once cause old habits to
be abandoned; polychromy does not disappear; it is only somewhat
changed. A safe instinct warns sculptors that this close and highly
polished grain, this warm transparency, this gentle glow, must all con-
tribute to the beauty of artistic work, and that the problem which they
have to solve is, how to conciliate the exigencies of the material with
those of color. This problem archaic masters are bent upon solving,
and they do it with as much good taste as decisiveness.

We are nowadays perfectly well informed as to the painting of
archaic marble statues, and, to speak only of the most widely known’
discoveries, the excavations on the Acropolis of Athens have revealed
it to us in unexpected accuracy. The statues of women, gathered
together in the Museum of the Acropolis, are well known. These mar-
ble figures, which revive for us the contemporaries of the Pisistratides,
have often been described; their somewhat stiff attitudes have been
commented upon with some self-complacency; their gestures, appar-
ently regulated by a kind of coquettishness, have been studied, as well as
their festive costumes, with their long, regular folds, and the cunning
arrangement of the hair.! The minute carefulness of the execution
‘warns us that the art of working in marble has now reached its highest
technical perfection, and that any progress to be made hereafter can
only be a progress in style. The artists who have carved these statues,
between 520 and 480, are sure of their chisels, as the painters who
decorate them are sure of their principles. Polychromy now follows
established rules and no longer proceeds by experiments. We may
therefore choose an example which will save us long descriptions, and
examine, from among the statues of the Acropolis, one of those that
has preserved most valuable traces of having been painted.? Let us
look first at the head, with its hair curiously wrought in detail by the
chisel; curls are rising stage upon stage in front, tresses are flowing
down upon the breast, a mass of hair is spread out over the shoulders
in one large sheet, as it were, marked with regular undulations. In

The most complete account of this subject will be found in Mr. Lechat’s articles
in the Bulletin de correspondance hellénique 1890, pages 501-362, 552-586. The same
author has very closely examined the polychromy of statues, and I only sum up here
his conclusions.

order to perfect the sculptor’s work, but one plain tint will be required,
and this tint is borrowed from one of the conventional colors, the red-
dish brown, which is going to be constantly used, even at a much later
date, by the painters of statues. In contrast with this quiet and solid
coloring, the flesh of the face is left as it is, and the tone of the marble
reappears, together with its transparency. On the other hand, the lips
are red; the eyebrows and lids are marked with a black line; the pupil
is black and surrounded by a red circle, to represent the iris. Poly-
chromy, heretofore total and complete, is now therefore limited to cer-
tain parts—to the same parts which in living nature contrast by their
natural coloring with the color of the skin. If we next examine the
costume, we notice here the same recoiling of solid colors which makes
room for the whiteness of the marble. Here, again, color takes refuge
in the decorations, large stripes embroidered with fretwork and wind-
ing lines which adorn the front of the chiton or the borders of the
peplos; in the laces which border the neck of the chemisette, in the
flowery shapes, the foliage, and the crosses that form, as it were, a scat-
tering of seed on the drapery. Everywhere else the tone of the marble
recalls the warm whiteness of woolen or linen stuffs, and if the painter
does not altogether forego the solid colors he reserves them for more
limited spaces, like the top of the chemisette, which shows from under
the drapery of the peplos. The colorist employs this polychromy, that
has now become but partial, with great caution. He takes pains to
engrave with a burin a kind of sketch of the ornamentation, and this
slight hint guides his brush so as to follow the complicated design of
the fretwork and winding outlines. This is, besides, a process by no
means peculiar to Athenians. The seated statue of Chares in the
British Museum, the statue of the Victory of Archermos in the Central
Museum at Athens, all preserve alike traces of this engraved sketch
which bears witness to the use of painting, even at a time when every
vestige of color has disappeared.

Thus, we find the statue painted according to the rules of archaic
polychromy. Dull, solid colors, without transparency, stand out from
the marble which forms the ground. The tones that prevail in this
scale of colors, limited as it is, are always the same as those used in
monumental polychromy—that is to say, red and blue, at one place
freely spread over, as over the hair or the chiton, elsewhere knowingly
combined so as to form the attractive ornamentation of stripes and
seed-like adornments. A few fine black lines mark the details of the
eyes and the arch of the eyebrows; here and there, on the pendants
from the ears and upon the frontlet that crowns the coiffure, some gild-
ing adds a metallic sheen; the painter’s brush has finished its work.

Has a statue thus painted assumed the appearance of life? Is it a
realistic sentiment which has suggested the choice of colors and the
manner of applying them? By no means! The whole ambition of the
painter has been his desire to remain within strict conventionalities,
POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY. 609

to improve the sculptor’s work by the charm of colors, and to perform
an artist’s work without any effort to mislead the eye by a willful imi-
tation of the reality. Hence, the exquisite precautions he takes to pre-
vent any vulgar accident from tarnishing the freshness of this delicate
coloring! Look at this metal spike fastened to the top of the head.
This is to support the crescent, called a meniscus, made of wood or of
metal, which protects the statue against the offences committed by
birds, and to secure it against the defacements with which it is con-
stantly threatened by those indiscreet guests of the Acropolis.

Does this coloring of the statue complete its toilet? It has been
justly remarked that the contrast between the painted parts and the
natural tint of the marble would be too painful to the eye unless a kind
of treatment with the hand—a patinage—should reestablish the proper
harmony by softening this rather crude whiteness. Archaic marbles
have preserved no trace of such a treatment, but this fact is easily
explained. But at a later date we meet with several examples, and
the written texts make frequent allusions to it. Nothing prevents our
believing that the artists of the sixth century had already compre-
hended the necessity of a proceeding which, as we shall see further on,
plays a very important part in the classic period.

VOC

The adversaries of polychromy may look upon the limitation of
painting to certain parts of archaic statues as a symptom of approach-
ing decline. It looks to them somewhat like an ancient tradition which
still survives, but is doomed to disappear. Or is it rather a shrinking
back—a movement such as that which was observed in Italian seulp-
ture toward the beginning of the sixteenth century? And when, after-
wards, the great masters of marble statuary, with Phidias and his
Successors, shall try to find in their modelings the most delicate tints,
when they shall give to drapery a matchless elegance and nobility, will
they not then repudiate superannuated proceedings employed by primi-
tive image makers in order to hide the shortcomings of their chisel?

Here we come upon a most earnestly controverted question. As far
as the brilliant periods of the fifth and fourth centuries are concerned,
the facts are more widely scattered, the pieces of evidence do not suc-
ceed each other with absolute regularity, as they do in that matchless
totality of the sculptures on the Acropolis. Still, by combining all the

information we find here and there, they present a cohesion which is by

no means factitious, and gradually we are convinced. Wecome readily
to the conclusion that polychromy has survived the primitive archaism
for many centuries.

Monumental sculpture and bas-reliefs present to us certain land-
marks; they follow each other during a long period, extending from 470

_ toabout the end of the fourth century. Traces of color have been found
_ upon the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia, and on the drapery

of the colossal Apollo, that once stood in the center of the western
pediment. If the investigations made at the Parthenon have led only
to uncertain results, the frieze of the temple of Theseus, of a somewhat
later date than that of the Panathenes, has preserved traces of color-
ing. When Mr. Newton, in 1856, on the place where the Mausoleum
of Halicarnassus once stood, conducted his memorable excavations, he
could discover on the grand frieze upon the costumes of the colossa]
statues which crown the edifice, traces of color, which were then very
apparent, but are now almost extinct.1 Polychromy, however, remains
still very visible on the marble lions, which no doubt came from the same
monument. We can easily restore the brownish-red tone of the body,
and the bright red that has been put on the lips and the tongue that
hangs out of the half-open jaws. It will thus be seen that polychromy
still exists on monumental sculptures in the middle of the fourth cen-
tury, at a time when Scopas and his followers were decorating the
sumptuous tomb of the Carian king, Mausolus; the harmony has not
yet been interrupted that reigned between architecture, brightened by
elegant polychromy, and the sculpture which forms, as it were, one
body with the edifice.

Ts the inquiry to be carried any further? We shall look at isolated,
independent bas-reliefs, that escape for that very reason from the exi-
gencies of monumental polychromy. In this aspect funeral stele can
give us curious information. In looking over the collection of Attic
funeral bas-reliefs,? published by the Academy of Sciences in Vienna,
we gain the conviction that these stele, now mostly without any color,
still had received their final touch at the hands of the painter.’ The
brush completed the decoration of the pediment and of the pinnacles
which crowned the stela and indicated the details which the seulp-
tor had neglected, like the accessories of the toilet, the staff on which
the personages, clad in their cloaks, were resting, and would look as if
they were suspended in the air if the painter had not come to the res-
cue and restored the equilibrium. One of the most beautiful of the
stele of the Museum at Athens, that of Prokleides, has preserved
traces of a red background, on which the blue drapery of a seated per-
sonage stands out very clearly. Another stela belonging to Aristo-
nantes looks now as if it had no coloring, but at the time when it was
discovered it still presented the rich decorations of its moldings, its
cornice, and its tympanum. ‘The warrior’s shield,” wrote Mx. Lenor-
mant, ‘‘ was painted red, and in the background of the relief there still
appeared traces of the blue tint with which it had originally been cov-
ered again. All this has vanished under the influence of rain and

exposure to the air.” We know, moreover, quite a numerous series of
stelee in which the bas-relief is replaced by painting directly applied
to the marble,' and in monuments of careless workmauship as in chea}
stele, a sketch is often found slightly engraved and intended to guide
the painter. We must, therefore, take it for granted that a Greek
necropolis, like that of the outside ceramic works at Athens, owed to the
polychromy of the monuments a much less stern aspect than that of
our cemeteries; painted tombs, stele adorned with colored rehefs formed
here long lines in picturesque perspective; the wanderer who stopped
before one of these beautiful bas-reliefs enjoyed here the charm of form
united to that of color, and if we wish to evoke the vision of an Attic
stela with its delicate polychromy, we should recall the painted stuccoes
of the Renaissance, and forget the stone or marbie reliefS which adorn
the most luxurious of modern burial places.

The most striking and the most conclusive example of polychromy
applied to bas-reliets happens to be a funeral monument. Before the
end of the fourth century a Greek sculptor, a contemporary of Alexander,
created that magnificent sarcophagus which Hamdy-Bey was so fortu-
nate as to discover in the necropolis of Sidon. This is the *‘Sarcopha-
gus of Alexander,” now the most precious work in the Museum of the
Tchinily-Kiosk at Constantinople.’

We are not called upon here to describe in detail the bas-reliefts which
so liberally cover the four sides of the huge coffin: an episode of a hunt
for panthers, a lion hunt, in which a Persian and a Greek, no doubt
Alexander, are the principal personages, a furious skirmish of cavalry
between Macedonian and Persian soldiers, a densely crowded composi-
tion, in which we meet again all the rush and the fury of the battle
scenes sculptured by contemporaries of Scopas, at Halicarnassus. In
spite of the interest we feel in these bas-reliefs, which are very justly
deemed to represent to us the beginning of historic sculpture in Greek
art, we can not stop for anything but the object of this essay. Now,
far from betraying a decline of polychromy, the ‘‘Sareophagus of Alex-
ander” shows it to us more flourishing than ever; it has actually
gained new resources. Instead of the three or four tints which the
painters of the sixth century employed, the decorator now commands
avery rich palette, which includes violet, purple, blue, yellow, carmine
red, reddish brown, and perhaps dark-brown bister. Instead of timidly
limiting the field of painting, he lavishes solid colors, spreads them in
abundance over the tunics and fluttering cloaks, and disposes of this
greatly varied gamut with singular facility. ‘The man who illumi-
nated our sarcophagus,” writes Mr. Theodor Reinach, ‘‘is a genuine
colorist; he not only imitates with minute accuracy the complicated

patterns of Oriental stuffs—the tunics and their solid ground, purple,
blue, or red, embroidered with little squares or ornamented with an inser-
tion of a different color, the facing contrasting with the sleeves, the
sleeves with the mantles, the trousers striped, dotted, or dappled some-
times in three shades, the saddlecloths with their brilliant braids and
their figured embroideries—but more than that, he excels in the delicate
art to please the eye by very sharp contrasts, and yet to harmonize the
colors.”! Nor is polychromy here limited to the clothes and their acces-
sories. The heads, with their brownish-red hair, the eyes, in which the
iris is always carefully indicated as blue or brown, have a marked life-
like expression. The head of Alexander in the scene from the lion hunt
is worth examining as proving our assertion; his eye, fixed upon the
animal which is biting the chest of one of his horses, has all the inten-
sity, all the energy which a painter could have wished to express in a
painting. Take, moreover, this essential fact which is productive of
weighty consequences. The difficult question of coloring uncovered parts
is made quite clear by positive evidence. The bare parts were covered
up “ with a kind of light and transparent rubbing in of uniform density,
light or dark yellow, according as the subject was a Greek or a barba-
rian, without any effort to reproduce the varying aspect of flesh and
blood by a variety of shades. These glazings are so different from the
even, opaque, and consistent tints which are applied to parts of the
drapery, and time has so-successfully gnawed away the fluid veil that at
first sight one might imagine nothing was there but the natural marble,
gilt by the years.” Thus, about the year 320, far from having lost ground,
polychromy had rather improved and progressed, and if new evidence
were needed to prove this, abundance of it would be found in the other
monuments discovered at Sidon; the painted friezes of the sarcophagus
of the female mourners would furnish an additional argument. All
these facts combined lead us to the conclusion that there were laws, or,
if we prefer it, established customs, that regulated polychromy for bas-
reliefs. Inthe first place, the decorators did not abandon opaque colors;
on the contrary, they used them freely. As to bare parts, they solved
the problem as above mentioned; they employ for them a colored glaz-
ing that is transparent and allows the grain of the marble to show, while
it tempers the whiteness which they thought too glaring. Finally, we
do not notice at this period, more than at any more remote date, any
doubtful tints, nor any modeling by color. It is the prominent parts
of the bas-relief alone which give to the lights their effect and to the
shadows their intensity. The painter has nothing to do with modeling;
he only colors with solid tints the sculptured surfaces which have in
themselves their own play of lights and shadows.

telying upon such very precise indications, we may with tolerable
safety turn to the most important question—the painting of statues.

Arts, 1892.

Here the problem becomes more difficult. We have to deal with iso-
lated works, made for their own purposes and having no connection
with architecture. The question mainly concerns plastic creations,
which according to our modern ideas require nothing but form in order
to give them all their great value and their peculiar accent. It has
long been thought that the chisel of Scopas and Praxiteles gave to
the marble sufficient life to convey by the modeling alone the passion-
ate outbursts of the ‘‘ Maenade with the Kid,” or the perfect beauty of
the “Cnidian.” And is it not really a barbarous idea to attempt con-
cealing, even under the slightest touch of coloring, the exquisite deli-
eacy of the marble as it has been shaped by the chisel of great Greek
masters?

We would not dare assert that the polychromy of statues has been
an absolute, inflexible rule, and that it rigorously bound all artists
alike. But if the facts are conclusive, we must needs accept it, if not
as a law, at least as a custom, to which the taste of antiquity submitted
gracefully. Now, we find at the very outset in the written evidence
many reasons to overcome our doubts. The principal texts which in
any way allude to the painting of statues have long since been collected
and commented upon, and we ought to bear in mind that they spread
over a very long period, from the fourth century before our era to a
very advanced date in the times of the Emperors.! Greek statuary is
in its full splendor when Plato writes as follows: “If we were to paint
statues and some one were to come and object that we do not employ
the most beautiful colors for the most beautiful parts of the body; that,
for instance, we do not paint the eyes vermilion, but black, we should
think we had answered the censor very well by saying to him: ‘ Do not
think that we ought to paint eyes so beautifully that they cease to be
eyes; and what I say of this part of the body must be understood of the
others likewise.’” Pliny has preserved a saying attributed to Praxiteles
and evidently taken from Greek sources. When the great artist was
asked which of his marble statues he valued most highly, he replied:
“Those which have been in the hands of the painter Nicias!” And
Pliny adds: ‘‘So great was the importance which he attached to the
work (cireumlitio) of Nicias!” This cooperation of painter and sculp-
tor ought not to surprise us; we meet with its equivalent in the days
of the Italian renaissance. Thus Lorenzo di Credi and Cosimo Roselli
painted the sculptures of Benedetto da Majano,? and in the studio of
the painter Neri-Bicci they were coloring ‘plaster or marble madon-
nas, works of good masters.”’ Let us go deeper in this line of evi-
dence. Inscriptions found at Delos give us a detailed account of the

payments and the inventories drawn up by the administrators of the tem-
ples of Delos. Under the date of 246, mention is made of gold leaf
bought for the gilding of a quiver; this is a marble quiver belonging
to a statue of Artemis. [Hlsewhere we find a salary spoken of that was
paid to a painter for coloring in encaustics a statue of Aphrodite, and
for the finishing touches (Ko'oj:yo1s) given to another statue of the same
goddess.’ This is an industry the tradition of which is never entirely
lost in Greece. After the Roman conquest the Greeks kept the secret
and came and practiced it in Italy. A funeral inscription found in
Rome introduces us to a Greek sculptor who is otherwise unknown,
but who practices the profession of ‘‘ manufacturer of statues and
painter in eneausties.”? Sometimes the duty of coloring the marbles is
left to female hands, as we learn from a Pompeiian fresco, where a
woman painter’s studio is shown; we see her, brush in hand, busily
coloring a statue of Priapus, and consulting a painted sketch that is
placed before her.’ In the second century of our era the best connois-
seurs In matters of art look upon polychromy as the indispensable com-
plement of sculpture. We all know the dialogue of the Portraits, where
Lucian introduces two overrefined amateurs, Lykinos and Polystratos.
In order to realize a type of perfect beauty, the two men borrow from
the most celebrated Greek statues all the features of their description:
from the Cnidian of Praxiteles her hair and her brow; from the Aphro-
dite of the gardens by Aleamenes, her round and tapering fingers; from
the Lemnian woman by Phidias the outlines of her cheeks and the oval
of her face. But that is not all. Polystratos calls for a new element
of beauty. “Whatis it? Itis by no means the least interesting, my
dear friend, unless the tint that is peculiar to every part appears to
you of no importance in point of beauty - - - our work runs great
risk to sin on the essential point.” And the two great talkers divide
out among the most illustrious painters of Greek antiquity the duty of
applying such an ideal polychromy. We understand, of course, how
Latin writers make likewise very pointed allusions to the painting of
statues, how a Roman poet, the author of an epigram on a marble
Daphne, should admire both the skill of the sculptor and the skill of
the painter,’ and how another, a contemporary of Augustus, should
promise Venus that he will dedicate to her a marble Amor with vari-
egated wings and a painted quiver:
Marmoreusque tibi, dea, yersicoloribus alis
In morem picta stabit Amor pharetra.’

Every mind that is free from prejudice must needs be struck by this

unbroken continuity in the evidence. Even if there were no other

proof, it must be admitted that the custom of painting statues was evi-
dently not a passing fashion, and that it survived even the Roman
conquest. But the written texts have their commentary in the monu-
ments. A complete examination would amount to a catalogue of all
the works on which traces of painting have been discovered, and this
simple statement of facts would be equivalent to a conviction. But we
can not think of undertaking such a minute investigation. We shall

be content to quote some examples in order to put down some land-

marks on this long road with distant perspectives of which a rapid
survey of the manuscripts has given us a glimpse at least.

Pliny’s anecdote about the cooperation of Praxiteles and Nicias has
nothing that is suspicious about it; on the contrary, the discovery of
the only original statue by this great Athenian master which we pos-
sess, the Hermes of Olympia, invites us to believe that it is true. The
reddish browa, traces of which are found on his hair and on the san-
dals, bears witness that the painter’s brush has put the final touch to
the sculptor’s work. The marbles which date from the Hellenistic epoch
furnish more than one analogous example. An Apollo in the Museum
at Constantinople, found at Cymae, bears on his shoulders some red
drapery; he wears ornamental shoes, on which traces of red, blue, and
ocher are visible. We must especially mention a statuette of Ascu-
lapius in Paros marble, found on the Island of Cos and bought, in 1892,
for the Dresden Museum.' It presents the curious peculiarity of hay-
ing not only been painted, but actually painted over again. The prim-
itive color of the cloak had been a rather light brick red. At a later
date, perhaps upon the occasion of a revision of all the offerings
exposed in the sanctuary of A‘sculapius, the primitive painting has
been revised, and a new coloring given to the cloak. This time a rose
tint was chosen. It has often been asserted that the Greek terra cot-
tas give us a fairly correct idea of the painting of statues, and that
especially the small Tanagra figures, with their delicate coloring, their
flesh clothed in a very pale tint, their draperies in which soft and very
much weakened colors combine, a delicate pink, blue, or violet, and
their hair, painted reddish brown, might present to us, in miniature,
the image of a polychromatic statue. The process of making them
renders this analogy very striking indeed. Before proceeding to the
coloring of the little figure, the manufacturer plunges it into a bath of
whitewash and white lead. When it comes forth from this, immac-
ulate under its slight layer of white, which is to be the ground work
for the painting, it presents very nearly the appearance of a small
marble statue, ready to receive its final dressing at the hand of the
painter. And will not the artist who is to color it be under the influ-
ence of the usual custom in coloring large statues? The recent exca-
vations carried on by the French School of Athens, at Delos, furnish
us with curious information on that question. Amid the ruins of a

‘Arch, Anzeiger, Jahrbuch des arch, Instituts, VII, 1892, page 159,
616 POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY.

house at Delos, Mr. Couve has discovered a beautiful statue of a draped
woman, equal in point of elegance to the most coquettish of the little
Tanagra figures. The hair, artistically arranged in bandeaux, displays
a brownish red tint; this is exactly the type of the dressing of the
hair and of its color which we find in terra-cotta statuettes. It is, more-
over, the conventional color chosen by the manufacturers of such ware
to reproduce, as nearly as can be, that brilliant golden tinge which a
Greek traveler admires so greatly in the hair of Theban women.

Toward the middle of the second century before our era, Greek art
undergoes a kind of evolution, which is often called a renaissance.
This is the time when a school of new classics, reacting against the
tendencies of Alexandrianism, resolutely returns to the traditions of the
two great centuries, when able sculptors, like Apollonius, Glycon, Cleo-
menes, put their names to a torso in the Vatican, a Hercules Farnese,
the so-called Germanicus in the Louvre, and adopt as their models the
works of the fifth and fourth centuries. Greek sculptors emigrate and
go to Italy. To satisfy the demands of their Roman patrons, they mul-
tiply copies of celebrated statues. The villas, the palaces of rich
Romans, are soon full of marbles carved by skillful artists, whose
works of art mostly furnished the models after being carried away out
of Greece. Did polychromy survive these new conditions? Will it
become acclimatized under the Italian sky? It would be strange if the
taste for archeologic amateurship and the erudite curiosity which were
aroused in Rome should not have become a guaranty for its vitality. We
do not see that it suddenly gives way to monochromatic sculpture. Far
from it. Instead of proscribing the union between sculpture and paint-
ing, the Italian taste eagerly accepts it. It is the timeof the Emperors
that produced those colored marble statues of green basalt, porphyry,
antique red (rosso antico), which had heretofore been peculiar to
Egyptian art. The employment of such marbles, imported from Nu-
midia or Egypt, is favorable to the development of a very special kind
of polychromy that might be called natural polychromy. It produces
those statues of variegated marble which cause our modern taste to
hesitate, and which, if they fail to secure our admiration, at least excite
our curiosity.

How could painting by the side of a statuary art so daringly many-
colored fail to maintain its rights, protected as they were by old tradi-
tions and by the prestige of Hellenic art? It maintains them so well
that it is to Greco-Roman sculpture we owe very many and very con-
clusive specimens of colored statues. In 1885, there was found in Rome,
on the ground of Sallust’s garden, a head of Athene, which evidently is
a copy of the Parthenos.' The painter has endeavored to keep as close
to his model as he can and give to his work the appearance of a chrys-
elephantine statue. While the flesh, carefully polished, preserves the
clear tint of the marble, the yellow color of the helmet represents the

‘Antike Denkmiiler, 1886, I, P1. ILI.
POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY. 617

effect of gold. Hair and eyebrows red; the iris dark brown, suggests
the idea that the painter, unable to bring out all the shades of the
various kinds of gold and precious stones, has employed a conventional
coloring. Many will say this is a copy of a chryselephantine work; in
other words, this is an exceptional case. Let us, therefore, examine
other works, copies, which reveal to us most readily the originals in
marble. In the British Museum there is a precious head of marble,
carefully protected by a glass case against atmospheric influences. It
was found in Rome in 1884, and no doubt belongs to a statue which
once adorned the gardens of the Esquiline, and the general style, the
shape of the coiffure, betray a replica of a Greek original, dating from
the fourth century.! If we consider the light yeliow shade of the hair,
the rosy flesh tint that still covers the brow, the cheeks, and the neck,
the black pupils of the eyes, we can not hesitate to feel that the copyist
has respected the polychromy of his model. Has he transferred it with
all desirable delicacy? That is another question, but his testimony is
too valuable for us to blame the painter for having shown himself a
rather poor imitator of Nicias. With the London marble we must again
compare a head of a goddess, bought in 1888 by the Dresden Museum,
whose blonde hair is confined by a pink-colored headband, while the
face still shows evident traces of having been treated with wax.” Add
to this a curious statuette of Aphrodite, discovered in Pompeii in 1873,
very coquettish under her orange-colored cloak with its grayish-blue lin-
ing and white border, and accompanied by a little archaic-looking figure
in a yellow peplos and green chiton,? and you will have a proof that
the polychromy of marble is still very much to the taste of Romans in
the first century of our era. No one will be astonished to find in Pom-
peiian frescoes reproductions of painted statues with a well-sustained
peculiar tint for the fleshy parts. Is this nothing more than a conces-
sion made to the curiosity of amateurs? Does polychromy remain a
kind of reward for amateurs, and is it excluded from official statuary,
which multiplies the statues of emperors and great personages? Here,
again, we might have ground for believing the contrary. We shall
quote but one very striking example. The statue of Augustus, which
was found in Livy’s villa, on the Flaminian road, and is now in the

Vatican, is well known. The Emperor, in military costume, seems to

be addressing his troops. It is an admirable work, belonging to the

tuts, 1889, Vol. IV. The plate is accompanied by a very learned article by Mr. G.
Treu, page 18.

apparent—a bright-red tunic, a dark-red pallium, armor bordered with
yellow fringes and ornamented with chiseled relief, set off with car-
mine, purple, and blue—all give us the idea of a statue on which the
richest polychromy has been lavished. Before we lose the last trace of
this persistent custom, we have to go very far down into the times of
the Emperors. A statue of Faustine, the wife of Antonine the Pious,
who died in 141, shows that the habit of gilding the hair and of embel-
lishing the drapery with color was then still in existence.

JEW.

All these facts are sufficient, it seems to us, to prove the essential
point; to show how unfounded the prejudice is which for a long time
refused to believe that there was any painted statuary in Greece. But
they do not yet satisfy our curiosity; we should like to know a great
deal more about it. Instead of painfully searching for marbles, scat-
tered about here and there, that have faint traces of half-effaced color-
ing, we would like to have a clear and complete view of a painted
Statue in all the freshness of its polychromy, and to know accurately
what harmonies a master like Nicias could realize by adding to a mar-
ble carved by Praxiteles the charm of colors. We must be resigned;
we can only very imperfectly catch a glimpse, as it were, of the full effect
of a painted statue. In order to conjure up at least a faint image, we
should have to give up mere theories, resort to practical applications,
and try to re-create, either by molding or by a copy in marble, the colors,
as we restore on paper, with fragments of columns and capitals, the
order of a Greek temple. This is not a dream that can not be realized.
Similar efforts have been made from time to time. In 1885, the eminent
director of the Albertinum in Dresden, Mr. Georg Treu, organized in
the Berlin National-Galerie an exhibition of polychromatic statuary,
belonging to all countries and all ages, from Egyptian statues in lime-
stone to painted marble busts and friezes in majolica by contemporary
artists. By the side of a painted relief in wax by our countryman, Mr.
Henry Cros, of busts in wood and in terra cotta or in marble, coming
from Italian and Spanish schools, Greek polychromy was represented
by moldings, which reproduced the colors of the originals, or by res-
torations, such as a grand draped statue from Herculaneum, painted
in wax by Mr. Ludwig Otto.1 More recently, investigations carried
on by Mr. Georg Treu in antique polychromy, have resulted in Dresden
in still other efforts, which deserve most careful attention. Mr. Treu
has been kind enough to send me notes on the subject, full of details,
and accompanied by photographs of moldings after the antique, col-
ored by Mr. J. HK. Sattler; the Satyr leaning on his elbows, in the
Capitol, has been restored with all the tints of gold and of ivory of a

chryselephantine statue. The head of the Ludovisi Medusa, with its
mass of dark hair and the flesh tint that covers the face, stands out from
its blue ground like a painted stucco of the Renaissance. Similar efforts
have been made in America. In boston an archeologist, Mr. Robinson,
and a sculptor, Mr. J. Lindon Smith, combined their efforts to restore
the polychromy of the Hermes of Praxiteles and the Venus genitrix of
the Louvre.' It is not for us, at such a distance, to judge of the value
of such restorations; at all events, they do this at least, they cause a
problem, which is still much studied, to enter into an entirely new
phase. Mere theories are now followed by practical experiments and by
applications of theories, which may furnish interesting subjects for dis-
eussion. In fact, words alone will never express what is so eminently
subtle—so very fleeting; we mean depths of color, harmonies of shades,
transparencies playing on the ground color of the marble. To do the
best we can, we shall at least endeavor to sum up our conclusions; and
in order to choose an example that may render them more precise, we
will inquire what may have been the polychromy of a statue such as
the Hermes of Praxiteles?

In the condition in which it has reached us the statue presents only
faint traces of having been painted. If we forget the mutilations and
stains which disfigure it, it therefore looks to us as it appeared to the
eye after the sculptor had given it the final touch. Now, the very
nature of the process seems to point out in advance the field that was
left to polychromy. Certain parts are reserved tor those simple trans-
parent “rubbings” which the ‘Sarcophagus of Alexander” has taught
us to know, other parts will receive a coloring of greater solidity. The
work on the face and on the body, carried on with exquisite, almost
caressing delicacy, and reaching the very daintiest shades, is such as
to exclude any thought of opaque coloring which would cause this
matchless flower of the modeled form to disappear; the brush is bound
to respect these fleshy parts which the file of the sculptor has so lov-
ingly polished. On the other hand, the hair is treated with much free-
dom, without what is sometimes called virtuosity. ‘The drapery thrown
upon the trunk of a tree hangs there in broken folds, cross lines which
by contrast bring out more forcibly yet the effect of the uncovered
parts where the light is playing upon surfaces that melt into each other
most harmoniously. Here, therefore, we may look for opaque colors.
As for the hair, we need not hesitate. The reddish brown that painters
of statues affect so much is again apparent. The draperies of the
Hermes and the little Dionysius will, of course, be blue or red, but we
may certainly assume, without venturing too far, that in a work of the
fourth century the draperies will be painted. The stele of Athens
justify the presumption, and we might, moreover, invoke the testimony
of a statuette of Artemis, found in Cyprus, a very carefully finished

copy of an Attic original, of a date prior to that of the Hermes. The
chiton is purple, the mantle green with a violet border, and the parts
reserved for the painter have on purpose been left a little rough, in con-
trast with the fleshy parts, which are most carefully polished.! Let us
complete the renewal of the painting of the accessories, and restore
the gilding of the sandals, and we shall have an idea of a somewhat
somber polychromy which, moreover, covers only a small part of the
statue.

If we examine the details more carefully, the painting of the head
suggests some thoughts deserving our attention. Where did the red-
dish brown of the hair stop? In the Hermes, as in several other statues
by Praxiteles, the line of the hair on the brow is managed by a kind of
plastic transition, by softened surfaces which the painter can not cut
off brutally. We do not find here, as in archaic heads, that the sculp-
tor’s chisel has been at work abruptly cutting off the hair on the fore-
head and on the temples. The Roman copyists have instinctively felt
the difficulty. In this point of view the female head of the Dresden
Museum, which we mentioned above, is peculiarly interesting. The
local tint of the hair is yellow; the curls are each marked off by dark-
brown lines, which follow the outlines, and finally expire, so to say, on
the forehead, forming thus at the root of the hair a kind of transparent
fringe. No doubt a Nicias would have known how to solve that prob-
lem by simpler means, by a softening down of the tint, skillfully man-
aged. But that is a question which practiced experiments alone can
answer satisfactorily.

Were the eyes painted? If we had no other testimony to consult
but Plato’s, we should not hesitate to think so. Our impression would
be confirmed by literary statements relative to the Venus of Cnidus.
Could we understand that “hurried look,” of which Lucian speaks, if
the question was only of eyes without color and without life, such as
we are accustomed to see in modern statuary? But we know that the
eustom of animating the look of statues by means of color is to a cer-
tain extent traditional in Greek statuary. Enameled eyes, inserted
between the eyelids, sometimes set skillfully between two leaflets of
bronze, the beard-like edges of which imitate the hair of the eyelids,
are details which are more than once met with in archaic works.2 A
study of the technique of eyes in Greek statues led Mr. Conze to the
conclusion that even in the best years of the art, the painting of the

the iris and of the pupil are represented by marbles of different colors. (Arch.

POLYCHROMY IN GREEK STATUARY. 621

more intensity to the look is not anterior to the time of Hadrian, and
this is a proof that polychromy is now beginning to abdicate. There
ean be no doubt that here, more than elsewhere, the individual senti-
ment of the painter found an opportunity to assert itself. An art as
refined as that of the fourth century must have been more or less
exacting, and if we look at statues like those of Praxiteles we become
aware that the very structure of the eye, slightly veiled beneath the
lid, warned the painter not to fall into brutal realism. In order to
solve the difficulty, we may have to go back to the many colored head
of the British Museum, in which the upper eyelid, cutting the cirele of
the apple of the eye, strangely softens the expression of the eye. But
can we ever divine what charm the coworker of Praxiteles, so renowned
for his women’s portraits, may have succeeded in giving to the look of
a marble Aphrodite?

Still, an objection presents itself here. We have before us the med-
eling of the hair, the eyes, no doubt also that of the lips, improved by
colors applied with more or less delicacy, but always consistent enough
to contrast with the tint of the marble, which is left untouched for all
the bare parts. Is this not a shocking contrast? Will not the colors
stand out with a certain crudeness? And do not the Jaws of harmony
which the eye of a Greek perceives with such rare accuracy, impose
upon the artist the duty of softening these violent contrasts, of sub-
duing somewhat the too striking whiteness of the marble and to change
it to a warmer scheme of colors? Here we come to a question that has
been much discussed—the coloring of naked parts. Whether we admit
it or not—and opinions are divided on this subject—one fact remains
certain, the statue underwent a kind of treatment which restored the
harmony between the parts that had been painted and those that the
painter’s brush had not yet touched. ‘Thanks to written testimony, we
know the details of this operation perfectly well. According to what
Vitruvius says, it is the same which painters in encaustics practiced in
order to give greater brilliancy to their painting, very much as we var-
nish a picture: “When the wall has been well polished and is very
dry, we apply with a brush, made of pigs’ bristles, a layer of Punic
wax, melted before the fire and mixed with a little oil; then we heat the
wali by means of charcoal kept in a chafing dish, until the wax melts
and enters into the painting. Finally, the whole is rubbed with wax
and clean linen, as we do with marble statues that are waxed.” This
is the operation which the Greeks call yaveors.' Other texts confirm
the testimony of Vitruvius. The inventories of the temples of Delos
allude to the Koopnors of statues of Artemisia and Hera: This is an
operation resembling the yavqwozs, and consists in “spreading over the
surface a coating to make it even, to polish it, to render it shining, or to
color it,? or to wash it with certain substances which give it brilliancy

'This question is well treated by Henry Gros and Charles Henry in L’Encaustique
et les autres procédés chez les Anciens. Paris: Librairie de l’Art, 1884.

and preserve it altogether.” The accounts of expenses enumerate all
the objects and ingredients that were employed—sponges; niter, doubt-
less for the washing of the statues and freeing it from dust when the
question arose of refreshing the colors; white, carefully purified oil,
wax, a stuff made of flax; finally a rose perfume,a very natural
refinement when the marble represents ‘“‘a statue that is to be wor-
shiped and placed in a sanctuary.” This operation was often repeated,
and the duty of presiding at it devolved upon the officials of the tem-
ple. An inscription on the Ptoion has preserved for us a statement of
accounts made by one of the administrators of the temple of Apollo;
it mentions, among others, a sum spent for the keeping of the statues
and the removal of the yavwozs.' it was still in use in the Roman
period. Plutarch speaks of artists in marble who repair broken parts
and restore them; he also mentions this fact that the first act of the
censors, when they entered upon their duties, was to adjudge to the
lowest bidder the feeding ot the sacred geese on the capitol and the
yava@ois of the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus, because ‘the vermilion
with which it had been the custom to coat the old statues very quickly
underwent a change.”

Thus very clear statements in writing justify us in supposing that
this restoration was a treatment with wax, a transparent rubbing in,
which protects the painted parts and the gildings, giving to the naked
parts a soft sheen, a brightness resembling that of ivory, and satisfy-
ing the eye by softening too striking contrasts, while presenting to the
sight nothing but skillfully managed transitions. But is the result
really secured if the whole is nothing but a treatment without colors?
The purified wax, of which Vitruvius speaks, the “white oil” which
the inscriptions of Delos mention, can hardly have any coloring virtue,
nor will they suffice to give warmth to the tone of the marble. This
question also has been much discussed, and two suggestions have been
made that are still open: Hither, owing to a special preparation, the
wax was giving a kind of yellowish tonality to the marble, or it was
applied upon a very slight glazing, doing the duty of coloring matter.
This latter hypothesis has been advocated by Mr. G. Treu,” and it must
be admitted that it rests upon facts. The head in the British Museum
lets us perceive a colored glazing beneath the treatment with wax, and
this is therefore the proper place to recall that transparent rubbing in,
which was observed upon the clouds on the “Sarcophagus of Alexan-
der.” Itis, of course, easily understood that in most instances so very
slight a glazing should have left no traces, and that Greek marbles
show us only vestiges of opaque tones that have greater consistency.
The restoration of so fragile, so ee a le remains a matter of

personal feeling. But we will never believe that the Greeks should at
any time have sought to produce by such means the illusion of reality,
and to represent actual flesh tints. We can readily imagine that a
slight, very transparent rubbing in was given to the body of the
Hermes, which allowed the grain of the marble to be discerned, and
had no other object but to lend to the naked parts a warm and uniform
tonality.

The ideal restoration which we have thus sketched will enable us to
conclude in a few words. A writer who severely condemns the princi-
ple of polychromy, “the offspring of a savage instinct,” quotes on this
subject the following lines written by Diderot: ‘‘What would be the
effect of the most truthful and the most beautiful coloring upon a
painted statue? Bad, I think.”' Wedo not contradict this. Besides
and we think we have made this sufficiently clear—this kind of poly-
chromy is not at all in question. Among the Greeks, painting a statue
was the result of a principle exactly opposite. Greek polychromy is,
above all, conventional; it has never abandoned that character. We
find it, at the very beginning, carry the principle of liberty within con-
ventionality so far as to disregard the simplest probabilities purposely
to limit the choice of colors and to make itself supple enough, far enough
from all realistic imitation, to yield without scruples to the exactions of
monumental polychromy. At a later period, when art had progressed,
far from claiming to have conquered, it knows how to respect the noble
material which artists use for their purposes, to play a subordinate
part to sculpture and to lend it very discreet assistance. Its part to
play is not, as has been said, to “attempt an impossible fraud,” but to
enhance the charms of a perfect form, which remains the mistress and
the sovereign. For the same reason, it must always be a very delicate
art, all in dainty tints, hostile to violent exaggerations, and well able
to resist the temptations of realistic art. Now, when we admire the
marvels produced by industrial art in Greece, the delicate coloring of
the little figures (figurines) of terra cotta, the strikingly pure poly-
chromy of ceramics with their white ground, we must highly honor the
painters of statues. We do not exactly know what a work may have
been in which a Praxiteles and a Nicias cotnbined their efforts, but we
do know that it required all the exquisite taste and all the science of a
great master to realize in the Tanagra of our Luxemburg Museum the
harmonious alliance of form and of color.

RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT,
ILLUSTRATED BY AMERICAN EXAMPLES:!

By J. W. POWELL.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I shall endeavor to explain to you the
effect of environment on man. I shall try to demonstrate that prima-
rily the environment has little effect on the physical man—that the
principal effect, though not the whole of it, is on his mind. I wish to
demonstrate to you that human evolution is intellectual evolution, in
which it greatly differs from animal evolution. The neglect of this
characteristic has come to us from the too exclusive study of the lower
animals, so that the terms of evolution have been misapplied to man.
I shall attempt to explain to you that human evolution is the evolution
not of kinds of men, but of grades of men. The oak is a different
kind of tree from the beech; the acorn, the plantlet, and the old oak
are grades of the same thing. Now, clearly understand me when I
speak of kinds and grades. Human evolution is serial evolution; it is
evolution producing grades; animal evolution is primarily differential
evolution producing kinds, while secondarily it produces grades. The
laws of evolution do not produce kinds of men, but grades of men; and
human evolution is intellectual, not physical. There are some slight
exceptions to this, and in the early history of mankind some important
exceptions; but gradually, as society advances, evolution into kinds is
replaced by evolution into grades. Now, the effect of environment is
only one of the factors of evolution, there being three: One is heredity,
another is self-activity, and the last is environment; and we are to

The Saturday lectures, complimentary to the citizens of Washington, were con_
tinued during the season of 1896, under the auspices of the Joint Commission of the
Scientific: Societies of Washington, with the special codperation of the Biological
and Anthropological Societies.

The addresses were delivered in the lecture hall of the National Museum, 4.20 to
5.30 p. m., on the dates specified; several were illustrated by maps and diagrams,
specimens, etc. The citizens of Washington and their friends were cordially invited
to attend, and the attendance was good, the hall being always filled and sometimes
crowded. ;

The series of lectures for 1896 was arranged with the view of illustrating the rela-
tions of life to environment, especially on the American Continent, Two courses

discuss especially this afternoon the effect of environment which
produces kinds of animals but grades of men.

We will consider, then, the effect of an arctic temperature on animals
and men. The fishes of an arctic climate acquire blubber and use it as
a fuel in organic combustion. Many of the animals of the land and
air do the same; some develop hair, or wool, as a protection from the
storms; birds develop down. What effect will that arctic climate have
upon man? He does not develop blubber like the whale; he does not
develop wool like the ancient elephant; he does not develop down like
the eider duck. What effect has the environment upon him? The
effect is to stimulate his mental activities. He invents a house and
builds it of blocks of ice. Then he invents fire and with it a lamp in
which to burn the oil derived from the blubber of animals. Then he
invents clothing and utilizes the furs of animals and the down of birds,

human life in its relations to lower organisms, as well as to the inorganic world.
Special topics and lecturers were so selected as to present typical aspects of the gen-
eral subject in the light of the latest researches, each lecturer being a recognized
authority in his line of study.

Tour of the lectures in the first course were already prepared for delivery or print-
ing, and were arranged in such order as to form an introduction to the general sub-
ject of environmental relations; the address on the persistence of functionless
structures was specially prepared for the course, but the copy was not completed
when the author was called to Alaska.

The lectures constituting the second course were specially prepared by the respec-
tive lecturers.

and instead of the environment affecting him he changes the environ-
ment. The whole process is reversed. The environment now becomes
the creature of the man. He dresses in skins or in feathers, or in
some other manner protects himself from cold. He builds his house
and warms it, and that leads him to a multiplicity of other inventions.
The whole effect of environment is to develop him intellectually, not
physically.

Now, let us see the effect of environment in another region, another
climate, and under other conditions. In temperate climes there are
trees; he can not build of ice, for ice melts; so he builds homes of trees,
of the slabs of trees, of young trees and of boughs; he weaves mats
with which to cover his house, or he covers it with earth or leaves, as
the environment suggests. He exercises his ingenuity in the devising
of a habitation, and all the utensils of his home and the implements
useful in his domestic life; thus he controls and becomes the creator of
his environment instead of permitting his environment to change his
physical constitution. He uses his intellect, and instead of merely
developing as an animal would develop under those circumstances—
herding on the plain, wandering in the forest—and changing his
environment from one condition to another, he modifies and changes
it. Human evolution thus, in so far as it is affected by environment in
middle latitudes, is evolution of mind; it is not evolution of kinds of
men, but of grades of mind.

A little farther south we come to an arid land where trees and other
vegetation is scant, and where the rocks lie in profusion over the sur-
face of the earth. Here man is thrown under another environment.
The plant in an arid climate develops a bark or a skin which is covered
with glaze, so that the water does not evaporate; then it provides
organs by which water when it comes is stored within the plant, and a
method by which this can be utilized when rain does not come. Life
may be held in abeyance; the plant may sleep or partially sleep during
the arid time, living only on stored water. It provides itself also with
protecting organs to preserve it from destruction. In all of the arid
lands plants are found to have a singular armature of spines and
thorns and serrate edges, with which to save themselves from being
devoured by animals. The animals also develop in a peculiar way.
They not only have horns and spines, but several of them develop
poisons, like that of the rattlesnake and of other reptiles and insects
found in arid lands. But the, effect upon man is altogether different;
man does not develop poisons or horns, or a skin which can not per-
Spire. He is not physically changed by reason of the arid climate; his
organs as such are not greatly modified; there is no differential evolu-
tion in the man. The man now invents a house. Let us see how he
does it. He takes these rocks that he finds scattered all over the land
and builds him a house, perhaps under the cliffs where it wili be
shaded, He develops a great variety of houses, all adapted to the
628 RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT.

conditions of the environment. Thus that environment affects his
ingenuity—his intellectual powers; it makes grades of men, but does
not make kinds of men. If he is in a region of volcanic rock, he takes
the caves which are found, walls them in and makes houses. If he is
in the region of overhanging cliffs, he puts outer walls in front of these
eliffs and thus builds houses. If he finds tufaceous rocks, he excavates
the tufa and cuts out cavate chambers within the tufa and he has a
home. If he isin a region where stones can be piled up into walls, he
builds pueblos with houses of stone walls. Now, he does not develop a
poison as does the reptile and as does the insect, but he invents a elub,
a bow and an arrow, and finally, as he goes on through civilization, he
invents firearms and all the wonderful appliances of war and fortifica-
tion. in the progress of this development his mind is expanded, but
the poor man himself as a physical being is one of the most helpless
of creatures. |

Let me call your attention to one more region of country. In south-
ern Florida, along the shores of Yucatan and around the Gulf of Mexico
and on the islands of the Caribbean, another set of habitations is dis-
covered. Often the coral islands were used as the homes of the people
of these lands. The coral islands, as they are found in nature, are
swept by high tides, while in low tides they are uncovered. Such a
tide-swept island was selected as a home and protected from the tides
by low walls built around its margin. Through this wall the builders
left a number of openings to the sea, the strait, or the lagoon. Then
they dug canals from the wall into the central portion of the island,
throwing the material wp into ridges and providing many little canals
and water courts, something like those of Venice. Into the water of the
courts they drove palmetto logs as piles, and on these piles erected
their houses. Then they could come from the strait into the center of
the island with their boats and climb into their houses by ladders.
These homes are found in vast numbers where coral islands have been
utilized.

The animal develops long legs to walk in the water or webbed feet by
which if can swim or gains a sac like the pelican in which it can
store its food; but the environment has a different effect on man. It
does not make different kinds, but different grades of men. The wolf
by fighting gains long tusks. Therattlesnake by fighting gains poison.
In all of the animal world contest effects a change in the physical con-
stitution of the animal, but in human evolution contest, warfare, attack,
and defense is by means of stratagem, and implements and devices are
invented. Human evolution is always intellectual evolution, and it is
never to any important extent physical. It is the evolution of the organ
of mind—the brain. The advancement of man is serial instead of dif-
ferential. Instead of affecting his body, the environment furnishes a
subject about which he may think, and in this thinking and planning
and inventing the man develops intellectually.
RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT. 629

I wish to show just how evolution affects the human mind, and in
order to do it I must explain to yon that man develops in qualities, and
only in grades of qualities. The difference which exists between man
and man is not a question of properties, but only a question of quali-
ties. If I make that clear to you, then I will make you understand what
human evolution is.

Now, there are five properties of natural bodies. Bodies have num-
ber, bodies have extension, bodies have motion, bodies have duration,
and animate bodies have judgment. But there is a difference between
properties and qualities.

We set on a table a dozen apples in a tray. There are twenty men at
the table. The number is a property of the apples. Here are twelve
apples and twenty men sitting at the table. Twelve apples are few for
twenty men. Suppose they are all taken by one man; the same twelve
apples are many for that one man, few for many men. Many and few
are qualities of things, and those qualities of things are always con-
sidered in relation to the purpose to which they are put. The twelve
apples do not change as properties; the apples are the same in both
cases; but instantaneously, according to the point of view, the many
may become few and the few many. Thus, there are properties and
qualities of number.

There are properties of extension or form; out of them are developed
qualities of form. Here is arazor; it is Sharp; thesharpness is a prop-
erty of its form. A manshaves with this razor, and its quality is good
for this purpose because it is sharp; another man seizes the razor to cut
a throat; the quality now becomes horrible. Quality becomes good or
evil in the purpose for which it is used. But there is no good or evil in
the formitself. Wedo not blame the razor for being sharp, but we blame
the intention of the man who uses it for the bad purpose.

Here is a car going by which has motion; that is a property. The
car is fast; the electric car especially fast if you compare it with a
horse car, but if you compare it with a railroad car its motion is slow;
it depends upon the point of view whether its motion be fast or slow.
Now, fall across the track and see it approach; it seems to come with a
horrible velocity. You are in a hurry to go some place and you think
the car is slow. The child at play thinks that time is swift; the old
man weary with years thinks as he waits idly that the hour is very
long. Whether the time is minutes or hours is a property; but whether
it shall be long or short in our ideas is a quality.

In the same manner judgments may be good or evil; judgments by
themselves as properties are correct or incorrect, but as qualities they
are good or evil. Now, we have five kinds of properties and five kinds
of qualities, and, curiously enough, properties of number develop into
qualities of pleasure, properties of form develop into qualities of wel-
fare, properties of force or motion develop into qualities of justice or
injustice—qualities of conduct. Properties of duration develop into
630 RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT.

qualities of wisdom, and properties of judgment develop into qualities
of speech. There are five kinds of qualities in the world—qualities of
pleasure, qualities of welfare, qualities of conduct, qualities of opinion,
qualities of language; and this fact expresses the sum total of human
activities.

The relations of properties are numbers developed by relations into
kinds, or extensions developed by relations into forms, or motions
developed by relations into forces, or durations developed by relations
into times, or judgments developed by relations into ideas. Then, all of
these properties are still further developed into qualities by their espe-
cial relations to human purposes; these qualities are arts, industries,
institutions, opinions, and languages. It may be useful for us to illus-
trate and enforce the distinction between properties and qualities.
Here is a mussel shell from the Ohio River. On the inside you see it
has a beautiful nacre; hence it has color, which is a property, and it has
beauty, which is a quality. The indians once used these shells, cutting
them into beads, and for this purpose they are beautiful; beauty is a
quality. You see also that it has a form which is derived from its plan
of extension, and it forms a cup. This form is a property; but thesame
Indians who used the shells for beads also used them for cups; as a cup
it becomes useful, and usefulness is a quality. They also used this
same shell as a knife or as a scraper, for it has a sharp edge, and can
be used as a tool with which to cut or scrape, the force being derived
from motion. Thus it has force in weight, strength, etc., which are
properties. Again, it is advantageous to use the shell or scraper
rather than many other things; for example, rather than a round stone
or rather than a piece of wood. Thus advantage is a quality. But
this same shell has duration; it will last long if buried in water or
earth; it will last longer if it is kept in a dry place. This duration is
a property, but if it is used as a knife for a purpose it will wear away
more slowly than a stick or many other things that might be used as a
knife or scraper; its endurance is a quality.

We have taken natural and inanimate objects for illustration, and
found the four properties and four qualities; let us now take an arti-
ficial but inanimate object and see what we will find. Hereis a pocket-
knife; the handle is white, the blades are steel color; these are proper-
ties; but it is a beautiful knife by reason of its pure white handle and
its rustless blades; it is therefore beautiful, which is a quality. It has
a form as a knife, and its blades are sharp because of their form. The
form in the handle and the blades is a property, but the handle is use-
ful and so wrought that it can be easily grasped and the blades are so
sharp that they will cut. Here the handle and the blades become use-
ful, which is a quality. Itis a good knife for the purpose for which it
is intended, as a pocketknife, but it would be a bad knife for the sur-
geou; in the form of a scalpel it would be good for his purpose. The
knife is a good instrument for cutting a small bough, a bad instrument
RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT. 631

for felling a tree. Goodness and badness are qualities. Again, the
handle and blades of the knife have strength and other properties of
force; but the same properties are also qualities, for the knife is good by
reason of these properties for the purpose for which it is intended, but
as a lever for rolling a stone itis bad. The knife has duration, which
is a property, but it will endure for a longer or shorter time, depending
upon the way in which it is used and the manner of its construction.
This endurance for a purpose isa quality. Now we see that the handle
of the knife has a rounded form with its edges beveled off, and the
blade has one sharp edge, which is made so by grinding it; and more
than that, the blade will close into the handle or open from the handle.
Notice the handle of the knife carefully and you will see many charac-
teristics that prove that it was wrought for a purpose; it therefore
shows design. It expresses the judgment of the maker who manutfac-
tured it for a purpose. Thus we see pleasure in the knife in its beauty,
welfare in the knife in its use, conduct in the knife when it is used to
cut a pencil or cut a throat, wisdom in the knife in the way in which it
is made. In all its properties and qualities it expresses these ideas,
for it expresses the language of inanimate nature.

Let us contemplate a beautiful maiden with bright eyes, rosy cheeks,
and lithe form. She is one individual; she has two eyes and two
cheeks and many organs, and she is of another kind even than a bird.
The hairs of her head, the eyes that sparkle, the cheeks that glow, and
the lithe figure all have forms. She is a body of activities in all her
members, and all of these are forces derived from motion. The maiden
herself and all her organs have duration; she is a bundle of durations;
but every moment of her life she is forming judgments by seeing, hear-
ing, touching, tasting, smelling, and through her senses and all her
mental powers acquiring knowledge, and her mind is a multiplicity of
thoughts. These numbers or kinds, these extensions or forms, these
durations or times, and these judgments or ideas are properties, but
they may be all transformed into qualities by the mind. All of the
multiplicity of properties may be transformed into qualities by the
mind in our contemplation. One person would think the eyes beauti-
ful, depending on experience, habit, or idea of the beautiful and ugly;
another might be impressed by the complexion, according to the opin-
ions with which the contemplating mind is endowed. <A book might
be written on all of these properties and their mutation into 6 1alities.

The purposes for which men strive are pleasure, welfare, justice, wis-
dom, and expression. The activities which they develop for these pur-
poses are arts, industries, institutions, learning, and language. In
these purposes and activities qualities are involved, and qualities are
good or bad by reason of the purposes. Things do not have qualities
in themselves, but only as they relate to purposes.

All men have pleasures, some more, some less; all men have welfare,
some more, some less; all men have justice, some more, some less; all
632 RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT.

men have wisdom, some more, some less; all men have expression,
some more, some less. If they have no speech of any kind, oral or sign
language, or something or other, they have no opinions, they have no
knowledge, they do not exercise conduct, they have no welfare, they
have no pleasure. Now, then, let us look once more at these qualities.
I think I have made clear to you the difference between properties
and qualities. But let me emphasize it a little more. I go on the
street; I see a man rudely push another; I judge of his conduct and I
am indignant; but the next moment I see that the man pushed was
about to fall into a pit, and the other pushed him aside to save him,
and so the quality of the action changes in my mind. Thus it is possi-
ble to change instantaneously our judgment of qualities, which always
depends on the point of view. Properties are inherent in things them-
selves, and you can not change properties without changing the things
themselves, but if you change the properties you change the qualities.
If there are twenty men at the table and there are twelve apples, and
if I change the number to twenty, few becomes plenty, but the plenty
for the table is still few for a cargo. Now, all human activities are
employed in change of properties of things for the purpose of changing
their qualities. Hence, we are interested in the properties of things in
order that we may improve their qualities. It is by these activities
that men are so broadly differentiated—that there is such a wide gap
between the lower animals and man. Man is slightly differentiated
from the beast in his physical characteristics; still he is much like the
monkey. He is broadly differentiated from the monkey by his intellect,
which has been developed through his arts, industries, institutions,
opinions, and language. In man there still exists a relic of his animal
stage, for there are varieties of men, though not species. Men differ
from one another. Some are dwarfs and others are giants, and there
seem to be large and small races. Some men have long heads, others
short heads, and there seem to be races that are more or less distinctive
in the form of their crania. Some men are white, some yellow, and
some black; some men have horizontal eyes and others oblique eyes;
some men have straight and others curly hair, and yet in their charac-
teristics are they varied. But these variations were mainly developed
during the animal stage. Since they have become men these physical
characteristics have been undergoing a process of obliteration, by rea-
son of the admixture of streams of blood. You may find the white
man and the black man, but there are many others; there are all
grades between them. So you may find long heads and short heads,
and there are all grades between them, and there are no hard and fast
lines of distinction. Human evolution has wiped out the distinction.
In the consideration of human evolution primarily and fundamentally
we must consider intellectual evolution. It is in vain that we study
skulls, it is idle to study the color of the skin, it is folly to study the
structure of the hair, it is inane to study the attitude of the eyes, for
a RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT. 633

man is more than the animal ; his distinction is discovered in his intel-
lect. To study men, therefore, we have to study mind, and to study
human evolution we are compelled to study the development of the
mind. All other questions, though important in considering man as an
animal, are trivial when considering man as distinguished from the lower
animal. How shallwestudy the mind? By studying the things which
the mind produces through the agency of man’s physical attributes.
Weare compelled to study the mind through a study of the pleasures
which the mind has discovered and invented, through a study of the
industries which mind has discovered and invented, through a study of
the institutions which mind has discovered and invented, and through
a study of the languages which the mind has discovered and invented.
A wise man has said that the proper study of mankind is man, and man,
above all other things, is mind; the proper study of mankind, then, is
mind as it is exhibited in the five great classes of activities.

Let us once more consider these activities of culture. Animal pleas-
ures are chiefly physical, though they would have no existence were the
animals destitute of mind. They live to eat and drink, and they love
the sports in which they engage. The activities of animals that depend
upon flight for existence are changed into sports, and so lambs skip, so
the kittens play at catching mice, so puppies play in mimic battles, so
children play in imitation of their elders. The skipping of the child
becomes an organized dance; the flight of the child becomes an organized
race; the battle of the child becomes a game of ball; but these sim-
ple, childish pleasures develop into a vast system of pleasures. Man
enhances his pleasures of food by the invention of condiments, his
pleasures in the objects by which he is surrounded by the development
of decoration, and the pleasures he takes in his daily life by the develop-
ment of comforts, for he invents a chair upon which he sits, and a bed
upon which he lies. His pleasures are still further evolved into the
fine arts of music, sculpture, painting, poetry, dramatic representation,
story, and religion. This is human evolution as distinct from animal
evolution.

The industries of animals are employed in seeking and seizing food,
in locomotion while passing from one environment to another to obtain
food, shelter, and climate. But man soon learns to seek sustenance by
cultivating food; to some extent he still seizes the natural food on the
land, in the water, and in the air as an animal; but as man, he develops
new sources of food by cultivating the soil and by domesticating ani-
mals, and thus results a multitude of food products. Instead of seek-
ing the cave, or retiring to the deep water, or flying to a more genial
climate when the seasons change, he invents a habitation and a vast
multitude of utensils for his home and implements for his labor, and
thus creates a supply which he does not find in nature. All thisis a
development of intellect and a modification of environment.

The animals control one another and engage in attack and defense,
634 RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT.

and in his manner develop a vast multiplicity of organs and devices;
so they have horns and tusks and hoofs and claws for attack, and
seales and hair and thick skin and fleet legs and swift wings for defense.
Man also develops implements and agencies for attack and defense;
clubs, bows and arrows, guns, ammunition, fortifications, and all of the
devices of warfare. More than that, and chiefly, he develops institu-
tions, laws as rules of conduct, and sanctions to enforce these laws, and
appoints officers of the law to see them executed. Thus, in modern
society we find a vast system of institutions ramified in many direc-
tions and affecting all the conduct of all mankind. Human evolution
isevolution in institutions; and warfare still exists as a relic developed
from the animal condition.

Animals have opinions, but their opinions are mainly about physical
things, and probably about very simple questions; human opinions
immeasurably transcend animal opinions. Man’s opiiions about these
things are evolved by a self-recognized endeavor to learn by observing
the phenomena of objects in nature, comparing and discriminating and
classifying them by the aid of language. He invents a multitude of
methods of experimentation and verification by which he may gain
certitudes. Further than that, he has opinions about pleasures which
the animal can not enjoy; he has opinions about industries which the
animal can not practice; he has opinions about institutions which
the animals can not organize; he has opinions about opinions which the
animal does not entertain, and, finally, he has opinions about language
which the animals do not understand.

The lower animals express themselves to one another in all their
characteristics; there is thus a natural language, and they utilize this
natural language in a general sign language of designed expression.
From this sign language, conscious of self and self-activities, the ani-
mal learns much of the environment; he knows his home and where
his food is found and where safety may be sought, and a vast multitude
of things, all learned by this crude sign language. But man-proceeds
further, and develops oral speech by a process of increments of inven-
tion; then he symbolizes oral speech with written speech, and far
excels the animal in the expression of his opinions, and this is a char-
acteristic which most clearly differentiates him from the lower animal.
We may imperfectly distinguish man from animal by considering his
physical constitution; but when we desire perfectly to distinguish him,
we are compelled to consider his arts, his industries, his institutions,
his opinions, and his language.

One potent environment has been purposely neglected in the pre-
vious statements. This is the social environment. We have seen that
the physical environment has some slight effect upon the physical man
and an indirect though profound effect upon his mind. Now, the social
effect is direct, and this phase of the subject must be clearly expounded.
The pleasures of the child are almost wholly social pleasures—pleasures
4

in which others cooperate and share. The game of “ring around a
rosy” is a game for many; the game of ball is a game for many. In
the pleasure of all decorations the many take part. In the fine arts,
music is music for many, sculpture is sculpture for many, painting is
painting for many, poetry is poetry for many, histrionic art is play for
many, Story is story for many, religion is worship for many. These are

all for one, but at some time they are all for many. The one in the

family develops through the agency of every member of the family, the
one in the tribe develops in all of these activities through the agency
of the whole tribe, the one in the state develops through the agency of
the state, the one in the world develops through the agency of the
whole social world; so culture passes from parent to child, and from
child to child, and from tribe to tribe, and from nation to nation,
spreading throughout the world. All culture has a personal factor, but
itis only one of its factors which are multitudes in family, tribe, nation,
and world. The development of mind by social environment can be
illustrated by all of the activities of culture. Arts spread from land
to land and modify one another, industries spread from land to land
and modify one another, opinions spread from land to land and modify
one another, and, finally, languages spread from land to land and mod-
ify one another. The way in which this is accomplished can be well
illustrated by a consideration of languages, and the whole subject can
thus be made plain.

There are many languages yet spoken in the world, but it is probable
that a far greater number have been lost. It seems that man, in evoly-
ing from the animal state into the human state, developed a language
within every little kinship tribe. As time went on primordial kinship
groups were consolidated into larger and still larger tribes and finally
into nations. With this change came a change in Janguage; two pri-
mordial groups of primitive tribes uniting to form one compounded their
languages. In the same manner any number of tribes might combine and
their languages compound. ‘This process resulted in the integration or
unification of languages. When the united people separated, and one
portion or the other migrated, gradually both of these divisions would
associate with and become organized into tribes with other tribes speak-
ing other languages. In this manner two distinct languages might be
formed differing more or less from one another, because each great tribe
was constituted of differing primordial tribal elements. Now, this
would result in two languages only in part alike.

In time tribes come together and in time tribes separate; nations
come together and nations separate, and the process of admixture of
Streams of blood results in an admixture of languages, so that at the
present time in the study of one language we always discover two
or more primeval languages, and the greater the culture the greater
the number of primeval languages of which the given language is com-
pounded. The Zuni compose a little tribe in Arizona, only a few
636 RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT.

hundred people speak the language, but it is not a primordial tribe nor
has it a primordial language; at least two and probably several other
primordial languages have been united to constitute the Zuni language.
The English language is composed of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
different languages; we know not how many. The German language is
also composed of many primordial languages, but some of these lan-
guages are common to the English and to the German speaking people.
The primary difference between the Hnglish and the German depends
upon the elements of primordial languages of which they are composed
and of the proportion of these languages which they have absorbed.
All of the languages of the world that have been studied are found
thus composite and to differ from one another in kinds chiefly because
of the different elementary languages of which they are composed. If
a people divide and separate into two or more distinct regions their lan-
guages scarcely change, they may be preserved and remain intelligible
to all for hundreds or even thousands of years; but if two people divide,
one going to one region and another to a different one, and in these
regions mix with other tribes having other languages, compound lan-
guages will develop and will soon become barbaric or nonintelligible to
each other. Now, the point which we wish to make is this, that by
the effect of social environment kinds of languages are integrated, the
totalnumber gradually diminishing. The rate at which these languages
diminish in number steadily increases with the progress of culture. It
is probable that in America there were more than a thousand distinet
languages when Columbus discovered the land, and these languages
were so different that they could not be understood outside of the peo-
ple to whom they belonged. With the progress of culture, many of
these languages have been exterminated, and all are in rapid process
of extermination. Ina century or two they will all be lost. The invad-
ing people greatly outnumber the original inhabitants, and because they
are dominating and controlling in culture the languages of these invad-
ing peoples will prevail, yet many words from the Indian tongues will
be absorbed into the English, the German, the French, and the Span-
ish by theinvader. While these Indian languages are still spoken, they
are rapidly undergoing change, acquiring new terms and new gram-
matic forms by reason of the social environment to which the tribes are
subjected, that is, by acculturation. Thus it is that languages chiefly
develop by acculturation or social environment. The great fact never
to be forgotten in the study and grouping of languages may be expressed
as follows: Languages have not differentiated from one primordial lan-
guage, but have integrated from innumerable primordial languages. One
of the principal differences between these primordial languages seems
to havebeen in phonics; warm climates tended to produce vocalic words,
cold climates consonantal words; but this distinetion becomes obscured
with the progress of culture. Yet still the matter is but partly told.
RELATION OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES TO ENVIRONMENT. 637

There would be no language if there were not two or more persons striv-
ing to express themselves to one another.

Now, let us see how wonderfully language is involved in all other
human activities. What pleasure would there be if there was but one
person living? What pleasure would there be if there were many per-
sons living who could not speak to each other? What welfare could
one person secure from the world it there were no language? if there
were nomeans of linguistic communication there would be no industries
developed. What control could people exert over one anotherif they
could not speak to one another? There would be no institutions organ-
ized. What wisdom would there be if we could not by language learn
from another? Our opinions mainly depend upon our training. A man
without language among men would be a fool, and a person who has no
language, as oral speech, written speech, or touch speech is practically
an idiot. By coordinate and contemporaneous development of all of
these activities which I have described, man largely becomes the crea-
ture of the social environment and the modifier and creator of the physi-
cal environment. Animal evolution and human evolution are immeas-
urably distinct things. Man is man by reason of his mind, and his
evolution is intellectual evolution.
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES
OR ARTS!

By OtT1s TUFTON MASON.

THE ARTS OF LIFE.

My part in this programme is to speak to you upon the influence of
environment upon human industries or arts.

By arts of life are meant all those activities which are performed by
means of that large body of objects usually called apparatus, imple-
ments, tools, utensils, machines, or mechanical powers, in the utiliza-
tion of force derived from the human body, from animals, and from
natural agencies, such as gravity, wind, fire, steam, electricity, and the
like.

There is a study of the activities of life that belongs to natural his-
tory, being concerned with what men are and what they do as mere
animals. They eat, drink, sleep, walk about, and help themselves to
the bounties of nature, regardless of race. Their bones, muscles, and
vital organs in their adult state, in their growth from embryo to decay,
in their specific forms, are to be studied alongside of and in comparison
with the same parts of other creatures. These natural activities of
mankind constitute what, in old-time writers, was the natural as dis-
tinguished from the renewed man. In reality, all these natural endow-
ments, along with other matters of which I am to speak, form part of
the occasioning environment of arts and industries. But our concern
now is with inventions, artificial implements, processes, and results.
We have to study culture or the doings of the artificial man—the
renewed man. All that he does through new devices constitutes his
industries or his true industrial life. The higher any subspecies or
race or nation has climbed into this renewed life the greater has been

its culture.
THE ENVIRONMENT OF ARTS.

The environment of arts is really the sum total of all that is outside
of and in touch with them, including the whole earth and all that on it
dwell, the sun and the planets also, and many of the stars, since men

640 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES.

guide their journeys by them, set their clocks and adjust their cal-
endars according to their movements, and invent the most delicate
apparatus to gaze upon them.

Practically, however, the environment of human arts is the combined
action of the sun, the moon, and the earth, especially at any given
place or in any culture center.

When you look at a terrestrial globe the first thing you notice is
its smoothness and homogeneity. Now, if the earth were as smooth and
homogeneous, that would end the matter. There would have been no
arts, no lectures on their relation to environment, no audiences, and, to
make along story very short, no environment worth speaking about.
If you were to look closely at a globe you would see that itis painted to
represent a great variety of facts about the earth, to declare its physi-
ographic outlines and features, its roughness and heterogeneity. To
be precise, the earth consists of three inclosures—the land, the water,
the air—enveloped in the all-pervading ether. The solid portion may be
called the geosphere, the liquid portion the hydrosphere, the gaseous
portion the atmosphere. These are not so many distinet things, like a
nest of encapsulating boxes, but there exists the most intimate associ-
ations among them; they environ one another. The geosphere invades
the waters and the air. Nowhere are the waters and the atmosphere
free from the invasion of solid particles of matter. The hydrosphere
invades the other two, rising into the atmosphere in enormous quanti-
ties, and sinking into the earth to unknown distances. Finally, the
atnosphere is found permeating the waters, making life possible, and
finding its way deep into the structure of the solid crust. The compo-
nents of the air and of the waters are also the chief ingredients in the
structure of the solid portions. There is no element in the air nor in
the waters that does not exist in another form in the earth’s crust.

I speak of this to impress upon your minds the fact that this mother
planet of ours is not a mere pile of substances without interest in one
another, but a very carefully organized body to do a certain kind of
work. I shall not now stop to inquire whether it was intelligently
planned to do this wonderful work, of which I shall soon speak, or
whether the work is simply the result of its cooperative activities. Ili
will suit my present purpose if I can get you to see with me this mar-
velous set of terrestrial cooperations.

THE SUN AND THE ENVIRONMENT.

The sun in its relation to the geosphere, the hydrosphere, and the
atmosphere forms a part of the environmental cooperations. Our dis-
tance from the source of heat and light and actinism, our curve and
velocity about it and the speed of diurnal revolution, the degree of
inclination of the earth’s axis of revolution to the plane of its annual
path, and, finally, our journey with the sun through space are alla part
of one scheme or congeries of natural phenomena out of which the
’
y

INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES. 641

minutest phases of our industrial life spring. By a simple diagram
(see plate) this action of the sun and interaction of earth strata may
be shown. The ancients divided phenomena into those of earth, water,
air, fire—not a bad division when we are considering the influence of
environment on human actions.

The terrestrial fires are responsible for the corrugations on the earth’s
erust. The solar fires, in cooperation with the moon and the earth’s mo-
tions and its inclination in its orbit are responsible for the movements
of the waters and the air in tides and climate and all the marvelous
changes included in that word. The waters of the earth preserve tol-
erably well the spheroidal form, and the winds and climates of the seas
conform to the simple laws of spherical motion under given conditions.
The lands projecting from the seas by their elevations and conforma-
tions modify the movements of the air and the waters so as to re-create
themselves. The winds of the Atlantic, saturated with moisture, sliding
westward as the earth spins eastward at the rate of a thousand miles an
hour, strike against the mountain barrier of the two Americas. Their
waters are precipitated in deluges on the lowlands and blizzards of
snow on the high mountains. This provokes the action of disintegrat-
ing frosts, of avalanches, of glaciers, of torrents, of rank vegetation to
break down the mountains and form the continents eastward. On the
contrary, west of this vast upheaval the winds from which the water
has been wrung turn the western slopes almost to a desert.

The Eastern Hemisphere has other codes of behavior for the earth,
the air, and the water. The results are the long slope toward the Arctic
and a series of rivers whose mouths are stopped with ice at the moment
when their higher channels are in the periods of inundation. The
Russian and Siberian wastes are the result, and the long north sloping
Piedmont from the North Sea to Lake Baikal.

These coordinating activities result in the rich rivers of China, the
garden spot of Japan, the overwatered regions of southeastern Asia,
the great desert region of central Asia, the varied climate of India, the
excessively complex arrangement of elevation, heat, precipitation, and
water front about southern and western Europe. In Africa and the
Indo-Pacific Archipelagos the phenomena also form part of a single
scheme.

To the arts of man all mountains, all rivers, forests, prairies, and
deserts are necessary,—the deep sea no less than those prolitie feeding
grounds into which early nen ventured and learned their first lesson in
self-confidence, tle end of which would come to be familiarity with the
whole globe.

In fact, the whole world is now, and always has been, 2 single enyi-
ronment for man, fitted up with more or less spacious environments
in which the first human groups settled, and as they became richer and

stronger they took larger and larger apartments. Hach one of these

environments had a character of its own and the only possibility for a

sm 95 41

race to occupy more than one was to become more and more artificial
and to multiply its wants.

SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS.

In this connection, it will be profitable to note how the cosmic forces
have cooperated to create special environmental relationships in the
three kingdoms of nature. The arts of mankind have to do with the
mineral, vegetal, and animal resources of the earth, to procure them,
to manufacture them, to transport them, to count, weigh, measure, and
value them, to exchange them, and to enjoy them, in answer to an ever-
increasing body of wants, working them as materials by means of tools
and machinery, according to methods which constitute the processes of
the arts, always with definite ends in view.

Now, these three kingdoms of nature, though they may have no king
apparent to our senses, are far from being for our race a purposeless
rabble. As with the three spheres of the earth, they also play into
one another indefinitely under the sway of the imperial sun. This
relationship has been represented as in the diagram (see plate).

In the case of the spheres, it was easy to see that if the earth were
perfectly homogeneous and smooth the movements of air and water
would be tolerably uniform; but as things are arranged this would not
be so with our three kingdoms. There would be tropical, temperate,
and arctic plants and animals even then. But with the present order
of contours and movements in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geo-
sphere, the kingdoms of minerals, vegetables, and animals undergo an
endless variety of changes, creating no end of subvarieties in the
environments and stimuli to action and artificial life.

The mineral kingdomis awakened by the sun; not only its mechanical
movements are quickened in the air, the water, and the earth, the cur-
rents of the ocean, the rains, snows, ice, frost, and heat, but somehow his
beams are entangled with life itself, for only in his presence are the
fields and forests clad in emerald, the organs of regeneration made
resplendent in flowers of every possible hue, and new beings come into
life at his bidding. It is only in the unfathomable abysses and in the
unillumined earth that lifeis not. The stream of life flows into the veg-
etal kingdom through the mineral, and a return current brings liberated
oxygen and the products of decay. The stream of life flows from the
vegetal into the mineral with return currents of carbonic acid gas,
decayed matter, and the preparation of the soil. The stream of life
descends from the animal to the mineral, with return currents in
the form of air to breathe, water to drink, and a host of mineral
substances wrought into our blood, brains, and bones.’ The invisible

luminous, actinie and heating. (Smithsonian Report, 1891, pp. 365-415.)

motions produced by the sun’s force becomes visible in the rising
vapors; the motions of the air in the movements of the clouds; the
secret motions of the snow and rain, the dew and the frost in the
downward movement of the lands; the unseen movements of the land
appear in the families, genera, and species of animals; finally, the dis-
tribution of these reveal themselves in ways not known to us in the
specific cultures of mankind belonging to the areas where they arose.

Do you not see that the total result of these natural activities gives
us a world that almost mimics a thoughtful being, with something to
bestow, many things to suggest, power unlimited to lend, and, mark
me, an intelligent discrimination of rewards and punishments whose
effect has been to glorify the good and to destroy the unfit.

I do not say that the world is alive and thoughtful, that its provinces
or areas of separate environmental characterizations are each governed
by a viceroy, but the law of the ingenious mind of man working in
these makes it appear so. His subjective activity is projected upon
the background of the earth, until it is quite certain that he is in coop-
eration with the power that governs it. It is not yet decided how far
this force obtrudes itself upon his will, since it is certain that his con-
Servatism impels him to certain activities against the environment.

KINDS OF ACTIVITIES.

There are six kinds of human industrial arts as regards the environ-
ment, to wit:

(1) Taking the gifts of nature: Man is then a quarryman or miner,
a gleaner, a fisherman, a hunter, and later a domesticator.

(2) Changing the form of natural objects: Man is then a manufac-
turer, mechanic, artisan, an inventor of tools and machines.

(3) Changing the place or position of himself and of things: Man is
then a traveler, a carrier, an engineer, a subduer of force.

(4) Intelligent accounting for things and measuring: Man is then a
statistician, a, measurer, surveyor, gauger, weigher, a maker of clocks
and almanacs, a scientific explorer.

(5) The exchanging of the fruits of labor, commerce, business,
money: Man becomes a merchant.

(6) The arts of enjoyment: Man becomes a user of food, houses, fur-
niture, utensils, equipage, fine art in all its branches.

It is certain that we are brought into relation with nature or envi-
ronment in and by all of these. Indeed, it is due to the great diversity
of environments that they are all possible. If you will run your eye
along the perspective of human history, you will see cultures running
into one another like the streams of a river or the lines of a great struc-
ture. Each culture. was developed in a special environment. The
unicn of two environments eventuates in the union of two cultures,
widening both. ;
644 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES.

CHARACTERISTICS OF ENVIRONMENT.

We may now be allowed to enumerate some of those characteristics
of this composite nature of things whose influence upon our daily
activities we are now contemplating. And first we can not help seeing
that the environment is the provider of all raw materials. This seems
trite, and in its simple statement may be so. But see how each people
of the earth is characterized by its raw materials. An Eskimo collee-
tion is white; the same ideas are expressed by the Haidas south of
them in jet black. The art of the British Columbian is red, of Oregon
and California yellow, of the Pueblos écru, of Mexico gray. All this
is plain enough when you know the color of walrus ivory, of slate, and
mountain goat horn, of cedar, of grasses and spruce root, of fire clay
when baked, and of volcanic building stones. People express them-
selves in the material at hand. The Egyptian was furnished with lime-
stone and syenite, so he bammered away at that. His ideas could
mount no higher than the material. On the other hand, the Greek was
provided by environment with the whitest, finest, and thickest quar-
ries of marble on earth. It was expected of him that he should give
the highest expression of the esthetic faculty in sculpture and archi-
tecture, though his pottery was somewhat inferior. When the whole
world is brought into one environment by the art of transportation,
then other lands have hope to imbibe some of the genius engendered
and fostered about the quarries of Pentelicus. But in the generative
period of industrial forms, before the world-embracing commerce, it
was not So.

Nature or environment appears to us, secondly, in the light of a pur-
veyor of force. At first our race had only the force of its own frail
but versatile bodies to depend upon, yet men will never cease to marvel
at this mechanism aS an economic device for storing and utilizing
power. Whether we regard a machine in the light of saving fuel,
of speed, of ability to change rectilinear motion readily into that of
any curve or succession of curves, the body of man will ever remain
for inventors to wonder at and imitate. Long ago backs and hands
and feet were wearied with ever-increasing burdens, and so the dog,
the reindeer, the horse, the ass, the cow, the camel, the llama, the ele-
phant, and even the sheep were handed over in innumerable packs and
herds to give additional power to industry. These creatures not only
fed and clothed men, they made men’s legs longer, their backs stronger,
their hands more skillful. Then came the wind to blow upon the mat,
the sail, the mill, and the water, moving in its natural currents and
then in artificial channels to turn the wheels of industrialism. How
bountiful has nature been in the supply of force! Who ever dreamed
of exhausting it? How many ships upon the sea would it take to use
up all the winds that blow, and how many turbine wheels would it
he

INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES. 645

require to take up and transform into useful arts the force of all water-
falls?

Jt is true there are environmental gifts that may be ruthlessly
wasted. As Professor McGee has shown, the resources of fertility
wasted in the United States every year exceed those reproduced in
crops. Six hundred million tons of coal are the output annually in the
United States. Many species of most useful animals have been irre-
trievably extinguished, but who ever thought of exhausting gravity,
elasticity, the mechanical powers, the forces of the environment. How-
ever, we must admit that even these natural forces are unequally dis-
tributed, and that gives character also to the arts. There are no
turbine wheels in the desert, no sails cross the zone of calms, and each
domestic animal has its geographic range beyond which it becomes
unprofitable.

In the third place, the environment manifests itself as the teacher of
industries. I should be the last person in the world to rob the ingen-
ious mind of man of its glory in achievements through human industry;
but the fact remains that wherever you enter his workshop, called the
world, you will see hanging on the walls and lying about him all sorts
of patterns and models, and a multitude of processes are going on
which he falls into as “‘heir of all the ages.”

There were cave dwellers before there were men; spiders, mud wasps,
beavers, and birds spun and worked in clay and cut down trees and
made soft beds for their young long ago. Plants reared vessels and mol-
lusks produced dishes that even now are the patterns of the most
Skillful potters. There were hammers, gimlets, pins, needles, saws,
baskets, and sandpaper at hand when the human artisan first became
an apprentice. And I would ask you whether there is any possibility
of this suggestiveness of nature ever being exhausted. Whisperings
_are yet going on in her school. The little birds have not told all the
secrets. The processions toward the patent office prove that the grow-
ing coordinations of environment in relation to the common industries
have turned the village school, with its circumscribed advantages, into
a world-embracing university.

Lastly, I must not fail to tell you that the environment itself is capa-
ble of unlimited education and improvement in relation to the com-
monest wants of life and our ways of satisfying them. There is one
thought about the nature of the common things among which we min-
gle that fills me with ever-increasing delight. It is the sympathetic
response of nature or environment to every affectionate touch. An
industrious and wise farmer settles upon a piece of land. Soon you
behold remunerative crops replacing the forest and the waste. The
man is enriched; he then enriches the land, and by a kind of mutual
admiration they two grow fat together. When a progressive race
has settled down in a part of the earth not too icy, not too torrid, not
646 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES.

discouragingly luxuriant, not absolutely a desert, the same has been
true. The wild and cooperatively relentless wolves have become faith-
ful dogs. The capability was slumbering there. The feeble grasses are
transformed simply by giving the best a chance into prolific grains.
The modest wild flower becomes the florist’s delight, landscape garden-
ing the composite expression of all sesthetic pleasures in form, color,
number, odor, and motion. Professor McGee has called our attention
to the partial desert as the best possible arena for starting certain forms
or epochs of this artificial life which we are now considering, and it is.
Indeed, in this perfectibility of the environment of which I am now
speaking it seems to be the manifest destiny, the natural proclivity, the
ambition of the desert to blossom as the rose. How delightful to con-
template this readiness of nature to respond to the touch of man.

AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTS.

It must have frequently occurred to my hearers that the more cir-
-cumscribed the environment the more dependent the activity must be
upon it and therefore the more monotonous the life must have been.
This is true in the kingdoms of life and also true as among genera and
species of animals. It has been also true among the races of men.
The best examples, therefore, of environment affecting arts and indus-
tries will be found where the tribes are still living in the endogamice
stage of social culture, so that the happy arrangement between the
arts and their surroundings have been as little disturbed as possible.
Taking the Americas at the time when they were first revealed to the
historian you will find that they range through natural conditions
diversified enough to bring into prominence arts adapted to each cul-
ture area and obtrusively different from those of other areas.!

For our present purpose, there may be said to have been eighteen
American Indian environments or culture areas, to wit: Arctic, Atha-
pascan, Algonquian, Iroquoian, Muskhogean, Plains of the Great West,
North Pacifie Coast, Columbia drainage, Interior Basin, California-
Oregon, Pueblo, Middle American, Antillean, South American Cordil-
leran, Andean Atlantic Slope, Eastern Brazilian, Central Brazilian,
Argentine-Patagonian, Fuegian.? These will be given seriatim with the
factors constituting the motives and processes of the arts of life. A
table will follow with the factors at the top. By writing the character-
istics of each factor for each environment you would have at a glance

An. Rep. Bur. Ethnol., with Thomas’s mound maps, 12th An. Rep. Bur. Ethnol., with

with Franz Boas’s Anthropology of the North American Indians, Mon. Internat. Cong.

furniture; extensive use of mats woven or sewed together, and skin
robes. In this area there are the largest number of geometric earth-
works, fortifications, mounds, and shell heaps.

(6) The arts were not of high order; they included chipped, battered,
and polished stone; poor, red pottery; bark, dugout, and wicker ves-
sels; quill work; tawed skin, sinew, and thong or babiche work;

and self-bows, and stone pointed arrows, stone tomahawks and casse-
tetes, clubs armed with jagged blades, lances.

662 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES.

THE COMPRE HENSIVE ENVIRONMENT.

in closing, I desire to call your special attention to the ever inereas-
ing size and variety and comprehensiveness of the term environment
as culture has advanced. At first, in what may be ealled the centrifu-
gal condition of human evolution, the execution of limited environments
went hand in hand with the production of races and varieties of peo-
ples and languages and typical groups of industries. The overstepping
of the boundaries of these in the course of time produced many
changes of the profoundest significance in men and their activities.

First. The increase of knowledge was accompanied with the refine-
ment, the intensifying, and the multiplication of desires and the means
of gratifying them.

Second. These demanded longer journeys and the perfection of
machinery; changes in commerce and the ministers of enjoyment.

Third. They demanded modification and increase of cooperative
forces, of language, of law, of knowledge and intelligence.

Fourth. Growing by what it fed upon, these irresistible tendencies
seized the whole earth, and henceforth it was one oikoumene, one
enclave, one environment.

ENVIRONMENT THE OCCASION NOT THE CAUSE OF INDUSTRIES.

From one point of view it would appear that all mankind and all arts
are the outright product of this cunning environment. But a sober
view, while it gives to the latter all deserved encomium beholds in the
ingenious human creature the true source of all arts. I do not know
a better proof of this than the fact that the withholding or the conceal-
ing of gifts by nature acts as a stimulus to ingenuity. Take, for exam-
ple, the bow. There are regions where the wood for this implement is
perfect, as in South America, or the hard-wood forests of Eastern
United States. Here the very embarrassment of riches lead men to be
satisfied with a very poorly made bow.

Now, the characteristics of a good bow are rigidity and elasticity.
When our ingenious friend, the Indian, climbed the eastern slopes of the
Rocky Mountains, away from the hard-wood forests, he invoked the mam-
mals to yield the sinew from the leg or the scapula and with this he
glues an elastic back upon his poor implement, or unites two or three
horns so as to get his effect, the middle piece giving the columnar resis-
tance, the wings putting to flight the arrow. By and by you approach
the Hyperborean man, you ask him how he is going to have a bow.
He tells you that he is in the current of progressive culture whose law
is ‘the poorer the environment the greater the ingenuity.” It is true
that he has only brittle driftwood, that glue will not hold in his cold
and damp clime, and that materials for arrows are scarce. The result
of this is the sinew-backed bow and the harpoon arrow, together the
most complicated and ingenious device ever contrived by savage mind.
INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES. 663

The bow wood has one virtue, that of rigidity. By an ingenious wrap-
ping of hundreds of feet of fine smew thread or braid from end to end
along the back with half hitches on the limbs, at every danger-point
the virtue of elasticity is added and you have one of the most quickly
responsive implements in the world. The arrow is quite as cleverly
conceived, for it pierces its victim, acts as a drag or log to impede its
progress and by its feather as a signal to the hunter in following his
victim.

IT am sure I should weary you if I should undertake to repeat this
process of thought through the endless varieties of architecture, cook-
ing, living, dressing, manufacturing, and going about. The story is
the same. If men want houses, stoves, furniture, clothing, tools, power,
or carriages or boats, they invent them, spite of environment, or rather
by knowing and mastering the environment. As the size and shape of
a cast is conditioned by the mold, not caused by it, industries are
molded in the environment.

ALL ARE NOT IN THE CURRENTS OF CULTURE.

And now, in thanking you for your patience, let me say that in our
comprehensive epoch, when all sunshine and all lands, and all winds,
and all streams, and all terrestrial phenomena, and all history form the
single and organized environment of every mind, it depends on each

/ nation and each individual to say how much it or he will enter into the

conscious occupation of this estate. Here in the nation’s capital you
may find men and women who can not read or perform any skilled
labor whatever, who are the survivals of long past ages of ignorance
and inexperience, who are only in the eddies of culture—in the zone of
calms. Here also are the great minds of the world in touch with all
culture. Between the two extremes are we, each and all, and I should
be untrue to you if I did not implore each one before me to strive to be
in the moving current as much as poSsible. We are the heirs of the
ages and do not desire to be their prodigal son.

DUTIES OF THE FRIENDS OF TECHNOGRAPHIC SCIENCE.

When we turn our eyes toward that wonderful piece of architecture
and sculpture called the earth, we need not ask in what laboratory it
was executed. Time and Law were the workmen. The hills are almost
as old as the earth, the streams of water are as old as the hills, the con-
tours and coast lines are more ancient than man. AI the forms of
physiographic and vital existence are open for our study. The ground,
the waters, and the air have been associated in the production of the
earth as we now have it. More than all else the earth is the ‘heir of
all the ages.”

I need not tell a company of educated students that the living body
of man is the inheritor oi all general biological laws. To acquaint
ourselves with these laws and to obey them is half the battle of life.
664 INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT UPON HUMAN INDUSTRIES.

Now, few of us have learned this lesson and none of us profit by it.
In that perfect day that is to come the heir of all the ages will look
upon every indulgence that is fatal to life and to full intellectual activity
as a sin and a crime against humanity akin to maiming and murder.

But there are higher laws of existence and the ages have richer
treasures than gravity and physics and chemistry and biology.

A great philosopher of the past tells us that the spiritual life and
the conquest of the earth are better than the ownership of the earth.
This is what Tennyson meant by the ages of which you are the heir.
The substitution of beast, water, steam, and electric power for mere bod-
ily power; the substitution of mechanical devices and engineering for
the hands and the arms of men; the development of literature, paint-
ing, lace work, engraving, sculpture, music, architecture, and land-
scape outof the natural sights and sounds of the world; the origination
and perfecting of language; the gradual organization of the family,
society, and government; the ever-improving explanation of the cos-
mos and ourselves called science and philosophy; the more ideal and
less grossly material unfolding of the spirit world and the divine life
within us are the inheritance of the present generation.

The heir of the ages is one who owns the ages. He is the master of
the ages, not their slave. Their lands and resources, their powers and
machines, their productions and commerce, their accumulations and
enjoyments are his to control. The heir of the ages is a master spirit.
He causes the fire to burn, he is not consumed by it; he causes the
waters to flow, he is not overwhelmed by them; he passes through
the deep, the deep can not enter him; he rides on the wings of the
wind; he harnesses the lightning to his chariot. He is now the realiza-
tion of the myth of Orpheus, at whose touch the rapid rivers indeed
ceased to flow, the savage beasts of the forest forgot their wildness, and
the mountains moved to listen to his song. All nature in his presence
wore new charms. But the comparison does not stop there. This all-
conquering son of Apollo, stricken for the loss of his sensuous Hurydice,
pursued her to the under world. He was allowed to lead her thence
on the promise that he would not look back. But when he turned to
gaze on his lovely Eurydice she vanished forever from his sight. In
unconsolable grief he gave himself to melancholy and was torn to
pieces by drunken Thracian women. They threw him into the Hebrus,
aud it is said that its waters as they roll to the sea still whisper EKuryd-
ice, Eurydice! And thus the heir of all the ages, like a prodigal bird,
perished in the electric light of his own passions.

There is a special sense in which this particular body of hearers are
the heirs of all the ages. It is as the children and the heirs of sci-
ence. Changing events and diversities of ambitions and interests will
bring other men to our side and drive them away again. But thestamp
of our intellectual kinship is upon us. Into our keeping must or ought
to fall her interests and her good name. You should ever be foremost
x Se |

in unselfish devotion, in zeal that looks for no recompense, in love that
springs from intellectual maternity.

One by one or in groups the guardians of the past are surrendering
their trusteeships. To-day it is a great secretary or a genius among
discoverers who lays aside his pen; to-morrow it is a brilliant inventor
or master mechanic; the next day it is a cunning hand that carries to
the dark chamber its pencil or chisel which it can not will away; anon,
a generous patron of science lives no more.

Now, who of all human beings should have a true and abiding inter-
est in the preservation of these honored careers? Whose hearts should
bleed when such men die? Whose hearts should be glad when they
are honored, who in their unwritten wills gave and bequeathed to their
children and heirs to have and to hold so long as they live and to hand
down with accrued interest and betterments to their successors all true
knowledge, all skill acquired with infinite pains, all the harvest of
human industries that have been raised upon the generous and fertile
environment called earth?

THE JAPANESE NATION—A TYPICAL PRODUCT OF
ENVIRONMENT!

By GARDINER G. HUBBARD.

Of all countries of the earth, none have made such wonderful and
rapid progress in form of government and in the development of indus-
tries and commerce, and such great changes in its conditions of envi-
ronment as Japan. This country, which twenty-five years ago was
almost unknown, has come forward to take its place not only as the
foremost of oriental powers, but in the sisterhood of nations. While
we marvel at this wonderful change, a glance at her geographic posi-
tion, her internal and industrial resources, a brief study of her past
history, and of the character, manners, and customs of her people will
help us to understand her present, and perhaps to foretell something
of her future. Both the old and the recent development show Japan
to be a typical product of environment.

In the geographic position of Japan and Great Britain there is a
striking resemblance; both consist of a group of islands with exten-
Sive seacoasts, indented with numerous excellent harbors, and bathed
by equatorial currents; their insular position protecting them from
invasion by land, and offering every opportunity for commercial inter-
course. Almost within sight of each lies a, continent densely popu-
lated, affording a market for productions and manufactures; both are
rich in mines of coal and iron ore. The mines of Great Britain built
up and then stimulated her manufactures, and these developed com-
merce and banking facilities, and made England the first manufactur-
ing, commercial, and financial power of the world. The mines of Japan
are developing her manufactures and her commerce, and she must
become the first commercial power of the Orient.

The Empire of Japan is composed of four large and three thousand
small islands, forming an are of a large circle, extending from the north-
east, within a few miles of Kamchatka, southwest about 2,000 miles,
and with Formosa, nearly 3,000 miles, from an arctic climate to one of
perpetual spring and everlasting summer.

668 THE JAPANESE NATION.

A long range of high mountains follows the general trend of the
islands from northeast to southwest, culminating in the beautiful peak
of Fujiama, 12,365 feet high. Volcanoes and earthquakes give to Japan
its name of “ Karthquake country.” From the mountains clear and
rapid streams make rich the valleys, while inland seas, dotted with
small islands, beautiful bays, and numerous harbors, contribute to make
Japan a nation of sailors, and to cover the waters with vessels and
boats; the whole making a picture of surpassing beauty. The land-
scape is a continuous succession of lofty mountains and valleys, look-
ing out on these inland seas, while the labor of centuries has brought
the valleys and mountain slopes to a high state of cultivation.

Leaving the geography of Japan, let us glance a moment at its his-
tory and see how that has been affected by its geographical conditions
and influenced by its environments.

The oldest existing race is the Ainos, who now live in the northeast-
ern islands of the Empire, the coldest and least desirable portion. They
originally occupied the greater portion of Japan, but were dispossessed
of their lands; driven far north or enslaved, and so gradually inter-
mingled with the subsequent immigrants, who were stronger races.
These immigrants came from the islands of the Pacific, from China,
Korea, and Mongolia. Into the southern portion of Japan came inhab-
itants of the Malay and Polynesian type; into the center came the
Koreans and Chinese, while into the north came men of the Mongolian
type.

The habitable portions of Japan are on or near the shore; this gives
easy communication by water to all parts of Japan, and has led to the
mingling of its races and the formation of the Japanese nation.

OLD JAPAN.

In former times the Mikado, as the earthly representative of the
Deity, ruled with absolute power. But by degrees the Mikado and
his court becoming weak and effeminate, the real power passed from
the court and civil rulers to the army. The military officers gradually
withdrew from court to fortified camps, and subsequently built castles,
where they lived surrounded by their military retainers and depend-
ents. They embodied in their customs and mode of life most of the
features of the feudal system of Europe. Thus, in two widely sepa-
rated portions of the world, each without knowledge of the other,
similar environments produced like systems, and at about the same era.
To the introduction of this system, unknown in any other part of Asia,
Japan is greatly indebted for its subsequent development, for each
castle became a center of civilization and of an independent growth.
The military officers of the Mikado became Daimios, or territorial lords
and barons, living in fortified castles scattered over the country. They
usurped all the offices, compelled the people to become subject to them,
aud through the labor of these serfs acquired large hereditary revenues.
THE JAPANESE NATION. 669

Subordinate to the Daimios were the Samauri, the military class
employed by and depeudent on the Daimios, living on their estates,
faithful and loyal retainers. Under the Samauri were the working
classes, serfs, little better than slaves.

Subsequently one of the Daimios usurped the civil power, nominally
acting as the minister of the Mikado, calling himself the Shogun.
Thus the Shogun acquired the temporal power and control of the army,
leaving the Mikado, who had always been withdrawn from public
sight, only the priestly office and the honor attached.

We have been in the habit of regarding Japan as a hermit nation,
without any relation with the outside world. Fortunately, she has not
been allowed to live permanently isolated from the rest of the world.
Her conditions of environment have been largely infiuenced by three
great waves of civilization which have swept over her. The first, from
Asia, in the sixth century, brought Chinese literature and Buddhism.
The second, in the sixteenth century, from Hurope, brought the mer-
chants of Portugal and Holland and the Jesuits from Spain. The last, .
in the nineteenth century, brought the civilization of America and
Europe, with the Christian religion.

The effect of China on the art, religion, and literature of Japan we
shall consider later.

The merchants of Europe had commercial relations with Japan for
about seventy-five years, between 1550 and 1625. With the traders
came the Jesuits, Xavier and his associates, who made many proselytes,
probably six or seven hundred thousand. This contact with European
civilization wrought important changes in Japan, though not percepti-
ble to us.

During the last part of the sixteenth century persecution began, the
Japanese asserting, and some believing, that the priests were endeay-
oring to overthrow the Government and to convert Japan into a papal
province, and that Christianity tended to lessen reverence toward
parents and ancestors, a prominent feature of the Japanese religion.
This persecution continued until the middle of the seventeenth century,
when the Christians had all either renounced their faith or had been
put todeath. We are told that the annals of the primitive church fur-
nish no instances of greater heroism or constancy than those of the
Christians of Japan.

This attempt to establish commercial relations with Europe and intro-
duce Christianity resulted in the sealing of Japan against all commu-
nication with the outside world for two hundred years, in the expulsion
of all foreigners, and in the prohibition of all intercourse between the
natives and foreiguers, save with the Dutch, at one point. It wasmade
a capital offense to teach or preach the Christian faith, and Japanese
were forbidden to leave Japan under pain of death and confiseation of
their property.

Notwithstanding these laws and the feeling of the people, some light
670 THE JAPANESE NATION.

from abroad continued to shine upon Japan. Shipwrecked crews were
cast upon the shores; foreign ships were seen sailing past, and oeca-
sionally anchored in some port for water or repairs or trade. By slow
degrees a few Japanese became desirous to see more of these foreign-
ers, for although outside barbarians, they yet knew many things of
which the Japanese were ignorant. These inquirers and seekers after
knowledge belonged to the class of men we call radicals.

About the middle of this century, the Mikado, a man of greater ability
than his predecessors, determined to recover the power formerly wrested
from his ancestors, and on conference with some of the Daimios found
they were dissatisfied with the Government of the Shogun and desired
to restore the power to the Mikado, “for all men hated the Shogun
while all men loved the Mikado.” The radicals naturally joined the
Mikado, thinking any change would give greater freedom and lead to
intercourse with that other world of which they knew so little; others of
a conservative temperament as naturally desired the reestablishment
of the old system. Many were therefore united in opposition to the
Shogun.

It was about this time, viz, 1853, that Matthew G. Perry, commander
of anaval expedition of the United States, visited Japan and demanded
the opening of certain ports to American commerce. After making
known his mission he left, saying that he should return and then remain
until the ports of Japan were opened. The next year he returned and
renewed his demands with great tact and moderation. The Shogun,
finding himself without support, was compelled to yield and sign the
treaty. England and other European powers immediately followed the
example of America, and compelled Japan to make treaties with them.
The ports were opened in 1859 and 1860, but for several years there
was very little trade; the lives, even, of foreigners were unsafe away
from their flag. It was only by slow degrees that Western civilization
was brought to Japan and the barriers to intercourse and progress
removed. The Mikado slowly recovered his old powers, while the Sho-
gun lost all his authority.

Then old Japan passed away; the physical environments remained,
all others were changed. An experiment novel in history began. The
closed country was opened; instead of the exclusion of foreigners, they
were invited from all parts of the civilized world. Natives under the
old régime had been forbidden to leave Japan under pain of death.
Now, a commission of the highest nobles, with four cabinet ministers,
was sent to the United States, Germany, England, and Frange, to
study their systems of government, education, finance, justice, and relig-
ion, aud the organization of their armies and navies. Japanese youths
were sent abroad for education, and men of high reputation were brought
from other countries as professors and teachers. The Japanese, though
respecting themselves and their own civilization, realized that in many
respects it differed from that of Western nations, and was capable of
development.
THE JAPANESE NATION. 671

Their financial and educational systems were modeled on those of
the United States, Germany, and England; their judicial system was
borrowed from the codes of half the nations of Europe; their navy
upon the English; their army upon the German system.

In 1871, the Mikado became convinced that the overthrow of the
feudal system was necessary, because opposed to modern life. He
therefore issued an edict requiring the Daimios to surrender their
territorial rights and revenues, to disband their retainers and depend-
ents, and to retire to private life. They generally obeyed, removing from
their castles to the large cities. For the privileges they surrendered
they received an annuity equal to one-tenth of their old revenues, with
relief from the maintenance of their dependents. An annuity was
given to the Samauri, and freedom to the serfs.

Russia, Japan, and the United States each emancipated their slaves
or serfs between 1861 and 1871. Russia emancipated about 49,000,000
serfs and sold to them the lands they had cultivated for their masters,
for a fixed price, payable in annual installments, running through fifty
years. Japan emancipated about 20,000,000 serfs and gave to them
the land they had cultivated, subject only to the usual tax on real
estate. The United States emancipated about 3,000,000 slaves without
any provision for their benefit, save the enactment of laws—sometimes
enforced. The former serfs of Japan are now its peasants and farmers.

In old Japan education was not common, though a considerable por-
tion of the people could read and write. In 1872, the following edict
was passed: “It is intended that education shall be diffused, and there
shall not be a village with an ignorant family, nor a family with an
ignorant member.” Education is now compulsory. The chairs in many
of the universities were at first filled by Americans and Englishmen;
but as soon as the Japanese realized that they had secured from for-
eigners all that they could give, and that they could help themselves,
without being dependent on foreigners, they dismissed them—not all at
once, but gradually. This was carried so far that when the Japan-China
war began there was not a single foreign officer in either army or navy.

Quite recently the Japanese converts have dismissed the professors
in their theological seminary, asserting that the missionaries are unduly
conservative, and not abreast of the best scholarship of America and
Germany; while the Japanese scholars possess advantages in the study
of theology, from their freedom from prejudices growing out of Christian
tradition.

In, 1876, Sunday was adopted as an official holiday, and all acts
against Christians were repealed.

In 1877, an edict was issued forbidding the Samauri to wear the long
and short swords which they had carried for generations—the first for
combat, the second for “‘hara-kari.” In no country has the sword been
an object of such honor as in Japan, for it was a divine symbol, a
knightly weapon, and a certificate of noble birth. It was the life

672 THE JAPANESE NATION.

and soul of their order, yet on a single day it was finally and silently
laid aside, and the old order passed away forever. The best skill of
the artisan had been lavished on the manufacture and ornamentation
of this weapon, at once the terror and safeguard of society. It is said
that the politeness of the Japanese is largely due to the wearing of
this weapon, for the sword once drawn could not be sheathed without
the shedding of blood. When subsequently the law was repealed and
the wearing of swords permitted, the Samauri did not resume them,
for they had ceased to be a symbol of rank.

GOVERNMENT.

In 1889, the Emperor perceived that further changes in the Govern-
ment were required, and in fulfillment of a promise made several years
before gave a written constitution to his people, limiting his own pow-
ers and establishing a parliament, with a representative form of gov-
ernment. Parliament was inaugurated by a procession, in which the
Emperor and Empress appeared together for the first time in public
and as equals. Under the old régime, no subject saw the Mikado,
except his wives and chief minister, for the people had been taught
that no one could see the face of the Mikado and live, while the Queen
was treated as his inferior.

The reorganization of the Government, the compensation to the Dai-
mios and Samauri, and other expenses in making these changes, cre-
ated a large debt, for which bonds were issued. Nearly all these were
taken and held in Japan. The total amount of debt January 1, 1894,
was $286,326,000, exclusive of war debt; interest, 5 per cent. The debt
had been reduced $42,400,000 in eight years prior to 1894. The paper
money, formerly at a heavy discount, has been greatly reduced, and
is now redeemed at par in silver. The finances at the opening of the
war were on a better basis than in most of the countries of Europe.
Taxes, formerly unknown to the people, were imposed, and increased
from time to time, by the Government. This occasioned much dissat-
‘isfaction, but when the war broke out opposition to the Government
was changed to patriotic feeling, and all classes joined in support of

the Emperor.
ROADS.

Another cause which has contributed very greatly to the making of
Japan into a nation is its good roads, which have been for a long time
better than in most other countries. One of the main roads of the
Empire is called the Tokaido, or East Shore road, running from Kioto
to Tokyo, about 300 miles. Along this road are fifty-six stations, or
posthouses. All their large cities are connected by wide roads, with
sidewalks and trees on either side, kept in repair by the General Gov-
ernment, with tea houses at convenient distances. Provincial roads
connect the principal towns in each province, country roads the small
towns; these are maintained, respectively, by the provinces and towns.
THE JAPANESE NATION. 673

There are few horses in Japan, and all travel is either on foot or by
conveyances carried or drawn by men. The norimon, or kaga, a kind
of sedan chair, was formerly used, but the jinrikisha is now the com-
mon carriage—a conveyance introduced within the life of the present
generation, said to be a development of a missionary baby carriage.

The first railroad was constructed in 1870; now between 2,000 and 5,000
miles are in operation. These are largely patronized, the travel increas-
ing every year. Other roads are in process of construction. <A few of
the railroads were built by the Government, most of them by private
companies at a small cost, as labor is cheap.

JAPANESE CUSTOMS.

It is impossible for the foreigner to understand the operation of the
mind of the Japanese, and equally difficult for the Japanese to under-
stand ours. Their environment, their lives, religion, customs, habits,
thoughts, and opinions, inherited from generations, are not only unlike,
but are generally opposed to ours. For instance, while we consider the
relation of husband and wife as the most sacred, a Japanese, in com-
mon with the oriental world, is taught to regard the paternal relation
as the most sacred. A Japanese who would leave father and mother
for his wife would be looked upon as an outcast; therefore the Bible,
teaching that ‘‘a man shall leave father and mother and cleave unto
his wife,” is regarded as irreligious and immoral. The family in Japan
is not only the unit of social life, but the father as head of the family
exercises supreme authority over the children and grandchildren. The
doctrine of ancestral worship, prevalent in Japan and China, arose
from reverence and obedience to the head of the family; but as it sub-
jects the will to another it deprives the individual of personality.

WOMEN.

We are told that “the Japanese women are the crowning charm of
Japan,” and that the key to their life is obedience and subjection to
the will of another. For generations the women have been taught
that the three great religious duties of woman are obedience, as a
daughter, to her father; as a wife, to her husband; as a widow, to her
eldest son. The wife wears mourning when she leaves her parents
to become the member of another family, while the absolute control of
her life and will is transferred from her father to her husband.

The women are not as well educated as the men, yet in the literature
of Japan there are many poems written by them. They mingle much
more in social life than in any other Asiatic countries, and the Japa-
nese girlis regarded by Asiatics much as the American girl is regarded
by Europeans. Women are not secluded in harems, yet as in all ori-
ental countries their lives are spent at home, withdrawn from associa-
tions outside the family circle. In the upper circles the man and wife
neither take their meals nor appear together.

674 THE JAPANESE NATION.

Instead of clubs, the Japanese frequent tea houses, where dancing
girls and musicians, called ‘‘ gaishas,” are found, for relaxation, social
intercourse, and amusement. These girls, associating with men and
taught to interest and amuse them, become to a certain extent edu-
cated, acquire conversational ability, and often have more influence
over the man than has the wife. That the development of a nation
depends as much on the women as on the men is a principle not yet
appreciated in Asia, and its recognition is one of the great blessings
that Japan will acquire from Europe.

JAPANESE DRESS.

A few years ago many Japanese substituted the European dress for
the oriental as an evidence of civilization, but they soon realized that
it was unsuited to Japanese life and that its adoption would lead to
the introduction of Western domestic customs and the abandonment
of their ancestral habits; a reaction followed, and they generally decided
to retain their own dress. In the army, navy, police, and in business
houses fashioned on foreign models, the European dress has been
adopted as most convenient. Although required in court circles, some
officials who are compelled to wear the Huropean dress take it off as
soon as they return home. One very wealthy nobleman occupies a
double house—one half his Japanese home, in which he lives; the other
half furnished in the French style, where he receives foreign visitors
and officers of the court. The kimono, a long dress open in front, fas-
tened around the waist by a girdle, is the principal garment of both
Sexes, and is better fitted for sedentary than active life.

If Japanese women take the position that women hold with us, they
must change their dress to suit their new occupations. This will re-
quire them to give up their quiet life and live among inen, and not,
as now, at home. We trust they will retain their exquisite taste in the
beautiful designs and colors of their silk and cotton textures even if
they change the fashion of their dress.

BUILDINGS.

The Japanese houses usually receive light and air not from the street,
but from small courts or gardens in the rear. The entire side of the
house on the garden is movable, so that the interior ean be thrown open
tothe day and sun light. The houses generally have overhanging roofs,
which are either shingled, tiled, or thatched. The floor is raised from 18
inches to 2 feet above the ground, and the space between the floor and
ground is generally left open for the air to blow through. ‘The houses
are usually small and low, from 6 to 8 feet in height; the partitions are
wooden panels 3 feet wide, sliding in grooves in the floor and ceiling, and
covered with paper. Neither paint, varnish, oil, nor finish is used about
the house. Instead of windows they have screens covered with thin
white paper, protected on the outside by sliding shutters. As the people
THE JAPANESE NATION. 675

sit upon the floor, they have no need of furniture. For seats they have
mats, all of the same size and alike. The size of the room is known by
the number of mats on the floor. Upon these mats the people eat,
sleep, and die. ‘They are bed, chair, lounge, and table combined.
Their meals are served in lacquer dishes on the floor. The mats at
night are covered with wadded quilts, put away in the daytime,
and on these they sleep. The houses are without fireplaces, chim-
neys, or smoke, being heated by braziers of charcoal. Every house
contains one or more vases, and often hanging baskets filled with flowers
arranged with greater taste than with us, while the paper upon the
panels forming the partitions is ornamented with drawings and pictures
more beautiful than those we find in our homes. Fireproof buildings are
attached to many of the large houses, into which furniture and valuables
can be moved in case of fire. Some writers criticise the houses of the
Japanese because they are built of such frail materials and so loosely
put together, forgetting that these typicai Japanese houses, though
entirely unsuited to our life, are better fitted for earthquake-shaken
Japan than buildings of wood and stone. A few hundred dollars will
buy and furnish a good and commodious house. Mr. Morse tells us that
his house in Tokyo was 21 by 31 feet, with an annex 15 by 24 feet, with
vestibule, hall, and kitehen—seven rooms and nine closets. The cost
of the house was about $1,000, on a lot one-quarter of an acre in extent
which cost $330; annual tax, $5.

Public baths are universal, and for a cent or two one may have a hot
bath, while for the house they have bath tubs made with ovens for
heating water. That the Japanese are a most cleanly race is apparent
in their houses, their workshops, and in the care with which they look
after everything in their charge.

Western architecture has been adopted for buildings in which West-
ern occupations are carried on—as the post-offices, custom - houses,
breweries, and cotton mills—but even in these buildings they have often
developed purely oriental features.

LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.

The Japanese language is a combination of the tongues of the ancient
inhabitants of the islands, and is therefore unlike other languages.
Literature was introduced into Japan from China with the religion of
Buddha; but the words and the pronunciation have been so softened
to fit the melodious Japanese tongue that a Japanese can not under-
stand a Chinese nor a Chinese a Japanese. As a large proportion of
the Chinese characters are used, it is not difficult for a Chinese and
Japanese to communicate by writing.

The difficulty of learning to write the Japanese language is very
great, as in addition to the Japanese alphabet some 15,000 to 20,000
Chinese characters must be memorized and the eye and hand trained
to distinguish and delineate them. It is said that it requires seven
676 THE JAPANESE NATION.

years for a boy to become sufficiently familiar with the Chinese charae-
ters to use them readily; thus the time given to real intellectual train-
ing is greatly lessened.

An American started the first newspaper in 1871 with 1,200 charac-
ters, but was compelled to increase them, and now uses 12,000. In the
printing office each compositor sits at the desk with the ietters of
the Japanese alphabet within his reach, while boys bring the Chinese
characters from their numerous piaces for him to set up.

The Japanese literature is rich in works of fiction, fables, legends,
and poetry. Many of the legends are very beautiful, full of poetic
feeling and fancy, and as they are generally written in Japanese are
largely read by the common people.

As science and arts are unknown to the Asiaties, their language is
insufficient for the requirements of the highest intellectual and scien
tific culture.

RELIGION.

The earliest religion of every savage tribe is the expression of fear
and dread of the unknown and a desire to propitiate the mysteries,
both evil and good, and is always largely affected by the environment.
In Japan earthquakes average two a month, and one hundred in one
revolution of the moon are not uncommon. Almost every mountain
top is or has been a crater from which the molten lava has flowed
down, destroying many a village and town. Floods of rain on the
mountains often cause great landslides and inundations, destroying
towns and cities, while once or twice a year the typhoon, most dreadful
in its ravages, must be expected. These all affect the mind and influ-
ence the religious feeling. The God of Thunder, of the Harthquake,
and the Dragon all men worshiped. The earthly representative of
the Deity was the Mikado, whom all men reverenced, feared, and
obeyed. In the family ancestral worship—reverence and obedience of
the child to the father during his lifetime—was taught. This principle
has been unfavorable to the development of the race, as it involves the
sacrifice of independence, free will, and personality.

The mythology of Japan abounds with beautiful, romantic, and weird
stories, the foundation of much of its art and poetry. As the intellec-
tual progress of the people, their art and literature were developed,
the need of a religion higher and more spiritual than Shintoism—as
their old religion was called—was felt. This was found in Buddhism,
which came from China in the sixth century. It taught patience, cour-
age, charity, the subjugation of the animal nature and passions, the
purification and elevation of the moral nature in the struggle for higher
life. It regarded the present as only the highest of a series of trans-
formations through which the soul must pass to reach Nirvana, the
eternal peace; but if the discipline of this life should be ineffectual to
elevate the man, the soul must return to a lower animal life, once more
to pass by ascending incarnations to its final absorption in Buddha.

THE JAPANESE NATION. 677

The influence of this religion was not confined to the daily life, but
acted upon the literature and art.

For a time it seemed as if Buddhism would supplant Shintoism and
become the religion of Japan, but instead of that it elevated and
spiritualized Shintoism, so that it regained much of its hold upon the
people. The priesthood is not a caste, nor is the whole life of the priest
devoted to religious observances. In the Shinto temple neither idols,
images, nor pictures are found; only the altar on which are laid offer-
ings of fish and fruit. At different times eminent men in each of these
religions have formed sects, with many followers.

Christianity has made many converts in Japan since the ports were
opened, whose numbers are steadily increasing, but Buddhism is still
their religion.

ART.

The art of the Japanese differs from that of the Aryan or Indo-
European, for it is not as with them the grafting of one style upon
another, but the accumulated knowledge of many centuries, unaffected
by foreign influences. Within its confined scope it was in advance of
the art of other nations when the country was opened to foreigners.
For her art as well as her literature, Japan is undoubtedly indebted to
China and Korea, as among the most skillful workmen of the famous
Satsuma faienee are the descendants of Korean artists. After the
introduction of art its development was greatly promoted through
the influence of the feudal system. The Daimios required swords and
armor, and their retainers were employed in their fabrication. What-
ever time or labor was required to produce the finest and most beauti.
ful article was freely given, and thus skillful artists were trained first
in the fabrication of swords, and then in works of art. There was
great rivalry among the Daimios and these artists to produce the most
beautiful works, and this rivalry was further stimulated by the custom
of sending beautiful presents from one lord to another.

Pictorial art has never attained any great importance, but the dec-
orative and industrial art of Japan is original, and excites the adimira-
tion of the world. The children early use the brush in making the
many lines and curves required to form the complicated Chinese char-
acters, and thus acquire that accuracy of eye and skill of hand neces-
sary for artistic work. They have no knowledge of the architecture or
art of Egypt, Babylon, and Greece, on which that of Europe and
America‘is founded. They know little of either sculpture or music in
their highest development, and their delineations of the human form,
although showing skill, are only bizarre and grotesque; but they have
the closest and most sympathetic appreciation of mature in her most
delicate and beautiful aspects, and their exquisite representations of
‘the varied forms of animal, insect, and plant life make their work the
wonder and envy of our Western artists.

In porcelain, pottery, and lacquered ware and in metals and bronzes
678 THE JAPANESE NATION.

the Japanese have never been surpassed. Their swords were almost
miracles of beauty and skilled workmanship, and there was a great
demand for them, as every Samauri wore two swords.

The art treasures of Japan were first brought to our notice at the
expositions of London and Paris in 1862 and 1867, of Vienna in 1873,
and of Philadelphia in 1876. And it was the opinion of experts, ‘‘ that
for beauty, grace, and perfection of workmanship, variety of form, and
novelty of design, they competed successfully in Paris with the best
products of Parisian ateliers, in Vienna, with Viennese specialties,
and in Berlin with the celebrated iron and bronze work of that capital,”
while they could be sold at a price below that of European articles of
similar kind.

But the environment was changed; different and newer work espe-
cially designed for the European market called for and produced in
great quantities and this new demand, unfortunately, does not require
the taste, beauty, and delicacy which characterized the early produc.
tions.

There is no better illustration of the modification in Japanese decora-
tive art resulting from outside influence than in the pottery known
commercially by the name “Satsuma.” The Satsuma potteries have
been in operation for many centuries, and their products are highly
prized by the Japanese. The true Satsuma ware, such as is found in the
cabinets of Japanese collectors, is always small, of graceful form, with
simple decorations of flowers and birds so disposed as not to cover up
the delicate crackled glaze which they greatly admire. The Satsuma
ware most highly prized by many European and American collectors
is quite different, being usually in the form of large plaques or vases,
covered with elaborate, theatrical paintings of men and women, in
brilliant costumes, absolutely obscuring the color and texture of the
ware. Nor is it a product entirely of Satsuma, the decoration being
applied in Tokyo and elsewhere.

With the increase of the demand, the individual workman is giving
place to men and women crowded together in factories using machinery,
where the personality of the workman disappears.

In considering the art of Japan and the great progress made in this
and other departments, we must bear in mind that this development
has been on lines in which the Japanese had formerly been distin-
guished, for they have accomplished little in any of the arts and sciences
introduced from Europe, excepting such as could be done by imitation.
Painting, music, architecture, and sculpture require time and the culti-
vation of the mind and taste.

ARMY.

The Japanese have always been a warlike people. Twenty-five years
ago Japanese soldiers were armed with bows and arrows, with a few
great, heavy, unwieldy muskets of the time of the Armada, wore huge
THE JAPANESE NATION. 679

grotesque masked helmets to frighten the enemy, with chain and lac-
quered armor for defense and protection, and were commanded by a
man with a fan. In 1871, their old arms were thrown aside; experi-
enced officers from France and Germany organized a new army, with
continental conscription and regular training. The transformation was
rapidly carried out without diminishing the warlike spirit of the Japa-

nese. In January, 1893, before the Japan-China war broke out, Japan

had an army which, though small, would not have done discredit to
any of the nations of Europe in organization, discipline, and equip-
ment. Its actual fighting strength was between 60,000 and 70,000 men,
with power to call a much larger reserve force into the field. The
Japanese had then neither great machine shops nor facilities for build-
ing ships, nor for the manufacture of large cannon, but they acquired
from Europe armaments, ships, cannon, and equipment for their army.

NAVY.

The position of Japan, with its inland seas and good harbors, early
led them to become good sailors. The vessels of old Japan have been
replaced by a large fleet of sailing vessels and steamers.

In the recent war between Japan and China, the two countries
present strong contrasts. Its opening found Japan fully prepared, all
plans for the campaign rapidly made; China, without any plans. The
navy of each nation composed of the best modern ships and guns built
in Kurope; the Japanese fully equipped and manned by their own offi-
cers, the Chinese officers generally aided by Europeans. The fleets of
China now either lie at the bottom of the ocean or tly the flag of Japan,
enrolled in its navy. The campaign was as well planned and carried
out by Japan as the campaign of Germany against France in 1870.
The war was the contest of civilization against barbarism, of intelli-
gence with ignorance.

The ports of China were opened to foreign commerce before those of
Japan, and China had for a long time more intercourse and larger com-
mercial relations with Europe than Japan. But China represents
ancient conservatism, neither change nor progress, stagnation with-
out life. What China was three thousand years ago that she is to-day,
while Japan represents entirely new conditions of environment, fol-
lowed by the most rapid and striking development the world has ever
witnessed.

Japan is not only the foremost nation of the East, but her civiliza-
tion compares in many ways favorably with that of Europe.

INDUSTRIAL ERA.

The natives of Asia, unlike those of Africa and America, have always
been industrious, economical, and hard workers. They have not, there-
fore, to learn the hardest of lessons—to work—but only to apply their
work in new directions.
OSUNT THE JAPANESE NATION.

Although the ports of Japan were nominally opened in 1854, it was
not until the appointment of Commissioner Harris, in 1860, that any
trade was carried on. From a very small beginning it slowly but
steadily increased each year more and more rapidly. At first all kinds
of foreign goods were bought and found a ready market; the imports
largely exceeded the exports, and the balance was paid in gold and
silver, the accumulation of centuries. i

Then came hard times for Japan; imports fell off, for the people had
no means to pay for them. Next came the great expositions in Europe
and America and a demand for the products of Japan—their tea, silk,
and art works—so great that the balance of trade turned in their favor.
A good market for cotton goods among the Japanese was created,
and to supply this demand the manufacture of cotton yarn into cloth
was commenced, and then as the demand increased, factories were
started with machinery imported from the United States. Then cotton
was imported, more factories built, the machinery copied and made by
the Japanese. Now Japan is exporting cotton goods to India and
China in competition with England, and will soon supply the market
of the nations on the Indian and Pacifie oceans.

Until 1860, all commerce between Japanese ports were in Japanese
junks and boats, then English and American steamboats took their
place for a few years, only to be supplanted by Japanese steamships,
and now one of the Japanese steamship eompanies is among the largest
in the world. They are now sailing to the islands of Australasia and
India; soon the Japanese flag will be seen at Tacoma and San Fran-
cisco, and will ere long drive out English and American vessels from
the carrying trade of the Pacific for the same reasons that they have
driven their vessels from the Japanese waters.

The opening of the ports was followed by the establishment of
foreign banking, mercantile, and trading houses. Their number rap-
idly increased, and the trade, both wholesale and retail, was carried
on by foreigners, and all suits between foreigners and natives were
tried by foreign consuls. Gradually Japanese retail shops were opened
in the ports, then wholesale warehouses and banking houses were
started, and treaties made by which Japanese tribunals were substi-
tuted for foreign courts. Soon all this foreign trade must pass into
Japanese control.

When we see what one generation has accomplished, and remember
that those whose fathers knew nothing about cotton or cotton goods,
nothing of machinery or manufactures, are becoming large manu-
facturers aud supplying Asia, we begin to realize the magnitude of the
change, and wonder what will be the ultimate result of these new con-
ditions of environment to Japan and the world. The preparation began
on a small scale some years ago has been steadily carried on. The

steamers to ply between the ports of Japan and Seattle in connection with our
northern railroads.

rapid mountain torrents with their falls furnish water for electric power,
her numerous and extensive coal fields steam power for the manu-
facture of the products of her mines and forests. Wages are low, for
the people live on easily obtained rice and fish, in houses cheaply
built, with low rents. Only 20 to 30 cents a day is paid for work that
commands ten times as much in Hurope and America, while the quick
intelligence of her people give Japan facilities for rapidly becoming a
manufacturing nation. A recent traveler says, ‘“¢‘ You can not suggest
to me one article that I can not export in six months from Japan,
and, regardless of our tariff laws, undersell the market in the United
States.”

They are the French of the East; their artistic instincts and their
ingenuity in the use of machinery make them the competitors of
Europe, particularly in specialties. Their profits are so large that their
industries will increase with greater rapidity every year.

Japan as a nation possesses an individuality stronger than our own.
Our power of cooperation and organization of men and capital into cor-
porations gives to us a certain advantage, but even this corporate
organization they are rapidly acquiring.

The wages of labor in Japan must necessarily increase, but not in one
generation, scarcely in two generations, can all their habits of life,
their dress, food, and homes change so greatly as to increase the price
of labor more than 100 or 200 per cent. Yet at this increase wages in
Japan would be very much lower than in Europe or America.

Our brief sketch shows somewhat of the changes which new condi-
tions of environment have worked out within twenty-five years. The
hermit nation has come into communication with the great powers of
the world; her embassies are found in the capitals of Europe and
America; she holds her position with dignity and self-respect. Her
present position is honorable, the presage of a brilliant future.

Japan is indeed a typical product of environment. A warm climate,
where the land and water not only contribute food, but induce con-
tinued intercourse and the welding of different races into one nation.

From the contact of man with man, from city life, not from country,
comes the highest civilization. In Japan this contact has been main-
tained for centuries and has led to the steady development of her
people. Volcanoes, earthquakes, mountain torrents, and typhoons have
affected not only the land, but the character, religion, and art of its
inhabitants, while its development has been hastened by the opening
of the ports, the introduction of Western civilization, and the demand
for her products in every market of the world.
THE TUSAYAN RITUAL: A STUDY OF THE INFLUENCE
OF ENVIRONMENT ON ABORIGINAL CULTS.'

By J. WALTER FEWKES.

The science called ethnology claims as its field of research the study
of all racial characteristics of man. It deals not only with his phys-
ical features, social grouping, and geographical distribution, but also
with the products of his hand and mind, his thoughts and feelings.
No race or individual is so low in the scale of being as to be utterly
devoid of some idea of the supernatural, and as this is a universal
human characteristic it is naturally one of the subjects which presents
itself for study by the ethnologist. The study of the evolution of
supernatural ideas, like that of all other human characters, ought not
to be limited to a few favored races, nor should the term “religion,” in
its scientific use, be restricted to any group or race of man. It must be
broad enough to embrace the supernatural conceptions of all men, low
and high in the seale. No poor or insignificant grouping of men and
women should be regarded too wretched to be studied, and the scien-
tific man can not overlook any if he is loyal to scientific methods. A
generalization which is built on limited knowledge of the religious
characteristics of a few men or those of gifted races will as surely
fail as a general law of linguistics based on the language of any one
of the great races to the neglect of others. There was a time when
naturalists overlooked the lowest animals in their studies of the evolu-
tion of organic life, but now it is universally recognized by biologists
that we must look to the most inferior animals for a solution of many
problems connected with the highest. In studies of the development
of the supernatural in the mind of man the same thing is true. The
laws of the evolution of religious thought can not be scientifically
studied if the culture of primitive man is neglected. Unless I am
greatly mistaken, the roots of some of the purest spiritual conceptions
reach far down into savage and barbarous stages of culture.

We are accustomed to designate the crude supernatural ideas of
Savage and barbarous peoples as cults, and every cult will be found
on examination to be composed of two complemental parts, known as

1Saturday lecture in the Assembiy Hall of the United States National Museum,

683
684 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

mythology and ritual. Around the former group themselves the vari-
ous beliefs regarding the supernatural, and about the latter the pro-
cesses by which man approaches and influences these supernal concep-
tions. This bifid strand runs through all supernatural ideas, from
those of the savage to the civilized man. As nature has thus united
them, they must always be considered together in scientific studies.
We have seen in one of the previous lectures of this course how certain
arts of man are affected by environment. I shall endeavor to show a
connection between ceremonial practices and climatic conditions, which
are, I take it, essential factors of environment. For an illustration, I
have chosen the influence of an arid climate upon the ritual of one
cluster of American Indians.

There are certain common components of all cults which are as widely
spread as the races of man and exist independently of surroundings,
while there are others which are profoundly affected by environment.
Our subject especially deals with the latter, and as the ritual is capable
of more exact scientific analysis, I have in mind to discuss the modifi-
cations in it which can be traced to purely climatic causes.

To simplify the elements of the problem we must chose not only a
primitive form of ritual, but also as far as possible one which has been
but slightly modified by the introduction of foreign influences, and
hence other environments. We must avoid as much as possible com-
plexity due to composition. It is a very difficult task to determine the
aboriginal cults of any primitive people, for modifications resulting
from contact with other races are present almost everywhere we turn.

‘very cluster or grouping of men known to me is composite in its
character. Yet the task is not wholly hopeless or beyond our powers.
The work before the American student is facilitated by the fact that
we have still living in our country surviving members of the American
race who, on account of isolation, have been slightly modified by
foreign influences. I wish this afternoon to call your attention to one
of these, and to discuss the influences which evironment has exerted
on their ritual.

The people concerning whom I shall speak are commonly ealled the
Mokis, although they prefer to be known as the Hopi. They live ina
region of Arizona, which from its discovery in the middle of the six-
teenth century, has been designated Tusayan. The Hopi or Tusayan
Indians belong to the so-called village or pueblo people—the peculiar
culture of prehistoric Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah.
While what I shall say especially concerns one group, it may in a gen-
eral way be applied to the culture of a wide territory called the pueblo
area of the ‘southwestern part of the United States. In a natural
sequence a discussion of the effect of environment would follow a
statement of the distinctive characters of the physical features which
characterize surroundings; and in order that you may have an idea
of the climatic conditions of Tusayan, let us take a few moments to
THE TUSAYAN RITUAL. 685

consider these peculiarities of the environment. In physical features
this province is a part of the great arid zone of the Rocky Mountains, to
which in former times was given the name of Great American Desert.
It lies in the northeastern part of Arizona, about 90 miles from the
nearest village of white men on the south and about the same distance
east of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. On all sides it is isolated
by dry deserts, a dreary extent of mountains, mesas, and arid plains
about 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. No permanent streams
of water refresh these parched canyons or fields, and the surroundings
of this isolated tribe, organic and inorganic, belong to those character-
istic of desert environment. The rains are limited in quantity—liable
to fail at planting times, although later in the summer pouring down
in copious torrents, that fill the depression by which the water is
rapidly carried away from the thirsty fields. Springs of permanent
water are small and weak, and when abundant, poor and hardly pota-
ble. In this unpromising land a few less than 2,000 Indians strive to
maintain themselves by agriculture from a barren sandy soil which
a white farmer would despise.

Nor is the unremunerative soil the only hostile environment with
which this industrious race of aboriginal farmers has had to contend.
Incoming marauders, in the form of nomadic enemies, have from pre-
historic times harassed them, preyed on their farms, and forced them
to adopt inaccessible mesa tops, high above their fields, for protection.
Perched on these rocky eminences they have erected seven stone vil-
lages in so clever a way that they seem to be a part of the cliffs. Ani-
mals in desert surroundings as a protective device have taken on the
color of the soil, but these men have built their towns in the cliffs so
deftly that they seem to be parts of the mesas themselves. They have
succeeded well in this protective device, due to environment, for at a
distance the pueblos are indistinguishable from the cliffs on which they
stand.

I need not dwell on the forbidding aspect of the mesa tops on which
these villages are built. Not a sprig of verdure, drop of water, or frag-
ment of fuel is to be found upon them. If there is one physical feature
which may be said to characterize Tusayan, it is the paucity of water,
or rather its unequal distribution in different seasons of the year.

The character of animal life is also significant, fer it is of such a
nature as to exert a profound influence. A race dependent on animal
food alone would have starved for game. The great ruminants, as the
bison, which more than any other animal influenced the culture of the
Indians of the great plains of the Mississippi, never visited this region.
No domesticated animals made pastoral culture possible. There were
small rodents, many rabbits and hares, and a scanty supply of antelope
in distant mountains. Unpromising as was the soil for agriculture, the
resources of the hunter were much less, and in this region man was
forced to become an agriculturist.
686 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

It is, therefore, clear that the sedentary agricultural life of the
Tusayan Indian is the direct result of organic and inorganic surround-
ings. Forced from some reason unknown to me to live in a land where
animals were so few that he could not subsist from the products of the
chase, he found a possible food supply in plant life, and he accepted
the inevitable. He adopted the life which environment dictated,! and
accepting things as they were, worked out his culture on the only pos-
sible lines of development. He raised crops of maize, melons, and
beans, cultivated and harvested various grains, but at times when
other things failed found food in cacti and the meal of pion nuts.
Accepting the inevitable, man’s ritual became a mirror of that part of
his environment which most intimately affected his necessities. The
irregularity of the rains, and the possibility that the corn may not
grow, developed the ritual in the direction indicated. As long as the
processes of nature go on without change, no special rain or growth
ceremonials would develop. In a bountiful soi] which never fails the
farmer, where the seed dropped in the ground is sure to germinate, and
the rains are constant, no ritual would originate to bring about what
was sure to come. But let natural processes be capricious, awake in a
primitive mind the fear that these processes may not recur, let him
become conscious that the rains may not come, and he evolves a ritual
to prevent its failure. He is absolutely driven to devise ceremonials
by which to affect those supernatural beings whom he believes cause
the rain and the growth of his crops. The cults of a primitive people
are products of their necessities, and they become complicated as the
probability of their needs not being met are uncertain. The two needs
which sorely pressed the Hopi farmer were rain to water his crops and
the growth and maturity of his corn. My problem, therefore, is to
show by illustrations that the two components, rain making and growth
ceremonials, characterize the Tusayan ritual, as aridity is the epitome
of the distinetive climatic features of the region in which it has been
developed.

There are, as before stated, certain elemental components of all cults
which are aS widespread aS man, and apparently exist independently
of climatic conditions. These elements are psychical, subjective, and
occur wherever man lives in deserts, islands, forests, plains, under
every degree of latitude and temperature. A more profound philo-
sophical analysis than I can make may resolve even these into effects
of environment, but their universality would seem to show that they
are not due to the special climatic condition of aridity characteristic of
Tusayan. I do not regard it pertinent to my discussion to attempt to
explain their origin, but we can better appreciate the Tusayan ritual.

The genus Homo, emerging from genera of animals, most of which

were timorous and bodily weak, inherited from them a wonder and fear
at anything unusual or uncanny. This dawning intelligence, influenced
by such sentiments as wonder, fear, hope, and love, reached that
mental condition when, as pointed out by King, it ascribed all happen-
ings about itself to luck.’ His heritage was a mind unable to separate
the normal from the abnormal, and everything to such a mind is mys-
terious, and all nature is regarded as living, but we can hardly sup-
pose that in that condition it deified or saw gods in everything. Man
understood the causes of few of the mysteries about him, and felt him-
self at the caprice of chance. He was a consistent fatalist, overlooking
good, for that was normal, but associating the bad with chance. In
this early condition a stage of supernaturalism called fetishism, or the
use of charms, spells, amulets, mascots of various kinds to control
chance, arose. As far as I know, no race has wholly outgrown this
condition, and the lower we descend in the scale of humanity, either
historically in our own race, or ethnographically among savages, the
relative predominance of fetishism increases. There is no more con-
stant element, none following the same law of increase; the present
forms of monotheism have the least, the lowest savage the most. While
at present there survives no people so degraded that fetishism is the
only cult, those nearest that stage are the lowest in mental, moral, and
social attainments. I need not remind you that at that early stage a
fetish was not an idol, it may or may not have had a regular form; a
stone, a root, an amulet may serve as a fetish. In this stage of
development every individual came to believe that he had a certain
protective charm. We can hardly believe he had a system of gods or
that he recognized such. Later in its evolution fetishism became
incorporated with other higher elements, especially symbolism, but in
its archaic conception this was impossible.

The highest outgrowth of pure fetishism was the shaman or medi-
cine man. It was recognized that certain men were gifted with occult
powers beyond their fellows, and were more potent to control happen-
ings. But this medicine man made use of impersonal amulets, not
personal spirits.

The second stage in the growth of the supernatural was a belief ina
spirit? or double of man, the concept of animism. When through

1T find myself in accord with Mr. J. H. King, who has discussed this subject at
length in his work, The Supernatural; its Origin, Nature, and Evolution. While
there are several points in his discussion where I can not see my way clear to
accept his interpretations, I have in others found my views almost coinciding with
his. He has discussed the subject in so scholarly a manner that the small space [
can give to this great subject might have been better occupied with quotations
from his volumes. His work should be thoughtfully studied by everyone interested
in this subject.

“The recognition of spirit was of very early date, and is regarded by Sir J. Lub-
bock, Dr. Tylor, and Herbert Spencer as characteristic of all supernaturalism. Mr.
King, however, seems to me to have advanced strong reasons to show that fetishism
may have antedated animism. Although I have adopted his view, I am sure there
is much to be said on the other side.
688 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

dreams and other psychical phenomena man recognized his soul, he
immediately extended his concept to animals, plants, stones, all things,
and thus everything was thought to have an intangible double, soul.
Man sought to ally himself with some one of these souls; if a hunter,
some animal spirit, for instance, as an aid. This became his totem, and
everything came to be a totem of power depending on needs of man.
As fetishism was the archaic condition in the groping of the human
mind, totemism was the following, and both evolved tegether, mutually
reacting on each other and interdigitating in their development.

As the inevitable outgrowth of animism and its twin brother totemism
came ancestor worship. Totemism and animism are sometimes limited
to animal worship, from the fact that zoomorphic totems naturally
were chosen by hunters, but especially among agricultural people totems
of corn, rain, and the like replaced zoomorphic forms. The forces of
nature thus became totems—sun, moon, earth—some with animal, others
with human personalities. A totem of a family became a tutelary god,
and groups of tutelary gods with a regal head became a council of gods
as among the old Greeks.

Political and religious conceptions kept pace, a patriarchal head of
the family was reflected in the mythology. A king suggested a mono-
theism. Isolated phratries living in groups like the prehistoric pueblos
recognized no supreme political chief; their system was feudal; they were
too low for monotheism. I believe there isno good evidence to provethat
they ever advanced higher in the evolution of mythology than a form of
totemism, in which powers of nature under anthropomorphic or animal
disguises were worshiped.

I have said that the ritual of man can not be separated from his
beliefs; it is incomprehensible alone. Let us, therefore, glance at the
mythology of the Tusayan Indians. These people: had never, when
unmodified by European influences, advanced higher than the worship
of anthropomorphic powers of nature, although all lower forms of wor-
ship, as of animals, ancestors, and fetishism, were prevalent. —As far as
I have studied the beliefs of the Tusayan Indians, I find no evidence
that they recognized monotheism or the existence of a Great Spirit, —
creator of all things. With them as elsewhere among American Indians
whenever we find a knowledge of a Great Spirit we see, as pointed out
by Mr. R. Dorman,! “Nothing more than a figure of European origin
reflected and transformed almost beyond recognition in the mirror of
the Indian mind.” It is suggestive that the Indian knows only the
name, he has no stories pertaining to him, but when you inquire about
creation you elicit myths of the works of a spider woman or the birth
of men from the caverns of the earth. A conception of a Great Spirit,
wherever reported from savage people of North America, is the work
of missionaries, soldiers, or traders.”

All cosmogony begins with a created earth and that earth is mother
of gods and men. From the under world, a cavern in the earth, men
crawled to the surface through an opening called the sipapt. Races,
like individuals, grew or were born; there is no hint as to how mother
earth was created.

~The highest supernatural beings were deified forces of nature endowed
with human or animal forms. Among these were sky gods, earth gods,
and their offspring in the early times when the race of man was young:
The pueblos deified the sun and called him father of all, and so impor-
tant is the place that he plays in their beliefs that they are ordinarily
called sun worshipers. They endow him with human form, speaking
of the disk as his mask. Hach day he is thought to rise from his home
in the under world and at night sinks into a western house. The pueblo
Indians livein houses. Their chiefsupernatural has a house, as indicated
by their use of this word for his place of rising and setting. The sun is
a benificent being all powerful to bring the rains. In other parts of
America among warriors he is appealed to to destroy enemies. Among
those people whose environment necessitates rain he is regarded as all
powerful for that purpose. Like ancient Aryans, the Tusayan Indians
pray to the rising sun for blessings, but the meaning of the word ‘bless-
ing” is always rain, that the farms may be watered and the crops grow
to maturity. The worship of the sun, therefore, is of great importance;
it pervades all the ritual, but it is always with one intent—the over-
powering need of the agriculturist for rain in a desert environment.

As I have used the word “prayer,” it may be well for me to point out
the signification of this word among these people. We are dealing
with a race in that stage of culture where the symbolism is all-impor-
tant. Their word for prayer is, ‘‘scatter,” that is, to scatter sacred meal.
When a Tusayan priest addresses a supernatural being of his mythology
he believes he must do so through the medium of some object as a
prayer bearer; he breathes his wish on meal and throws this meal to
the god. The prayer bearer is thought to have a spiritual double or
breath body which carries his wishes. It is an old idea with him,
reaching back to fetishism, for his breath with the talismanic words is the
spell which brings the desired results. It must be mentioned, however,
that oftentimes ethical ideas are associated with Tusayan prayers for
rain, and I have frequently heard the priests at the close of their songs

monotheistic stage of supernatural concepts, and if that evidence is unimpeachable
it would not be improbable that traces of the same should be found among pueblos.
Unfortunately, however, the evidences on this point are none too strong, the prob-

abilities that the writers and the documents did not eliminate their own interpreta-

tion too great. The pueblos at present have an idea of a supreme spirit, but there
is every reason to believe it is of exotic derivation in the time since Coronado.
However honest may be the modern priest who may say that he learned from his
grandfather certain current beliefs, the crucial test of their prehistoric character
must come from proof that the grandfather’s testimony is correct. The sources of
error in stories passed down by word of mouth through many generations are too
many to permit us to pin much faith to traditions reputed to be of great age.

for rain exclaim, ‘‘ Whose heart is bad, whose thoughts are leaving the
straight path,” and as they bewailed that the rains were delayed,
sorrowfully resumed their songs and incantations.

An individual intrusts his prayer to sacred meal, but a society of
priests has a more powerful charm. In the formal worship by a
society of priests this prayer bearer becomes more complicated by
appendages. It is furnished with accessories, all of which are symbolic.
The meal is placed in a corn-husk packet surrounded with symbolic
charms, feathers of birds which love water, herbs which grow in damp
places. Such a prayer bearer with symbolic attachments is called a
paho, and as if to betray its meaning in its name, the exact translation
of this word is the water-wood, the wood which brings the water.
These prayer sticks have many different forms, but are always called
by the generic name, water-sticks. As their form becomes complicated
by reason of symbolic accessories, their manufacture is an act which
takes time, and as the prescribed symbols are known only to the initi-
ated, their construction gives rise to a complex series of secret rites.
The paho itself is a sacred object, consequently whitilings from it,
fragments of string, corn husks, or feathers, used in its construction,
are also sacred and must not be profaned. They are, therefore, care-
fully gathered up and deposited with a prayer in some sacred place.

The simple act of breathing ‘a prayer on a pinch of meal is all suffi-
cient in an individual’s use of prayer meal, but in the complicated
paho this simple act is insufficient in their belief. The prayer bearer
intrusted with the prayers of a community of priests must be laid on
an altar, smoked upon, prayed over, and consecrated by song before it
is deemed efficacious. The production of this altar, the fetishes which
stand upon it, the formal rites attending the ceremonial smoke, and
the character of the songs thus develop each its own complex series
of rites. Lastly, even the casting of the meal has led to complica-
tions. The paho must be offered to the god addressed in a dignified
manner worthy of its object and the care used in its consecration. A
Special courier carries it to a special shrine. He is commissioned to
his task with formal words, and he places his burden in the shrine
with prescribed prayers. It has thus been brought about that the
manufacture, consecration, and final deposition of the elaborate paho
or stick to bring the rain occupies several hours, and when repeated,
as it is in all great ceremonies for several consecutive days, makes a
complicated series of rites.

The ritual of the Tusayan Indians is composite as their blood kin-
Ship. Peoples from other parts of the arid region have joined the
original nucleus, each bringing its rites and its names of the sun god.
Each of these components clung to their own ceremonials, and thus
several series of rites developed side by side, adding new names to
supernatural beings already worshiped. This state of things is not
peculiar to Tusayan. Ra, the Egyptian sun god, has not more aliases
than Tawa, the solar deity of the Mokis. So receptive is the Pueblo

system in point of fact that they are quite willing to ingraft the Chris-
tian ritual on their own, and in some of the modified pueblos of the
Rio Grande we find the two coexisting. The sun especially has many
names among these people, attributal or incorporated, derived from
colonists among them. While it oftentimes puzzles the student to
identifiy them, it causes no trouble to the primitive mind, who gladly
accepts the medicine of all people, friends or enemies. Of synonyms
of the sun, one of the most potent is called the Heart of the Sky.

In the mythology of the American Indians the worship of a mythic
serpent is widely associated with that of thesun. Among the Pueblos
this serpent appears as the Great Plumed Snake. This personage was
a marked one in the Mexican and Central American mythologies. He
is found carved in stone on the stately ruins of Chiapas and Yucatan,
painted in fresco on the necropolis of Mitla, and represented in stucco
on the fagades of other high temples of Mexico. As the most powerful
of all the divinities of the Nahuatl and Aztec peoples, he has crept into
all the mythologies where traces of Nahuatl words can be detected.
In Tusayan the Great Plumed Serpent is a powerful deity to bring the
rain, and is associated with lightning, his symbol. By simple observa-
tion the untutored mind recognizes that rain follows lightning, and
what more natural than that it should be looked upon as the effect.
He therefore worships lightning because of this power. The course of
the lightning in the sky is zigzag as that of the snake, both kill when
they strike. The lightning comes from the sky, the abode of the sun
and rain god, and the simple reasoning of the Tusayan Indian supposes
Some connection between the lightning, snake, and rain. The suste-
nance of the primitive agriculturist comes from the earth, and if the
soil is nonproductive the sun and rain are of no avail. The Tusayan
Indian thus recognizes the potency,of the earth and symbolically deifies
it as the mother. Consequently earth goddesses play important roles
in his mythology, and here likewise the composition of the tribe shows
itself in the many names by which the earth mother is designated.
We find her called ‘Mother of Germs,” “Old Woman,” ‘Spider
Woman,” “ Corn Maid,” “Growth Goddess.” Strangely enough to us,
but by no means strange to a primitive mind, this latter is associated
with fire; for in the Indian conception fire itself is a living being, and
what is more natural than association of fire and growth?

Before we pass to a consideration of the lesser gods of Tusayan
there remains to be considered, among those of primary importance,
a strange collection of concepts, the direct outgrowth of sun worship.
refer to what are known as the gods of the world quarters or cardinal
directions.

The constant observation of the sun has led to an intimate study of
the position of this luminary in different seasons, especially in his vari-
ation in places of rising and setting. As is well known, the sun, on
account of the obliquity of the ecliptic, rises and sets at different
points on the horizon at different dates, varying with latitude, between
692 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

certain distances north and south. The intervals on the horizon
between extreme northern and southern azimuth is mapped out by a
society of sun priests, who note the tree, hillock, or depression in the
horizon from which the sun rises or into which he seems to sink at
each interval, and thus determine the time for ceremonials with sur-
prising accuracy year by year. The solstitial points of the sun on the
horizon thus came to be cardinal points, two of which are called sun
houses. !

As the four solstices are marked epochs in the sun worship of an
agricultural people, the points of rising and setting at these times, or
their cardinal points, are associated with minor deities, offspring of sun
and earth. These are the positions of the sun houses. Naturally, his
children live in these four world quarters, and from that primitive idea
is evolved the worship of the so-called world-quarter deities which
play such a prominent part in the Tusayan ritual.

Ancestor worship has developed into an elaborate system of minor
supernaturals called Katcinas, most powerful, in their conception, to
bring blessings, another name in their vocabulary for rain. It would
be instructive to trace the origin and define the character of these
beings if time permitted. Their name is legion, their ceremonials
complicated.

In addition to the deification of the forces of nature, totems of ani-
mals, and ancestral personages, Tusayan supernal concepts are almost
infinite in variety and number, many of which are simply modified
fetishes, the heritage of archaic conditions. “To define the character of
a tithe of these concepts would be a task too technical for general discus-
sion. Among a people where gods are so numerous, every hostile one
must be appeased, no beneficent personage forgotten. From one end of
‘the year to another there is almost a constant round of ceremonials, to
describe which in detail would tax your patience.

Fortunately, however, these ceremonials admit of a classification. In
one way we may say that the ritual of a people is the sum of all cere-
monials which recur with precision in successive cycles. The time
commonly adopted by primitive people is a natural epoch, the year
determined by the course of the seasons.

Minor divisions of this year, or months, are characterized each by
a special ceremonial, so that roughly speaking we may say that each
ceremonial year at Tusayan is composed of thirteen great ceremonial
events, one for each lunar revolution.

In the most elaborate of these monthly ceremonials occur rites last-
ing sixteen days, with four additional days for purifications. In the
celebration of many the time is curtailed, but no moon shines over

‘The horizontal positions of the sun at the solstices were probably recognized as
cardinal by other peoples of agricultural life. The reader who is interested to fol-
low this subject further is referred to various works on the orientation of Egyptian
temples.

Tusayan without witnessing a religious festival of great complexity
and prescribed precision, which is repeated every year at the same time.!

From this complicated series I will choose two great ceremonials to
illustrate the two most important phases of the influence of aridity.
These two occur in consecutive months, August and September, are
both celebrated in extenso, and will for that reason give a fair idea of
the nature of the elaborate components. Both are characteristic of

-Tusayan, although represented in a somewhat modified form in other

pueblos.

The first is called the Snake Dance, the second the Lalakonti. The
one is performed by male priests, the other by female; the former an
elaborate prayer for rain, the latter for growth and an abundant har-
vest of maize. Both in their respective way illustrate the modifica-
tions developed by the climatic conditions. So complicated are they,
however, that I must limit myself to the barest sketch of some of their
more striking features.

No better ceremony could be chosen to illustrate the effect of the
arid cnvironment than the well-known Snake Dance, the most weird
rite in the Tusayan calendar. This dance occurs every summer on
alternate years in five of the Tusayan villages, and although a dramati-
zation of an elaborate sun-serpent myth is so permeated by rain cere-
monials that it has come to be an elaborate prayer for rain.

The worship of the serpent occupies a most prominent place in the
ritual of all barbarous people where each environment has stamped it
with special significance. . Among the Tusayan Indians there are most
complicated rites of ophiolatry, in March,’ where six effigies of the
Great Plumed-headed Snake are exhibited in the secret rooms in con-
nection with symbols of the sun, in a strange dramatization. ‘These
ceremonials, however, have to do with the fertilization of maize and
might well be chosen to illustrate rites which pertain to the necessities
of agricultural people.

It is to that ceremony’ where reptiles are carried fearlessly by the

’For an account of the Snake Dance at Walpi, see Journal of American Ethnology
and Archeology, Vol. IV; Houghton, Mifflin & Co., Boston. I have elsewhere
pointed out the small part which the Great Plumed Serpent plays in this ceremony,
and the absence of fetishes or idols of this personage in the secret portions of the
ceremony. The only symbol of the plumed snake which is found is on the kilts of
the snake priest. As nearly as I can judge of its place in the components of primi-
tive supernatural concepts, it seems to be an example of animal totemism and
ancestor worship in which special powers to bring the rains are believed to belong
to the reptiles, descendants, like the living participants, of 1 snake mother. The
conditions are so often paralleled in the beliefs of other primitive people that there
seems to be no exception among the Hopi. Cf. King, op. cit., Vol. I, pages 165-207.

snake priests, their younger brothers, as they believe, to which I
especially refer, and to which I wish to call your attention. It is
impossible for me in the limited time at my disposal to give even a
sketch of this complicated rite, so weird and startling in its character
as to rival the most heathen ceremony in the wilds of Africa. Yet this
uneanny dance in all human probability will be performed in August
of the present year in our own country in a Territory which justly
aspires to be a State. The participants in it by treaty obligations are
citizens of the United States and their children pupils of the public
schools.

There is little doubt, however, that this survival of aboriginal cere-
monials will soon become extinet, although up to the present time it has
been but little modified by the new environment which the white men
are bringing to the Tusayan Indians. The ceremony is not a hap-
hazard or temporary invention of priests to entertain, but a part of a
Serious, precise ritual which has survived from prehistoric times to our
day. Fifteen years ago the existence of this dance was practically
unknown, and to-day, after searching study, comparatively little has
been discovered. It may be wholly abandoned betore the scientific
man is able to collect material enough to make out what it all means.

In order to consider some of the elements of rain-making rites in the
Snake Dance and accompanying secret ceremonials, let us first turn to
the altars used in this dramatization. The celebration of this uncanny
rite is performed by two religious societies or brotherhoods, whieh are
known as the Antelope and Snake priests. The secret ceremonials of
each of these priesthoods are very complicated and are performed in
subterranean rooms called kivas into which uninitiated are debarred
entrance. Hach of these societies has in its own kiva an altar of com-
plicated nature about which the ceremonials of a secret character are
performed.

The altar of the Antelope priests is of especial interest to us in con-
sidering the rain-making motives of the ritual. It consists of an elab-
orate mosaic or picture made of six different colored sands spread on
the floor and surrounded by a border of the same material.

The picture represents sixteen, semicircular figures of four different
colors, the symbols of rain clouds of the four cardinal directions. From
one side of this composite picture are drawn parallel lines representing
falling rain. This sand picture, with accompanying fetishes, is known
as the rain-cloud altar, the home of the rain clouds.

Seated about this altar for seven consecutive days the Antelope
priests daily sing sixteen songs to consecrate prayer sticks, which are
later deposited in shrines to the rain gods. These prayer bearers con-
sist of two sticks painted green and tied together midway in their
length. At the point where they are bound is fastened a small packet
of sacred meal, while to the same is also bound a feather of the wild
turkey. This feather is aptly chosen, for the turkey is associated in

their mythology with a time or place when the surface of the earth
was muddy, and as they say the black tip of the feather was colored
by the turkey dragging his tail in the black mud. To this prayer
bearer is likewise attached two herbs—one male, the other female—
plants which love the water. There are many other prescribed details
in the manufacture of this prayer stick with which I will not weary
you, but there is one point which may be of interest. The prayer
bearers or prayer sticks of the first day are made as long as the longest
finger of the left hand, and are carried to four shrines of the cardinal
points, each of which is about 7 miles from the pueblo. The length of
these prayer sticks diminish each day, and in the same ratio the dis-
tance of the shrines decreases. On the last of the seven days the
prayer stick is the length of the ultimate joint of the middle finger, and
the shrines in which they are placed are just outside the town. The
intent of the prayers and songs intrusted to these prayer sticks is for
rain. The courier who carries them each day is an important priest,
and his explanation of why he proceeds in certain ways in his duty may
interest you.

He runs swiftly through the whole circuit except when kneeling at
the shrines, and is barefooted and naked, that the rain gods may notice
him and respond with equal haste to the prayers which he bears. He
loosens his hair and lets it hang down his back, symbolic of the way in
which he believes the rain gods carry the falling rain which his hair
symbolizes. He makes the far circuit on the first day because rain gods
dwell far away beyond all cultivated fields. He runs in a circle that
all the rain gods may see him. The priests hope the rain deities may
notice their courier who bears their offerings to the shrines, and that
each day they may come nearer. Hence, on each succeeding day the
courier travels on a shorter circumference. It is thus they wish the
rain clouds to approach nearer and nearer and pour down their con-
tents on their houses and fields, that the dry river beds may be swollen
with water and all farmers hear the pattering rain.

Consider one of the many episodes about the altar in the consecration
of the prayer offering. Smoking,as is well known, was in Precolumbian
times a ceremonial custom among the aborigines of the Southwest,
and in the ritual of the present pueblos every great rite opens and
closes with a formal smoke. The pipe lighter is an important function-
ary, next in rank to the chief, and in passing the pipe certain prescribed
usages are always followed and terms of relationship exchanged. The
sixteen songs of which I have spoken are divided into two groups of
eight each by a unique observance—the smoking of the great cloud pipe.
In this ceremony four different kinds of herbs are loaded into a conical
pipe, and at a signal the pipe lighter passes a live coal to the chief,
who places it in the larger end, kneels down behind the altar, places
the larger end of the bowl in his mouth and blows four long whiffs
through the pipe upon the sand picture of the altar. The smoke thus

formed is called the rain cloud, which it symbolizes, and the act a prayer -
to bring the rain.

Let us consider the final public event of the Snake Dance, that so
often described, when the snake priests handle venomous reptiles,
apparently without fear, in the presence of spectators. This uncanny
proceeding has the same intent as the secret rites of which we have
spoken—a ceremony for rain. The reptiles are believed to be elder
brothers of the priests, and they are gathered from the fields on four
successive days to participate in the ceremonies. It is believed that
these reptiles have more power to influence supernatural beings than
man, and as the acme of the whole series of nine days’ observances
they are thrown in a heap on the ground in a circle of sacred meals,
and the chief of the antelopes says a prayer to the struggling mass,
after which they are seized by the priests and carried to the fields
commissioned to intercede with rain gods to send the desired rains.
In fact, the whole series of rites which make up the snake celebration
is one long prayer of nine days’ duration, filled with startling compo-
nents the details of which would weary rather than instruct you.

Let us, therefore, turn to another component of the Tusayan ritual
which occurs each year in the month following that in which the Snake
Dance occurs, the ceremony of the women priests for the maturation of
the corn. I refer to the September rites called the Lalakonti, cele-
brated by a priesthood of the same name.

The ceremony for growth of the crops, which is practically for the
harvest of maize, is directly the outgrowth of those climatic conditions
which have made the Tusayan people agriculturists. <A failure of this
crop means starvation, and maize is far from a spontaneous growth in
those desert sands. Hence the elaborate nature of the appeals to the
supernatural beings which control this function. This great ceremony
is naturally of special concern to women, the providers. The corn is
the mother, the corn goddess the patron deity of women; the women
are chiefs in this their special ceremonial. In turning over the mass
of details which have been recorded concerning the festival of the
Lalakonti it has seemed to me that I could not better illustrate the
points which IL especially desire to develop than to explain the altar
used by these women priests in this ceremony.

The altar! is erected in a subterranean secret chamber entered by
a ladder through the middle of the roof; and around this altar are per-
formed many rites the intent of which is an appeal to the gods of
growth for abundant harvests.

There are two upright slats, painted with symbolic designs, among
which the figures of the rain cloud and falling rain and the lightning
which accompanies the rainstorm are most prominent. Back of the
altar are sticks serving as Syme of ihe lightning, the zigzag ones

representing the forked and the straight the sheet lightning. Two
coronets, one on each side of the alter, are worn by two of the chiefs
and they are made in the form of rain cloud symbois, semicircles from
which parallel lines representing falling rain are drawn. Here, there-
fore, we see several rain symbols in prominent places. But the cere-
mony in which this altar is used is primarily one for the growth of corn;
let us examine the objects in it with that thought in mind.

Four effigies or idols between the uprights of the reredos represent
the following personages: The one to the right is the goddess of
growth. She carries in her belt prayer offerings for abundant harvests.
At her feet is an effigy of the corn mountain, colored with different
colored corn, since all kinds of corn are under her control. In her left
hand she has a small jar of holy water, since corn can not grow with-
out moisture. The figure at her leftis the patron goddess of the society
who celebrate growth ceremonials, the ancestral deified totem of the
fraternity. At her left is the corn goddess, since corn is the one cereal
whose growth is desired. This figurine bears on her head the symbol
of the ear of maize. No tield of corn may be harvested without the
protection of the warrior in a country harassed by enemies, and the
fourth effigy represents the god of war, whose effigy naturally has a
place on this altar. The white meal which is sprinkled on the heads
of all the idols represents the prayers of the faithful, for as each priest
approaches the altar she breathes her prayer on sacred meal and _ scat-
ters it on the heads of the effigies. These prayers are for a good
harvest, a successful crop and abundant rains.

There are three objects in front of the images which are the badges
of the priests, called the “mothers.” In advance of these, spread on
the floor, is an elaborate picture, made of different colored sands,
representing on one side the Harth Goddess, and on the other the
Watcher, or little War God. Connected with the altar is a bowl with
terraced rim, used as a medicine bowl, and a single upright ear of maize
with a feather, a kind of standard, which is placed at the pathway
of the kiva to warn uninitiated persons not to intrude on the mys-
teries which are performed about the altar.

The influence of arid climatic conditions is shown in the character
and intent of symbols. The conventional figure of the rain clouds
and falling rain is depicted more than any other on various parapher-
nalia of worship. It is painted on the altars, drawn in sacred meal on
the floor of his sacred rooms, or kivas, embroidered on ceremonial kilts.
The priest wears it on his marks and paints it on the body. It is an
omnipresent symbol.

By a natural connection it is often replaced by figures of animals or
plants associated with water. The frog and tadpole appear when the
rain is abundant, and for that reason the priest paints the figures of
these animals on his medicine bow], or places effigies of it on the altar.
In certain rites he makes clay balls, in which he inserts small twigs,
698 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

which he believes will change into tadpoles, and deposits them along dry
water courses for the same reason, that rain may come. So shells from
the great ocean are likewise esteemed as bringers of water, and frag-
ments of water-worn wood are carefully cherished by him for a like
purpose. The dragonfly which hovers over the springs, the cotton-
wood which grows near the springs, the flag which loves the moist
places, becomes a symbol of water. Water itself from the ocean or
from some distant spring, in his conception, are all powerful agents to
bring moisture. There can be but one reason for this—the aridity of
his surroundings. Not alone in picteral symbols does he seek to bring
the needed rains. The clouds from which rain falls are symbolized by
the smoke from the pipe in his ceremony, and he so regards them. He
pours water on the heads of participants in certain ceremonials, hop-
ing that in the same way rain will fall on his parched fields. Even in
his games he is influenced by the same thought, and in certain races
the young men run along the arroyos, as they wish the water to go
filled to their banks.

To our ways of thinking these are absurd ways in which to bring
the rain, but to a primitive mind it is a method consecrated by tradi-
tion and venerated from its antiquity.

Symbolic figures of maize, the national food of the Hopi Indians, are
no less common on ceremonial paraphernalia than those of rain. Maize
is painted on the masks of sacred dancers and represented by effigies on
altars. It gives names to several supernatural beings. Every babe,
when 20 days old, is dedicated to the sun and receives an ear of corn
as its symbolic mother. The badges or palladia of religious societies
are ears of corn wrapped in buckskin—symbolic, no doubt, of the time
when seed corn was the most precious heritage and preserved by the
chiefs. The foremost supernatural being in the Tusayan Olympus is
the Corn Maid, who is figured on food bowls, baskets, and elsewhere.

It can hardly be necessary for me to adduce more facts in support
of the hypothesis that these two elements of the Tusayan ritual which
reflect the climatic surroundings are ceremonials for rain and those for
the germination, maturation, and abundance of agricultural products.
The necessities of life have driven man into the agricultural condition,
and the aridity of the climate has forced him to devise all possible
means at his control to so influence his gods as to force them to send
the rains to aid him. Wherever we turn in an intimate study of the
ceremonials of the Tusayan Indians we see the imprint of the arid
deserts by which they are surrounded, always the prayer for abundant
crops, and rains for his parched fields.

When one makes the Tusayan ritual a special study he finds it won-
derfully complicated in the development of details. No Hopi priest
lives who understands the meaning of all these details, nor does he
care for an explanation of them. There are two fundamental factors,
however, which he can comprehend, and these are always on his lips
when an explanation of the ritual is solicited. We cling to the rites of
THE TUSAYAN RITUAL. 699

our ancestors because they have been pronounced good by those who
know. We erect our altars, sing our traditional songs, and celebrate
our sacred dances for rain that our corn may germinate and vield
abundant harvest.

The town crier calls at dawn from the house top the following an-
nouncement, which is the key to the whole explanation of the Tusayan
ritual:

‘All people awake, open your eyes, arise,

Become Talahoya (child of light), vigorous, active, sprightly.

Hasten clouds from the four world quarters ;

Come snow in plenty, that water may be abundant when summer comes.

Come ice and cover the fields, that after planting they may yield abundantly;

Let all hearts be glad;

The knowing ones will assemble in four days;

They will encircle the village dancing and singing theirlays * *

That moisture may come in abundance.”

I have limited myself to showing that the arid climatic conditions
are retlected from the rites of one tribe of Indians, and it would be in-
structive to see whether these facts are of importance from the com-
parative side. There are other equally arid regions of the globe where
we might justly look for the same results if this climatic condition is
as powerful in the modification of cults as implied. There are marked
similarities in the climate of Arabia, of Peru, and of Assyria, and as a
consequence startling resemblances in their rituals. But there are
many differences; and we thus detect that our analyses of causes has
not been complete or ultimate, for we have limited it to but one powerful
element in the modifications of ceremonials.

Environment is a complicated nexus of influences, organic and inor-
ganic, threads of which we can successfully- trace a certain distance,
but which eludes as we go further. There are many effects where causes
remain to be discovered, and many climatic influences on cults have yet
to be clearly discerned.

A few words more and I have done. Theories among civilized men,
like things among savages, may become fetishes. It would be lamen-
table if environment should become a word to conjure with, or if we
should use it to cover ignorance of that which we can not explain. I
have tried to show that one highly complicated ritual is so plastic that
it responds to climatic conditions, but there are elements in it due to
some other unknown cause. Because climatic conditions explain cer-
tain modifications in human culture the tendency would be to strive to
make it do duty in explaining all. Such a generalization is premature
and unscientific. The theory that differences of species of animals and
plants were due to climatic influences may have satisfied the early stu-
dents of evolution before Charles Darwin pointed out the law of natural
selection. Environment is a factor which profoundly affects animals,
but a struggle for existence in which the fittest survive is a law of
evolution.
700 THE TUSAYAN RITUAL.

So environment is a potent influence on the culture of man, but there
are laws, as yet not clearly made out, back of it which control the
evolution of man.

When in the struggle for existence the fittest came to be measured by
degrees of intelligence, and no longer by superiority of bodily structure,
climatic conditions were still powerful to modify and stimulate thought.
The increase in intelligence due to these agents did not develop a
new species, for, to whatever heights he rises, man still remains Homo
sapiens. If, then, the specific identity of all individual men on the
globe to-day is true, the superstitions which we have studied are errors
of minds like our own, but imperfectly developed and modified by
environment. In her mistakes, said the great naturalist Geoffroy St.
Hilaire, nature betrays her secrets. By a study of erroneous working
of the mind and their probable causes we can discover the nature of
mind. Below all ceremonials among all men, savage or barbarous, may
be traced aspirations akin to our own since they spring from our com-
mon nature. Until some philosopher shall arise who can so analyze
environment as to demonstrate that the great religious teachers of man,
who, suddenly appearing, have stimulated the race to great bounds in
progress, were solely the products of surroundings, we may believe
that there is another most potent influence behind environment control-
ling the development of culture. Throughout all history man, from his
own consciousness, has recognized that controlling influence to be higher
than environment, and no science nor philosophy has yet succeeded in
banishing the thought from his mind.

THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.

By W J McGue.!

THE RELATIONS OF ORGANISMS.”

The career of the organism, as individual species or larger group,
may be considered as the resultant of two forces, viz, (1) the initial or
directing force operating through heredity, and (2) the secondary or
modifying force operating through interaction with environment.

The potency of environment in shaping the career of the organism is
illustrated by the forest. Primarily the plant depends for existence on
soil and climate, and vitality fails if these conditions are adverse; when
soil and climate are measurably favorable the fitter plants strive for
supremacy and some tower above their competitors. Commonly the
trees bear multitudes of seeds, that the species may survive even
though many seeds fall on stony ground and many young shoots may
choke among brambles; the cypress, pine, and other trees combine to
form dense and lofty mantles of foliage beneath which alien plants are
smothered; and through these and other means forests are produced.
Initially the tree strives against alien species, but when its kind comes
to prevail the trees strive against one another and the strongest, lofti-
est, and hardiest survive; and thus internecine strife as well as strife
against the alien makes for excellence among trees. So the forest is
shaped by environment, beginning with external conditions and ending
with the mutual relation between individuals; and the career of the
forest tree is one of ceaseless struggle, chiefly against other plants,
both akin and alien, through which all its features are molded.

The potency of environment in shaping organisms is still more
clearly shown in desert lands. Here the strife for existence is chiefly
between the organism on the one hand and the physical conditions of
climate and soil on the other; here the plants strive to perpetuate
their kind by individual longevity rather than by multiplication of off-
spring, so that with most species seeds are are reduced in number,
while with some species fruiting becomes a disease, perhaps fatal; here

702 THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.

adaptive devices for checking evaporation and storing water, for pro-
tecting the plants from heat and cold, and for arming them against
animal enemies, as well as for utilizing the energy of light, are developed;
here all plants interact with the inorganic external in such manner
that even unrelated species assume likeness in form and feature. In
desert lands the strife for existence is not between plant and plant,
whether akin or alien, so much as against sun and sand; and most of
the organisms engaged in this common strife are forced thereby into a
cooperation in which each benefits the other and in which finally all are
united in a great solidarity of singular perfection. So the organisms of
desert lands, especially the plants, are modified by environment in the
direction of likeness in external characters, and in other ways, and are
forced into a cooperative union transcending specific and even generic
kinship; and thereby the flora is in large measure transformed, and the
potency of heredity is masked through the adjustment of the organisms
to environment, while vegetal clanship is exalted into plant sociology.

In humid and in arid lands alike heredity and environmental inter-
action are commonly antagonistic, and in this antagonism the strife for
existence arises; but now and then, in the course of the development
of organic forms, it chances that an organism enters an environment
to which it is so peculiarly adapted that the struggle for existence is
made easy through the conjunction of heredity with external relation,
and in such instances the potency of vitality is strikingly shown. Such
a case was that of the American buffalo which, about the time of transi-
tion of geologic modernity into historic antiquity, began to spread over
the grass-covered plains of the mid-continent; so well adapted was his
environment to his needs that his kind increased and multiplied a
hundred fold; his rise was so rapid that he far outstripped enemies
and. expended his redundant energy in covering the hills and valleys
with thousand-weights of moving flesh; but through generations of
peace and sloth his vigor waned, his constitution weakened, and he fell
an easy prey to the red man, and when the white man came he melted
away helplessly. Commonly such spurts of vitality as that exemplified
in the history of the buffalo result from human interference with the
natural interaction of organisms. The European rabbit, when intro-
duced in Australia, escaped the enemies and inimical factors of envi-
roument which had grown up with the species in the original habitat,
and soon increased beyond anticipation, almost beyond belief; the
western American rabbit found his environment changed by the intro.
duction of fields and stock, and increased enormously; the English
sparrow, the common daisy of Britain, a roadside plant of Mexico, and
many other organisms introduced in the United States artificially have
profited by freedom from natural enemies and have multiplied into pests,
So,in many parts of the world, and at various times in the history of
the development of organisms, the redundance of vitality, when relieved
from the pressure of adverse conditions, has been exemplified; and it
bs

THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT. 703

is under these favorable conditions that the potency of heredity is most
conspicuous, since the organisms are not fain, as elsewhere and other-
time, to expend energy in shaping themselves to their surroundings.

The fertility of organisms in adaptive devices whereby they are fitted
to adverse conditions of environment, shown clearly in the desert flora,
is illustrated still more strikingly by certain insects. The walking
sticks, the flying leaves, and a variety of creeping and leaping and
winging insects adjust form and color to the vegetation on which they
habitually rest so closely as to deceive enemies; stingless flies mimic
the appearance and habits of stinging wasps and odorless insects
counterfeit odoriferous bugs that they may escape molestation; and in
many other ways insect species modify themselves for their own benefit
under adverse conditions. The unrelated desert plants grow alike
toward thorniness, waxiness, leaflessness, etc., to meet common needs,
and thereby hereditary features are masked; but in insect mimicry the
impress of heredity is lost and characters produced through direct
interaction with environment replace legitimate features expressing
biotic relation. Thereby the exceeding plasticity of the organism is
displayed—a plasticity so perfect as almost to suggest that the initial
force operating through heredity is as nothing, and that environmental
interaction is as everything, in shaping the course of the vital stream.

The forest, the scant flora of the desert, the redundant vitality of
species chancing to outstrip competitors, insect mimicry, all illustrate
the potency of environment in determining the career of organisms
considered as units, and indicate that primary characters are largely
or perhaps wholly subordinate to derived organic characters produced
by interaction with the external; and even when the organism is viewed
as an aggregation of organs the same lesson may be read. The fune-
tionless splint bones of the horse are vestiges of digits which were useful
organs in equine ancestors, aS shown by the joint evidence of paleon
tology, embryology, and reversion; the functionless and troublesome
vermiform appendix is shown by Lueas to be a vestige of a supplemental
stomach useful to an herbivorous progenitor, but useless through sev-
eral later stages of development; the feeble vestigial muscle by which
one man in a thousand, and one infant in a hundred, is able to move
his ear is an all but functionless organ, weakened and nearly lost
through disuse; and the dozen or more vestigial structures known in
man and the scores known in other organisms are but moribund war-
riors in the strife for existence, thrown out of rank and trampled over
because of unfitness for battle against the great external—they may
boast long lineage and noble station in the earlier stages of organic
development, yet their past counts for nought in that ceaseless struggle
in which activity is life and inactivity is death. So among organs as
among organisms, many fall behind and are lost in the race for con-
tinued existence, and it is environmental relation rather than original
character that makes for perpetuity.
704 THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.

The forest of humid lands, the flora of the desert, the foeless buffalo
and rabbit and sparrow, and the mimetic insect illustrate the potency
and persistence and indeed the predominance of characters acquired
through interaction with environment, and the testimony of vestigial
organs accords with the testimony of the organisms; and thereby the
law of organic development is indicated. In general terms, this law is
that the characters of organisms are determined through interaction with
environment. It is to be observed that the law is general and that
exceptional instances are to be looked for, yet it is to be remembered
also that no indubitably exceptional instances are known. It is indeed
a legitimate and desirable postulate that there is an inherent and per-
sistent force in vitality, a force expressed in heredity and transcending ©
environmental interaction; the postulate is legitimate since this com-
ponent of vitality is represented in the life of each individual organism
and in many of the characters of speciess genera, and other groups of
organisms; the postulate is desirable since it yields a sort of datum-
plane from which the amount and kind of adaptive modification may
be measured; yet it must not be forgotten that, as applied to the great
aggregate of living things on the earth, the postulate is a postulate
merely; and the law of organic development, individual, specific, and
general, is that the characters of organisms are ultimately shaped by
interaction with environment.

When the law of biotic development is extended to mankind, it
appears to fail; for the men of desert and shoreland, mountain and
plain, arctic and tropic, are ceaselessly occupied in strife against envi-
ronmental conditions which transform their subhuman associates, and
yet men remain essentially unchanged—some taller, some stouter, some
swifter of foot, some longer of life than others, yet all essentially Homo
sapiens in every characteristic. More careful examination indicates
that the failure of the law, when extended to mankind, is apparent
only. The desert nomads retain common physical characteristics, but
develop arts of obtaining water and food, and these arts are adjusted to
the local environment; dwellers alongshore do not suffer modification
in bodily form, but their arts are modilied and they become fishermen
and sailors; the mountaineers do not acquire the physical characters
of the subhuman animals of the mountains, but learn to use weapons
and to protect themselves from bodily injury by artificial devices; the
plainsmen remain human in body and limb, but learn to hunt and, bor-
rowing knowledge from the desert, to herd lower animals; the men of
the arctic do not emulate their fur-bearing and blubber-making associ-
ates, but adjust themselves to environment and begin the conquest of
the earth through the making of clothes and the building of houses;
and the dwellers beneath the equatorial sun hold to the human form, yet
invent multifarious devices for overcoming hard environment through
the aid of mind. Thus development, differentiation, transformation,
are no less characteristic of the human genus than of lower organisms—
THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT. 705

indeed, it is in this noblest of organisms that plasticity or adjustability
to diverse conditions culminates—but the differentiation is intellectual
rather than physical, cerebral rather than corporeal. Men were dif-
ferentiated initially through arts of welfare by which they began
transforming environment to their needs; later, arts of pleasure were
developed out of the richness of a higher life, and for the first time in
the history of living things smiles and laughter came to be on the
earth; and as mind grew through exercise, arts increased and multiplied.

So human development differs in divers ways from the development
of lower organisms. In the first place, it is fundamentally intellectual;
in the second place, it is collective rather than individual; and in the
_third place, it tends directly, at first through convenience and later
through design, toward the modification of environment and the con-
quest of the earth for human weal. Yet the law of modification
remains essentially unchanged, for mental characters, like physical,
are Shaped by interaction with environment.

Since human development arises in arts, which are essentially collec-
tive, the career of the individual is in large measure subordinate to the
career of the group; and since the parts of the group are interrelated,
while groups are related among each other, the essential unit is the
organization rather than the organism. The primitive organization is
feeble and indefinite, perhaps to such an extent as hardly to distin-
guish man from lower animals; but as arts increase, and as internal and
external relations multiply, the organizations grow definite and laws
are gradually developed, and institutions, the last and best fruit of
intellectual development, are born. So the institution springs from
organization as organization is produced by arts, themselves the off-
spring of intellectual activity. These are the salient features of human
development through interaction with the external. While the funda-
mental features of human development are thus essentially distinct, it
is to be remembered that their germs are found in lower life. Many
insects, birds, and other subhuman things possess simple arts, many
gregarious and other animals are loosely organized, and among some
articulates and vertebrates the organization is so definite as to imply
law, none the less efficient because instinctive—indeed, just as the
ascent of the human organism may be traced through structural homol-
ogies with the lower animals, so the ascent of organizations may be
followed from a lowly beginning far down in the scale of biotic develop-
ment up to a splendid culmination in humanity and human institutions.

THE RELATIONS OF ORGANIZATIONS.

On humid and temperate lands and in shoal waters life teems, and
the bitterest strife is between organism and organism. In the sun-
parched and snow-mantled deserts of the land surface and in the chill
deserts of the abysmal waters life scrimps, and the strife is between
organism and inorganic environment. Thus there is a law of strife for
the feeund district and another law for the desert.

SM 95——-45
706 THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.

Manifold results flow from the strife of the desert. Since only a few
organisms can be maintained, each strives to perpetuate its kind, not
by multiplying progeny as amid softer surroundings, but by prolong-
ing the life of the individual and economizing in reproductive energy.
Thus plants and animals live long and leave scant offspring. Since
the organisms are few, species can be perpetuated only through indi-
vidual vigor, and each strives for this and other qualities of individu-
ality, so that the plants and animals are strong and hardy. Since the
organisms are molded by interaction with the same physical agencies,
they grow toward likeness in form and function to the extent that
unrelated organisms assume similar characters. Finally, since the
organisms are engaged in common Strife, they spontaneously fall into
a cooperation through which each assists alien neighbors in such
manner that all are united against the common enemies of sun and
sand.

There are many grades of cooperation depending on the number of
species engaged therein. The shrub shelters the field mouse {rom the
sun and the hawk, and the field mouse loosens and fertilizes the soil
about the roots of the shrub, and the two dwell together in mutual
tolerance, without enmity or intimate union. “The insect comes to feast
on the flowers and fruit of the shrub, and incidentally to spread pollen
and to: be devoured by the mouse, and thus plant and animal are linked
in more intimate union. by the mediate insect, the despoiler of one and
the prey of the other, yet the benefactor of both. ‘Then the grass
springs about the burrows in the shelter of the shrub, and incidentally
retains the scant moisture; the herbivore arises to consume the grass,
but incidentally to spread the seeds of the shrub; birds gather to
devour insects and fruits, and incidentally fertilize the soil and distrib-
ute seeds; and the carnivore comes to feast on flesh, yet incidentally to
protect the shrub and grass by decimating the herbivores; ‘and in this
way the shrub and the mouse and all the other organisms are brought
into an intimate union in which every habit, even individual enmity,
makes for the common good. Thus the cooperation among the living
things of the desert begins in tolerance and ends in solidarity—a soli-
darity so perfect and far-reaching that no organism exists beyond it,
that every organism within its bounds is directly or indirectly depend-
ent on its advantages, and that the sum of life is multiplied through
its beneficence.

There are also several kinds of cooperation depending on intimacy
of union. The shrub and the mouse and the insect are loosely linked,
and each is free to come and go and reproduce after its kind, yet they
spontaneously gather into colonies or communities to the extent that
the prevailing life of the desert iscommunal. The farmer ant fertilizes
the silver grass in an unknown way, and the grass flourishes and the
ant subsists on its seeds, so that each furnishes food for the other and
both increase and multiply apace; thus, although free to come and go
aud to reproduce each after its kind, the ant and grass are commensal,
we
=
ab

THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT. 707

and are benefited by the commensality to the extent that they sponta-
neously strive for this form of union. The yucea is fertilized by the
yucca moth so regularly and persistently that it has grown impotent,
while the moth nests in the plant for which it lives and would hardly
survive divorce therefrom beyond a single generation; this is the
cooperation of miscigenesis,' toward which many desert organisms have
been driven in the strife for existence.” Thus the cooperation begin-
ning in simple tolerance sometimes ends in bodily union—a union so
complete that the component organisms are transformed unto each
other and transfigured into an exalted unity far transcending individual
or specific quality.

There are certain stages in cooperation defined by the organic (espe-
cially neural) rank of the cooperating organisms. When the shrub and
mouse and insect unite in a community, the most highly organized
member is the most independent and measurably dominates its associ-
ates; yet the unconscious domination is feeble and the communality is
not greatly affected thereby—this may be called the stage of protocul-
ture. When the farmer ant affiliates with the silver grass, or the honey
wasp of Sonora with its nectar-bearing bush, the articulate domi-
nates and molds to its unconscious will the nerveless and moveless
plant; and though both organisms are benefited the higher profits the
more, aud is ennobled by conquest along the line leading to intellectual
dominion—this may be called the stage of eoculture. When the nomadic
ancestor of the Papago Indian long ago entered the solidarity of the
desert, he dominated the herbivore and carnivore by craft as well as
strength, and learned to scatter seed and fertilize soil by design rather
than chance and to protect fruit-bearing plants, howsoever sown, unto
the harvest; and since he strove against sun and sand with the plant and
the lower animal, he was forced into the solidarity which he only digni-
fied but dared not destroy, and entered, albeit feebly and haltingly, into
conscious control of vitality—this is the stage of simple agriculture.
As the prehistoric Papago became sedentary and began to divert and
store water, small birds sought his domicile for protection, fowls
gathered to glean his fields, and coyotes and vultures collected to scay-
enger his homestead; then, since the dove and turkey furnished eggs
and flesh and the coyote sounded a larum at the approach of enemies,
tolerance warmed to interdependence and the lower organisms passed
collectively (for such is the way of natural taming) into domestication
and later into artificialization for the behoof of mankind, yet to their
own benefit—this is the stage of zooculture, or the higher agriculture.
Thus the growth of cooperation begins with independent association

iMiscigenesis (see Winchell, ‘‘ Preadamites,” 1880, p. 80) was combined with com-
mensality in an earlier discussion of the life of the desert (‘‘The Beginning of Agri-
culture,” American Anthropologist, Vol. VIII, 1895, p. 366), but discrimination is
desirable.

and ends with interdependent association or organization—a hierarchic
association of organisms in which each has special function and all
have individual and collective profit, while all are dominated by the
big-brained organism for the good of his world, be it small or large.

As time passes, local association grows into general organization.
Each valley and hillside has a peculiar soil and water supply and
tends to bring forth peculiar plants, so that such shrubs as scorn the
charity of cooperation remain provincial.| When the plant offers
sweet perfume, or sapid fruit, or nutritious nuts to the flying insect
or wandering berbivore or migrating bird, its pollen and seed are car-
ried into other provinces and its posterity enjoy an ever-increasing
range of association; and thereby the force of life begins to overcome
local hardness and the unselfish plant becomes a prophet of good, albeit
of little honor in its own country. When a herbivore or fowl sacrifices
tithes of toothsome flesh, it tempts carnivorous enemies, yet is thereby
led from province to province and made to develop the individuality
requisite for ultimate success in the strife for existence; and when
beast or fowl communes with man, as did fleshly turkey with flesh-
eating Indian, it enters on a nobler career which may carry it to the
ends of the earth, so that its original home is lost in its general diffusion.
While the human horde hugs the native heath, it wars with all other
tribes; but as the huntsmen follow quarry into neighboring ranges
they meet enemies, when the more savage are slain and the more
peaceful survive and sometimes find favor among alien daughters, so
that the tribes are united; and in this way clans are blent and prov-
inces joined to the extent that peaceful arts arise and bind .men,
animals, and plants in far-reaching union. So it is that organization
begins with escape from provincial barriers, and extends unto cosmop-
olite association—an association in which the selfish and scrimping
are subordinate and the generous superordinate, while the humane in
mind and heart dominate over all. |

As time passes or as progress rises, organization grows into institu-
tions. The migrant bird returns to its nest and the feral beast holds
to its range and watering place, and thus property right arises, albeit
vaguely; the colony of farmer ants clears a threshing floor a thousand
ant-lengths across and cultivates a grass field thrice as great and lays
highways to neighboring farms, and thereby individual and common
property right are adjusted; the modern Papago inherits title to a spot
of ground in the permanent village and to another spot in the tempo-
rale where crops are made, as well as to a share in the spring or storm
freshet, while his water-storing ancestor must have acquired interest
in irrigation works; so that property right springs among lower organ-
isms and matures among men, growing definite through custom, the
parent of common law. Among beasts, the family is the social unit

‘The provincial character of the desert flora has been recognized by Toumey,
Coville, and others.

THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT. T09

and the sire or dam is the ruler thereof, and the young are led toward
right and held from wrong according to the lights of the ruler, and
thus social organization and ethical control arise together; in the
human genus, sapient species, and Seri family the parental group
appears to have grown into the clan in which the mother is householder,
though the doughtiest warrior or shrewdest juggler is leader and law-
giver and controls his kin by fear, largely for selfish ends, while the body
of common law changes materially with each succession in chiefship;
in the Piman family and Papago tribe, the closer blood ties are strong,
though the clan system is feeble, and the ruler is chosen for wisdom as
well as courage, and is advised by a council of wise men and aided by
subchiefs, each similarly guided by the old men of his village, and thus
the government is beneficent according to the lights of the sages, and
the body of law, albeit unwritten, is handed down from generation to
generation with little change. So property right and jurisdiction arise
among the more intelligent lower animals and spread widely among the
peaceful Papago, whose unwritten laws are like unto the written laws
of enlightened nations in beneficence of aim; and as justice blossoms
and bears fruit in beneficent custom, provinces and clans and gentes
wane and confederation waxes, and the governmental institution grows
large and clear. Thus it is that the higher stages of organization begin
with family rule and pass into civics—a series of institutions embody-
ing the justice of wisdom, the mercy of humanity, and the strength of
a union which transcends the harsh enmity of sun and sand and makes
the wilderness to blossom—institutions only a little less firmly fixed
because limned on the tablets of memory and linked through song and
story, rather than graved on brass or printed in books.

Of such are the results flowing from the strife of the desert. The
plants, animals, and men are forced into cooperation so intimate that
few live unto themselves alone, most live for the general good; then,
stimulated by the severity of the strife, cooperation begets intelligence
which dominates the desert for the common good; thenceforth intelli-
gence guides the communality, commensality, and miscigenesis from
which it springs, and produces definite organizations of the organisms
which are best for the most intelligent but good for all; and in time the
organization matures in institutions binding the humans directly but
at the same time binding the subhumans indirectly and uniting human
and subhuman in a grander unity—the unity of intelligent life in a single
nature-shaping power. The course of development is unbroken from
lowly shrub to ruler of a principality, and from simple tolerance between
shrub and mouse to beneficent law; and throughout the course from
lowly beginning to noble ending, a single mode prevails—it is not so
much the elimination of the unfit (for this is the cruel work of ruthless
nature) as the combination of the fit into superorganic groups of ever-
rising grade. So the bitter strife of the desert makes strongly for ind1i-
vidual strength, but still more strongly for altruism with its attendant
710  ##THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT.

organizations and institutions; and while it may not be denied that
organizations arise under softer skies where organism strives against
organism, it may be affirmed that the hard environment quickens the
germ of combination whose blossom is law and whose fruit is enlight-
enment.

As institutions grow and spread they are fertilized and ennobled by
contact with one another, much as languages and arts are enriched by
blending. Along storm-swept shorelands abounding in sea-food, as
about the Gulf of Mexico in olden times, primitive men gather to feast
on the fishes and mollusks. Since individuals are unable to stem the
tide and ride the storm waves without occasional or habitual aid from
their fellows, industrial and social organizations arise, and in time the
organizations mature in fixed institutions adapted first to the advan-
tage of the family group or clan and later to tribal welfare. So prolific
shorelands tend to produce populous tribes. Under the beneficent
tribal institution the group expands and displaces ill-organized tribes,
and eventually overflows into the interior; if the interior is adapted
to the chase and petty fishing, the overflow retrogrades, but if it is so
conditioned as to enforce industrial and social cooperation (as are all
desert regions), the overflow improves through new organizations blend-
ing with the old, and the institutions become more general and still
more beneficent. So shore lands abounding in aquatic life with adja-
cent desert regions seem to afford the conditions requisite for the
development of civilized institutions, and it is the testimony of history
that civilization sprung in regions so conditioned in the four great conti-
nents of the globe—Eurasia, Africa, South America, and North America.

As time passes and as institutions blend, beneficent law (which is the
framework of the institution) re-creates the altruistic motive whence it
sprang. Among hunters and petty fishermen disputes arise concern-
ing the ownership of quarry, and these are settled by the leaders in the
interest of peace and clan welfare, and thus laws are established and
motives fixed which are collective rather than individual; yet, through
habit, the motive is gradually impressed on the mind of each individual
subject to the law. Thus justice is engendered. Among shoreland
tribes disputes arise concerning labor, which is an impost on the strong
for the benefit of weak and strong alike; much of the labor is performed
beyond the reach of the leader who adjudicates disputes, so that testi-
mony must be taken in order that justice may be done, and in time
mendacity is condemned and veracity applauded; at first the blame
and praise are collective and expressed by the wise men on the tribal
behalf, yet in time individual interest leads to individual effort to
secure praise and avoid blame, and law comes to be reflected in motive.
Thus truth is engendered and justice strengthened. In the desert the
young and thoughtless occasionally famish unless the more provident
share their precious store of water, and to prevent weakening the
group the leaders prescribe hospitality and derogate meanness; at first
THE RELATION OF INSTITUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENT. 711

the rule is fixed by the judges in the collective interest, but in time the
custom comes to be followed as a motive by each normal individual of
the group. Thus mercy is engendered. In boreal lands it is needful
to lay up store against the long winter, and thereby thrift is developed
and property right is strengthened, in connection with hospitality such
as arises in the desert. At the same time life isendangered and the
group weakened through predation, and thus, in the eyes of the sages,
theft is the gravest of crimes and is severely punished. At first the
regulation is collective in the generai interest, but in time the fear of
punishment and the hope of commendation become habitual, and the
habit of uprightness grows into upright motive. Thus probity is
engendered. Other environments tend toward the development of
special provisions designed to promote welfare under the special con-
ditions. Always these laws bud as collective regulations, burgeon as
individual habits, and blossom as altruistic motives, which duly fruit
in improved laws; and thus justice, truth, mercy, and probity come up
to glorify mankind.

So organizations which find their germ among the lower organisms
attain full development only among enlightened men. At first the
organizations are local and reflect the local environment; they grow
into institutions, which in like manner reflect the surroundings of the
people by whom they are framed; through contact and commingling of
peoples the organizations are enlarged and the institutions enriched and
made more beneficent; and the institutional laws pass into motives and
become the noblest of human characters. In the beginning the organi-
zations, institutions, motives even, are of the earth earthy, and, like the
provincial flora or fauna, pertain to the tract in which they were devel-
oped; but through combination of the good and condemnation of the
bad as the organizations spread, they are exalted ever higher and
higher in the perfection of humanity. Such is the history of the past,
and such the promise for the future.
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE!

By JULES SIMon.

GENTLEMEN: When General Bonaparte took command of the Army
of Egypt, he immediately signed his proclamations and orders: ‘ Bona-
parte, General in Chief, Member of the Institute of Frence,” ‘‘ which
would be sure,” said he, ‘‘to be understood by the lowest drummer.”

The institute was then not three years old. It has since that time
made some noise in the world. I may not flatter myself, therefore, that
I can teach anyone its short and glorious history for the first time. I
Shall sum it up in a few words, in order that we may rejoice together
over its achievements, but by no means that we may learn to know them.

The great assemblies which at the end of the eighteenth century
took the fate of France into their hands had from the beginning revo-
lutionary instincts. The end they had in view was not to preserve
existing institutions by improving them and by purging them of their
abuses. They simply swept away all they found to exist, and, when
they had overthrown everything, they felt at liberty to go to work and
reconstruct it all.

The academies had aided largely in bringing on the revolution.
Hardly had they passed from theory to action when they perceived that
they were going too fast. They had wished to reform, but all around
them people thought only of destroying. The revolution, on its side,
as is the way with all revolutions, forgot what had been given to it,
and became exasperated over what was refused.

It confined itself at first to unfriendly measures. The Constituent
Assembly voted with hesitation and only provisionally, for one year,
the appropriations which the finance committee demanded for the
literary associations,? accompanying, moreover, the vote with sharp
reproaches. The convention struck some heavy blows. In the first

place, it forbade the vacant places to be filled again, and, finally, in
August, 1793, it suppressed all the academies and literary associations
established by the nation.

It has often been remarked that this very revolution which had sup-
pressed all academies, created the institute, which isan academy. This
was not inconsistent on the part of the assemblies. The idea of cre-
ating an entirely new and complete academy was contemporary with
the resolution to make an end of the old academies. The Constituent
Assembly had directed Mirabeau to submit to them a plan for a national
academy. Mirabeau called in Chamfort, who was just then engaged in
a quarrel with the French Academy; hence he wrote a violent diatribe
and prepared a plan which Mirabeau never found time to read from the
tribune.

Plans for a national academy were numerous under the convention.
Condorcet, d’Alembert, Dannou, Talleyrand, all who had high aims,
presented their contributions. It is said that Talleyrand accepted the
paternity of a scheme, which was entirely the work of the Abbé Des-
renandes, who had been his vicar-general at Autun, and who was
known to have been a member of the council of public instruction.

Talleyrand was one of those who could have dispensed with the |
aid ot a secretary, but the tradition is both old and persistent. All
who had formed plans for a national academy jealously laid claims to
the glorious title of founder of the institute. But historic truth com-
pels us to inscribe another name at the head of this list of honor, and
that is the name of Richelieu, the founder of the French Academy.

We, of our day, are more just than our fathers were. Our admira-
tion for the great achievements of the revolution does not blind us to.
the glories of the monarchy, which are the glories of France. We
celebrate the centennial of the Institute of France, but we are perfectly
ready to associate with the glory of this day the founder, or rather the
founders of the academies, from whom the institute has inherited its
glory: Louis XIII, and Louis XIV, Richelieu, Séguier, and Colbert.
The institute has been in existence since October 25, 1795, but the
academies of which it is composed go back to 1635. Most assuredly
the Institute of France counts, from its foundation, among its mem-
bers a number of illustrious men. I shall quote some of the names,
regretting only that I can not mention them all: Chateaubriand,
Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, Alfred de Vigny, Guizot,
Thiers, Cousin, in the French Academy; Monge, Berthollet, Lagrange,
Laplace, Lavoisier, Fresnel, Ampere, Arago, Cuvier, Geoffroy Saint
Hilaire, Cauchy, Chasles, Claude Bernard in the Academy of Sciences;
Dannou, Victor Le Clerc, Littré, Boissonade, Hase, Naudet, Burnouf,
in the Academy of Inscriptions; Louis David, Ingres, Delacroix, Meis-
sonier, David (d’Angers), in the Academy of Fine Arts. I had ended
here the list of our glorious contemporaries in obedience to the law
which does not permit me to mention the name of anyone living at the
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. TLS

present time—must I add to-day the name of a man whom I knew
more than fifty years ago at the normal school, where he was a pupil
and I a professor, who was a friend to every one of us, since no one
could know him and not love him, and who was, above all, the friend
and benefactor of mankind, the immortal name of Louis Pasteur? The
roof of this hall still resounds with the echo of the acclamations that
welcomed him when he came to this very place to receive the homage
of the whole scientific world. Mankind, on that day at least, was
grateful and just.

Thus the Institute of France has had, since the beginning, a magnifi-
cent membership of great men. We are proud of our new glories, but
we preserve a grateful and filial worship for the heroes of olden days.
We do not renounce Corneille, Racine, nor Boileau, nor La Fontaine,
nor Bossuet, nor Voltaire, nor Montesquieu, nor Buffon, nor Clairant,
nor d’Alembert, nor Huyghens, nor Mariotte, nor Mabillon, nor Rollin,
nor Turgot, nor Lebrun, nor Mignard, nor Lesueur, nor Philippe de
Champagne, nor Mansart, nor Soufflot.

Gentlemen, the tricolored flag is still for us “the beloved flag;” it is
the star of liberty and of civilization, but we follow with love and
pride in our hearts the white flag with the lilies of France as we go
back from age to age to the century which was the great century, and
which remains, emphatically, the “ French century.”

It was on the 29th of January, 1635, that the French Academy
received its official consecration. The Academy of Fine Arts enjoyed
the same honor in 1648, the Academy of Inscriptions in 1663, and the
Academy of Sciences in 1666. It does not suffice to restore the honor
of creating the academies to Louis XIII and to Richelieu. We must
go back as far as Conrart. The first. according to date, the French
Academy, is, like many great institutions, due to private initiative.
Conrart was nobody; he never became anybody. He is famous only
by his silence, a kind of fame specially created for him by Boileau.
It was he who first conceived the idea of making rules for a company
of men who met by turns at the different members’ houses to discuss
literature. There were nine men in this company. “Insignificant
men,” said Voltaire in a disdainful tone. ‘Obscure men,” he after-
wards added, in speaking of the first academicians, twenty-eight in
number, who received this title by letters patent from the King in 1635.
Of course a Corneille or a Racine was not to be had on the spot to
introduce into the academy. We had to wait twelve years for Corneille,
thirty-six years for Bossuet, thirty-seven for Racine, forty-nine for
La Fontaine and Boileau. The academy adorned itself with great
men very slowly. It was never to have forty great men at once. No
assembly, no matter when it existed nor to what nation it belonged,
can ever have at one time more than a limited number of great men.
Those whom Voltaire called insignificant men were perhaps not so
insignificant as he thought them to be. They seem insignificant to
716 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

posterity, but they were great in the eyes of their contemporaries. Let
us learn, if only for the sake of discretion, to respect superior men,
even though they do not happen to be Voltaires nor Moliéres. We
can not and we must not deceive ourselves with regard to men of
genius; we may hesitate in our choice between men who are superior
without being great, such as I shall call distinguished men above the
average. It is an honor for the enlightened society of the seventeenth
century that they at once attached great importance to this reunion of
a few men of culture who occupied themselves neither with polities
nor with religion, but confined their attention exclusively to literature
and the products of the mind. This love of letters has remained one
of the characteristic features of our national taste. From the time the
public were admitted to the receptions of the French Academy they
have flocked there. When it opened its doors on such days to women,
in 1702, they also assembled there in crowds. The academy has been
careful not to abandon this practice, which assumed in time great
solemnity. A reception at the academy is emphatically a Parisian
event. One must have been present, one must have formed an opinion
of the two speeches, to appreciate it. Less importance is attached to
the most heated discussions in the Legislative Assembly. The famous
““coupole” becomes an instrument of torture; people are stifled there;
some lose their consciousness. These fainting women add to the
success of the two orators. They remind one of Spanish bull fights,
which are only interesting in the eyes of their enemies when a “ torea-
dor” has been killed.

Cardinal Richelieu heard people speak of Conrart’s Society, and hav-
ing an instinct for what was great and permanent, he believed that
this association might become an institution.

He offered Conrart’s friends to give official recognition to the exist-
ence of their association, and this was about all he offered. ‘‘ Honor-
able privileges,” said Voltaire, ‘‘not one of them of any use; the founder
procured for them not even a place of meeting.” —

In tact, he rendered the academy no other service than that of not
ignoring it, but he thought, and everybody thought with him, that
since he did not ignore it, he controlled it. Many of Conrart’s friends
hesitated. What they had looked for was liberty; instead, they were
offered subordination. Their resistance could not be of long duration,
however, for it was not customary to resist the King, nor the Cardinal,
who was the King. To refuse a favor which they offered was more
than resistance; it was disobedience. They yielded; they even offered
thanks. They exalted the King and his great minister, Richetieu, who
promised to protect them.

There was still another obstacle to the official creation of the academy.
The Parliament also had a desire to resist. We know that registration
was at that time necessary to give efficacy to royal decrees. Parliament
could delay. It could make observations and even remonstrances.
THE CENYENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. t17

Finally, however, it could, on great occasions, be brought to submission
by a special court, called a “lit de justice.” But they did not have
recourse to such extremities in order to transform the reunions of
Conrart into a royal academy, though Parliament showed its bad
humor by the delay of a year. The Cardinal was compelled to make
it understood, that he meant to be obeyed.

Efforts have been made to find out what caused this ill will on the
part of the Parliament. It was not a question about the creation of a
final court, but of ‘simple weighers of words,” as they were called by
the jokers of the time. The Parliament, according to Voltaire, feared
that the academy would claim some jurisdiction over the library, and
added this clause to the letters patent of the King: “The academy will
only recognize the French language and such books as its members
have written, or which have been submitted to its judgment.”

I rather think that Parliament feared for the authority which it
claimed for itself in religious and philosophical matters. The academy
question touched the school question. The theological question was
also in close proximity; the more the authority of the Parliament was
contested in religious matters the more jealous it showed itself. They
were guided in this whole matter by the same spirit which later sug-
gested to them the reform of the university through President Roliand.

The King—and I speak here of Louis XV as well as of Louis XIV
and Louis X]I]I—was constantly a good master to the academies, but a
master nevertheless. The elections had to be submitted for his appro-
bation. This is a right which had always been reserved for the public;
it is stillin existence in our day. Louis XIV exercised this power on a
memorable occasion. He wished to have Boileau elected; the academy
chose La Fontaine. The King refused his approbation. The academy
therefore hastened to elect Boileau to the first vacancy. ‘ Now,” said
the King, ‘‘you may proceed to receive La Fontaine.”

The King also at times interfered with the work of the academy, but
only on very rare occasions. It was he, or rather it was Richelieu, the
author of the tragedy of Mirame, who prescribed that examination of
the “Cid” which was contrived to exalt the glory of the Cardinal, and
the result of which was to show the glory of Corneille in all its splendor.
Voltaire, in the following century, under the pretext of impartiality
and by mixing apotheosis with criticism, attempted the same under-
taking and arrived at the same result.

The academicians for a moment turned aside from their more peace-
able work and came back to the dictionary. During the revolution
they did not escape reproach for having produced neither the grammar
nor that art of poetry which the King expected from them, and for
having carried on the preparation of the dictionary much too slowly.
The academy was not so much to blame, though, as it was believed to
be. Of the three objects confided to its care it had chosen the diction-
ary, which rendered to the language the double service of fixing its
718 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

terms and of explaining its rules by examples borrowed from the best
writers. The dictionary advanced slowly, it is true, but this very
slowness constituted its strength. The various readings which it
recorded were all judged and adapted to the times before receiving
official confirmation.

The dictionary itself is the whole French Academy. To our lan-
guage, essentially flexible and full of life, which readily adapts itself
to the expression of every new sentiment and new thought, and which
suffices, without neologisms, for the exposition and demonstration of
scientific discoveries, it gives all the solidity and the majesty of the two
languages which have successively formed the incarnation of Greece
and of Rome.

Louis XIV was desirous that there should be a language of Louis
XIV, as there had been a language of Pericles and a language of
Augustus, and he claimed for himself the honor of this idea when he
said: ‘The encouragement of letters and of fine arts, having always
contributed to the splendor of nations, the late King, our revered lord
and father, ordered the establishment of the French Academy in 1635,
in order to bring language, eloquence, and poetry to that point of per-
fection which it has at last reached under our reign.”

I am not disposed to insist; I simply state what Louis XIV thought
and those who have ever since been called The Forty. Our admiration
of our own masterpieces and our own Janguage does not prevent us
from admiring the glories of other nations. We took part in the
centennial of Shakespeare; Goethe, Schiller, and Cervantes are popular
in our schools. No one can ever enter without feelings of profound
respect the church of Santa Croce in Florence, where around the
cenotaph of Dante are collected the tombs of Galileo, of Michel Angelo,
of Macchiavelli, of Alfieri, and of Cherubini.

The eighteenth century was constantly reproaching the academies,
and above all the French Academy, which bore the larger part of these
attacks because it had borne the larger share of glory, and also
because the public could more easily follow its labors, for having elected
mediocre men, and for having left men of genius outside its doors.
J have in my mind two men who were not members of the French
Academy, Descartes and Moliére. Rousseau, whose name is some-
times mentioned in connection with the omissions of the academy, was
a citizen of Geneva.

Two errors in a century and a half! Men, as a rule, do worse than
that. The greater part of Descartes’s works was written in Latin.
The “ Discours de la Méthode,” which is one of the grand monuments
of the French language, was known only to a small number of men
of science. The great splendor of Descartes’s name began only after
his death, when it was at last. understood that he had emancipated
human reason. Moliére’s profession was against him. We would laugh
nowadays, and with good reason, at such an objection. It was, however,
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. 719

a serious one under Louis XIV. The “ gentlemen upholsterers” and
“‘valets de chambre” of the King would not have desired to be made
members of the academy. I do not know what Moliére himself would
have thought of his election. People were then preservers of rank as
we are now of propriety. It was necessary to compel Catinat to allow
himself to be made a marshal of France. As to the other great men,
whose absence the convention regretted so bitterly, they belonged to
the category of those whom we styled a moment ago great men above
the average. They were justly admired by their contemporaries, but
posterity has the right to choose from among them. Dufresny, Raynal,
Helvetius are great men the omission of whose names caused much
indignation in 1793, but we of to-day would disapprove of it had they
been elected by the academy.

Of all charges brought against the academy, the one most frequently
made was its fawning upon the King. It was a society of courtiers
who could have given lessons upon this subject to all the Dangeaus
who ever existed, for was it not they who had offered a prize for the
best answer to the question, ‘‘ Which of all the King’s virtues deserves
the most praise?”

But this style and these sentiments no longer existed when Grégoire,
reproaching his ‘‘good Fénélon” for having written a treatise on ‘the
control over a King’s conscience,” added, ‘as if Kings had any con-
science! One might as well write a dissertation on the gentleness of
wild beasts.”

The mistake which men blinded by passion make, is to wish always
to form a judgment without taking into account the time and the sur-
roundings. With all respect for the levelers of 1793, the liberal spirit
which had manifested itself in the midst of the academy at the moment
of its official creation continued during its whole existence. The mem-
bers combined with it an admiration of the King the nature of which
we do not understand. The academy saw I’rance in the King. At
that epoch of history one was powerful only on the condition of being
dependent. It can not be doubted that the academies, surrounded by
the monarchy with honors, had become little by little veritable aristoc-
racies. They had in the eyes of the Republicans the double defect of
being corporations, and privileged corporations, much tainted by their
privileges. A practice, introduced by Colbert, or rather by PAbbé Big-
non, his nephew and his representative in the government of scientific
societies, divided the academies of inscriptions, of sciences, and of let-
ters into three classes of academicians—the honoraries, the pensioners,
and the pupils; thus, this constituted a privilege within a privilege.
The French Academy alone resisted energetically; it refused to suffer
the affront of such a regulation. The French Academy, since its crea-
tion, had always had in its midst dukes, marshals, bishops, and mag-
istrates of supreme courts. These great lords learned to treat men
of letters as their equals; but at the same time these men of letters
720 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

learned to consider themselves great lords. They complimented each
other in order to perfect themselves in their principal duty, which was
to praise the King and his ministers. These compliments have become
the speeches made at the reception of new members.

Voltaire was not lenient toward them. ‘All I can perceive in these
fine speeches,” he said, “is that the new member having assured them
that his predecessor was a very great man, that Cardinal Richelieu was
avery great man, Chancellor S¢guier rather a great man, the director
repeats the same thing and adds that the new member himself might
also be a kind of a great man, and that for himself, the director, he
does not overlook his own claims;” and further on: ‘The necessity of
speaking, the embarrassment of having nothing to say, and the desire
to appear clever, are three things calculated to make even the greatest
of men appear ridiculous.”

Could the convention suffer the existence of a body which spent its
time in heralding the virtues of the kings, which was itself a privileged
body, and which numbered among its members men invested with a
double privilege? It was the aristocracy of the mind, but still an aris-
tocracy. ‘La Montagne” and ‘La Plaine” were agreed to overthrow
it. An event had, however, taken place toward the middle of the
eighteenth century which might have modified the judgment of the
revolutionists. Voltaire was admitted into the academy. The academi-
cians had valiantly defended themselves. Voltaire was twice refused.
Finally he was admitted, and from that day the academy belonged to
him. He had already his newspaper, the Encyclopedia, and the Eney-
clopedia went with him into the academy, which was thus transformed
by anticipation into a veritable academy of sciences, moral and polit-
ical. He caused Dreclos, d’Alembert, Marmontel, Condillac, Morellet
to be admitted, one after the other. He failed with Diderot. He com-
plained bitterly, and with good reason, for though Diderot is not
exactly an academical genius, ke is still, beyond all doubt, a superior
man.

Voltaire writes to the Abbé d’Olivet: ‘Do try, my dear master, to
give us a real academician in the place of the Abbé de Saint-Cyr, and
a savant in the place of the Abbé Salier. Why could we not have M.
Diderot this time? You know that the academy should not be a semi-
nary, neither should it be a court of peers. A tew gold ornaments for
our lyre are befitting, but the strings must be of catgut and they must
be resonant.” .

Voltaire was not accustomed to be thwarted, and had taken his
revenge. He had the main body of his army in the French Academy.
He had Condorcet, d’Alembert, Fontenelle in the Academy of Sciences.
The Academy of Inscriptions showed more resistance, but he made his
way everywhere. He was the oracle of the “cercles des précieuses,”
whose influence had replaced the decreasing influence of the court.
Mme. de Lambert, Mme. de Tencin, Mme. Du Deffant, Mlle. de
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. 721

Lespinasse, Mme. Geoffrin, and Mme. Du Chatelet received their
inspiration from him. He was the (intermittent) friend of the King of
Prussia and the correspondent (and flatterer) of the great Catherine.
He had treated Corneille with arrogance. He believed himself to be
more pathetic than Racine. In philosophy he defied the clergy, whilst
observing his Haster duties at Ferney and dedicating his “‘ Mahomet”
to the Pope.

Judging him at the present time we can not help seeing in him a
precursor of the revolution. Voltaire and the whole army he com-
manded had, in fact, served revolutionary ideas, but they had thought
they were invoking a good genius, and when they found themselves
face to face with it (I speak of Voltaire’s lieutenants, for he died in
1778), it seemed to them they had invoked the devil. They hesitated
on the way and they became by this simple fact the greatest enemies of
their former friends. We could here make a parody on that grand
saying: ‘There is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth - - - ”and say: ‘‘There is more wrath in the revolu-
tionary army over a friend who stops on the road - - - .”

The academies, whose services were forgotten, shared the fate of the
parliaments and of the clergy. Grégoire, in a ridiculously emphatic
report, proposed the suppression of the academies, at the same time
asking that ‘‘from amid the ruins” the sanctuary of arts, rising under
the auspices of liberty, should represent the organized reunion of all
the scientists and all the means of science. ‘After to morrow,” he said,
‘‘the French Republic will make its entrance into the world. On that
day, on which the sun will shine upon a single nation of brothers, there
should no longer be found on French soil any institution which might
detract from the eternal principles which we have consecrated; and
yet some which still bear the stamp of despotism, or have an organi-
zation incompatible with equality, have escaped the general rule:
These are the academies.”

Two years after having disbanded the academies in this polite
manner the convention did a great thing—a very great thing. It
reestablished them, and in so doing it subjected them to a thorough
modification. The dream of one unique assembly of all scholars and
artists, of poets and philosophers, already conceived by the Consti-
tuent Assembly, became a reality. Never had the fraternity of letters,
Sciences, and arts been affirmed with such emphasis. ‘The new institu-
tion united in one body all the forces of passion and of thought. It
created above the ordinary society, occupied with the cares of life, a
sort of special world, which should unceasingly send forth new truths
and masterpieces, in order to enlighten humanity and to fortify and
charm it. The institute should take no part in the Government; it
was not to be burdened with teaching. Its work was to be of a higher
nature, it was to teach by example. In the same way that the God of
Aristotle moved without being moved, and could ignore the world to

sm 95——46
722 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

which he had given life, it is sufficient for scientists and poets to exist
and to be known. Their works produce the movement, and at the
same time they regulate it by the admiration which they inspire.
Dannou, speaking in the name of the convention, said: ‘“‘We have
borrowed from Talleyrand and from Condorcet the plan of a national
institute, a grand and majestic idea, the execution of which is to sur-
pass in splendor all the academies of the Kings. - - - . This will
be, in a way, the abridgment of the scientific world, the representative
body of the republic of letters, a national temple, the doors of which,
closed forever to intrigue, will open only at the arrival of genuine
. renown.”

This union, sublime and productive of all that is eternal in sentiment
and thought, is not the only grand feature of the new institution. The
academies so far have been purely local. They recruited themselves
from a single city and represented the scientific or literary movement
of the city where they were born. But the institute, created in 1795
to replace the academies, is not a Parisian institute; it is a national
institute, it is the Institute of France. ‘The constitution of the year 3,
the formula of which is faithfully reproduced by the constitution of the
year 8, declares it in these solemn words: “There is for the whole
Republic one single national institute, charged with collecting discov-
eries and with perfecting the arts and the sciences.” Could I forget, in
the sight of this assembly, that the national convention opened the
doors of the institute, not only to all men of French nationality, but to
all great men, whatsoever be their origin? Just as Louis XIV rewarded
genius, no matter to what nation it belonged, the convention also created
within the institute the order of Foreign Associates, which permits us
to inscribe on our lists of honor Huyghens, Newton, Leibnitz, and,
nearer home, Rossini and Meyerbeer.

The work of the convention is, therefore, not the re-creation of the
former academies, disguised under new names and modified in second-
ary details of their organization. It is in fact a new work. It is a
creation, a powerful creation. It is the Academy of I'rance, represent-
ing at the same time sciences, letters, and arts. It contains the former
academies, but inclosing them in a new and strong synthesis. Itis our
right and our duty on this day of rejoicing to offer our homage alike to
the old academies which prepared the institute and to the institute
which contains and completes the former academies. The work of
the convention is grand enough to enable us to acknowledge that the
Assembly had been less happy in the details of execution than in
the first conception. It had exaggerated everything; its own authority
over the institute, and the authority of the institute over the members
who compose it. It did not know what liberty meant. It said, as
Louis XIV did: L’état e’est moi! and when it had usurped all power
it said: ‘‘ Now we are free!”

The first fault of the convention, in this as in many other things, was
a

THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. (2a

its immoderate love for sweeping destruction. It suppressed the acad-
emies, which it might have modified while preserving them. It even
suppressed their names in the reorganization which it undertook after-
wards. It has been said with truth that it was afraid of words. It
replaced those illustrious namés by common appellations of first, second,
and third class, and yet succeeded by these changes only in veiling all
historic associations. It effaced another name which should have been
particularly sacred to it. Having to place philosophy in the class of
sciences, moral and political, which it was organizing for the first time,
it replaced this name, which might have suggested spiritualistic beliefs,
by that of analysis of sensations and of ideas, which recalls only Con-
dillac. Chaptal, who, already in 1801, reproached the organization of
the institute with “having gone much too far away from what expe-
rience had proved to be perfection in the composition of our old acad-
emies,” made in 1803 a new plan in which he showed himself more just
and more able than the convention. He even proposed to restore the
names of the old academies, on which France had prided herself for
more than a century and which had become the model of the literary
and scientific institutions formed successively in all parts of Hurope.
The council of state would not consent. It approved of the bulk of
the proposition, but it did not restore the names of the old academies.

The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, founded for the first
time in 1795, and which formed the second class of the institute, had a
short existence. The First Consul had one day said to M. de Ségur:
‘““You preside over the second class of the institute. I command you
to tell them that I do not wish to have politics discussed at their meet-
ings. If the class disobey I shall abolish it as a bad club.” True to
the end to his aversion for those whom he styled ideologists, when he
proceeded with the reorganization of the institute in 1803, he suppressed
the second class by silence, suppressing its name and distributing the
members among the other classes.

The first mistake of the convention was then to give up venerable
names and an illustrious past; it made another mistake in the mode of
election which it adopted. The candidates were presented by the class
in which a vacancy occurred, and the institute as a body was charged
with choosing from among the candidates thus presented. Never
before had fitness been treated with such contempt. An actor decided
the election of a mathematician. A painter judged a philosopher.
Here was an assembly which admitted Jews among the voters for the
election of Catholic bishops. Election by class or academy was only
established in the year 11 upon a report made by Chaptal.

The convention committed another error. The effect of the two first
was to exaggerate unity, the third exaggerated and misrepresented the
national character of the institute. It was the institute of France,
and they wished it on that account to be composed partly of Parisians
and partly of provincials. It would have been sufficient to say that
124 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

men of the first merit could be elected, whether they resided in Paris
or elsewhere. No, it seemed to be more radical to divide by halves.
This even ceased to be just, because Paris had a population of only
500,000 inhabitants and the provinces counted 25,000,000, and this was
not reasonable, since a man of eminence might desire to live in Paris
because of the libraries, the museum, the amphitheaters, and all the
other means of study there. A section of the dramatic art had been
admitted; three Parisian actors, three provincial actors. Everyone is
aware that, although great actors may have their beginning in the
provinces, they can not remain there where they have neither tradi-
tions, nor schools, nor the auxiliaries, nor the public which they need,
nor material resources. As much may be said of scholars and of
artists. The residence rule was very strict then, much more so than it
has been since. A member nominated to represent Paris, and who
took up his residence definitely in the provinces, was forced to send in
his resignation. Destrutt de Tracy, who lived at Auteuil, was nomi-
nated a nonresident member. The greatest error committed perhaps
is the inside regulation of work, which was impused by organic decree.
The Government claimed in this regulation the right to request the
opinion of the classes of the institute. It was especially to the Academy
of Sciences that it addressed these demands. It consulted it on the
subject of covered conveyances destined for the removal of the sick, on
the improvements to be made in hospital regulations, on the monetary
system, on a way of reconciling the era of the Republic with the com-
mon era, on a new kind of cannon ball, on an oiled taffeta suitable
for making cloaks for the troops, on the idea of placing several rows
of guns on a common frame, on the preservation of drinking water
on board ship, on the preservation of biscuits and of vegetables at sea.
There were also questions for the other classes, even philosophical
questions, which tended to make a state doctrine. Nothing is more
hostile to philosophy and to true policy, and nothing can impede more
seriously the progress of science and the splendor of academies. Ina
well organized literary body, the authority of each member grows with
that of the association, but on condition that there shall result from it
no intermeddling by the Government, nor by the academy, with the
individual labor. When General Cavaignac, to refute the socialists of
1848, asked the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences to write
some popular pamphlets on the subject, the academy failed to do it—
we must frankly confess it—although it had appealed to the greatest
men of science. A great mind is not found in work done on demand.
Genius must breathe the air of liberty.

This right of requisition did not appertain to the Government alone;
it belonged also to the public. Every author could demand an analysis
of his book, every inventor an examination of his discovery. Thus, the
academicians were no longer masters of their own time. Iam no longer
astonished at their being assigned two costumes, one for ceremonious
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. 125

occasions, and one to work in. No one seemed to see that being bound
to serve everybody they had no longer time to serve science.

I do not wish to enumerate all. I shall, however, mention the sup-
pression of the perpetual secretaries who were replaced by two secre-
taries, elected semiannually. This was taking from the academies their
unity, their life. Chaptal, in 1801, speaking of the old academies, said:
“The same man followed all the details of the academy, became its his-
torian, and connected in a very peculiar manner the glory of his name
with that of the body, whose organ he was. There was more consist-
ency in the administration, greater celerity in the execution, and it
can not be denied that the reestablishment of a perpetual secretary for
each class of the institute, by opening a career which presents so many
great men as models, would contribute to the glory of this body and to
the progress of science.” And later, in 1803, he returned to the charge.
“The reestablishment of these places,” he says, speaking of the per-
petual secretaryships, ‘will revive a branch of eloquence which has
been very much neglected for the last ten years, and will give to
academical labors that spirit of order, that combination of facts with
thoughts, which alone can precisely fix the dates of discoveries and
trace with accuracy the history of human knowledge.”

Although declaring that it renounced the academical past, the con-
vention, by the very force of circumstances, had preserved for its insti-
tute all the advantages which the old academies enjoyed. It retained
the recognition of the institute by the state, and the intervention of
the state in interior regulations. It left to the institute the home
of the academies, the library, the participation in the nomination of
professors in the great literary and scientific establishments. The
institute has carefully preserved this prerogative, and still presents
candidates for the College of France, the Museum, the Academy, the
schools of Kome and of Athens, the School of Maps, the School of Living
Oriental Languages, the Conservatory of Arts and Handicrafts, the
Observatory, the Polytechnic School. It has preserved the gratuitous
copies and the prizes known as prix du budget, to which are now added
certain prizes founded by private initiative, the annual amount of which
does not fall much short of 524,500 franes! On the 29th Messidor,
year 4, the convention gave to each member of the institute an annual
indemnity of 750 myriagrams of wheat, and on the 19th Thermidor fol-
lowing it decided that out of this indemnity there should be kept back,
on account of each member, a sum equal to 150 myriagrams of wheat,
to be distributed among those who had been present at the meetings,
both general and special, in each class.

In 1803, upon a report made by Chaptal, the members of this insti.
tute were permitted to belong to several academies at once, and in
consequence to combine several indemnities. ‘‘ This gives us,” said
Chaptal, ‘“‘the means of opening to men of distinction many avenues
to glory and to comfort, and in consequence the means of multiplying
726 THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.

and promoting talent.” The right of accumulating academies still
exists, but that of accumulating indemnities has been done away with.
We are still at the 750 myriagrams. Those among us who belong to
several academies receive only one indemnity. We boast of not being
rich. The members of the institute, when 750 myriagrams of wheat,
or, to speak more intelligibly, 1,500 francs, were fixed as the indemnity
which was to relieve them of all cares of life, never imagined in their
most ambitious dreams that they would possess one of these days one
of the most beautiful palaces in the world, with a picture gallery, a
library created all at once by the gift of a great writer and doubled
by an eminent scholar, woods, lakes, and a whole world of beautiful
souvenirs.

It would perhaps be well to recall here the fact, in order to explain
both our wealth and our poverty, that all gifts made to the institute
are made to science or to the poor. The members of the institute never
profit by them. A new donation is for them only an increase of labor.
The Emperor Napoleon III wished one day to raise the indemnity from
1,500 frances to 5,000, which made a very respectable quantity of wheat.
The institute, however, upon being consulted expressed its gratitude
and refused.

It has sometimes been remarked that all the efforts of the revolution
to transform the academies were after all but illusory. On the 8th of
August, 1793, they are suppressed—on the 25th of October, 1795, they
are replaced by the institute. It was almost immediately perceived
that this institute, just because it was new, was notlikely tolive. From
1803 they commence to reform it; the reforms are multiplied from year
to year, and to what did they lead? To suppressing the greater part
of the innovations, to restoring the old academies, and even, in 1826,
to giving them back their names. Those that speak thus do not see
that there remains to the revolution the glory of having established a
close bond between the academies, of having appreciated the solidarity
of letters, sciences and arts, of having put the academies in more inti-
mate communication with the public, and of having given them new
and serious means of influence.

From the ancient associations and the rearranging of the new ones
resulted the present institute, in which the protection of the state does
not exclude the liberty of the members, where each one is alone respon-
sible for his own doctrine, where solidarity of honor, which unites all
the members, makes eccentricities impossible, where all the members
united, without losing their identity, lend each other mutual assistance
and yet never fall into confusion, where all the work done tends to the
manifestation of truth and to the triumph of art—a body, in fine, which
unites in just proportions, authority and liberty, and which deserves
to be held up as a model to all civilized nations.

I venture to add, gentlemen, that your presence here, that of the
respected chief of the nation, and the splendor which is the result, will
give to the Institute of France a new consecration.
THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF FRANCE. THe

The world for the past twenty-five years has been witnessing a curious
spectacle. On one hand the governments are multiplying with a sort
of rage preparations for war. They are building fortresses, they are
casting guns, they are filling their arsenals with projectiles. Military
service in the active army is required of all young men without excep-
tion to the extent of emptying the schools and of disorganizing public
and private service, of taking from agriculture and industry the arms
which they need. They retain all citizens in the bonds of military
service until their forty-fifth year. It looks as if the battle were to be
fought to-morrow.

At the same time all philosophers and publicists, all statesmen and
the sovereigns themselves, protest in loud tones their horror of war.
They want peace. They must have it to give to labor security, to intelli-
gence its rights, and to the yearits spring. Leagues for the maintenance
of peace are formed on all sides, congresses are convened to protest
against “armed peace,” which is more ruinous and more murderous than
war.

Alas! These congresses bring nothing but good wishes! Thatis a
great deal, and yet itis nothing. They bring good wishes, and I dare
not say that they bring hopes! What mankind needs is not words,
nor does it need sighs. It needs acts. What will revive true fraternity
between men is great works done in common, and great services done
to humanity.

Here you have before your eyes the true Congress of Peace! This
is the congress where Truth is beloved for its own sake, no matter in
what country it comes to light, where poetry is worshiped in all lan-
guages, where great discoveries call forth the same enthusiasm, no mat-
ter what may be their origin, and where no other emulation is known
save that of doing well. The land of eternal truth and of eternal beauty
is also the land of peace.

Associates and correspondents of the Institute of France, you will
carry away with you not only the remembrance of the warm sympathies
which welcomed you here, we shall all of us carry away from this fra-
ternal reunion an increased love of peace, of the sciences which make
it bear fruit, and of the arts which embellish it. And we shall labor,
each one of us in his chosen corner of the universal workshop, for the
prosperity of the house—that is to say, for the happiness of mankind.

SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.|!

By CHARLES L. BARNES, M. A., F.C. 5S.

Under the ample shelter afforded by the words “literary” and “ philo-
sophical,” I feel that a paper on the progress of science in England
from the seventh to the thirteenth century, inclusive, may find admit-
tance, though that which is new, and not that which is old, is more
usually welcomed within these walls.

The authorities from whom my remarks have been gathered are, in
the main, as follows:

(1) Popular Treatises on Science, written during the Middle Ages in
Anglo-Norman, Anglo-Saxon, and English, edited by Thomas Wright,
and published for the Historical Society of Science, 1841. This society,
whose existence seems to have been forgotten, had for president the
Duke of Sussex, and for vice-presidents, the Harl of Munster, Lord
Holland, the Bishop of Durham, and three others, while several dis-
tinguished names appear on the council, viz, Augustus de Morgan,
J. O. Halliwell, Sir Francis Palgrave, the Rev. Robert Willis, professor
of natural experimental philosophy at Cambridge, Thomas Wright,
and several more. Another of its publications, also issued in 1841,
has the following title: A Collection of Letters illustrative of the
Progress of Science in England from the Reign of Elizabeth to that of
Charles II, and is edited by Halliwell, afterwards better known as
Halliwell Phillips. A further list of books in contemplation is given
in each of these volumes, but they are not to be found at the reference
library, and I have not yet been able to discover when or why the
society dissolved, unless it died a natural death on the publication of
the Rolls series.

Many fragments have also been gleaned from the Encyclopedia
Britannica and the Dictionary of National Biography.

This country, in its earlier days, lay quite outside the sphere of
Scientific influence; remote from Egypt, Rome, or Greece, and the
arena of constant struggles between the native races and their
invaders, it offered more attractions to warriors and missionaries than
to philosophers, consequently we may pass over not only the whole
Roman period, but a considerable interval after the invasion of the
Saxons in 449, without finding a single circumstance to dwell upon.
The conversion of this people to Christianity was begun in 597 by
Augustine, at the instance of Pope Gregory the Great, and the intel-
lectual awakening which followed from this event soon bore fruit in
the development of the language and literature. The poems of Ced-
mon, Cynewulf, and the legendary Beowulf are the earliest specimens
of Anglo-Saxon achievements in a most difficult art, and date from
660 to 700 or thereabouts.

In the eighth century the cultivation of letters was taken up even by
women, many of whom wrote Latin and French with equal ease, while
all ranks were in the habit of making journeys to Rome, whence they
returned Jaden with books and ideas which they did their best to
disseminate.

The want of Anglo-Saxon scientific terms delayed the translation of
books into the vernacular, and those which existed in any language suf-
fered severely between the ninth and eleventh centuries at the hands
of the Danes, and in a minor degree from an unfortunate custom of
scraping the letters off old MSS. to make room for new matter.

The barbarous Northmen, who have been described as the curse of
England at that period, were especially bitter against monasteries and
the treasures they contained, and from the sacking of Lindisfarne or
Holy Island in 793 till the reign of Canute did incalculable damage.
Under this monarch, himself a Dane, the country had a temporary
prosperity. After him came the English restoration, then the Norman
Conquest, and so on. At no time were the sword and implements
of war laid by for long, and those whose bent would have been toward
philosophy under happier circumstances were forced to keep silence or
to fall in with the popular current. These things must be borne in
mind before we judge our ancestors too harshly. It is well known that
the Saxons made furnaces for the evaporation of salt in Cheshire and
Worcestershire, and contrived dishes of metal and even of transparent
glass for domestic purposes, while their agriculture was conducted upon
sound principles, though with rude instruments.

The sources of their scientific information were, in the first place,
Greek and Roman; but as they accepted without question the authority
of Aristotle and Pliny, they made no advance worth speaking of till

the eleventh century. Much progress had long before been made in
other countries. The great Alexandrian school—the closing scene of
which was the murder of Hypatia in 414—had been continued for two
centuries in Persia; thence it was carried by the Arab conquerors into
Spain, and flourished abundantly from the ninth century onward at
Granada, Cordova, Toledo, Seville, and elsewhere; but owing to the
lack of travelers sufficiently versed in Arabic, and at the same time
capable of assimilating the new ideas, their diffusion into England took
place very slowly. The philosopher’s stone and potable gold, the elixir
of life, were undreamed of till the Arabian influence was felt, and chem-
istry and medicine were in a state of which the less said the better.

Of those who endeavored to keep alight the flame of science in this
country were, in the first place, Bede, the monk of Jarrow (672-735),
styled in after times the Venerable, the Father of English learning,
whose work, De Natura Rerum, served as as a foundation for other
writers for a long period, though it only represents a very small part of
his literary labors. It is chiefly a cosmography and cosmogony, the
same which had prevailed in Europe for many centuries. The earth was
the center of the universe, and the firmament a sphere, bounded by fire;
beyond this was heaven, the abode of angelic natures, capable of human
and superhuman functions. The planets were seven in number and
revolved within the firmament; comets were stars suddenly developed,
which portended pestilence, revolution, war, or tempest; lightning was
produced by the collision of clouds, just as fire is produced by striking
two flints. This idea is to be found in Lucretius, first century B. C.,
in Book VI, De Rerum Natura: “It lightens then, when the clouds
have struck out by their collision many seeds of fire, just as if a stone
were to strike another stone or a piece of iron, for then, too, light bursts
out and fire scatters about bright sparks.” Probably the same notion
had been current for untold ages before this.

Two other works of Bede’s were written to elucidate questions con-
nected with Haster, this feast having at all times presented problems of
amost thorny kind. Characteristically enough, Bede believed that the
world in his day was old, decrepid, worn out, and in its sixth stage, and
that it would shortly come to an end.

Toward the end of the seventh century (in 668, to be very precise),
Theodore, a native of Tarsus, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, and
taught astronomy and arithmetic in the schools, while Albert, Arch-
bishop of York, also diffused the higher branches of knowledge. Under
the system of the schools, learning was divided into seven arts, the
“Trivium,” comprising grammar, logic, and rhetoric, and the ‘‘Quad-
rivium,” namely, arithmetic, geometry (probably mensuration or sur-
veying, not Huclidean geometry), astronomy, and music. The number
of arts was, however, sometimes expanded to ten by the inclusion of
astrology, medicine, and mechanics, though these occasionally replace
grammar, logic, and rhetoric, instead of supplementing them.

After these we have Gerbert, born about 950, better known in later
(ays SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.

times as Pope Sylvester II, and his followers, Elthelwold of Winchester
(925-984), and Dunstan of Glastonbury (925-988), the latter of whom
subsequently became Archbishop of Canterbury. Gerbert, though not
an Englishman, may be introduced as having made Europeans ac-
quainted with the Indian numerals and algebra, and with various
mechanical inventions, such as the clock pendulum. He had studied
at Cordova and Toledo, and acquired a great reputation, not unmixed
with obloquy as a dabbler in forbidden arts. Ethelwold was famed as
an ingenious mechanic, and a treatise by him on the quadrature of the
circle is in existence at the Bodleian Library. Dunstan fell under the
same imputation as Gerbert, and is recorded to have possessed a magic
harp which played sweet tunes by itself when hanging on a wall. He
once survived the ordeal of being thrown into a pond. His favorite
studies were arithmetic, geometry, and music, and a story of him in
connection with a pair of tongs and a forge has caught the popular ear.

Ailmer, a monk of Glastonbury, is credited with the manufacture of
a pair of wings wherewith to spurn the ground. He broke his leg on
coming down too roughly after an attempt to fly from a church tower,
but, with a true scientific spirit, attributed his misfortune to the want
of a tail to the machine.

Robert, Bishop of Hereford (died 1095), wrote on the motion of the
stars and the lunar computus (a method of finding Easter). He also
compiled a number of mathematical tables.

Next we find Athelard of Bath, whose name is said to be the great-
est in English science up to the days of Grosseteste and Roger Bacon.
He traveled in Greece, Spain, North Africa, Sicily, and probably to
Bagdad, then one of the chief seats of Arabian learning, and translated
Euclid from Arabic to Latin, thus introducing a text-book which still
survives amongst us. (A version in the same tongue taken direct from
the Greek is said to have been made by Beetius, who lived from 475 to
525, but his writings were not read fill late in the Anglo-Saxon period.)
Later on, somewhere between 1110 and 1120, he founded a school in
France, where he taught the then new and unpopular sciences he had
learned.

Philippe de Thaun, writer of a Bestiary, to be noticed presently;
William of Newbury, who gave currency to the fables of animals
embedded in rocks surviving their accidental release, and to legends
of dragons and other monstrous creatures (probably founded on fossil
bones); Alexander Neckam (1157-1217); Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln
(died 1253), and Roger Bacon completed a list, which is only meant to
include the principal names. Of Neckam and Bacon, I shall have more
to say presently. Grosseteste has been favorably noticed by George
Boole as having had a glimpse of the principle of least action. Start-
ing with a datum derived from Aristotle, that there is greater union
and unity in a straight line than any other, and assuming that all
united virtue is more powerful than that which is not united, he deduces
that nature, operating in straight lines, operates in the best manner
SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND. fae

possible. Hence he infers that light travels in straight lines, and gives
the law of reflection correctly, but accounts for refraction by hinting
that the ray is less weakened by this process than the other. He might
have learned all his optics and more from Euclid and Ptolemy.

Now, quitting the list of authors, we may glance at some of their
works, taking here and there an extract where the quaintness or inter-
est appears to demand it.

Among the arithmetical problems in vogue we have the following:
“The swallow once invited the snail to dinner; he lived just one league
from the spot, and the snail traveled at the rate of an inchaday. How
long would it be before he dined?” This problem casts an unworthy
slur upon the powers of locomotion possessed by the gasteropod, and
even upon his intelligence, though it does not specifically say that the
swallow’s invitation was accepted. Here is another, which has been
battered to and fro throughout the centuries, but which is still recog-
nizable as an old friend: ‘‘ Three men and their wives came to the side
of a river, where they found but one boat capable of carrying over only
two persons at once. All the men were jealous of each other. How
must they contrive so that no one should be left in company with his
neighbor’s wife?” <A third instance shows that the arithmetical bogey
of school books, who, when asked a straightforward question, answers
it in the most crooked way he can think of—stretches his line far back.
“An old man met a child. ‘Good day, my son,’ says he, ‘may you live
as long as you have lived and as much more, and thrice as much as all
this, and if God give you one year in addition to the others, you will be
just a century old.’ What was the lad’s age?” To prevent a needless
waste of exertion, I hasten to say that he was eleven. These problems
were current in the tenth and eleventh centuries.

Some sciences were taught by dialogue, never a good method even
in our day, but it might have been given up earlier with advantage if
the following are fair samples. ‘To the question, ‘“‘ Where does the sun
shine at night?” The answer is returned that ‘‘It shines in three
places: First in the belly of the whale called leviathan, next it shines
in hell, and afterwards on the island called Glith, where the souls of
holy men rest till doomsday.”

(@. Where is a man’s soul?—A. In his head, and it comes out at his
mouth.

Q. Where resteth the soul of a man when his body sleepeth?—A. I
tell thee it is in three places—in the brain, the heart, and the blood.

Occasionally they degenerate into riddles: Q. What is that from
which if you take the head it becomes higher?—A. Go to your bed
and you will find it.!

The “‘ Popular Treatise on Science,” above mentioned, comprise: (1)
A tract on astronomy in Anglo-Saxon, abridged from Bede’s De
Natura Rerum, by an unknown author, probably about 990. (2) The
Livre des Créatures, by Philippe de Thaun. (3) The Bestiary, by the

‘The head of the occupier is that which becomes higher.
734 SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.

same author, in Anglo-Norman, about 1120. (4) A fragment on séci-
ence from the Metrical Lives of the Saints, about 1250, in English.

In the astronomical treatise we find, of the sun, that “‘she is ever
running about the earth, and so light shines under the earth by night
as it does above our heads by day. On the other side where she shines
there is day, and on the side where she does not shine there is night.”
Further on we read: *‘ Every day the moon’s light is waning or waxing
four points through the sun’s light, and he goes either to the sun or
from the sun so many points. Not that he arrives at the sun, for the
sun is much more elevated than the moon. It happens sometimes
when the moon rups on the same track that the sun runs, that his orb
intercepts the sun so much that she is all darkened, and the stars
appear as if by night. This happens seldom, and never but at new
moon.” This partition of genders, still remaining in modern German, is
also found in old Norse, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hebrew, etc., but not in the
Latin or Neo-Latin tongues. It is quite indefensible on optical
grounds, as the feminine quality, that of giving back after it has
received, is nowhere more clearly indicated than in the case of our
lesser light. But to proceed: ‘‘The sea and the moon agree between
them; ever they are companions in increase and in waning, and as the
moon daily rises four points later than he did before, so also the sea
flows always four points later.” The origin of rain, hail, and snow is
given sensibly enough, but on thunder the writer is rather vague. ‘It
comes of heat and moisture; they strive with each other with a fearful
noise, and the fire bursts out through lightning and injures the prod-
uce of the earth if it be greater than the moisture. If the moisture
be greater than the fire, then it does good.”

The second treatise, the Livre des Créatures, or book of created
things, is in verse and comprises 1,588 lines. It deals with the signs
of the zodiac, the days of the week, lunations, epacts, the finding of
Easter, and soon. It appears to have no great value beyond its his-
toric interest, as many of the derivations are fantastic and misleading.
For example, the writer says that ‘‘September, October, November, and
December were called rains, for then there are tempests, that is in Latin
imber, from which is derived September, and the three others are derived
thus.” Modern philologists are content to derive these names from the
Latin numerals, septem, octo, etc., and Chambers adds that the final
syllable comes from the Persian word bar, meaning a period of time.
The book goes on to say that February was the month which Pluto had,
because he caused no incumbrance to the soul when he went to hell.
One does not see the connection here; in any case, the matter is more
clearly expressed in our dictionaries, according to which February is the
month of expiation, after a Roman custom. With May and June heis
again not easily reconcilable with the moderns, as he derives one from
the elders or majores, the other from the juniors. We connect them
both with words which signify growth.

In the sigus of the zodiac he sometimes touches on delicate ground.
SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND. 735

“Cancer signifies that it can not go straight by land nor by sea, and
when God came on the earth to conquer our souls He went much from
side to side; He dared not come forwards, He feared much to Pagans
and the Jews, because they were to kil! Him and make Him a martyr.”
“The fifth sign is placed in July, which is called Lion, because he is very
great before and his legs are feeble behind; so the sun in the begin-
ning takes all his force; he is all boiling, very hot and burning; when he
is come to the middle he has hardly more strength than the lion who
has small flanks.”

We must now leave this treatise and proceed with the Bestiary.
This particular one was written for the instruction of Adelaide of Lou-
vain, Queen of Henry I, to whom she was married in 1121; but works
on natural history, compiled from Greek and Roman writers, were com-
mon under the name of Physiologus or Bestiary, from the tenth or
eleventh century onwards; copies being known in Old High German,
Icelandic, Provencal, Arabic, Syriac, etc., not to mention Latin and
French. Many strange qualities are assigned to real beasts in this com-
pilation, and stranger still to the fabulous ones ‘Cetus is a very great
beast; it lives always in the sea; it takes to sand of the sea, spreads it
on its back, raises itself up, and will be in tranquillity. The seafarer
comes, thinks that it is an island, and goes to arrive there to prepare
his meal. The whale feels the fire and the ship and the people, then
he will plunge if he can and drown them. This cetus is the devil,
the sea is the world, and the sands are the riches of the world; the
soul the steersman, and the body the ship which he ought to keep,
and the fire is love, because man loveth his gold, his gold and his
Silver. When he perceives that and he shall be the more sure, then he
will drown him. And this cetus, says the writing, has such a nature
that when he wants to eat, he begins to gape, and the gaping of his
mouth sends forth a smell so sweet and so good, that the little fish,
who like the smell, will enter his mouth, and then he will kill them,
then he will swallow them, and similariy the devil will strangle the
people who shall love him so much that they will enter into his mouth.”
Hardly a single one of these descriptions is allowed to pass without a
moral, the constant repetition of which becomes wearisome, not to say
exasperating, to a modern reader, as it probably did to the ancient one.
The salamander is of course found here. “If it come by chance where
there shall be burning fire, it will immediately extinguish it; the beast
is so cold and also of such a quality, fire will not be able to go where
it shall enter.” Also the wild ass which brays twelve times both by
night and day at the equinox; the beaver with a curious instinct, and
the serra with the head of a lion and tail of a fish, which, when it sees
a ship, rises up and keeps the wind off it. It is somewhat startling to
read that ‘the turtle is a bird, simple, chaste, and fair, and loves its
mate so much that never during its life will it have another. Always
afterwards it will lament him; nor will it be any more on the branch.”
One’s appreciation of what appears at first sight an amazing blunder
736 SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.

is, however, spoilt by the reflection that turtle here is the French tour-
terelle, and is more familar as turtle dove. Here is also the adder
which fears the voice of the enchanter, and to keep itself from harm
closes one of its ears with its tail and presses the other to the ground;
the eagle which, when its eyes are dim and its wings can no longer
carry it, flies to the highest regions of the sky, and when the sun has
burnt its wings and blinded its sight falls into a fountain, plunges
therein three times, and is revived; and many more too numerous to
mention. The fable of the adder stopping its ears is of great antiquity,
being alluded to in Psalms, Ivili, 4 and 5: ‘They are like the deaf
adder that stoppeth her ear; which will not harken to the voice of
charmers, charming never so wisely.” Again, in Psalms ciii, 5, the
words, ‘“‘So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s,” give at least
an equal antiquity to the other one.

In the ‘‘ Leechdoms, Wort-cunning, and Stareraft of Early England”
we are struck by the quaint Anglo-Saxon expressions for medicine,
botany, and astronomy, while at the same time we recognize that the
difficulty of translating scientific works into the vernacular must have
been very great. The Leech book, dating from 900 to 950, is compiled
from Greek and Roman, as well as from Eastern and Scandinavian
sources. In it an ache or pain is usually called ‘ wark,” a word which
has survived to our own day in the dialect of this country, with only a
slight change. ‘“ For tooth wark, burn white salt and garlic, make them
smoke on glades (ashes), roast and tear to pieces, add pepper and elub-
moss, and lay on.” No inconvenience is too slight to find a remedy .
here. “Against a woman’s chatter, taste at night fasting a root of
radish; that day the chatter can not harm thee.” Is a man weary and
ill at ease, ““he may eat radish with salt and vinegar, soon the world
will be more gay.”

Empiricism and superstition have about equal share in the book,
e. g., for a remedy to be efficacious a plant must be gathered in a cer-
tain month when the moon is on the wane, or it must be dug up with-
out iron, and soon. Time, and not material, prevents any more quota-
tions in this place.

In the Wort-cunning, many valuable qualities are ascribed to plants,
which, in our degenerate days, are utterly neglected. Of feverfuge,
we are told that “This wort, which is named Centaurea minor, and
which some call the lesser churmel, is produced on solid lands and on
strong ones. Also it is said that Chiron the Centaur found these
worts, whence they obtained the name of Centaurea. For bite of snake
take dust of this same wort or itself pounded, administer to the patient
in old wine, and it will produce much benefit. For sore of eyes take
this same wort’s juice, smear the eyes therewith; it heals the thinness
of the sight;” and so on for many, many pages. The Starcraft in this
book is the same as that given by Wright in the Popular Treatises, and
has been already quoted from.

We must now glance for a moment at Alexander Neckam. Born at
SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND. toe

St. Albans in 1157, he migrated to France at an early age, and obtained
a professorship at Paris in 1180, but in a few years returned to Eng-
land. He applied for admission to the great Benedictine Monastery of
his native town, but tradition relates that a jocular reply of the abbot
nettled him so much that he joined the Augustinians at Cirencester
instead. The reply was as follows: ‘Si bonus sis, venias; si nhequam,
nequaquam.” ‘If you are a good man, you may come; if you are a
bad one (a Neckam), we won’t have you at any price.”

He composed a Latin elegiac poem on science in ten books, but his
principal work is De Naturis Rerum, which was written before the end
of the twelfth century. It includes an account of the creation, and
dissertations on the four elements, on astronomy, natural history, and
on minerals. The earliest recorded mention of the man in the moon
occurs here, though enly as a tradition; the marks on its surface are

_ ascribed to caves, hills, and valleys. His remarks on magnetism are

worth quoting, as he is the first English writer who mentions this sub-
ject. After explaining the hanging of Mahomet’s coffin by this means,
he continues: ‘‘The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when
in cloudy weather they can no longer profit by the light of the sun,
and when the world is wrapped up in the darkness of the shades of
night, and they are ignorant to what point of the compass their ship’s
course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle, which is
whirled round until, when its motion ceases, its point looks direct
toward the north.” In another treatise, De Utilitensibus, also of the
twelfty century, he has another mention of the compass, and says that
‘among the stores of a ship there must be a needle mounted on a pivot,
which will oscillate and turn till the point looks toward the north.”
The pivot is a distinct advance over a needle floating on a straw. In
view of the interest attaching to early references to the compass, I may
quote the following extracts, given for the sake of reference, in the
same volume. Cardinal Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acon, in Pales-
tine, in a history of Jerusalem, written about 1218, says: ‘An iron
needle, after having been in contact with the loadstone, turns itself
always towards the north, which, like the axis of the firmament, remains
immovable, while the others follow their course, so that it is very nec-
essary to those who navigate the sea.” Again, Guyot de Provence, in
a love song of the early part of the thirteenth century has these lines:

They know its position for their route,

When the weather is completely without light,

All those who employ this contrivance.

Whoever trusts a needle of iron

So that it remains almost entirely outside

In a bit of cork, and rubs it on the brown leadstone

If it be put in a vessel full of water

So that nobody push it out.

As soon as the water becomes quiet,

To whatsoever side the point turns
There is certainly the polar star.

sm 95 47

738 SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.

Lastly, Dante’s preceptor, Brunetto Latini, writing about 1260, just
after a visit to Roger Bacon, says: ‘He shewed me the magnet, an
ugly black stone to which iron spontaneously attaches itself. They
touch it with a needle and thrust this into a straw, then put it in
the water; it swims, and the point turns toward the polar star. If the
night be dark, and one can see neither star nor moon, the mariners can
keep their right course.” Bacon is the only writer, as far as I know,
who mentions magnetic repulsion, ‘‘as the lamb flees the wolf,” he
puts it.

Neckam’s remarks on animals are of little interest, as they reflect
allthe popular errors. Heis the only author, except Bacon and Grosse-
teste, who deals with optics. He describes the well-known basin and
coin experiment (this, however, was known to Cleomedes in the first
century A. D.), and speaks of glass mirrors. He tells us that in a
concave mirror the image is inverted, and in a plane or convex one .
erect, but remarks despairingly, ‘‘Who can assign a sufficient reason
for these things?” An interesting observation, which he might have
learned from Eratosthenes, of the third century B. C., is that verticals
to the earth’s surface must be inclined to one another; he goes rather
too far, however, and says that the walls of buildings must diverge, so
as to be in the direction of the earth’s radii. He notes that all ponder-
able things tend naturally toward the center.

Here, also, we find an interesting fable, that the wren, sitting on a
branch on the 1st of March, complained to February about the mild-
ness of the weather. She at length became abusive on the subject,
whereupon he went to his brother March and obtained permission to
influence the weather for two days. This he did with such effect that
the bird, battered by hailstones and half frozen, lamented that the gen-
tle February was past. It is well known to meteorologists that there
are nearly always three cold days between the 11th and 14th of April,
and that in the old style these dates would fall at the beginning of the
month: but I am not aware that a converse state of things has been
noted in March. The old Scotch rhyme which follows relates to the
‘‘borrowed” days of April:

March said to Aperill,

I see three hoggs upon a hill,

And if you’ll lends me dayes three,

V’ll find a way to make them dee.

The first o’ them was wind and wet;

The second o’ them was snaw and sleet;
The third o’ them was sic a freeze,

It froze the birds’ nests to the trees.
When the three days were past and gane,
The three silly hoggs came hirplin hame.

The word “hogg” here is a farmer’s term for a young lamb between
the time of its being weaned and having its first fleece cut.

In Roger Bacon, the last author with whom I shall deal, one feels
SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND. 139

instinctively, after even casually turning over a few pages, that the
style is vastly superior to and more scientific than anything that has
gone before. There is a solidity and keenness of penetration about it
which is sadly wanting in his predecessors, who were content to hand
down what they had learned without so much as a show of criticism.

Roger Bacon was born at Ilchester, in Somersetshire, in 1214. He
took the degree of doctor of theology in the University of Paris, famed
in those days above Oxford, Salerno, or Montpellier, and acquired a
mastery of the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic literature of his time.
He joined the Franciscan order of monks, but incurred much opposi-
tion from them, even to the extent of being thrown into prison on sey-
eral occasions on account of having fallen under the suspicion of
magic. His proposal to repudiate Aristotle altogether, and appeal to
nature by experiment, was also very unpopular. He spent forty years
of his life in study, and over £2,000 in buying books and materials and
in traveling; and his own reward was neglect, poverty, and persecution.
Fortunately for the world, Clement IV, who had been his friend before
his elevation to the papal chair, encouraged him to write, and at his
instance he produced these works which have placed him among the
immortals: The Opus Majus, Opus Minus, Opus Tertium, and Com-
pendium Philosophie. The first of these, planned on a splendid scale,
is divided into six parts, as follows:

(1) On the four causes of human ignorance; authority, custom, pop-
ular opinion, and the pride of supposed knowledge. ‘These seem to
bear a kind of lurking resemblance to Lord Bacon’s Idols of the Tribe,
the Cave, the Market Place, and the Theatre; but, for whatever con-
nection there is, Francis, and not Roger, must be held accountable.

(2) On the causes of perfect wisdom in the Sacred Scriptures.

(3) On the usefulness of grammar.

(4) On the usefulness of mathematics. This is again subdivided
into—

(a) The necessity of mathematics in human things.

(b) The necessity of mathematics in divine things. These are
enumerated as geography, chronology, cycles, and natural phe-
nomena, arithmetic, and music.

(c) The usefulness of mathematics in ecclesiastical things, e. g.,
the certification of faith, and the correction of the calendar.

(d) The usefulness of mathematics in the State, for the sciences
of hydrography, geography, and astrology.

(5) On perspective (i. e., optics), treated under four heads: The
organs of vision, the propagation of light in straight lines, reflection
and refraction, and the propagation of the impressions of light.

(6) Of experimental science.

Whewell says of this work that its plan was ‘to urge the necessity
of a reform in the mode of philosophizing; to set forth the reasons why
knowledge had not made a great progress; to bring back attention to
740 SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND.

sources of knowledge which had been unwisely neglected; to discover
other sources which were yet wholly unknown, and to animate men to
the undertaking by a prospect of the vast advantages which it offered.”
The work is thus a method, rather than a treatise on science; but part
5, on perspective, describes the anatomy of the eye, and is his own
work. He also discourses on vision, the laws of reflection and refrac-
tion, and the construction of mirrors and lenses. Part 6 is again
devoted rather to the philosophy of the subject than a description of
experiments; but it includes an investigation into the nature and
causes of the rainbow.

The Opus Minus is a summary of the Majus; Tertium, a preamble
and supplement to the other two. Bacon’s fiery energy appears in the
fact that all three must have been written within eighteen months,
though no trace of haste or carelessness appears in them. There is
evidence that he intended all these works merely as a preliminary to a
still greater one, of which the Compendium Philosophie is a part.

To do justice to him, and to give extracts showing the intellectual
level on which he stood, would far exceed the limits of a page or two.
One can only regret that such a man should not have been able to
command the leisure and encouragement which would have been his
lot in a more enlightened age. That he was a believer in alchemy,
there is no doubt, but for this he can not be blamed; nor for a belief
in magic, though he is mest emphatic in assigning it a subordinate
place. The one quotation which follows, from the Appendix to the
Compendium Philosophie, will show to what extent he forecasted the
labors of engineers and mechanicians, while at the same time he is evi-
dently not letting his imagination run riot, but keeps within reasonable
bounds, as if he knew the range of human powers.

“That I may the better demonstrate the inferiority and indignity of
magical power to that of Nature and Art, I shall a while discourse on
such admirable operations (of Art and Nature) as have not the least
magic in them. - - - And first of such engines as are purely
artificial.

“J. It is possible to make engines to sail withal, so that either fresh
or salt water vessels may be guided by the help of one man, and made

to move with a greater swiftness than others which are full of rowers
to drive them along.

‘II. It is possible to make a chariot move with an inestimable swift-
ness, such as the scythed chariots were, wherein our forefathers fought,
and this motion to be without the help of any living creature.

‘‘III. It is possible to make engines for flying, a man sitting in the
midst thereof, by turning only an instrument which moves artificial
wings made to beat the air, much after the fashion of a bird’s flight.

“TV. It is possible to invent an engine of little bulk, yet of great
efficiency, either to the depressing or elevation of the very greatest
weights.

“V, A man may easily make an instrument whereby one man may,
in despite of all opposition, draw a thousand men to himself, or any-
thing which is movable.

“Vi, Aman may make an engine whereby, without any corporal

ae
SCIENCE IN EARLY ENGLAND. (4I

danger, he may walk at the bottom of the sea or other water. Such
engines as these were of old, and are made even in our days. All of
them, excepting only that instrument of flying, which I never saw, nor
know any who hath seen it, with an infinite number of other inven-
tions, are possible, such as the making of bridges over rivers without
pillars or supporters.”

As my intention is by no means to trace the early history of science
in general, but merely to record what was done by English writers
between definite limits of time, I have of course to omit all reference
to the work of Geber, Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lully, and others.
It is only too evident that in these seven centuries science would have
fared very badly had its development been left to Englishmen alone; .
but a noble recompense for this neglect has been made since by a long
line of busy workers from the days of Boyle and Hooke down to our
own time.

THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION|!

By H. E. ARMSTRONG.’

The address on ‘“‘Art tuition,” delivered here a fortnight ago by Pro-
fessor Herkomer, which I trust many of you had the advantage of
listening to, was full of wise counsel, which can not fail to be of value
to those who study it; the more so as Professor Herkomer is not only
himself an artist of wide and varied experience, highly gifted with
originality, but also an experienced teacher, and is therefore better
able to advise than are most other artists.* For, atter all, only the
competent teacher is fully aware of the difficulties which beset the path
of the student.

But no advice given by Professor Herkomer was equal in importance
to his opening statement—which was subsequently confirmed by mem-
bers of the governing body—that in this polytechnic a clean beginning
has been made in art; that you have advisedly elected to be free from
all external control and are possessed with the fixed intention of work-
ing out your own salvation. Professor Herkomer begged—prayed, I
may say—that you should be kept clear of all contagion, and all who
are your true friends must join in this prayer.

I desire to preach from the same parable as regards the teaching of
science—to exercise the functions of a medical officer of health for
Science; but my task is a difficult one. Professor Herkomer spoke to

1Reprinted from Science Progress, Vol. LV, No. 23, January, 1896.

2The editor has been good enough to regard the following article as of sufficient
interest to warrant its insertion distinctly with the object of showing that it is
desired to deal with subjects likely to attract public attention, so as to interest a
wider circle of readers in Science Progress. I have gladly accepted his hospitality,
as I believe it to be of the utmost importance to interest scientific workers as well
as the public in questions such as I raise. Unless we are prepared to throw ourselves
more into such work, there is little probability that the teaching of scientific
method will gain that popular recognition which the subject imperatively demands,
and which so many of us are persuaded must without delay be accorded to it, if we
are to retain any proper measure of national prosperity. It was recently delivered
as an address at the Chelsea Polytechnic, and hence it is somewhat egotistical and
dogmatic in style; however, I have thought it undesirable to change the style,
desiring to lay as much emphasis as possible on the important issues which are

considered,
743
T44 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

willing ears; his meaning was clear; he was dealing with a popular
subject of which we all have some understanding. I can not butrecog-
nize that my subject is generally misunderstood, and its public impor-
tance greatly underrated in consequence. Some inscrutable influence
has led those who have organized this institute to appreciate the needs
of art, and having had the wisdom to take proper advice, they have
put you in possession of the elements of a perfect system of art sani-
tation; but the needs of the sister subject, science, have yet to be
grasped here and elsewhere. The sanitary condition of the dwellings
which science has to put up with throughout our country is most faulty,
ill arranged, out of date, and oftentimes abominable; and if this poly-
technic, indeed, polytechnics and schools generally, desire to place the
teaching of science under healthy conditions, heed must be given to
the inspector’s warnings.

IT might almost take Professor Herkomer’s address, write science for
art, add a few passages here and there, and redeliver it as my own.
Decorative art, that art which enables artists to decorate, you were
told can not be taught on the large scale; it can not even be taught in
schools—it must be taught in the workshop. Decorative science, sci-
ence which decorates its possessor and enables him or her to be scien-
tific, scientific knowledge which can be made use of in the service of
the world, also can not be studied except in the workshop and in nature,
to whom also the artist must resort. As Professor Herkomer said most
truly: all technical education will fail if established on a scheme in
which the master’s personality is eliminated, and that must follow in
any scheme of wholesale tuition.

But what meaning have the words “science” and “scientific” in Eng-
lish ears generally? Do they excite visions of a complicated picture of
things concerning our daily life in its minutest details? Certainly not.
Their utterance before those who know a little chemistry recalls fire-
works and smells and perhaps simple salts; whilst those who take an
interest in electricity have thoughts of bells ringing, galvanometer
needles wagging, or glowing electric lights; and teachers dream of
South Kensington certificates and hardly earned grants. In the minds
of the general public they call forth no response, especially in those of
that very numerous section of the community which is concerned
in commercial transactions and has no knowledge of manufactures.
Science in the eyes of the average Englishman consists of a newfangled
set of ideas, ali very well for those who can afford the time to study
them, but in his opinion not of such daily practical importance that it
is necessary for the nation to pay attention to them. And this unfor-
tunately is the opinion even of “educated” men and of many men of
culture. This is perhaps the primary defect in our system to which
the medical officer of health for science is bound to call attention; it is
one which we must all unite in overcoming and which polytechnics such
as this should do much to remove.
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. 745

If public appreciation of scientific procedure can be secured to even
a moderate extent, a complete popular victory for those who press for
its introduction must soon follow. The advantages to be derived from
the general application of scientific method to the affairs of life are
demonstrably so great that when once they are made known at all
commonly its adoption will be insisted on.

Science is but exact knowledge, and there are as many branches of
science as there are of exact knowledge. Remember, however, a loose
incoherent body of facts does not constitute a science—a man who is
merely possessed of such facts is not scientifically trained. A scientific
man is a “knowing man”—not merely a man who knows, but one who
is properly described in the terms of the popular expression—he’s a
knowing fellow—whici implies something more than the mere posses-
sion of knowledge, namely, the power to use it properly and with effect.
There is every difference, in fact, between the scientific and the merely
learned man. ‘To bescientific is to be as far as possible exact in thought,
deed, and word; to act with a purpose and after due and careful con-
sideration; to be observant and thoughtful; to be logical and method-
ical; to be guarded but fearless in opinions and judgment; and it is
because we are so rarely all these that we are so rarely truly scientific.

Unfortunately, the word ‘‘science” is now associated in the popular
mind with certain branches of natural knowledge, and it is because
these are generally regarded as of importance only to those whose
special business it is to attend to them that the proper application of
the term is lost sight of.

J am not here to speak of science teaching—I do not know what that
is—but of scientific teaching; of the method of teaching scientifically—
that is to say, exactly and properly. I am really speaking on the very
subject on which Professor Herkomer dilated; we are both pleading
one cause although on behalf of somewhat different interests, and mine
is the wider plea and will, in fact, include his. He was the advocate
of a practical workshop method of art tuition, under a teacher free as
well as competent to consider the peculiar qualities and requirements
of his pupils; of a method of so training students as to develop to the
utmost their individual innate talents, instead of turning out a set of
mechanical automata, blind followers of fashion. I desire to urge that
whatever we teach, our method shall be scientific, so that students, in
proportion to their abilities, may learn to honestly and usefully apply
whatever knowledge they may become possessed of.

Institutions such as this have a great field of usefulness before them
if all their work be done from such a standpoint; if it be not they will
be absolute and costly failures. I much fear that unless a change in
policy, almost amounting to a revolution, take place in many of the
schools throughout the country devoted to what we are now pleased to
call technical education, the results will be disastrous.

Let us consider what has been and is being done. Until about
746 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

twenty years ago, besides our universities, the three London colleges
and Owens College, Manchester, the country had little to boast of in
the way of institutions for higher learning to which those who had left
school could resort; but then important university colleges were
founded in rapid succession in a number of the chief provincial towns.
Meanwhile the educational fever spread to London, and there assumed
an extremely acute form under the name of technical education. The
City and Guilds of London Institute was founded, and built first the
Finsbury Technical College, and later the Central Technical College
at South Kensington, besides establishing an art school at Lambeth;
and by taking over, fostering, and largely extending the system of
technological examinations initiated by the Society of Arts, the City
Guilds Institute exercised an extraordinary influence on the establish-
ment and conduct of evening classes for instruction in technical sub-
jects throughout the country. A further development of the same
spirit has led more rezently to the erection here, there, and everywhere
throughout London of polytechnics, etc., and of a large number of
technical schools of various degrees of importance in the provincial
towns.

Why, it may be asked, all this educational activity, and why espe-
cially did the cause of technical education so suddenly spring into
prominence? The answer is, you know, because the conviction arose
that our manufacturing industries were being seriously threatened in
consequence of our failure to sufficiently avail ourselves of scientific
aid, and the greater appreciation by foreigners of the services of scien-
tifically trained workers. Because a feeling was abroad such as was
graphically expressed by Huxley in a remarkable letter to the Times
at the close of 1886 in which he pointed out that we had ‘already
entered upon the most serious struggle for existence to which this
country has ever been committed,” adding ‘the latter years of this
century promise to see us embarked in an industrial war of far more
serious import than the military wars of its opening years. On the
east, the most systematically instructed and best-informed people in
Hurope are our competitors; on the west, an energetic offshoot of our
own stock, grown bigger than its parent, enters upon the struggle,
possessed of natural resources to which he can make no pretension,
and with every prospect of soon possessing that cheap labor by which
they may be effectually utilized. Many circumstances tend to justify
the hope that we may hold our own if we are careful to organize
victory.”

The question is, Have the steps we have taken to protect ourselves,
to hold our own, to organize victory, led to success? In most cases,
most certainly not. We are fast proving ourselves to be incapable of
holding our own in almost every branch of industry.

Of course there are certain brilliant exceptions to the general rule,

but these only prove the rule and enable us to understand the cause of
our failure.
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. TAT

Why is this? It is, I believe, because our character is so firmly set
that nothing but severe compulsion will lead us to reform. It is be-
cause, whatever we may term ourselves politically, we are all by nature
ultraconservative, the rankest political radicals amongst us being the
strongest conservatives in their general conduct. It is due to our
intense belief in ourselves, the outcome of a long period of unexampled
prosperity. We are so intolerantly individual that we can not bring
ourselves to organize and cooperate, and this probably is the main
source from which our difficulties spring. Let me take an illustration
from agriculture, the most important of our industries, but one which,
as ail know, is in a terribly depressed condition. We are told that
last year £36,000,000 worth of butter, cheese, eggs, hams, bacon, fowls,
ducks, etc., was imported into this country. Surely we ought to be
capable of producing most of these.

As a matter of fact, we can not even make decent butter or cheese
yet. As Sir Henry Gilbert, the distinguished agricultural chemist,
remarked to me lately when we were sitting together at dinner, ‘In
our village we prefer to buy Brittany butter rather than the local ‘best
fresh.’” If we could do such things it would not be necessary for the
Yorkshire College, our leading university college, to send out peripa-
tetic teachers to instruct dairymaids, or for county councils all over the
country to do similar work, nor would the Duke of Devonshire have
been called on, as he was a few weeks ago, to open a midland dairy
institute. In France they have long known not only how to make but-
ter properly, but what to do with it when they have made it, an impor-
tant art which we, from our inability to organize, have also yet to learn.
Let me recite my own experience in this matter.

My father was largely concerned with the Normandy butter trade,
and on one occasion, about thirty years ago now, I visited France with
him; nothing I have since seen has ever impressed me more. The
morning after our arrival we were driven out to a market town in the
district, where we found all the country folk collected together, each
having brought whatever produce they could command to market; our
friend, and I should say that the active worker was a woman, went
rapidly round the market, tasting each parcel of butter and offering
what was thought to be its value, which, of course, was not the retail
price of best fresh. If the bid was accepted, note was taken by a clerk.
On our return, after dinner, in the evening, we found that the butter
had not only been collected and brought in, but we actually saw it being
carefully mixed and salted and colored to standard, so as to make it all
of one uniform quality, enough to fill a large number of casks being
thus dealt with. The next morning it was on the rail and on its way
to England. No such thing, | believe, has ever yet been done in this
country.

As to eggs coming from abroad, a recent remark made by Sir J. B.
Lawes occurs to me: “That it is not that we do not produce them, but
we eat them nearly all ourselves.” It may be well for us that we do,
748 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

but the fact is none the less an illustration of the absence from England
of thrifty habits such as characterize other nations.

Again, to illustrate why we are beaten by others, let me refer to the
fate that has befallen what was formerly an important English indus-
try—the manufacture of colors from coal tar, which is now practically
in the hands of the Germans and Swiss, so much so that Dr. Caro, the
chief living authority on these matters, in addressing the German
Chemical Society a couple of years ago, was able to refer to it as a
German national industry.

It was established in 1856 at Sudbury, near Harrow, by Perkin, who
discovered the first aniline color in the course of a research which he
was carrying out, with purely scientific objects in view, under the
direction of Hofmann, then professor in the Royal College of Chem-
istry, in Oxford street, London. Soon afterwards the important firm
of Simpson, Maull & Nicholson was founded at Hackney Wick—Nich-
olson being another of Hofmann’s pupils. Altheugh similar works
were erected in France and Germany, the main business remained in
English hands during perhaps twenty years. Meanwhile Dr. Griess,
chemist throughout his life to the celebrated brewers at Burton-on-
Trent, Messrs. Allsopp, was carrying on researches on diazo com-
pounds, which he had begun as a student in Germany—one of the
most remarkable series of scientific.researches ever made; but these
did not meet with full appreciation until 1876. In this year the firm of
Williams, Thomas & Dower, of Brentford, introduced certain azo colors
into the market which had been made in their works under the direction
of a most accomplished Swiss chemist, Dr. O. N. Witt, strictly in accord-
ance with Griess’s prescriptions. The importance of the step thus
taken was not fully apparent here, but it was in Germany. Dr. Caro, a
member of the now world-renowned Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik,
near Mannheim on the Rhine, who had formerly been chemist to Rob-
erts, Dale & Co., in Manchester, the personal friend of Griess, had
been working in the same direction as Witt, and his firm shortly after-
wards brought out azo colors similar to those manufactured by the
English firm. This time the seed had fallen upon fruitful soil; the
Germans were theoretical as well as practical, and at once saw that
the application of Griess’s discoveries was likely to be productive of
practical consequences. They largely increased their scientific staff,
research became the business of the works, and the industry expanded
at an extraordinary rate, while the English manufacturers, remaining
unteachable, and having no proper scientific staff in their employ, were
simply snuffed out.

And the story has yet another side. You have all heard of the turkey-
red or madder dyes, formerly obtained from the madder plant, which
was very largely grown in France, Holland, and Turkey. In 1868, two
German chemists prepared alizarin, which is the chief constituent of
madder, artificially from anthracene, a substance contained in coal tar.
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. 749

Now, Perkin, when a student with Hofmann, had worked with anthra-
cene, and seeing the practical importance of the discovery, again set
to work and anticipated Graebe and Liebermann in the discovery of
a process of manufacturing alizarin. He at once began to make it
artificially. His works prospered, and during several years the produc-
tion of artificial alizarin was an English industry. But Perkin made
the unfortunate “ English” mistake of working almost single-handed.
The Germans, meanwhile, were silently but steadily working in their
characteristic manner, studying every detail, and soon came to the
fore and became masters of the situation.

Perkin’s business is now continued as the British Alizarin Company.
The conditions under which this firm is working are Somewhat peculiar,
and such as to procure for it considerable advantages, but the success
which has attended its labors is sufficient to show that such an indus-
try might be carried on with special advantage in this country if organ-
ized in the proper spirit. Several years ago I had the opportunity of
visiting the works shortly after I had inspected the most fully equipped
factory of the kind in Germany, and I was agreeably surprised to find
that the English works were distinctly in advance of their continental
competitors, being able to deal economically with larger quantities.
But whereas here the anthracene-color industry is much as it was,
abroad it has expanded in various important directions which are prov-
ing highly remunerative, whilst the original madder dyes, although
produced in larger quantity than ever, are made at slight profit, owing
to the excessive competition that has arisen.

Now artificially made dyes have all but displaced natural coloring
matters, indigo excepted, even among so conservative a people as our
Indian subjects, and the industry is of enormous ipiportance, although
not tous. Weare so much behindhand in the race that there is little
chance of our regaining a good place in the list of runners, even if we
go fully into training with that object.

And not only dyestuffs are made from coal tar. A whole list of
substances of the greatest value in medicine are also now prepared
from raw materials derived from tar; some of these have proved to be
most efficient substitutes for quinine, and the growth of cinchona bark
in India and Ceylon has consequently ceased to be the remunerative
pursuit it was. All such substances have been the outcome of
researches carried out in the German universities, or in the still more
highly equipped laboratories of the German chemical works. More-
over, of late years nature’s perfumes have one after the other been
forced to disclose their character to the pertinacious inquirer, and have
been claimed as victims by the chemical manufacturer abroad, although
here again the example was first set by Perkin, who in 1868 showed
how coumarin, the odoriferous principle of the Tonka bean, might be
artificially prepared.

If we seek to understand our early success as well as our later failure
750 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

in the branch of industry of which I have been speaking, it is not
difficult to trace the former to Hofmann’s influence and the latter to
our want of appreciation of the inestimable value of the services of
such a man. In this connection, I may be allowed to quote from my
presidential address to the Chemical Society in 1894 the following pas-
sage in reference to the then recently published memoir by Dr. Caro on
the development of the coal tar color industry:

‘No those who can understand it, the story told by Caro is nothing
less than an epic, but it is one the contemplation of which must in
many wayssadden an Englishman, elevating though it be when regarded
from the purely scientific pointof view. Full and complete recognition
of Hofmann’s services to the industry characterizes every page of the
monograph, and the only ground of complaint which some of us feel
that we have against the writer is that his own great services are
nowhere referred to. Wherever they received their early training, the
true education which experience in the world alone gives was gained
by both Hofmann and Caro while in the service of English masters;
and it is an interesting problem for speculation whether, had they
remained with us, our position would not have been a different one.
Germany could scarcely have accomplished what it has done without
them, but by years of patient labor her universities had laid a broad
and solid foundation on which alone such men could build. Here, such
men had neither brick nor mortar offered to them either by the universi-
ties or manufacturers, and such is our disregard of theory in this country
of ‘practical men,’ that we even now have not learned the lesson which
the contemplation of the success of German chemical industry teaches;
shall we ever learn it properly? in London, at all events, we shall
probably wrangle during years to come about the establishment of a
university worthy of the greatest city in the world, which will set an
example and help us again to do our fair share of the work which has
been taken from us; and it will be years, apparently, before English
manufacturers will all learn to spell the word ‘‘chemist”—and that 1t will
acquire some meaning for them. Butitis much to be feared that recan-
tation may come too late, and that the opportunity will have been lost.
America, perhaps, will meanwhile have learned the lesson also, and the
competition we shall have to meet will not be European alone; we have
not only to go ahead as fast as others, but to make up for much lost
time, and it is not likely that others will calmly stand by while we make
the attempt.

‘Such is the lesson which we may derive, it seems to me, from the
study of Hofmann’s career and the attendant circumstances; and it is
one which we in this society must take very deeply to heart.”

At the present day, no matter what his business, the German manu-
facturer seeks to understand every detail, and he is always trying to
improve his processes. He attains this end by availing himself very
fully of the services of men trained scientifically at the university, men
who have all served their apprenticeship in the school of research: in
fact, no man who has not been so trained is looked at nowadays by the
German manufacturer.

In proof of this, I may quote words used by Dr. O. N. Witt, now
professor of chemical technology in the Berlin Royal Technical High
School, the most important institution of its kind in the world, in his
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. 751

report to the German Government as their commissioner at the Chicago
Exhibition in 1893. Says Dr. Witt:

“What appears to me to be of far greater importance to German
chemical industry than its predominant appearance at the Columbian
World’s Show is the fact which tinds expression in the German exhibits
alone, that industry and science stand on the footing of mutual deepest
appreciation, one ever influencing the other. By affording proof that
this is truly the case, Germany has given an indisputable guaranty of
the vitality of its chemical industries.”

Our policy is the precise reverse of that followed in Germany. Our
manufacturers generally do not know what the word “ research” means;
they place their business under the control of practical men, often
admirable men in their way, possessed of much native wit, but untrained
and therefore too often and necessarily unprogressive; and such men
as a rule actually resent the introduction into the works of scientifically
trained assistants. Hence there is no demand here for men who have
been carefully trained as investigators; consequently our schools do
not seriously attempt to train investigators. In this country such peo-
ple are only born and grow spontaneously, the high class manufactured
article is made in Germany alone. We elect to sacrifice at the altars of
the examination fiend, for god he can not be called, and do our best to
discourage the development of originality.

Let me give an illustration to make my meaning clearer. Recently
I met a friend who has not only distinguished himself by his intelligent
eriticism of a particular industry, but has become so interested in it
that, having means at his disposal, he has himself become a manufac-
turer, affording a rare illustration of enterprise. I said: “I trust you
are going to work on German lines and engage a good chemist to sys-
tematically study your material, and so ascertain how its properties
vary with its composition; for I have reason to think from direct expe-
rience that much is to be learned in this way which will make it possible
to put the manufacture on a scientific basis.” His ready answer was:
“Oh, ve got to make the business a commercial success!” Of course
I understood what he meant while I felt that he could not fathom my
meaning—he was too much an Englishman to do that. No doubt he
will place his business in the sole charge of a practical man, and as
long as it suffices to look only at the surface he will succeed; but then,
not improbably, the Japanese will come in and beat him, for they have
shown the world that they can organize as well as appreciate scientific
method.

Or, to give another example showing what may be accomplished under
English conditions by adopting foreign methods, let me refer to work
done by Mr. Mond, so well known in this country on account of the
skill he has shown in developing Solvay’s ammonia-soda process. Mr.
Mond has long been engaged in seeking for a solution of the problem—
how to burn fuel electrically, in such a manner, that is to say, as to

directly produce electricity instead of heat. Having improved the gas
152 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

battery devised in 1842 by the present Sir William Grove, in which
hydrogen is burnt electrically, he was anxious to obtain a method of
preparing hydrogen readily in large quantities. No good method is
known, but a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic oxide is easily made,
and even Mond found that on passing this mixture over heated nickel
the carbonic oxide was converted partly into carbon and partly into
carbondioxide, and as the latter was easily removable, he thus suc-
ceeded in a measure in effecting his object.

In studying the very remarkable action which nickel had on ear-
bonic oxide, it so happened that on one occasion when experiments
were being made in his laboratory the escaping gas was led into the
flame of a burner so as to set fire to it, a necessary precaution, as the
gas is highly poisonous; it was noticed that instead of burning as
usual with a nonluminous smokeless flame it burnt with a slightly
luminous flame. This strange circumstance led to inquiry being made,
and it was eventually ascertained that the metal nickel, under certain
conditions, combined with the gas carbonic oxide, forming a very
volatile colorless liquid, and thus one of the most remarkable dis-
coveries of modern times was made. The discovery was communicated
to the Chemical Society in 1890 by Mr. Mond in conjunction with his
assistants, Drs. Langer and Quincke. Having observed that the com-
pound was very readily broken up into carbonic oxide and nickel, Mr.
Mond at once set to work to devise a practical method of preparing
nickel on a large scale from its ores through the agency of the new
compound, and after spending not only much time and labor, and I
believe also a very great deal of money, on his quest, was successful in
devising a process which he has carried out on the large scale during
several months past, and which has enabled him to produce over a ton
of metallic nickel of almost absolute purity per week—perhaps the
greatest achievement in metallurgy on record. Such action on the part
of a native-born English manufacturer is ‘ unthinkable,” at least I
know of no precedent which would justify us in regarding it as possible
under present conditions. I only recently heard of a firm who are
doing work of a most important and eritical character, involving the
expenditure of a very large amount of money, who, having asked an
expert whether it would not be well to carefully observe the tempera-
ture at which their operations were conducted, on being advised that
it was most important to do so, objected that an instrument for the
purpose, costing £25, was too expensive to use. The foreign worker
would seek to know what happens at any cost.

If the English nation is to do even its fair share of the work of the
world in the future, its attitude must be entirely changed—it must
realize that steam and electricity have brought about a complete revo-
Jution; that the application of scientific principles and methods is
becoming so universal elsewhere that all here who wish to succeed
must adopt them, and therefore understand them. It rests with our
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. 153

schools to make the change possible. To repeat what I said in 1894
in the presidential address before referred to:

“There can be no question that the future of this country is very
largely in the hands of its schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, and
there are many among us who are convinced that our progress is much
hindered by their failure to feel the pulse of the times—who think,
indeed, that they do not suitably prepare the material which we sub-
sequently are called on to mold into its final shape. We look to the
new commission to recommend drastic changes which will enable us to
utilize to the full the marvelous ability latent in the English race, and
which will help parents in solving the truly terrible problem with which
they are confronted in these days of unreasoning and unreasonable
competition when the time comes to secure a career for their children.
English boys and girls at the present day are the victims of excessive
lesson learning, and are also falling a prey, in increasing numbers year
by year, to the examination demon, which threatens to become by far
the most ruthless monster the world has ever known either in fact or
in fable. Ask any teacher who has to do with students fresh from
school his opinion of them, he will say that in the great majority of
cases they have little if any power of helping themselves, little desire
to learn about things, little if any observing power, little desire to
reason on what they see or are called on to witness; that they are des-
titute of the sense of accuracy and satisfied with any performance how-
ever slovenly; that, in short, they are neither inquisitive nor acquisitive,
and as they too often are idle as well, the opportunities offered to them
are blindly sacrificed. A considerable proportion undoubtedly are by
nature mentally very feeble, but the larger number are by no means
without ability, and are in fact victims of an acquired disease. We
must find a remedy for this state of things or perish in the face of the
terrific competition now setting in.

“Boys and girls at school must be taught from the very earliest
moment to do and to appreciate. It is of no use our teaching them
merely about things, however interesting—no facts must be taught
without their use being taught simultaneously; and, as far as possible,
they must be led to discover the facts for themselves. Instead of our
placing condensed summaries in their hands, we must lead them to use
works of reference and acquire the habit of finding out; they must
always be at work applying their knowledge and solving problems. It
is a libel on the human race to say, as many do, that children can not
think and reason, and that they can only be taught facts; early child-
hood is the time at which these faculties are most apparent, and it is
probably through failure to exercise them then that they suffer atrophy.
The so-called science introduced into a few schools in answer to the
persistent demands of its advocates has been in most cases a shallow
fraud, of no value whatever educationally. Boys see oxygen made
and things burnt in it, which gives them much pleasure; but, after all,
this is but the old lesson learning in an interesting shape, and has no
Superior educational effect. I would here repeat what I have recently
urged elsewhere, that in the future all subjects must be taught scien-
tifically at schools, in order to inculcate those habits of mind which are
termed scientific habits; the teaching of scientific method—not the
mere shibboleths of some branch of natural science—must be insisted
on. No doubt some branch of chemistry, with a due modicum of phys-
ics, etc., is the subject by means of which we may, in the first instance,
best instill the scientific habits associated with experimental studies,

sm 95——48
(54 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

but it must be the true chemistry of the discoverer, not the cookery-
book-receipt pseudoform which has so long usurped its place. What-
ever be taught, let me repeat that mere repetition work and lesson
learning must give place to a system of allowing children to do things
themselves. Should we succeed in infusing the research spirit into our
teaching generally, then there will be bope that, in the course of a gen-
eration or so, we Shall cease to be the Philistines we are at the present
time; the education given in our schools will be worthy of being named
a ‘liberal education,’ which it never will be so Jong as we worship the
Old World classical fetish, and allow our schools to be controlled by
those who reverence this alone, having never been instructed in a
wider faith.”

And what are schools such as this todo? Should they not also teach
in the same spirit? As the secondary education commissioners point
out—education must ever become more practical—a means of forming
men (and they should have added, and women) not simply to enjoy life,
but to accomplish something in the life they enjoy.

To this end, every school, I believe, whether in this metropolis or
elsewhere, must work out its own salvation; and we must not look for
payment on results, or countenance examinations which reduce all to
one dead level.

When Professor Ayrton and I were appointed the first professors of
the City and Guilds of London Institute—he having cut his educational
teeth in the service of the Japanese and I having been largely made in
Germany—we found ourselves in complete agreement that we would
have nothing to do with teaching for examinations. Those who after-
wards became our colleagues in the estabiishment of the Finsbury
Technical College, my friends Mr. (now Sir Philip) Magnus and Profes-
sor Perry fully shared this view, and we all saw that a big problem in
education lay before us which we could only work out if we had complete
liberty of action, and the committees we had to do with never for one
moment questioned this—all honor to them. I am proud to say that
the programmes of the guild’s colleges have never been disfigured by
references to examinations as objects to be kept in view by students,
and I venture to think that when the time comes to consider without
prejudice the services which the city guilds have rendered to the cause
of education, it will be admitted that they, more than any other body,
have shown true appreciation of English needs. It is worth while not-
ing that although it has never been a coaching college, the Finsbury
Technical College has always been overfull, which disposes of the
assertion that the bait of an examination Tage necessarily be held out
as an attraction.

But what have the polytechnics done? To what extent have they
made a clean beginning in all subjects; and to what extent have
they been suborned to worship at the examination shrine to earn the
unholy money bribe called payment on results?

I am told that the latter course is adopted in some cases, not because
it is felt to be the right one, but because it would not do for Polytechnic
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. 155

B to appear behind Polytechnic A in regard to the number of cer-
tificates gained—governors might object! Unfortunately, we know
that such arguments are held, that quantity counts for more than qual-
ity. The English manufacturer can appreciate a big order, but will
not undertake to carry out a small one; and here the foreigner steps
in, and having made a beginning, gradually improves his position until
finally he is left in practical possession of the field. Perhaps if we
attended more to quality in education there would soon be a large
increase in its quantity. A large proportion of those who at present
come forward to be prepared belong to Professor Herkomer’s great
class of those who ought not to be taught at all. Among these are the
certificate hunters brought into existence by school boards and other
authorities. There is more than sufficient work to be done among those
who are deserving and capable.

To quote Professor Herkomer: ‘‘No system could act more perni-
ciously on the morals than payment on results. A few schools have
through their strong masters and in some cases strong local help
shaken off all the trammels of danger. The fact is, it has all grown
into an unwieldy piece of machinery with all the deadening effect of
impersonality in teaching. The whole system, when it is not practically
upset by a strong and independent master, is lifeless, humdrum, and,
above all, soul-deadening. It is the despair of the masters and the
disappointment of the brighter pupils.” To all which I say, Amen!

The system was established at a time when the many schools to
which I have referred were unknown, and it was largely because the
desired result was not obtained under the system that these new schoois
became necessary and were founded. How futile, then, must be any
attempt to base the instruction in these new institutions on discredited
methods—such old wine can not be put into such new bottles. Time
does not allow of my fully discussing this matter. I can only point
out that the programmes of instruction on which the examinations are
based are of such a nature as to make real instruction impossible—
even if no other objection could be raised, the extent of ground to be
gone over is So great as to make cram an absolute necessity. We have
to bear in mind that Germany has prospered without such examina-
tions; Japan also. I believe China is the only country in which a simi-
lar system meets with national support. Recent events do not encour-
age us, however, to derive any consolation from this circumstance.

As Professor Herkomer points out: ‘Granted that the Kensington
system was of use once upon a time, and that without it schools of art
would not have been established at all, we must look the matter straight
in the face and acknowledge that we have now-arrived at a point when
it must change its form in order to fulfill a great duty and to be of use,
or else be disbanded.” Undoubtedly this is so, and is as equally true
of science as of art. The department has at last perforce itself recog-
nized the necessity of change, but all too slowly, and by appointing a
756 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

certain number of inspectors has in a measure initiated a new policy.
The very distinguished scientific man who is the director of science, in
his evidence before the Royal Commission on Secondary Education,
openly stated indeed that if he had his way he would entirely substi-
tute inspection for examination in the elementary stage; but it is to be
feared, unfortunately for the country, that in this, as in most other
cases, one swallow does not make a summer.

Professor Herkomer insists that in the future freedom of action must
be given to each master—to each town. This independence, he says,
is to be obtained only by municipal and county council aid. ‘ Emanci-
pation from the apron strings of Kensington through municipal and
county council support would produce an individuality,” we are told,
‘in the art of each town,” for which I may substitute, in the way in
which science was taught and applied in each town.

But we must be careful that in leaving the science and art frying
pan we do not jump into a worse municipal fire, of which there is
clearly some danger; for while all the world is engaged in decrying
examinations, our county council is bent on devising new ones.
Scholarships at times are of great value to students, provided they
fall into the right hands, and are obtained as well as held under right
conditions. But it is easy to give too many scholarships, and still
more so to give them to the wrong persons. Unless the examinations
are placed in very competent hands, not only will a serious injury be ©
done to our general system of education by leading those who are
preparing boys and girls to adopt methods which it is unwise to follow
in schools and to unduly force on their pupils, but the wrong people
may be selected; the growth of a class of overtrained pot hunters
may be encouraged instead of a vigorous, keen-witted, observant, and
resourceful race. Those who prove themselves the most apt scholars
under the tutelage of the crammer, however able as desk workers,
may in the end entirely disappoint the hopes of those who desire most
to encourage the development of ability. Huxley has said much as to
the importance to the nation of catching the potential Faraday, but it
is doubtful whether such would ever shine in a competitive examina-
tion in which among other tasks they were asked to write an essay on
Oliver Cromwell, or some other like topic equally remote from the
daily experience of a healthy lad. If we depend too much on examina-
tions we may easily select the unfittest for the work of the world, and
unless very careful we are almost bound to select but one kind of

_ability—clerical rather than practical ability; unless, indeed, we alto-
gether change our system of school education, and examine very
differently.

It is also difficult to understand what is to be gained by examining
candidates for £5 evening scholarships; it must prove to be a very
expensive mode of distributing such doles, and it ought to be possible
to find some other more practical way of selecting those whose studies
would be materially promoted by such a grant.
THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION. €5¢

Clearly, therefore, it is essential that we should not lose sight of the
fact that an exceedingly complex educational system is now growing
up under the influence of men who, for the most part, are in no sense
experts, and have but little knowledge of the details of such work,
although possessed with the desire in every way to do service to the
community and to improve our national position. It therefore behooves
all who can follow such work to keep most careful watch on the march
of events; otherwise those who seek to benefit may in the end do
irreparable injury; the present is a most critical period in our history,
and such watchfulness is imperatively demanded of us.

J have ventured on this digression because so much depends on the
foundation laid at school, as technical studies can only be satisfactorily
engaged in by those who have been well trained from the beginning.

As Professor Herkomer says, the kind of individuality to be devel-
oped in each town—or in the case of our huge metropolis, in each
district--will vary according to the necessities of the community. In
future each polytechnic in London must seek to ascertain what special
work it can do to greatest advantage, instead of all following one
example, as is too much the case at present. In words almost exactly
those of my artist colleague: “This is the only way in which schools
will obtain a direct influence over the industries of the country; and
the influence will be the right one when the master is carefully selected,
because it will be the school around a man and not a man struggling
to be master in the midst of a system of impersonal teaching, where
every student is expected to be squeezed into a great educational
mangling machine.” ‘Choose your master carefully,” he says, ‘but
then let him be master, and he will soon, with freedom of action, vary
his forms of tuition according to the idiosyncrasy of each student, or
the necessities of his immediate locality. The one true prize to be
worked for would be individual progress. All teaching must be on a
personal basis.”

Choose your master carefully—this is indeed good advice. But this
implies, of course, that those who have to choose know how; that they
have some standard before them. Have they? Results seem to show
that they rarely have. In this matter, as in many others, IL believe,
the City and Guilds of London Institute has set a good example by
selecting men known to be capable of doing research work, and a large
amount of research work has been done in its colleges. I am not aware
that, excepting in the case of the principal of this polytechnic, capacity
to undertake research work has been regarded as a qualification; on
the contrary, for I know that when it was urged at one of them that a
particular candidate had exceptional qualifications of this kind, the
answer was: “We want a man to teach, not to do research.” But
the work of true education is pure research; really good teachers are
engaged in nothing else, being constantly occupied in studying their
pupils’ idiosynerasies and in devising suitable methods of instruction.
The “researcher” is the equivalent of the artist; the teacher who can
758 THE PLACE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION.

not engage in research is the equivalent of the inartistic copyist. No
subject is at a standstill in these days—all progress involves research,
although not always original research. The young child, even, is con-
stantly engaged in research, and the habit is only gradually lost at
school under our highly dev sloadl modern, soul-killing system of per-
petual lesson-learning, itself largely devised to sales a system of
payment on results.

Let us hope, therefore, that every board of governors will soon learn
to appreciate the national importance of research, and will require
evidence from every candidate for a teacher’s post of ability in this
respect. When such is the case, the research spirit will prevail also
amongst students generally.

A most desirable example has been set in this direction by what, I
suppose, may fairly be termed the least pretentious of the London poly-
technies—that in the Borough road—which, with the assistance of the
Leather Sellers’ Company, has just opened a branch tanning school at
Harolds Institute, Bermondsey, and with unblushing effrontery, one
may say, prints on the programme under “Tanning School” the words,
‘with special research laboratory,” and not content with this, informs
us on the next page that “the special research laboratory is fitted up
and supported by the worshipful company of leather sellers”—all hail
to the leather sellers, let us say. An industry which makes such a new
start, very late though it be, and recognizes the fact that research can
help it out of its difficulties, is phenomenal in this country, but on the
high road to retain its position if not to improve it.

Iwas much struck at the opening of the school by a statement made
by the chairman, Mr. Lafone, M. P., who told us of an American cus-
tomer who was in the habit of buying large quantities of a particular
kind of leather here, of then taking it to America and manufacturing
it, returning the goods here for sale. This man had remarked to him,
he said, ‘‘that he had seen all our works and did not care a fig for our
competition, for we had not even begun to know how to make the
best.” The introduction of the research spirit is sorely needed to cure
such an Old World state of affairs as this.

Of course, whenever I advocate research in this way, and urge that
the research spirit must be infused into all our teaching as well as into
our national life, I am told it can not be done—that children can not
solve problems. But there is a saying that an ounce of practice is worth
a pound of theory; it is only a half truth, and a saying which is often
misappled, but it consoles me somewhat on such oceasions. I have
done it during the past fifteen years, since the opening of the Finsbury
Technical College. No one has the right to say that it can not be done
until they have tried; all who really try will succeed; those who do
not should not attempt to teach.
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.!

By THEODORE GILL.

Ih

The history of scientific progress has been marked by a few periods
of intellectual fermentation when great bounds have been taken for-
ward and a complete revolution ensued. Very few have been such,
but in one the name of Huxley must be ever conspicuous. It was as
a lieutenant of the organizer of that revolution that he appeared, but
unquestionably without him it would have been long delayed, and it
was through his brilliant powers of exposition that the peoples of the
English-speaking lineage soon learned to understand, to :ome extent,
what evolution was and, learning, to accept it.

On the 4th of May, 1825, was born the infant Huxley, in due course
christened Thomas Henry. ‘It was,” Huxley himself has remarked,
“a curious chance that my parents should have fixed for my usual
denomination upon the name of that particular apostle with whom I
have always felt most sympathy.” In his physical and mental pecul-
iarities, he was completely the ‘son of his mother,” whose most distin-
guishing characteristic was “rapidity of thought;” that characteristic
Huxley claimed to have been passed on to him “in full strength,” and
to have often “stood him in good stead,” and to it he was undoubtedly
indebted for success in the many intellectual duels he was destined to
be engaged in. His “regular school training was of the briefest,” and
he has expressed a very poor opinion of it. His early inclination was
to be a mechanical engineer, but he was put to a brother-in-law to
study medicine. The only part of his professional course which really
interested him was physiology, which he has defined as “the mechan-
ical engineering of living machines.” ‘The only instruction from which
he thought he ever obtained the proper effect of education was that
received from Mr. Wharton Jones, who was the lecturer on physiology
at the Charing Cross School of Medicine. At Mr. Jones’s suggestion,
in 1845, Huxley communicated to the Medical Gazette (p. 1340) his first

paper “On a hitherto undescribed structure in the human hair sheath.”
Two years later he contributed to the British Association for the
Advancement of Science the first paper generally attributed to him,
“Hxamination of the corpuscles of the blood of Amphioxus.” (Ab-
stracts, p. 95.) In 1845 he passed the first M. B. examination at the
London University. Soon afterwards he was admitted into the med-
ical service of the navy and was, after some waiting, assigned to the
Rattlesnake, and for four years (1846-1850) served on her during her
exploration of the Australasian seas; he was, he supposed, among the
last voyagers ‘‘to whom it could be possible to meet with people who
knew nothing of firearms—as [they] did on the south coast of New
Guinea.”

While on board Huxley zealously prosecuted zoological investiga-
tions, and in 1849 and 1850 sent records of various observations, in
papers which were published in the Philosophical Transactions and
Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Most important of all was
a monograph on the Oceanic Hydrozoa, published by the Ray Society.
It is amusing to find that while in Sydney he was impressed by Mac-
Leay and lead to believe that “there is a great law hidden in the
‘Circular system’ if we could but get at it, perhaps in Quinarian-
ism, too,”! but sober sense doubtless soon came to the rescue and he
appears to have been never otherwise touched by the strange mono-
‘mania that had been epidemic in England during the previous quarter
century. In1851 he becamea F.R.S. He continued in the navy three
years after his return, but in 1853 resigned when ordered to sea again.

In 1853 Huxley and Tyndall became candidates for professorships in
the University of Toronto, but that university preferred others for the
vacant places and thus missed the opportunity of an age. In 1854
Huxley was appointed to the post of lecturer on natural history in the
School of Mines, which he held for the next thirty-one years. In the
same year he became Fullerian professor in the Royal Institution.
“The first important audience [he] ever addressed was at the Royal
Institution.” In 1862 he served as president of the biological section,
and in 1870 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science
itself; in 1869 and 1870 of the Geological and Ethnological Societies,
and in 1883 to 1885 of the Royal Society. He was inspector of salmon
fisheries from 1851 to 1885.

In 1876 he visited the United States and delivered an address at the
opening of the Johns Hopkins University.

In 1885 failing health and desire for freedom led him to retire from
most of his offices, and thenceforth he devoted himself chiefly to literary
work rather than to scientific investigation. On the accession of Lord
Salisbury to the premiership in 1892, Huxley was made privy counselor,
and with it came the title of Right Honorable, by which he was later
Styled. In the last years of life he resided at Hodeslea, Eastbourne, and

after a long illness (‘complication following insien Za” ') died there on
the 29th of June, 1895.

Such were the principal episodes in the life of Huxley. Many more
details may be found in the numerous periodicals of the day, and in
some of them are depicted various phases of his character and labors.
The short time that is at our disposal to-night may be most profitably
and entertainingly utilized in reviewing his feats as a warrior of science
and estimating the measure of influence he exercised in diverting human
thought from the ruts in which it had moved for centuries and direct-
ing it into a highway where increasing light from different sides could
guide the wayfarer. Although this period of warfare was at its height
not further back than the early afternoon of the present century, and
some of us here assembled joined in the fray, to the younger naturalists
it is an unknown past except through history, and to some of us who
were of it, it is so strange as to recur to us rather as a dream than as
a realized passage in actual life.

II.

Doubtless man, almost from the moment of his acquisition of those
characters which distinguish him as representative of the genus Homo,
had wondered and speculated as to how he came into being and how the
animals assembled round him had sprung into existence. Those early
concepts must have been strange, indeed, but were doubtless trans-
mitted from mother to child, only with some eccentricities lopped off
with advancing intelligence. Gradually, among peoples of the Aryan
stock at least, they crystallized into a doctrine that in the beginning
there was chaos, that the three elements of air, water, and earth were
differentiated, and that animals were successively created to occupy the
spaces. Such were the views of the old oriental cosmologists and
such of the later Romans as epitomized in Ovid’s verse. These ideas
were long regnant and naturalists embodied some in their schemes,
most accepting the idea that animals may have been created in pairs,
but a few (such as Agassiz) urging that they must have been created in
communities approximating to those still found. There were very few
to dissent from these views of specific creation, and those few had little
influence on the popular beliefs. But as the present century advanced,
curious men delved into all the mysteries of nature; the sciences of
morphology, physiology, histology, embryology, geology, and zoogeogra-
phy came into being, and facts were marshaled from every side that mil-
itated against the old conceptions. Even when these sciences were
inchoate, or new born, sagacious men had perceived the drift of the facts
and anticipated induction by the formulation of hypotheses of evolution,
but the hypotheses were too crude to insure acceptance. Meanwhile,
however, the facts accumulated, and in 1859 a factor determining the

762 HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.

course of development of species was appreciated by Darwin and Wal-
lace, and soon applied to a wide range of facts in the former’s Origin
of Species by means of Natural Selection.

Darwin’s work at once aroused great popular interest, but it was toe
diffuse and the intellectual pabulum it contained was too strong and
indigestible for ordinary readers, and it is probable that the general
acceptance of the Darwinian form of evolution would have been delayed
much longer than it was had it not been for the excursions from the
scientific fold into the popular arena by one having the confidence of
the former and the ear of the latter, as did Huxley.

Scarcely had Darwin’s work come from the press when Huxley com-
menced his missionary work. Almost exceptional among numerous
reviews, remarkable chiefly for crudity, ignorance, and arrogance, was
one that appeared in the great daily organ of English opinion, The
Times, marked by superior knowledge, acuteness of argumentation, and
terse and vigorous style. This review, which attracted general atten-
tion, was acknowledged later by Huxley. Lectures and addresses
before popular audiences, and even to those distinctively claiming to
be “workingmen,” followed, and these were published or supplemented
by publication in various forms. Answers, critiques, and other articles
in reply came out in rapid succession, and loud clamor was made that
Huxley was an infidel and a very bad man, and that he falsified and
misrepresented in a most villainous manner.

A memorable occasion was the meeting of the British Association for
the Advancement of Science in the year 1860, following the publication
of the Origin of Species. A discussion of the subject was precipitated
by the presentation of a communication by our own Draper, ‘On the
intellectual development of Kurope with reference to the views of Mr.
Darwin and others that the progression of organisms is determined by
law.” The reverend Mr Cresswell and the reverend Dr Wilberforce,
Bishop of Oxford, followed in opposition, and they were answered by
Huxley. Thescene has lately been redescribed by a great physiologist
and friend of Huxley, who is one of the few witnesses who now remain.
“The room was crowded, though it was Saturday, and the meeting was
excited. The bishop had spoken; cheered loudly from time to time
during his speech, he sat down amid rapturous applause, ladies waving
their handkerchiefs with great enthusiasm; and in almost dead silence,
broken merely by greetings which, coming only from the few who knew,
seemed as nothing, Huxley, then well-nigh unknown outside the narrow
circle of scientific workers, began his reply. A cheer, chiefly from a
knot of young men in the audience, hearty but seeming scant through
the fewness of those who gave it, and almost angrily resented by some,
welcomed the first point made. Then as, slowly and measuredly at
first, more quickly and with more vigor later, stroke followed stroke,
the cirele of cheers grew wider and yet wider, until the speaker’s last
words were crowned with an applause falling not far short of, indeed
casi

HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 7163

equaling that which had gone before, an applause hearty and genuine
in its recognition that a strong man had arisen among the biologists of
England.”

The versatile bishop indulged in the argumentum ad hominem so
very trite and familiar to us all ( who has not heard it?) he would like
“to hear from Mr. Huxley whether it was by his grandfather’s or
grandmother’s side that he was related to an ape.”

Huxley replied and answered: ‘“Tasserted, and I repeat, that a man
would have no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for a grand-
father. If there were an ancestor whom I[ should feel shame in recall-
ing it would be a man; a man of restless and versatile intellect who,
not content with an equivocal success in his own sphere of activity,
plunges into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaint-
ance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric and distract the atten-
tion of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions
and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.”

The arguments adduced against evolution during those days were
sometimes very comical, and the confident air of the upholder of the
ancient views and the assurance with which he claimed that his posi-
tion was fixed and that the burden of proof rested entirely upon the
advocate of the opposite view were very amusing. It was urged that
no one had ever seen one species turn into another. Had anyone ever
seen any animal made? Could anyone really conceive of any animal
being actually made? Did an omnipotent Creator actually take the
“dust of the ground” and mold it into animal shape and then breathe
into its nostrils “‘the breath of life?” ‘Did-infinitesimal atoms flash
into: living tissues?” Certainly no physiologist with a competent
knowledge of histology could believe in any such mode of creation.
On the other hand, everyone that could exercise the necessary skill
could follow the evolution of an animal from an undifferentiated proto-
plasmic mass into a perfect animal. A clutchof eggs could be succes-
sively taken from a mother hen or a hatching oven, and day after day
the actual evolution of the undifferentiated matter into derivative
functional parts could be followed. That which is true of the hen is
true of man, only in the latter case it is more difficulf to obtain the
requisite material and greater skill to use it is requisite. Compare
the embryos developing in the hen and human eggs and at first no dif-
ference except size and environment can be perceived. Compare them
in successive stages, and adult animals more or less parallel to some
early stages may be found still living or entombea in earlier formations
of the earth in fossilized form.

It was argued that no one had ever seen one species turn into
another. But is it not a matter of historical evidence that many
breeds of domestic animals have actually been developed by the agency
of man and propagate their kind? And how are such breeds distin-
guished from species except by the fact that we know their origin, and
764 HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.

that they have come into prominence through selection by man rather
than by nature? Interbreeding is no criterion.

But it is unnecessary to go into details, and these hints are offered
only because their bearings on the subject were so generally over-
looked by those who opposed evolution. One opponent, so eminent as
to be styled the “ pope” of a great Protestant Church, published a
work against evolution largely based on the contention that the exist-
ence of the eye, except through direct creation, was inconceivable.
Yet this very evolution of the eye from simple protoplasm could have
been witnessed at any time with little trouble in the hen’s egg. Is
evolution through great reaches of time more inconceivable than
actual evolution capable of daily observation ?

Well and skillfully did Huxley meet the arguments against evolu-
tion. Even most of the old naturalists sooner or later recognized the
force of the arguments for and the weakness of those against evolu-
tion. Those who did not in time gave up the contest with their lives.
The young who later entered into the field of investigation have done
so as evolutionists.

It is interesting to recall that the illustrious American (Professor
Dana) who recently departed so full of years and honors, and of whom
you have heard from a former speaker (Major Powell) to-night at
length, in the full maturity of his intellect, accepted unconditionally
the doctrine of evolution and dexterously applied it in his last great
work.

Til.

Darwin, in his Origin of Species, had refrained from direct allusion
to man in connection with evolution and many casual readers were
doubtless left in uncertainty as to his ideas on the subject. Naturally,
the scientific man recognized that the origin of his kind from a pri-
mate stock followed, and believed that Darwin’s reticence was prob-
ably due to a desire to disturb popular beliefs as little as possible.
When we recall what strange views were held respecting man’s origin
and relations we can understand how the unlearned could easily fail to
recognize that man must follow in the chain of his fellow-creatures.
(We preserve creature still as a reminiscence of ancient belief, but
without the primitive conception attached to the word.)

Man was claimed as a being isolated from animals generally, and
naturalists of acknowledged reputation and one or two of great fame
more or less completely differentiated him from the rest of the animal
kingdom and even from the animal kingdom itself.

As long as the isolation of man from the animal kingdom, or from
the greater part, was based on metaphysical or psychological ideas,
the naturalist perhaps had no cause of quarrel, although he might
wonder why a morphologist should stray so far from the field of obser-
vation. But when naturalists confused morphological and psycholog-
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 765

ical data, he had reason to protest. ‘This confusion was effected by one
of great eminence. There was no naturalist in Britain about the mid-
’ dle of the century who enjoyed a reputation equal to that of Richard
Owen. An anatomist of preeminent skill and extraordinary industry,
his merits had been appreciated by the entire world. An opinion of
his had a weight accorded to no others. Consequently a new classifi-
cation of the mammals, published by him in 1857, soon became popular.
This classification was founded on alleged characters of the brain and
on successive phases of increase in the cerebrum. Man was isolated
not only as the representative of a family, but of an order and a subelass.

According to Owen, ‘‘in man the brain presents an ascensive step in
development, higher and more strongly marked than that by which the
preceding subclass was distinguished from the one below it. Not only
do the cerebral hemispheres overlap the olfactory lobes and cerebel-
lum, but they extend in advance of the one and farther back than the
other. Their posterior development is so marked that anatomists have
assigned to that part the character of a third lobe. It is peculiar to the
genus Homo, and equally peculiar is the ‘posterior horn of the lateral
ventricle,’ and the ‘hippocampus minor,’ which characterize the hind
lobe of each hemisphere. The scperficial gray matter of the cerebrum,
through the number and depth of the convolutions, attains its maxi-
mum of extent in man. Peculiar mental powers are associated with
this highest form of brain, and their consequences wonderfully illus-
trate the value of the cerebral character.”

The views thus expressed by Owen were reiterated on various occa-
sions, but many anatomists dissented from them, and the rumbling of
a future storm was betokened. At last the storm cloud broke, and
Owen was overwhelmed. At a great popular assemblage at Oxford,
on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, Owen once more urged his contention of the
cerebral characteristics of man, and maintained this wide difference
from the apes.

Huxley immediately rose and, with that cogency of reasoning which
characterized him, proceeded to divest the subject of the sophistries
in which it had been enveloped. ‘‘The question,” he said, ‘‘appeared
to him in no way to represent the real nature of the problem under
discussion. He would therefore put that problem in another way.
The question was partly one of facts and partly one of reasoning. The
question of facts was, What are the structural differences between
man and the highest apes?—the question of reasoning, What is the
systematic value of those differences? Several years ago Professor
Owen had made three distinct assertions respecting the differences
which obtained between the brain of man and that of the highest
apes. He asserted that three structures were ‘peculiar to and char-
acteristic’ of man’s brain, these being the ‘posterior lobe,’ the ‘ pos-
terior cornu,’ and the ‘hippocampus minor.’ In a controversy which

766 HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.

had lasted for some years Professor Owen had not qualified these asser-
tions, but had repeatedly reiterated them. He (Professor Huxley), on
the other hand, had controverted these statements; and affirmed, on
the contrary, that the three structures mentioned not only exist, but
are often better developed than in man, in all the higher apes. He
(Professor Huxley) now appealed to the anatomists present in the sec-
tion whether the universal voice of Continental and British anatomists
had not entirely borne out his statements and refuted those of Pro-
fessor Owen. Professor Huxley discussed the relations of the foot of
man with those of the apes, and showed that the same argument could
be based upon them as on the brain; that argument being that the
structural differences between man and the highest ape are of the
same order, and only slightly different in degree from those which
separate the apes one from another. In conclusion, he expressed his
opinion of the futility of discussions like the present. In his opinion
the differences between man and the lower animals are not to be
expressed by his toes or his brain, but are moral and intellectual.”
The appeal to anatomists was answered on the spot. The foremost
anatomists of England there present (Rolleston and Flower) succes-
Sively rose and indorsed the affirmations of Huxley. Not one supported
Owen, and, brilliant as his attainments were, his want of candor
entailed on him the loss of his eminent place, and Huxley took the
vacated throne. But the contest that resulted in Owen’s overthrow
was of great service, for in the chief centers of civilization anatomists
eagerly investigated the question at issue, and the consequence was
that in a few years more material had been collected and studied than
under ordinary conditions would have been done in five times the
period. Unlike other battles, one in scientific warfare is almost always
advantageous to the general cause, whatever it may be to a party.

JE

The first important memoir by Huxley was written in his twenty-
third year On the Anatomy and the Affinities of the Family of the
Medus (Phil. Trans., 1849, pp. 413-434, pl. 37-39), and contained the
germ of a fundamental generalization. He therein laid “particular
stress upon the composition of [the stomach] and other organs of the
meduse out of two distinct membranes, as,” he says, ‘I believe that
is one of the essential peculiarities of their structure, and that a knowl-
edge of the fact is of great importance in investigating their homologies.
I will,” he continues, ‘call these two membranes as such, and inde-
pendently of any modification into particular organs, ‘toundation
membranes’” (p. 414). In his summary (p. 425) he also tormulates
“that a medusa consists essentially of two membranes, inclosing a
variously shaped cavity, inasmuch as its various organs are so com-
posed.”

I have thus given Huxley’s own words, inasmuch as Professor
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 167

Haeckel has asserted that Huxley therein “directed attention to the
very important point that the body of these animals is constructed of
two cell layers—of the éctoderm and endoderm—and that these, physio-
logically and morphologically, may be compared to the two germinal
layers of the higher animals” (Nature, 1874), and Professor Kowalevsky
has also claimed that Huxley “founded modern embryology by demon-
strating the homology of the germinal layers of vertebrates with the
ectoderm and endoderm of ccelenterates.” (Nature, October 31, 1895,
p. 651.)

In all candor, I must confess that, important as the generalization of
Huxley for the Medusz was, it was only applied by him to the Medusz,
and was not necessarily extensible with the homologies indicated, but
it was pregnant with suggestiveness, and to that extent may have led
to the wider generalization that followed. Let all possible credit then
be assigned to it.

The classification of animals generally adopted, and in this country
especially, up to at least the early years of the present half century,
was based on what was called plan or type, and was mainly due to
Cuvier. According to this school, there were four “ ¢reat fundamental
divisions of the animal kingdom,” and these were ‘ founded upon dis-
tinct plans of structure, cast, as it were, into distinct molds or forms.”
The term generally used to designate this category was branch or sub-
kingdom, and the subkingdoms themselves were named vertebrates,
mollusks, articulates, and radiates. Various modifications of this sys-
tem and more subkingdoms were recognized by many zoologists, but
the one specially mentioned was in very general use in the United
States because favored by Agassiz, who then enjoyed a great reputa-
tion. Almost all naturalists of other countries, and many of this,
recognized the distinctness, as subkingdoms or branches, of the Pro-
tozoans and ceelenterates. But Huxley, in 1876, went still further and
segregated all animals primarily under two great divisions based on
their intimate structure, accepting for one the old name, Protozoa, and
for the other Haeckel’s name, Metazoa.

‘“‘ Among those animals which are lowest in the seale of organization
there is a large assemblage which either present no differentiation of
the protoplasm of the body into structural elements, or, if they pos-
sess one or more nuclei, or even exhibit distinct cells, these cells do
not become metamorphosed into tissues—are not histogenetic. In all
other animals the first stage of development is the differentiation of
the vitellus into division masses, or blastomeres, which become con-
verted into cells, and are eventually metamorphosed into the elements
of the tissues. For the former the name Protozoa may be retained;
the latter are coextensive with the Metazoa of Haeckel.”

While not exactly original with Huxley, the recognition of these two
great categories of the animal kingdom was hastened among natural-
ists, and found place in most of the works by men of authority that
7168 HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.

followed. That such recognition greatly facilitates morphological con-
cepts is certain. But most of the further new features of this classifi-
cation have not received the approbation of naturalists generally.

V.—THE VERTEBRATE THEORY OF THE SKULL.

Germany’s great poet, Goethe, was ‘passionately devoted to the
natural sciences,” but was ‘‘induced by the habit of his mind to search
for the general truths which give life to the dry bones of detail.” In
the Jewish cemetery of Venice, a broken sheep’s skull came under his
notice and he thought he recognized that it was made of modified ver-
tebre. Another German, Oken, in the Hartz mountains, “ stumbled
upon the blanched skull of a deer,” and he was inspired with the idea
that “it is a vertebral column.” Oken immediately proclaimed his idea
tothe world. It found acceptance in many places and England’s great
anatomist, Richard Owen, took it up and carefully elaborated a new
form of it. Owen’s modifications, dubbed the “‘ archetype” of the skele-
ton, became popular in Britain and America, and elements of the skull
were described in terms indicating that they were ‘‘ homotypes” with
appendages of vertebra, the nasals, for example, being styled the
neural spines of the nasal vertebra, the premaxillary the hemal spine
of the same vertebra, and the dentary of the lower jaw the hemal
spine of the frontal vertebra. But still more fanciful was the termi-
nology for the limbs, the anterior being allocated to the occipital ver-
tebra, and the scapula regarded as a pleuropophysis, the coracoid as a
hemapophysis, and the limb itself as a “‘ diverging appendage.”

Strange as this conception may appear to the young who have only
been educated in modern methods, it had attractions for some, as I can
testify from personal experience. When a boy I made an enlarged
copy of the diagram republished in Carpenter’s Physiology and colored
the neurapophyses blue and the hemapophysesred. Later reflection led
me to the conclusion that an ‘‘ archetype” should be more or less real-
ized, and if it were not, it had no place in nature. As the Owenian
archetype was at most only distantly approximated by specialized
fishes, it could not be a true archetype of the vertebrate skeleton as
such, however near it might represent the typical fish skeleton. Doubt-
less others were led by similar reasoning to discard the Owenian ideas,
yet they continued in favor among many.

But in 1858, in a lecture on the Croonian foundation before the Royal
Society, with Owen himself in the chair, Huxley discoursed ‘on the
theory of the vertebral skull,” and conclusively showed the inconsist-
ency of the archetypal conception with the facts of embryology and
development. After a recapitulation he confessed that he did “not per-
ceive how it is possible, fairly and consistently, to reconcile these facts
with any existing theory of the vertebrate composition of the skull,
except by drawing ad libitum upon the Deus ex machina of the specu-
lator—imaginary confluences, ‘connations,’ ‘irrelative repetitions,’ and
shiftings of position—by whose skillful application it would not be
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 769

difficult to devise half a dozen very pretty vertebral theories, all equally
true, in the course of a summer’s day.” He naturally reached not only
“the negative conclusion that the doctrine of the vertebral composition
of the skull is not proven,” but “the positive belief that the relation of
the skull to the spinal column is quite different from that of one part
of the vertebral column to another.”

The blow thus dealt against the Owenian archetype was a serious one,
and it was nearly coincident with the growing adoption of the doctrine
of evolution and the overthrow of the doctrine of types and patterns.
At any rate, the old idea of the vertebration of the skull became an
idea of the past. Owen.continued to preach it, but his disciples
abandoned it, and he was soon left without a single notable follower.

VI.—CLASSIFICATION OF GANOID FISHES.

The designation of Ganoidei was originally given by Agassiz to a
heterogeneous group of fishes distinguished by a covering of what were
called ganoid scales and having no other common characters; some of
its representatives even lacked the “‘ ganoid” scales. But most of the
extinct species, at least, were really structurally affiliated and such
were segregated by Johannes Miiller in a comparatively natural group
distinguished by cerebral, cardiac, and intestinal peculiarities, and for
this group was retained the Agassizian term Ganoidei. its constituents
were contrasted under two subordinate groups named Chondrostei and
Holostei. The families of the latter group were evidently related in
various degrees, but such degrees were not expressed in the arrange-
ment of the families, and the families themselves were mostly defined
by superficial characters of little value. The appointment of Huxley
to the professorship of natural history in the Government School of
Mines led him to investigations which culminated in a “ Preliminary
_ Essay upon the Systematic Arrangement of the Fishes of the Devonian
Epoch” (1861), and “ Illustrations of the structure of the Crosstopery-
gian Ganoids” (1866). He proceeded ‘to reconsider the whole question
of the classification of the fishes of this epoch, and, eventually, to arrive
at results which seem to necessitate an important modification of the
received arrangement of the great order of Ganoidei.” He recombined
the Chondrostei and Holostei, and then distributed the aggregate
(which he designated as an order) into five suborders in the following

The chief merit in this arrangement is the appreciation of the close-
ness of the relations between the extinct fishes of the groups now rec-
ognized as Dipnoans and Crossopterygians, and the anticipation, by
a kind of intuition, of part of the truth as now recognized. The
‘‘suborder Crossopterygide” of Huxley is really a compound of the
subclasses or superorders of Dipnoans and Crossopterygians. The dis-
tinctive characters of the two were not recognized, and the author
even failed to appreciate the exact relations of the living and extinct
Dipnoans, or that, in fact, many of his Crossopterygide are really
Dipuoans.' In his Anatomy of the Vertebrates (1871), even he retained
his arrangement of the ‘“‘Ganoidei,” which were placed as the fourth
order of fishes, and considered the ‘‘ Dipnoi” after the Teleostei and as
the sixth order of fishes. He failed even to find any extinct Dipnoans,
and concluded his observations on the group with the statement that
“It is a remarkable circumstance that, while the Dipnot present, in so
many respects, a transition between the piscine and the amphibian
types of structure, the spinal column and, the limbs should be not only
piscine, but more nearly related to those of the most ancient Crossop-
terygian Ganoids than to those of any other fishes.”

The Polypterini, Saurodipterini, Glyptodipterini, and Ccelacanthini are alone
regarded as ‘‘ Crossopterygii” by recent palichthyologists, the Ctenodipterini and
Phaneropleurini being regarded as ‘‘ Dipnoi.”

*It may not be out of place for me to remark here that even earlier, in 1861, than
the publication of Huxley’s paper, I had recognized the sommon characters of the
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. Ce

Finally, in 1876, Huxley published, as ‘No. 1” of ‘Contributions to
Morphology,” a memoir “On Ceratodus forsteri, with observations on
the classification of fishes.” He still persisted in separating the recent
Dipnoans from the extinct forms combined with the Crossopterygide,
and contended that “even Dipterus, which approaches Ceratodus and
Lepidosiren so closely in its dentition and in the form of its fins, is far
more similar to Polypterus and Amia in other respects; and there is at
present no reason to believe that any of the Crossopterygian Ganoids
possessed other than a hyostylic skull, or differed from Polypterus in
those respects in which Polypterus differs from the existing Dipnoi. All
known Crossopterygians have jugular plates, of which there is no trace
in the Dipnoi.” .

It will be thus seen that the suborder of Crossopterygidie was really
the result of a misunderstanding and included most Dipnoans (and to
such extent was a synonym for that group) as well as the Crossopteryg-
ians of later authors. It was by no means the exact equivalent of
Crossopterygians, and consequently the latter name can not be consid-
ered aS a Synonym of Crossopterygide or be replaced by it. Neverthe-
less the introduction of the so-called suborder was not only the expres-
sion of an advance in our knowledge of the system itself, but paved
the way for future investigators.

I am even inclined to credit mainly to his sagacity the early appreci-
ation of the affinity of the Neoceratodus of Australia to the mesozoic
Ceratodontids with all the far-reaching consequences that appreciation
involved. It was in 1870 that the living Ceratodontid was introduced
to the scientific world as Ceratodus forsteri, and thus generically associ-
ated with the mesozoic fishes. How did Krefft (or Clarke) get the idea
of this association of a living fish with some known only from fossil
teeth referred by Agassiz to the same family, as the Cestraciont sharks?
In 1861 Huxley published his Preliminary Essay upon the Systematie
Arrangement of the Fishes of the Devonian Epoch, and therein sug-
gested that Ceratodus was a Ctenodipterine fish and ranged it (with a
mark of interrogation) by the side of Dipterus. Healso drew “attention
to the many and singular relations which obtain betwecn that wonder-
ful and apparently isolated fish, Lepidosiren,” and the Ctenodipterine

Dipnoi and Polypteroids, and for that reason combined the two in the subclass
Ganoidei. In a discussion of the subject (Cat. Fishes N. Am., p. 15), I remarked
that ‘‘Milne-Edwards again urges as a previously neglected argument in favor of
the amphibian nature of Lepidosiren, the opening of the ductus pneumaticus of the
pulmonary sacs into the ventral face of the digestive canal. But we also find a
similar arrangement in the species of the genus Polypterus, animals whose piscine
character and affinities have never been called in question;” also, “It is a fact of
no little interest that the Polypteri, which have an air bladder so similar to that of
the Lepidosirenes, do also, of all known fishes, most resemble them in the form and
development of the different elements of the brain.” They differ, however, in car-
diac and osteologic characters. I concluded that ‘‘as the Dipnoi agree in all other
essential respects with the Ganoids, we will then at least provisionally consider
them as belonging to the same great subclass.”
V2 HUXLEY AND HIS WORK.

fishes. (The exact truth was not discovered, but was approximated.)
Is it not probable that this memoir was known to Clarke, who claimed
to have suggested to Krefft the systematic relations of the newly discov-
ered Australian Dipnoan? It was creditable to both Clarke and Krefft
that they did recognize this relationship and profited by their biblio-
graphical knowledge, but it is doubtful whether they would have been
able to make the identification or appreciate the importance of the
discovery had not Huxley partly prepared the way. By this discovery,
our acquaintance with the ichthyic faunas of both the present and past
was almost revolutionized.

VII.

To the casual observer none of the terrestrial backboned animals
appear to be less related than birds and reptiles. As Huxley remarks,
“to superficial observation no two groups of beings can appear to
be more entirely dissimilar. - - - Placed side by side, a humming
bird and a tortoise, an ostrich and a crocodile offer the strongest con-
trast, and a stork seems to have little but animality in common with
the snake it swallows.” <A difference in habits appears to be associated
with the difference in form. The activity and freedom of the bird con-
trasts with the lethargy and restriction in range of the tortoise—the
warm body of the former with the cold mass of the latter. The birds
are looked upon as inhabitants of the air, the reptiles as degraded to
crawling on the earth. The popular conclusions were to a considerable
extent adopted by the scientific, and for a long time the birds and mam-
mals were associated together as ‘‘ warm-blooded ” in contradistinction
to the reptiles and other vertebrates, which were designated as ‘ cold-
blooded.” This classification was in vogue in England when Huxley
reopened the question as to the relative affinities of the vertebrates,
and in 1864 claimed that the classes of that division ‘“‘are capable of
being grouped into three provinces—(1) the Ichthyoids, comprising
Fishes and Amphibia; - - - (2) the Sauroids, - - - compris-
ing Reptiles and Birds; and (3) the Mammals.' - - - The Sauroids
(afterwards called ‘“Sauropsida”) agree in having ‘a single occipital
condyle, a complex mandibular ramus articulated to the skull by a
quadrate bone, nucleated blood corpuscles,” and thus differ from the
mammals, which have “a well-developed basi-occipital - - -; a
simple mandibular ramus articurated with the squamosal and not with
the quadratum, with mammary glands and with red non-nucleated blood
corpuscles.”

In 1868 Huxley directed his inquiries ‘on the animals which are
most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles.” ”

The differences between the recent members of the two classes are

HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 773

indeed many. The question, then, was How far can this gap be filled
up by a reference to the records of the life of past ages?

‘“The question resolves itself into two:

““(1) Are any fossil birds more reptilian than any of those now living?

“‘(2) Are any fossil reptiles more bird-like than living reptiles?

Both of these questions Huxley found “must be answered in the
affirmative.”

The remains of Archzeopteryx found in the “lithographic slate of
Solenhofen” furnished a bird with decided reptilian characters—so
prominent, indeed, that some of the paleontologists of the period
claimed that the animal was a reptile rather than a bird.

The remains of various Dinosaurians of Mesozoic times yielded rep-
tiles with characteristics manifest only among the birds of the present
epoch. Such characteristics were especially exemplified in details of
structure of the hind limbs. One of the Dinosaurians—Compsogna-
thus—was so much like a bird in the legs that ‘it is impossible to
doubt that it hopped or walked, in an erect or semierect position, after
the manner of a bird, to which its long neck, slight head, and small
anterior limbs must have given it an extraordinary resemblance.”

From the vantage ground of the present, with its increased stores,
we may justify Huxley’s “hope” that he had redeemed his ‘‘ promise to
show that in past times birds more like reptiles than any now living
and reptiles more like birds than any now living did really exist.”
There is now even a tendency to regard the differences remaining
between the birds and reptiles as of less than class value, and to com-
bine both groups in one and the same class—Sauropsida. The first to
propose such a union was Professor Cope, who had even to some extent
_ anticipated Huxley in the recognition of the similarity between the
Dinosaurians and birds. The fact that two such men independently
arrived at similar conclusions is significant as evidence for their truth.
But there is danger of pushing a truth to the extreme of itself deceiv-
ing. There is still a great gap between any known reptile and any
known bird. Huxley concluded with the caution that, ‘‘as we possess
hardly any knowledge of the terrestrial reptiles of [the Triassic] period,
it may be regarded as certain that we have no knowledge of the ani-
mals which linked reptiles and birds together historically and genetic-
ally, and that the Dinosauria, with Compsognathus, Archeopteryx, and
the struthious birds, only help us to form a reasonable conception of
what these intermediate forms may have been.” This cautious state-
ment is as apt for the present time as that in which it was expressed.”

One of the most persistent prejudices that has influenced the progress
of zoological taxonomy has been (perhaps still is) a belief in the import-
ance of superficial adaptation of structure for lifein the water contra-
distinguished from life ontheland. This prejudice was long impressed

on ornithology. The birds with feet adapted for swimming by the
development of webs between the toes or for wading by elongation of
the legs were set apart from those fitted mainly for progress on land
or through the air: in other words, from those having negative char-
acters in such respects. The major subdivisions of those groups, too,
were almost solely distinguished by superficial characters of little
importance, such as the form of the bill, the character of the claws,
and the combinations of toes. Variations in such trivial characters,
which in other classes of vertebrates would be esteemed of little sys-
tematic value, were assigned ordinal rank. Comparative anatomy,
too, was almost entirely neglected in the classification of birds; even
most anatomists were content to limit their observations to simple
irrelative details or to interject them into the framework of existing
arrangements. Such was the state of ornithology in 1867 when Hux-
ley published, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London,
a memoir ‘On the classification of birds, and on the taxonomic value
of the modifications of certain of the cranial bones observable in that
class.” In this he discarded the characters generally used and allowed
himself to be influenced by the modifications to be found in the skele-
ton without reference to the habits or habitats of the birds. He
reduced the orders to three—the Saurure (extinct), the Ratitze, and
the Carinate. The last, including almost all the living forms, were
divided into primary groups defined by modifications of ‘‘the bones
which enter into the formation of the palate.” ‘ Four different
modes” were recognized and were “called, respectively, the Dromcog-
nathous, Schizognathous, Desmognathous, and Afigithognathous arrange-
ment” (p. 425). It was urged that ‘these cranial characters may
safely be taken as indications of natural affinities” (p. 454), and Huxley
proposed ‘‘to regard these divisions as suborders, and to name them
Dromeognathe, Schizognathe, Desmognathe, and digithognathe (p. 456).
The last three suborders were divided into groups with the termina-
tion -morphe, as Aitomorphe (Raptores), Psittacomorphe (Psittaci),
etc., not taxonomically designated, but essentially equivalent to ‘‘ super-
families.” The Algithognathous “‘Coracomorphe” corresponded with
the ‘“‘Passeres” as limited by recent naturalists, and Huxley was
‘disposed” to divide it “into two primary groups, one containing
Menura, and the other all the other genera.” How the immense agere-
gate represented by all thé 6ther genera were to be subdivided Huxley
did not venture to decide, but he leaves the impression that he had
little respect for the numerous “families” which had been recognized
by most ornithologists.

The value of this work consisted chiefly in disturbing the old classi-
fications and calling attention to the proper method of investigation.
Much of it, nevertheless, appears to have been of permanent value,
and most of the superfamilies at least have been recognized as natural
assemblages, although still generally given ordinal or subordinal rank

and endowed with older names. The memoir at least gave an impulse
in the right direction—morphological as opposed to teleological—and
has incited to many elaborate investigations to the great advantage of
ornithology.

Much doubt had existed respecting the nature of the non-mammalian
ancestors of the mammals. It was supposed by some that they must
have been reptiles related to the Dinosaurians, but the specialized
characteristics and high development of that type forbade the belief
that they were in the direct line of descent. Of course the birds
which agreed with the mammals in the possession of a quadrilocular
heart, complete circulation, and warm blood must even more positively
than the Dinosaurians be excluded from the line of descent. The
problem of what was the genealogy of the highest class of animals was
at last attacked by Huxley. In several memoirs,' published in 1876,
1879,? and 1880,° he examined the evidence and formulated his con-
clusions. ‘Those conclusions were expressed in the following terms:

“Our existing classifications have no place for [the] submammalian
stage of evolution (already indicated by Haeckel under the name of
Promammale). It would be separated from the Sauropsida by its two
condyles, and by the retention of the left as the principal aortic arch;
while it would probably be no less differentiated from the Amphibia by
the presence of an amnion and the absence of branchiz at any period
of life. I propose to term the representatives of this stage Hypotheria;
and I do not doubt that when we have a fuller knowledge of the ter-
restrial vertebrata of the later palzozoic epochs, forms belonging to
this stage will be found among them. Now, if we take away from the
Hypotheria the amnion and the corpus callosum, and add the functional
branchize—the existence of which in the ancestors of the mammalia is
as clearly indicated by their visceral arches and clefts as the existence
of complete clavicles in the ancestral Canide is indicated by their ves-
tiges in the dog—the Hypotheria, thus reduced, at once take their place
among the Amphibia, for the presence of branchiz implies that of an
incompletely divided ventricle and of numerous aortic arches, such as
exist in the mammalian embryo, but are more or less completely sup-
pressed in the course of its development.

“Thus I regard the amphibian type as the representative of the next
lower stage of vertebrate evolution; and it is extremely interesting to

observe that even the existing Amphibia present us with almost every
degree of modification of the type, from such forms as the oviparous,
branchiate, small-lunged Siredon and Menobranchus, which stand in the
same relation to it as Gymnura to the Eutheria, to the exclusively air-
breathing Salamanders and frogs, in which the period of intraovular
development, either within the uterus itself or in special receptacles,
may be as much prolonged as it is in the mammalia.

“A careful study, on full materials, of the development of the young
of such forms as Hylodes will probably throw great light on the nature
of the changes which ended in the suppression of the branchize and
the development of the amnion and of the extra-abdominal part of the
allantois in the fcetus of the higher vertebrata.”

During the intervening years no discoveries of fossil forms substan-
tiating these inferences have been discovered. Among the ancient
vertebrates now known none appear to be more nearly allied to the
mammals than certain Permian animals representing a special order
named by Cope Theromorpha or (later) Theromora. As early as 1878
“the order Theromorpha was regarded by Professor Cope as approxi-
mating the mammalia more closely than any other divisicn of reptilia,
and as probably the ancestral group from which the latter were de-
rived.”! These views were subsequently developed in greater detail,?
and appear to be entitled to much consideration. In this connection
it may be added that the difference between Huxley and Cope is less
than the terms in which they have been stated might seem to indicate.
The gap between primitive amphibians and reptiles is by no means as
great as between the modern types, and it may be doubted whether
the ancestors of the mammalian stock were members of the specialized
order defined as Theromorpha. Neither of the philosophers may be far
out of the way.

Among the most important results of Huxley’s investigations were
the discovery and approximately correct recognition of the nature of
the “peculiar gelatinous bodies” found in all the seas, whether extra-
tropical or tropical, through which the Rattlesnake sailed, and which
were named Thalassicela, precursors of radiolarian hosts afterwards to
be brought to light, and the perception of the comparative affinities of
the southern forms of astacoidean crustaceans and their contrast as a
group with the forms of the Northern Hemisphere. I must resist the
temptation to further enumerate the great naturalist’s discoveries and
generalizations.

A few words on the nature of his work may be desirable. And here
it may be admitted that Huxley was rather a morphologist in a narrow

sense, or anatomist rather than a systematist of greatly superior
excellence. Unquestionably he did much excellent work in systematic
zoology, but the direct subject of investigation was perhaps treated
from too special a standpoint, and sometimes without an attempt to
coordinate it with the results in other fields, or to measure by some
given.standard. He was indeed a great artist, but he used his powers
chiefly to sketch the outlines of a picture of nature. This was done
with the bold and vigorous hand of a master, but his productions were
deficient in details and finish and were sometimes imperfect on account
of inattention to perspective and perhaps deliberate neglect of the
niceties of nomenclature. (And lest I may be misunderstood, let me
here explain that by systematic zoology I mean the expression of all
the facts of structure in a form to best represent the values of the differ-
ences as well as resemblances of all the constituents and parts of the
entire organization, from the cells to the perfected organs and the body
asa whole.) Kor example, he separated amphibians from reptiles and
combined them with fishes, and yet under the last name comprised the
Leptocardians and Marsipobranchs, and to his influence is doubtless
due to a large extent the persistence of English (but not American)
naturalists in a combination which is elsewhere regarded as contra-
dicted by all sound morphological doctrine.! The value of the char-
acters distinctive of the Rhynchocephalian reptiles and their consequent
significance for taxonomy and paleontology were also denied by him.
Nevertheless, even his negative position was of use in that it incited
investigation. The numerous memoirs on the anatomy and character-
istics of various groups of animals, too, were always replete with new
facts and the hints were almost always sagacious, even if not always in
exactly the right direction.

While the contest between the old and new schools of biological
philosophy was at its height, the former was almost entirely supported
by the religious element, and bitter were the invectives against evolu-
tion. The opposition was almost solely based on the ground that the
doctrine was in opposition to revealed religion. The naturally com-
bative disposition of Huxley was much aroused by this opposition,
and the antagonism early engendered was kept aglow during his entire
life. Meanwhileit had been discovered by many of the more sagacious
and learned clergymen that there was no real antagonism between the
seriptural account of creation and evolution, but that the two could be
perfectly reconciled. The reconciliation had been effected between
Genesis and astronomy and between Genesis and geology, and was
continued on the same lines for Genesis and evolution. But Huxley

own successor in the Royal College of Science, Professor Howes, and A. Smith Wood-
ward among systematic ichthyologists have recognized the heterogeneity of the old
class of fishes.

would have none of it. He gave expression to his convictions in the
following words:

“For more than a thousand years, the great majority of the most
highly civilized and instructed nations in the world have confidently
believed and passionately maintained that certain writings, which they
entitle sacred, occupy a unique position in literature, in that they pos-
sess an authority, different in kind, and immeasurably superior in weight,
to that of all other books. Age after age, they have held it to be an
indisputable truth that, whoever may be ostensible writers of the
Jewish, Christian, and Mohomedan Scriptures, God Himself is their
real author; and, since one of the attributes of the Deity excludes the
possibility of error and—at least in relation to this particular matter—
of willful deception, they have drawn the logical conclusion that the
denier of the accuracy of any statement, the questioner of the binding
force of any command, to be found in these documents is not merely a
fool, but a blasphemer. From the point of view of mere reason he
grossly blunders; from that of religion he grievously sins.

“But if this dogma of Rabbinical invention is well founded; if, for
example, every word in our Bible has been dictated by the Deity, or
even if it be held to be the Divine purpose that every proposition
should be understood by the hearer or reader in the plain sense of the
words employed (and it seems impossible to reconcile the Divine attri-
bute of truthfulness with any other intention), a serious strain upon
faith must arise. Moreover, experience has proved that the severity or
this strain tends to increase, and in an even more rapid ratio, with the
growth in intelligence of mankind and with the enlargement of the
sphere of assured knowledge among them.

“Tt is becoming, if it has not become, impossible for men of clear
intellect and adequate instruction to believe, and it has ceased, or is
ceasing, to be possible for such men honestly to say they believe that
the universe came into being in the fashion described in the first chap-
ter of Genesis; or to accept, as a literal truth, the story of the making
of woman with the account of the catastrophe which followed hard upon
it, in the second chapter; or to admit that the earth was repeopled with
terrestrial inhabitants by migration from Armenia to Kurdistan, little
more than four thousand years ago, which is implied in the eighth chap-
ter; or, finally, to shape their conduct in accordance with the conviction
that the world is haunted by innumerable demons, who take possession
of men and may be driven out of them by exorcistic adjurations, which
pervades the Gospels.”

So far even Huxley was not in disagreement with some of the most
eminent and learned of theologians. Those of you who are interested
will be able to recall utterances of enlightened clergymen which would
differ from Huxley’s only in the absence of the leaven of sarcasm that
permeates his lines. At a late congress of the Church of England,
held at Norwich, the reverend Canon and Professor Bonney gave voice
to words that convey the same ideas as Huxley’s.
HUXLEY AND HIS WORK. 719

“T can not deny,” he said, “‘ that the increase of scientific knowledge
has deprived parts of the earlier books of the Bible of the historical
value which was generally attributed to them by our forefathers. The
story of the creation in Genesis, unless we play fast and loose either
with words or with science, can not be brought into harmony with
what we have learned from geology. Its ethnological statements are
imperfect, if not sometimes inaccurate. The stories of the flood and of
the Tower of Babel are incredible in their present form. Some histor-
ical element may underlie many of the traditions in the first eleven
chapters of that book, but this we can not hope to recover.”

But Huxley was not content to deny any authority to the Scriptural
basis of most of the religions of Europe and America. He denied
that there was-any means of knowing what the future had in store.
He did not deny that there was a heaven or a hell; he did not deny
that in a future world man might continue in a sublimated state, and
might be punished for his misdeeds or rewarded for the good deeds he
had performed and for good thoughts on earth. He did not venture
to express any opinion on the subject for the reason that he had no
data to base an opinion upon. He called himself an agnostic and the
attitude he assumed was agnosticism.

This term agnostic, we are told by Mr. hk. H. Hutton, was suggested
by Professor Huxley at a party held previous to the formation of the
now defunct Metaphysical Society, at Mr. James Knowles’s house on
Clapham Common, one evening in 1869, and was suggested by St.
Paul’s mention of the altar to the unknown God— Ayrvwore@ be.

But Huxley has explained that he assumed this term in contradis-
tinction to the gnostic of old. The gnostic claimed to know what in
the nature of things is unknowable, and as Huxley found himself with
an exactly opposite mental status, he coined a word to express that
antithetical state—agnostic.

I have done all I conceive to be necessary in giving this statement
of Huxley’s attitude. Whether he was right or wrong, each one must
judge for himself or herself. Believing as he did, on a bed of pro-
longed illness he resignedly awaited the inevitable, and desired that
his sentiments reflected in verse by his wife should be engraved on his
tomb.

“And if there be no meeting past the grave,
If all is darkness, silence, yet ’tis rest.
Be not afraid, ye waiting hearts that weep,
For God ‘still giveth his beloved sleep,’
And if an endless sleep he wills—so best.”

By GEORGE M. STERNBERG, M. D., LL. D.,

Surgeon-General, United States Army.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I am to speak to you of the life and
achievements of one who has won imperishable renown by his valuable
contributions to human knowledge, and who has recently been buried
in the city in which his scientific labors have been prosecuted, with all
the honors which it was possible for a grateful people to confer. It is
certainly a happy augury for the future when the man of science, whose
_ achievements have been the result of painstaking and laborious work
in the laboratory, receives the grateful plaudits of his fellow-men dur-
ing his lifetime and the honors which were formerly only paid to civil
potentates or military heroes when his body is committed to the tomb.
It has been the fortune of few men to contribute so largely to the sum
of useful knowledge, and fewer still have lived to receive such ample
recognition of the value of their scientific work.

Pasteur’s success has been due to a combination of personal quali-
ties which especially fitted him for the pioneer work which he has done
in his chosen field of scientific investigation. With that penetrating
intellect and versatility of resource which constitutes genius, was com-
bined an energy and persistence of purpose, a disregard of accepted
theories not supported by evidence, and an appreciation of the value
of the experimental method as the only reliable means of arriving at
exact truth. No amount of conservative opposition intimidated him
when he announced results obtained by his carefully conducted labora-
tory experiments, and no false pride seduced him into maintaining a
position which he had once taken, if the experimental evidence was
against him. This rarely happened. But where is the man of science
who is infallible? Working in a new field, by methods largely of his
own devising, which were necessarily more or less imperfect at the
outset, it is surprising how few mistakes he made.

With his genius for scientific research, his indomitable perseverance,
and the forceful character which enabled him to defend his discoveries

so successfully, there must have been associated a kindly disposition,
for those who were closely associated with him in his laboratory work
were devotedly attached to him. He evidently had the faculty of
inspiring others with his enthusiasm for science, and their loyalty to
him and to their common mistress was rewarded by the frank acknowl-

edgment on his part of their share in the work accomplished. So far

as I am aware, he never showed any disposition to appropriate for him-
self credit due to another, whether that other was an associate or pupil
in his own laboratory, or one who was prosecuting his investigations
elsewhere. The speaker’s personal acquaintance with Pasteur is limited
to a memorable half day spent in his laboratory about ten years ago.
Although still disabled to some extent by paralysis, resulting from his
first apoplectic attack, he conducted me through his laboratory and
with the greatest kindness explained to me the methods in use and the
results recently accomplished in the lines of experimental work which
at that time occupied the attention of himself and his colleagues.

The time at my disposal will permit only a brief review of the life
and work of this illustrious savant; but this review will show that his
scientific achievements are of the highest order, and that the practical
benefits resulting from his labors have extended to all parts of the civ-
ilized world. He belongs not alone to France, but to science, and it is
eminently fitting that we should pay a tribute to his memory in this
capital city of a country in which his name is so well known and in
which the results of his scientific investigations are so highly appre-
ciated.

Louis Pasteur was born at Dole, a small town in the Department of
Jura, France, on the 27th of December, 1822; he died at his home in
Garches, a suburb of Paris, on the 28th of September, 1895..

Pasteur’s father had been a soldier in the army of Napoleon, but at
the time of his famous son’s birth was working at his trade as a tanner.
In 1825 the family moved to Arbois, a small town in the same depart-
ment, and here Louis Pasteur attended school at the college communal.
Later he was sent to the college at Besancon, where he took his degree
of Bachelier des Lettres. He subsequently entered the Ecole Normale
of Paris, and while there devoted himself to his favorite study—chem-
istry. Three years after joining the Ecole Normale he was appointed
assistant professor of physical science. In 1848 he was appointed pro-
fessor of physics at Dijon, and after a few months resigned his posi-
tion for the chair of chemistry in the University of Strasburg. In 1854
Pasteur was induced to accept the position of dean of the newly created
Faculty of Sciences at Lille, and in 1857 he returned to Paris as scien-
tific director of the Ecole Normale, where he had gained his first
scientific laurels. In 1862 Pasteur became a member of the Institute,
and in the same year he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and
chemistry in the Ecole des Beaux Arts. He was elected to the Acad-
emy of Sciences, taking the Fauteuil of Littré, in 1881. The same year

he received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. In 1874 the
National Assembly of France voted him a life pension of 20,000 francs
annually. Upon the anniversary of his seventieth birthday, Decem-
ber 27, 1892, he received from his compatriots a superb ovation at the
Sorbonne, which was attended by President Carnot, the members of
the French Institute, all foreign ministers and ambassadors then at the
French capital, and delegates from scientific societies in all parts of
the world. The Pasteur Institute, established in his honor, was inau-
gurated with proper ceremonies on the 14th of November, 1888. It is
situated in the rue Dutot, Paris, and is an imposing stone building in
the style of Louis XIII. It was built and equipped from a fund raised
by public subscription, amounting to 2,586,000 franes. Of this sum
200,000 franes was voted by the French Chambres Legislatif. After
the completion and equipment of the building more than 1,000,000
francs remained as a permanent endowment.

The time at my disposal will permit of but a brief review of Pasteur’s
scientific achievements. After having made some notable discove-
ries in chemistry his attention was attracted to the minute organisms
found in fermenting liquids, and .by a-brilliant series ot experiments he
demonstrated the fact that the chemical changes attending fermenta-
tion are due to the microscopic plants known as bacteria; also that dif-
ferent species give rise to different kinds of fermentation, as shown by
the different products evolved during the process. In prosecuting these
studies he discovered the species which produce lactic acid, acetic acid,
and butyric acid, and he added largely to our knowledge relating to
alcoholic fermentation and the class of micro-organisms to whichitis due.
He showed that in the absence of living organisms no putrefaction or
fermentation can occur in organic liquids, and that these low organ-
isms do not develop by spontaneous generation, as was at that time
generally believed, but have their origin from preexisting cells of the
same species, which are widely distributed in the atmosphere, especi-
ally near the surface of the earth. Various experimenters had shown
that a development of bacteria sometimes occurs in boiled organic liquids
excluded from the air. Pasteur showed that this was not due to spon-
taneous generation, but to the survival of the spores of certain species
of bacteria. These are able to resist a boiling temperature without loss
of vitality and reproductive power.

In 1865 the distinguished Irench chemist Dumas invited his former
pupil, Pasteur, to make investigations with reference to the cause and
prevention of a fatal malady among silkworms, which threatened to
destroy the siik industry of France. In the course of an investigation
which occupied several years, Pasteur succeeded in demonstrating the
nature of the infectious malady known as pébrine, the mode of its trans-
mission, and the measures necessary to eradicate it. Following his
advice the growers of silkworms succeeded in banishing the scourge,
and within a few years the industry was reestablished upon its former
profitable footing.
(84. PASTEUR.

This pioneer work led to further investigations with reference to the
cause and prevention of certain infectious diseases of the lower animals,
and especially to the fatal disease of cattle and sheep known as anthrax.
Having satisfied himself that this disease is due to a bacillus, which is
found in great numbers in the blood of infected animals, he demon-
strated by experiment that this bacillus rapidly loses its virulence when
cultivated in artificial media at a temperature of 42° to 48° C. Also
that animals inoculated with this ‘“‘attenuated” virus suffer a mild
attack of the disease, and that after their recovery they are immune
against future attacks, even when inoculated with the most virulent
material. This discovery has been applied practically, on an extensive
scale, in France, Austria, Switzerland, and other European countries.
The result of anthrax inoculations made by Pasteur’s method in France
during the past twelve years was summarized by Chamberland in 1894.
He reports the total number of animals inoculated during this period
as 1,788,677 sheep, and 200,962 cattle, and estimates the total saving
as the result of the inoculations as 5,000,000 francs for sheep and
2,000,000 franes for cattle.

Another infectious disease in which Pasteur’s method has been
employed with success is rouget or hog erysipelas. Chamberland states
that as a result of the protective inoculations practiced with Pasteur’s
vaccines the mortality from this disease in France has been reduced
from about 20 to 1.45 per cent. Hutyra reports that during a single
year (1889) 48,637 pigs were inoculated with Pasteur’s vaccines in
Hungary with a loss of 0.29 per cent, while the losses upon the same
farms in previous years averaged from 10 to 30 per cent.

But we must pass to that portion of Pasteur’s scientific work which
has most engaged the attention of the public. Pasteur first announced
his success in reproducing hydrophobia in susceptible animals by inocu-
lations of material obtained from the central nervous system in a com-
munication made to the Academy of Sciences on May 30, 1880. Con-
tinuing his investigations he reported, in 1884, his success in conferring
immunity against hydrophobia in nineteen dogs inoculated, in the pres-
ence of a commission appointed for the purpose, as a test experiment.
These animals had been rendered refractory by his method. The nine-
teen protected animals and nineteen control animals obtained from the
public pound without any selection were tested at the same time. The
test was made upon some of the animals of both series by inoculation
with virulent material upon the surface of the brain, and upon others
by allowing them to be bitten by rabid dogs, and upon still others by
intravenous inoculations. Not one of the protected animals developed
hydrophobia; on the other hand, three of the control animals out of
six bitten by a mad dog developed the disease, five out of seven which
received intravenous inoculations died of rabies, and five which were
trephined and inoculated on the surface of the brain died of the same
disease.
.

PASTEUR. 785

With reference to his first inoculations in man, Pasteur says:

“* Making use of this method, I had already made fifty dogs of various
racés and ages immune to rabies, and had not met with a single failure,
when, on the 6th of July, quite unexpectedly, three persons, residents
of Alsace, presented themselves at my laboratory.”

These persons were Theodore Vone, who had been bitten on the arm
on July 4, Joseph Meister, aged 9, bitten on the same day by the same
rabid dog, and the mother of Meister, who had not been bitten. The
child had been thrown down by the dog and bitten upon the hand, the
legs, and the thighs, in all in fourteen different places. Pasteur com-
menced the treatment at once, and had the satisfaction of reporting to
the Academy of Sciences in March of the following year (1886) that the
boy remained in perfect health. Since this time Pasteur institutes for
the treatment of hydrophobia have been established in all parts of the
civilized world, and the statistical reports published justify the belief
that when the treatment is instituted at an early date after the bite,
and is properly carried out, its protective value is almost absolute. At
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, 9,453 persons were treated during the
years 1886 to 1890, inclusive. The total mortality from hydrophobia
among those treated was considerably less than 1 per cent (0.61). In
1890, 416 persons were treated who had been bitten by animals proved
to be rabid, and among these there was not a single death. In 1891
the number of inoculations was 1,539, with a mortality of 0.25 per cent;
in 1892, 1,790, with a mortality of 0.22 per cent; in 1893, 1,648, with a
mortality of 0.36 per cent; in 1894, 1,587, with a mortality of 0.50 per
cent.

There has been and is still a considerable amount of skepticism among
members of the medical profession and others as to the practical
value of Pasteur’s inoculations for the prevention of hydrophobia;
and some physicians have even contended that the disease known by
this name is not the result of infection from the bite of a rabid animal,
but is a nervous affection due to fear. The time at my disposal will
not permit me to present for your consideration the experimental and
clinical evidence upon which I base the assertion that nothing in the
domain of science is more thoroughly demonstrated than the fact that
there is a specific infectious disease known to us as rabies, or hydro-
phobia, which may be communicated to man, or from one animal to
another, by the bite of a rabid animal, and that Pasteur’s inoculations
prevent the development of the disease in animals which have been
infected by the bite of a rabid animal or by inoculations with infectious
material from the central nervous system. This being the case, it is
evident that there is a scientific basis for Pasteur’s method of pro-
phylaxis as applied to man, and his published statistics give ample
evidence of the success of the method as carried out at the Pasteur
Institute in Paris and elsewhere. Great as have been the practical
results which have already followed Pasteur’s brilliant discoveries,

there is reason to believe that in the future stil more will be accom-
plished, especially in combating the infectious diseases of man. Havy-
ing pointed out the way, a multitude of earnest investigators in various
parts of the world are now engaged in laboratory researches relating
to the cause, prevention, and cure of infectious diseases. Already, in
the treatment of diphtheria and of tetanus with blood serum obtained
from immune animals, results have been obtained of the highest impor-
tance, and it seems probable that in the near future other infectious
diseases will be cured by a specific treatment based upon scientific
information obtained by those who have been following in the pathway
marked out by Pasteur, the illustrious pioneer in this line of research.

By 'T. C. MENDENHALL.

Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand, Baron von Helmholtz, was born in Pots-
dam on August 31,1821. In 1842 he received his degree in medicine at
Berlin, and entered the Government service as an army surgeon. In
1847 he published his essay on the Conservation of Energy. In 1849
he was appointed professor of physiology at Bonn. In 1851 he invented
the ophthalmoscope. In 1855 he was made professor of anatomy and
physiology at Bonn. In 1859 he was appointed to the same chair at
Heidelberg. In 1860 he was made one of the foreign members of the
Royal Society of London. In 1863 he published his great work on the
Sensations of Tone. In 1866 the first edition of his Physiological
Optics was completed. In 1871 he was made professor of natural
philosophy at the University of Berlin. In 1873 he received from the
Royal Society the highest distinction which it can bestow, the Copley
Medal; and in the same year the King of Prussia conferred upon him
the Order of Merit in Science and Art. In 1883 hereditary nobility
was conferred upon him by Emperor William I. In 1887 he assumed
the directorship of the great Physico-Technical Institute, founded by
the German Government at Charlottenberg. In 1891 the seventieth
anniversary of his birth was celebrated with great ceremony, and he
was placed at the head of the civil list by the German Emperor. In
1893 he visited America, serving as president of the International
Electrical Congress held in Chicago. In 1894, on September 8, he
died at the age of 73 years.

Such is the brief outline of the life of one of the most extraordinary
men of the present century. To perfect such a sketch in anything like
just proportions, or to attempt in the few minutes allotted to me to-
night to set forth anything like a fair estimate of the labors of one of
whom it inay be justly said that he was the most accomplished scholar
of modern times, is a task no one would seek. Nor can one easily
decline the honor which is carried by an invitation from a commission
representing the scientific societies of Washington to take partin so
memorable a commemoration as this. Under the circumstances, I must

confine myself to an exposition, all too brief, of a few only of the prin-
cipal contributions to human knowledge among the great number for
which the world is indebted to Professor Helmholtz. It was his dis-
tinetive characteristic that among the exponents of modern science he
stood quite alone in being really great along several lines. He was in
the beginning and always a pure mathematician of high type. Anato-
mists and physiologists claimed him for their own. During a few days’
stay in New York in 1893, after having presided over the International
Congress of Electricians, he was entertained by a distinguished sur-
geon, the leading eye specialist of the country, and ophthalmologists
flocked to do him honor as one of the founders of their profession.
When, in 1881, he gave the Faraday lecture before the Chemical Society
of London, the president of the society in presenting to him the Faraday
Medal, declared that eminent as was Helmholtz as an anatomist, a
physiologist, a physicist, and a mathematician, he was distinctly
claimed by the chemists. Nor were these onlyidle compliments. Only
a few days ago I happened on a most curious and interesting illustra-
tion of the unequaled extent of his scientific constituency in finding,
in a widely known journal published in London, his obituary notice
indexed under the heading, “The stage and music,” where his name
appeared accompanied by only that of Anton Rubenstein. His great
work on the Sensations of Tone and his analysis of the vowel sounds
of the human voice gave him a lasting fame among musicians.

Psychology as well as esthetics was benefited by his touch, but I
think it will be generally admitted that he was first of all, and more
than all else, a physicist. Indeed, it may be said that the best fruits of
his study of other branches of science grew out of the skill with which
he ingrafted upon them the methods of investigation for which we are
primarily indebted to the physicist.

When a boy he had acquired a fondness for the study of nature. His
father was a professor of literature in the gymnasium at Potsdam; his
mother a woman of English descent. Although he was encouraged in
the development of his youthful tastes as much as possible, the neces-
sity for earning a living directed his professional studies toward medi-
cine and he became a military surgeon. As a physiologist, he was led
to the study of ‘“‘ vital force;” his taste for mathematics and physics
forced him to the dynamical point of view, and his first great paper,
prepared before he was 26 years of age, was on the Conservation of
Energy. It is now nearly fifty years since this essay was presented to
the Physical Society of Berlin, and doubtless quite fifty years since it
was actually worked out. Its excellence is shown by the fact that if
rewritten to-day it would be changed only a little in its nomenclature.
Fifty years ago the great law of the conservation of energy, which will
ever be regarded as the most pregnant and far-reaching generaliza-
tion of this century, was so far from being known or recognized that
many of the ablest men of the time either regarded it as a “ fanciful
speculation”—or did not regard it at all.
HELMHOLTZ. 789

As a matter of ordinary mechanics, it had long been admitted that
no machine could create power, and as a part of that applied was
always lost or frittered away in friction the work coming out of a
machine must always be less than that put into it. The first great
advance had been made by an American, Benjamin Thompson, after-
wards Count Rumford, when he asked what became of that part lost
in friction and found his answer in the heat generated thereby, thus
proving that “heat was a mode of motion” rather than an “imponder-
able agent,” as it was rather ambiguously designated up to nearly the
middle of this century, but that all of the forces of nature were so
related to each other as to be interconvertible, and that the sum total
of all the energies of the universe was always the same, energy being
no more capable of creation or destruction than matter; these were
great facts, mere glimpses of which had been permitted to the physi-
cists of the early part of the century. Helmholtz was certainly one of
the first to completely grasp this splendid generalization, and not more
than two or three others stand with him in the credit which is due for
its complete proof and general acceptance. His first contribution had
the merit of being quite original in conception and execution, for he
then knew almost nothing of what others had done; he was entirely
ignorant of the important paper of his fellow-countryman, Mayer, and
knew only a little of Joule’s earlier work. The principle of the con-
servation of energy, which for a quarter of a century has been the
open sesame to every important advance in physical science, was not
then, to say the least, a popular topic. But for five or six years
a young Englishman named Joule, not yet 30 years old, had been
engaged with it and, from the point of view of the engineer, had made
it his own. On the 28th of April, 1847, he gave a popular lecture in
Manchester, where he lived and died, which was the first full exposi-
tion of the theory. A few weeks later Helmholtz read his paper in
Berlin. In England, even the local press refused to publish Joule’s
address, but finally the Manchester Courier, moved by the family influ-
ence (the elder Joule being a wealthy brewer), promised to insert the
whole as a special favor. In Germany the subject met with only a
little more favorable reception, and the leading scientific journal, Pog-
gendorff’s Annalen, declined to publish Helmholtz’s paper. Even at
the meeting of the British Association at Oxford a few months after
the Manchester address, when Joule again undertook the exposition
of his theory and his experimental proofs of it before what ought to
have been a more friendly audience, he was advised by the chairman
to be brief, and no discussion of his paper was invited. As Joule him-
self relates, his presentation of the subject would have again proved a
failure “if a young man had not risen in the section and by his intelli-
gent observations created a lively interest in the new theory.” This
young man was William Thomson, then 23 years old, now Lord Kelvin,
the foremost of living physicists.

doctrine, from that time until it was no longer in the balance, give evi-
dence alike of his extraordinary talents and his fine courage. The
publication of this important essay in 1847 had also the effect of bring-
ing about an immediate appreciation of his abilities. Du Bois-Reymond
gave a copy of it to Tyndall, then a student of Magnus in Berlin, say-
ing that it was the product of the first head in Europe. He was shortly
removed to the more favorable environment of a university professor-
ship at Kénigsburg. During the next twenty years he advanced from
Kénigsburg to Bonn, from Bonn to Heidelberg and from Heidelberg to
Berlin. While it was only on reaching the University of Berlin that
he assumed his true function of professor of physics, yet the previous
two decades had been rich in the application of physical methods to
physiological subjects.

In 1863 he published the remarkable monograph on the Sensations
of Tone. This work is a most masterly analysis of the whole subject
implied in its title and must always remain a classic. Only one or two
of the most important results of the profound researches of the author
can be referred to here. As everyone knows, the character of a musi-
cal tone is threefold. There is first its pitch, which has long been
known to depend upon the frequency of vibration of the string or reed,
or whatever gives rise to the sound; there is next the loudness, which
depends upon the amplitude of this variation, or, in a general way, on
the energy expended by the vibrating body. But two tones may agree
in pitch and in loudness and sfill produce very different impressions on
the ear. It is this which makes it possible to know when a musical
tone is heard that it comes from an organ, or a flute, or the human
voice. It enables an expert to know on hearing a single note from a
violin that the instrument was made in a given year by a certain artist;
by virtue of this characteristic one instantly recognizes a voice which
one has not heard for many years as belonging to a particular indi-
vidual.

So little was known of the physical cause of this inherent peculiarity
of a sound that for many years it went unnamed. Helmholtz called it
the ‘“ Klangfarbe;” literally, ‘‘tone color;” but in English the term
‘‘quality ” is now universally applied to it. Whatis the physical cause
of the quality of a tone is the question the answer to which he sought.
All that there is in a tone, he said—pitch, intensity, and quality—must
be borne upon the air waves by which the sound is communicated to
the ear, and all that these waves bear must be impressed upon them by
the vibrating body in which the sound originates. He did not fail to
recognize, however, and this was extremely important, that there might
exist peculiarities in the receiving instrument, the ear (through the
operation of whose mechanism the motion of matter is interpreted as a
sensation), the existence of which would materially modify the final
outcome, to the end that two physically identical tones might give rise,
under certain circumstances, to different sensations. Guided by these
principles, he discovered that the quality of a tone, that characteristic
HELMHOLTZ. T9O1

which gives charm to it, was really due to its impurity; that if two
perfectly pure tones, generated by simple, pendular vibrations, agreed
in pitch and loudness, it would be quite impossible to distinguish them.
But practically, such tones are never produced; all ordinary tones are
composite, made up of the fundamental, which generally fixes the
nominal pitch of the whole, and a series, more or less complete and
extended, of overtures or harmonies, the vibration frequencies of which
are two, three, four or some other multiple of that of the fundamental.
Without these, the fundamental, though pure, was plain, dull, and
insipid; with them it formed a composite with quality, soft it may be,
or brilliant, or rich, or harsh, or any of the thousand things which may
be said of a tone. Which it was and what it was, was determined by
the relative proportions of the several overtones, indefinite in number,
in the composite whole. This beautiful hypothesis was illustrated and
established by innumerable experiments, and it was proved that the
form of the air wave was the quality of the tone, and that this form
originated in the mode of vibration of the sounding body, which was
almost universally not simple, but complex. But the most important
work of Helmholtz along this line was the extension of this theory to
the solution of a problem more than two thousand years old, proposed,
in fact, by the Greek, Pythagoras. It meant nothing less than the
physical explanation of harmony. Why are certain combinations of
musical tones agreeable and others unpleasant? And, indeed, the
answer to this tells as well why a certain succession of tones, as in a
musical scale, is likely to be generally acceptable to the human ear.
Lack of time will only permit me to say that in the interference and
consequent beating of certain of the overtones or upper partials of
two fundamentals, Helmholtz found the explanation of their dissonance,
and that while in certain particulars his theory as originally published
has been criticised, it is in general universally accepted and admitted
to be one of the most splendid contributions to modern science.

Tam warned, also, that I must not speak of that other great work,
the Physiological Optics, as I would so gladly do if time permitted.
Helmholtz was actually engaged in the preparation of this and the
Sensations of Tone during the same years. No other man in the world
could have written these, for no other was at once an accomplished
physiologist, mathematician, and physicist. While I can not speak of
his contributions to the science of optics and ophthalmology, I must not
omit brief reference to his invention of the ophthalmoscope and the
ophthalmometer. Anxious to actually see what goes on in the eye, and
especially on the retina, that wonderful screen on which the image of
thevisible world is focused, he invented the ophthalmoscope. The qual-
_itative victory was followed by the quantitative in the invention of the
ophthalmometer, by means of which accurate measurements of the
various curved surfaces in the eye could be made. These two instru-
ments have been to ophthalmic surgery what the telescope and gradu-
ated circle have been to astronomy. So exact has the science of the
192 HELMHOLTZ.

eye become through their use that it is not great exaggeration to say
that one may now have a disordered eye repaired, corrected, and set
going with little more uncertainty than attends the performance of the
same duty for an ill-conditioned chronometer. Had Helmholtz accom-
plished nothing except the invention of these instruments, he would
have been entitled to the thanks of all mankind, on account of the
comfort they have added to life and the pain and suffering they have
prevented.

If I had devoted all of the time allotted to me to a simple enumera-
tion of the contributions to human knowledge made by Von Helmholtz
during fifty years of marvelous intellectual activity, | must have left
my task incomplete; but I must not close without reference to one or
two of these, more purely physical in their character and equally
stamped with the genius of their author.

Perhaps Nature has shown herself most reticent and unyielding when
scientific men have questioned her as to the ultimate structure of mat-
ter, the full knowledge of which includes a satisfactory explanation of
the force of gravity, which is one of its essential properties. Hypoth-
eses which have been very useful in their time have been finally rejected
because they involved some impossible conception, such as action at a
distance, which was for a long time believed possible. The tendencyis
now and has long been to regard space, or at least that part of it in which
we have any particular interest, as a plenum, and to assume a continu-
ous, incompressible, frictionless elastic fluid in which and of which all
things are. In the developmentof his exquisite theory of vortex mo-
tion, Helmholtz demonstrated the possibility of a portion of such a
fluid being differentiated from the rest in virtue of a peculiar motion
impressed upon it, and that v hen so differentiated it must forever
remain so, a fact which was quickly seized upon by Lord Kelvin as the
foundation of a vortex theory of matter, thus sharing with Helmholtz
the honor of having approached nearer than all others to the solution
of the great mystery. j

From the genesis of an atom to the origin of the universe seems a
long step, but it is not too great for the intellect of man. The well-
known nebular hypothesis was advanced long before Helmholtz’s time,
but a better knowledge of thermodynamics had quite upset one of its
generally accepted principles, namely, that the original nebulous matter
was fiery hot. As long ago as 1854, Helmholtz showed that this was not
a necessary assumption, and proved that mutual gravitation between
the parts of the sun might have generated the heat to which its pres-
ent high temperature is due. The greatest philosophers of the past
hundred years have attempted to account for this high temperature
and for its maintenance, on which all life on this globe depends. The
simple dynamical theory of Helmholtz has survived all others, and is
to-day universally accepted.

But I must cut short this absolutely inadequate account of what the
scholar did, that I may say a word or two of what the man was.
HELMHOLTZ. (5

Although one of the most modest and quiet of men, no one could meet
him without feeling the charm of his personality. While he bore
a dignity which became the great master of science which he was
everywhere admitted to be, he was approachable in an extraordinary
degree. He was eloquent in popular address and believed in the obli-
gations of men of science to the general public. In scientific discussion,
whether on his feet or with pen in hand, there was a certain massive-
ness about his style and manner which was generally irresistible. In
his attacks upon the region of the unknown he showed possibly less
brilliant strategy than one or two of his contemporaries, but he rarely,
if ever, found himself obliged to conduct a retreat. In 1893 he was
selected by the Emperor as the head of the German delegation, five in
number, to the International Electrical Congress held in Chicago in
Augtst of that year. His more than three score and ten years weighed
upon him, and he begged to be relieved of the duty. The young Kaiser,
who was fond of him and who loved to honor him in every way, sent for
him. On hearing his modest plea, he said, ‘‘ Helmholtz, you must go;
I want the Americans to see the best I have of every kind, and you are
our greatest and best man.” As becomes a dutiful subject he yielded.
While in this country every honor was shown him. Here he found
many of the hundreds and thousands of his pupils who everywhere in
the world are adding luster to his name by perpetuating his spirit and
his methods, and all were ready to serve him. Electrician, mathema-
tician, physiologist and physicist, he found everywhere a large and
appreciative constituency, while his own almost boyish pleasure in
whatever he saw that was novel, was charming to see.

On his homeward voyage he met with an accident which was thought
by many to be the beginning of the end. Up to the time of his death,
which occurred about a year later, he continued, but not very actively,
to direct the great institution for original research, in which, by the
wisdom of an appreciative Government, he had found full scope for his
powers. His interest in the important work done at the Chicago Con-
gress continued through this year, and one of the few long letters he
wrote had reference to its proceedings. On the 8th of September, 1894,
he died, and on the 13th he was buried at Charlottenberg, princes and
peasants alike mourning his loss.

Von Helmholtz occupied so large a part of the scientific horizon and
for so long a time that we have not yet become accustomed to his
absence. But it is not too soon to agree that the following admirable
lines which appeared in the London Punch a little more than a vear
ago express in some measure our judgment of the man and his work:

“What matter titles? Helmholtz is a name
That challenges alone the award of fame!
When Emperors, Kings, Pretenders, shadows all,
Leave not a dust-trace on our whirling ball,

Thy work, oh grave-eyed searcher, shall endure,
Unmarred by faction, from low passion pure.”
