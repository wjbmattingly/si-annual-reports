The Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” After receiving the property and ac-
cepting the trust, Congress incorporated the Institution in an “es-
tablishment,” whose statutory members are the President, the Vice
President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive depart-
ments, and vested responsibility for administering the trust in the
Smithsonian Board of Regents.

In the Nation's Service

Sy IDIELON ‘RIPLEY

BEING HISTORY-MINDED, I tend to believe that time is the only true
touchstone of merit. What merit lay in the enigmatic bequest of
money by James Smithson to the nation in 1826? No one could be
sure. The resulting hubbub in the Congress over whether to accept
the “tainted” British money has long since become part of the
dust of yesteryear. But my own feeling is that the creation of the
Smithsonian started a chain reaction which has since touched every
American.

It would be better to characterize the “diffusion of knowledge
among men,” to quote Smithson’s words describing the purpose of
his bequest, as being in the service of the people rather than in the
nation’s service. “In the nation’s service” bespeaks the many na-
tional service organizations of our government—the Postal Service,
the Health Service, the services for veterans, for unemployment
compensation, Social Security, the Internal Revenue Service, the
Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service. “In the service of the
nation” calls to mind the tremendous body of men and women in
the federal government employed to perform services for us all.
These servants of the people, often maligned by the public and
politicians alike, are devoted, zealous, and conscious of a calling, a
calling of service.

Most of them find a career reward of a genuine and compelling
nature in working for the benefit of us all. We rub elbows with them
every day at the Smithsonian. They are our best audience, for they
live for the most part near Washington. Thousands of them are
Associates of the Institution, and many thousands are our friends,
for they find a host of rewards in the experiences that we have to
offer. We can speak with conviction of those who dedicate their
careers to the civil, military, and kindred services, such as our
great Foreign Service, for these are people, devoted to the cause
of national service, of whom we can all feel proud.

Yet few people realize what the Smithsonian is all about. A
collection of large buildings on or about the Mall in Washington—
it is easy to assume that we are “government” in some way. Our
buildings seem for the most part large, impressive monuments to
the expenditure of taxpayers’ money. (The majority of people may
not realize the amount of nontaxpayer money that has gone into a
number of these buildings and will continue to do so in the future.
The names Smithson, Freer, Mellon, and Hirshhorn all spell dona-
tions for construction, just as more grants in the future will help
defray the costs of new galleries to be built.) Our museums, some
large, some small, consort in procession with the majestic, mono-
lithic array of huge government bureaux on the opposite sides of
Constitution and Independence Avenues. These government build-
ings brood over the scene in the sunlight, like a pride of lions
stretched out, panting in the heat, while their single lordly leader
rears his heavily maned head on Capitol Hill. It is a setting of
sedate splendor, awe-inspiring to some, crushing with monotonous
repetition to others. But within there is a continuing sense of
vitality.

No, we of the Smithsonian are not “feds.” We never “regulate”
anybody. We don’t publish mysterious orders in the Federal
Register. To be sure, we receive appropriated funds each year, but
even though they may represent two-thirds of our annual budget,
the sums keep our buildings and our technical and service staffs in
operation so that we can perform our services for all.

Nor are we an island. People in the government often fancy
themselves isolated, being in Washington. “Oh, it’s so valuable to
get out, to get out into the country,” they say, as if life in Wash-
ington were unreal, perhaps almost un-American. (People in New
York are sometimes thought of as foreigners in a strange way, “not
real Americans,” at any rate.) So people in Washington, in govern-
ment anyway, are always paying lip service to the concept that life
in Washington is different. It is not real America. This is especially
true, perhaps, among politicians, who after all have to pretend at
least not to be dismayed to be “home” with their constituents. From
there the mood is catching. Government servants often complain

4 / Smithsonian Year 1979
about being immured in Washington and not getting to sense the
needs of the people.

In fact, Washington is an immensely popular place to visit, per-
haps ahead of New York these days. Those who live here in service
of one kind or another should take comfort from this. It cannot be
so strange, so un-American, such an island. It is the hub, packed
with bits and pieces and stuff of everyman’s America.

In the Annual Report of the Institution for 1852, six years after
the commencement of operations in 1846, Joseph Henry, the first
Secretary, summed it up:

The prominent idea embraced in the Smithsonian organization,
is that of cooperation and concerted action with all institutions
and individuals engaged in the promotion of knowledge. Its
design is not to monopolize any part of the wide fields of
nature or of art, but to invite all to partake in the pleasure and
honor of their cultivation. It seeks not to encroach upon
ground occupied by other institutions, but to expend the funds
[i.e., the Smithsonian endowment income] in doing that which
cannot be as well done by other means. It gives to the words
of Smithson their most liberal interpretation, and “increases
and diffuses knowledge among men” by promoting the dis-
covery of new truths, and by disseminating these in every part
of the civilized world.

Thus Joseph Henry enunciated the concept of service toward
all people in “every part of the civilized world,” in words which
he constantly strove to impress on the minds of the Congress and
Executive alike: the Smithsonian had a task, a task of original
study and research to promote the dissemination of knowledge for
all mankind. Thinking back over the years, we have seen the
Institution grow to include numerous museums with museum col-
lections, a growth which to many minds tends to obscure the mean-
ing of Henry’s words.

How can one “discover new truths” as the proprietor of a dozen
or more museums? Fortunately, these times have seen a new realiza-
tion of what museums are all about, powerhouses of the mind, not
old dustbins into which is cast the detritus of history. Museums
serve today as educational centers, headquarters from which are
sent out messages, communications of all kinds. As Lewis Thomas

Statement by the Secretary / 5
says in his Lives of a Cell (1974), present genetic theory assumes
that

human beings are all born with a genetic endowment for
recognizing and formulating language. ... As human behavior
derives from the central mechanism of language, the same sets
of genes are, at least indirectly, responsible for governing such
astonishing behavior as in the concert hall, where hundreds of
people crowd together, silent, head-tilted, meditating, listening
to music as though receiving instructions, or in a gallery, mov-
ing along slowly, peering, never looking at each other, con-
centrating as though reading directions. . . . If language is at
the core of our social existence, holding us together, housing
us in meaning, it may also be safe to say that art and music
are functions of the same universal, genetically determined
mechanism.

Beyond these everyday experiences, so concisely delineated by
Thomas, there are all the other outward-flowing connections. Day
by day we communicate without the awareness of it. Often the
question is asked ‘““Why doesn’t the Smithsonian move out into the
country at large? Why is everything all confined here in Washing-
ton?” Almost every year some one of our congressional committees
asks the question during a hearing. This is usually coupled with
two other questions: ““Why don’t we get our products out into the
country at large, show our riches to the world?” and “Why do we
have all these museums?” Is there no way to stop this inexorable,
octopus-like growth?

It is frustrating to realize how general this impression is, how
it persists in spite of all our efforts. We do spread our message
across the country. We do get our message out. Our “riches” tend
to be more in ideas than in things. But we show both to the world.
What are our riches? We have only one of George Washington’s
uniforms, only one desk on which the Declaration of Independence
was drafted, only one flag that flew over Fort McHenry. We do
not have a single Philadelphia Chippendale camelback sofa, or a
Newport Townsend-Goddard lowboy with cabriole legs and relief
scrollwork carving. We do not have ten Remington sculptures or
even Gilbert Stuart portraits of the Founding Fathers! So what are
the riches? They exist in the mind, not in dozens of examples of

decorative arts or sculptural objects, except for a few symbolic
collections that have been given us, because our charter calls us,
among other things, the national museum of the United States.

I spend hours explaining to those interested enough to have any
attention span that our seventy-five or eighty million objects have,
to a large extent, intangible value. In this money-oriented culture
of ours, it is harder to understand that a collection of insects, or
fossils, or potsherds, or even portraits of famous people, may be of
great intangible value to us, the keepers of the nation’s collections,
and should be preserved rather than be thrown away or allowed
to deteriorate. But most of these invaluable (without a dollar sign
attached to them) collections of ours could not justify being
“tiches” to be shown across the world. As exhibits “to furnish
dozens of museums” (another stock phrase) they would lay an egg.

No, our service is of a different kind. If we put on an exhibit, we
may draw from the collections, but the very process is an idio-
syncratic one, illustrating some theme, some historical sequence of
events, or some set of ideas which must be thought through sub-
jectively, with an aim to broad public education.

In such service there is fulfillment, just as in the profession of
teaching. There is little money in it, and the objects involved may
have no monetary value in the marketplace, but they become price-
less when placed in juxtaposition because they convey ideas. Emer-
son said in his Lectures: “This time, like all other times, is a very
good one, if we but know what to do with it.” So an exhibit
represents time used in putting thoughts together, thoughts de-
lineated by objects, which in sum convey a message. Such time is
of great value, for we are programmed to receive messages in this
form, and messages may finally teach.

How then do we serve the country? It is relevant to say, first of
all, that enormous numbers of our citizens come to Washington
each year, aside from local residents, and that the combined
museums and exhibits of the Institution attract perhaps a tenth of
our population each year, over twenty-five million annually at last
approximation. Beyond that we do have attractions in other states:
a museum in New York; laboratories in Massachusetts, Florida,
and Arizona; and an environmental study center and a colloquium
center in Maryland. We have laboratories abroad in several
countries, among which the most famous is the biological station

Statement by the Secretary / 9
in Panama. Bui there are others besides, and the respect engendered
by the Smithsonian tradition of service in the search for knowledge
is worldwide, crossing without stress into the Second and Third
Worlds.

We are also mobile. Years ago, in 1951, we started the Smith-
sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (siTEs), with a ven-
ture capital outlay of $100,000. Partially self-liquidating through
the imposition of small transport and rental fees, strEs now has
some 175 exhibitions on the road or being planned or refurbished,
reaching a public of another four to five million viewers a year in
an average of 366 cities in 48 states. A few shows travel abroad
and some come here from overseas, but this part of our outreach,
which should be more actively developed, is much more expensive,
although we could and should coordinate with many more of the
nation’s major art galleries. We do help on occasion, willingly when
asked to do so by a foreign nation, especially when the exhibit
involves a clarification of history rather than a trumpery of
Barnumism. (There is a tendency today to finance “blockbuster”
exhibitions, often from abroad, requiring large expenditures of
money which attract huge crowds, provide immense temporary
occupancy of the museum involved, and which often produce huge
coffee-table catalogues, later advertising the prescience of the owner
in having visited the show, which, in the end, may serve as a status
symbol rather than a lasting residuum in the mind. Often such
exhibitions may be of mixed quality, may be almost impossible to
view, and thus may fail to perform the ultimate transmission of
meaning.)

Fortunately our Traveling Exhibition Service has simpler goals
and a mission of reaching smaller, less “show-biz” institutions.
Low-cost exhibits reaching historical associations, libraries, cultural
centers, high schools, and local galleries and museums, are in the
nation’s service. This is a goal never to be underestimated. In
addition, we have our Associates program, started in 1965, ex-
panded in 1970, now reaching a reading and radio audience of
millions through leaflets, scripts, our Smithsonian magazine, books,
a science service to the news media, and through our folk and per-
forming-arts festivals.

Few people, perhaps, realize the seminal influence of the Smith-
sonian’s Folklife Festival series, begun on the Mall in 1967, now dif-

fusing an enthusiasm for festivals all over the states and even
abroad. Few realize the enormous influence of our phonographic
recordings of American folk and popular music, documenting a
purely American art form, recordings which are available through
subscription or at our museum shops. This diffusion has been im-
mensely popular, so much so that if it did not exist it would long
since have had to be invented. But who could have invented the
Smithsonian and its services for people?

We live in what appears to be an uncertain age. Many people
foresee the gradual decay of our civilization, forced on us by will-
ful, wasteful ways, and the impression that we are imbued with
sloth in this country. It is a sense of malaise which has become
almost a way of thought among our economists and planners. So-
called liberal thought abounds with it. Conservative thought is
possessed with it. Philosophers are afflicted with a sense of
fatalism. Buddhism prepares us for acceptance of this sort, but it is
a far cry from the exuberance of hope which lies at the heart of
much of Judaeo-Christian inspiration. It is almost as if we were
resigning ourselves to a premature sense of death or encroaching
senility. Can a culture become senile? I am inclined to think not.
The malaise is more apparent than real. Part of the difficulty is that
we have lost touch with history, with our time scale, of which I
have written before. In the pseudo-joyousness of ““now” and of
“me,’’ we are even affronting the precepts of those other, less-
familiar religions, made temporarily popular.

If time is the only true touchstone of merit, then time requires a
communication of history. To achieve this should be our service
to the people. Such understanding involves work. In the Bhagavad
Gita, Krishna explains that work is its own reward. It should thus
be of virtue. As I have quoted before, “From food are all creatures;
from rain is the production of food; rain is produced from sacrifice;
and sacrifice is the outcome of work.’’ Here then lies salvation, and
any reward, if reward is needed, for service.

In this past year it is certainly fair to say that our “diffusion”
has reached a new peak, through visits, the Associates, traveling
exhibitions, the regional events program to a number of cities,
foreign and domestic tours, guidelines and programs for school
teachers, radio and Tv services, books of all sorts published by our-
selves or in conjunction with major publishing houses, reprints of

Statement by the Secretary / 13
classic texts, the Bicentennial project The Handbook of North
American Indians (of which the first two volumes have received
widespread acclaim), phonograph albums—all these offerings
serve to touch the lives of untold millions of people both now and
in the future. Our art museums alone lent more than a thousand
works to museums and galleries throughout the country for special
exhibitions.

A curious example of the present effects of Smithsonian diffusion
was the inclusion of the Smithsonian magazine in a survey of in-
fluential commercial media by The Wall Street Journal. For some
reason, unknown to us, the Journal included our Associates’ official
publication along with a number of prominent newspapers (includ-
ing the Journal, of course), news magazines, and similar widely
read, over-the-counter publications. The Smithsonian was the only
publication included which is available to a membership, in con-
trast to commercial methods of distribution. So startling were the
results of the survey that we understand they had to be repeated by
the researchers. In every area where credibility was a factor (except
where we hardly qualify, in politics or economics), Smithsonian
led the “thunderers” of the world of the news media. Thus, our
kind of diffusion is an intangible, a kind of word-of-mouth dis-
persal, and is accepted as an unspoken certification of authenticity.

When we speak of the effect of the diffusion of information by
the Smithsonian to millions in the future, we can think of two
highly significant events of this past year: the completion and
operation of two new astronomical instruments, the Multiple
Mirror Telescope and the HEAo-2 (Einstein) satellite. Both open
windows on new realms of knowledge of the universe, stages in
Smithsonian research in astronomy and astrophysics which began
over one hundred years ago with the personal research of one of
my predecessors, Samuel P. Langley, and which has been sponsored
by the Institution ever since.

The Multiple Mirror Telescope, first of its kind, developed in
conjunction with the University of Arizona, is the prototype for
optical telescopes of multiple-mirror construction perhaps as large
as 1,000 inches in diameter. The Einstein, developed with nasa, led
by the Center for Astrophysics in conjunction with the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, Columbia University, and the God-
dard Space Flight Center, is the first true focusing telescope for

Observatory and the University of Arizona, located on the summit of Mt. Hopkins,
Arizona, was Officially dedicated on May 9, 1979. Below. One of the stops on the

x-rays to be flown as a satellite. While already increasing sensitivity
by a factor of ten over the best earlier detectors, this satellite sug-
gests that an instrument even ten times more sensitive is feasible.
The successful completion of both instruments this year marks the
culmination of many years of design, testing, and planning by
teams of Smithsonian scientists working in cooperation with other
scientists around the world. Thus it can be said that new eras have
begun in both optical and x-ray astronomy as a result of these new
inventions. In this way, more millions of people in the future will
receive information diffused through Institution efforts.

Another method of expressing the inexpressible, making the con-
nections and the harmony out of what we do, is indeed solving the
problem of what we collect. As some of our scientists invent
strategies for sensing the phenomena of the universe, others develop
plans for documenting and cataloguing the immense data banks
represented by our collections in the natural sciences. For many
years, I have been at pains to talk and write about the importance
of this service of ours to Americans and to all people. To preserve
fragments at least of the stuff of our world, the materia mundi as
we can know and identify it, is of inestimable importance to our
future and to the future of mankind. At last, after more than ten
years of planning for this need, the Smithsonian has been granted
the right and the funds by the Congress to construct a Museum
Support Center in nearby Maryland, fifteen minutes away from
the Mall. This building, to cost between $20 and $21 million, will
be of the most modern design, incorporating energy-saving and
solar-heating devices appropriate to the Institution’s pioneering
efforts in such matters. (Dr. C. G. Abbot, my predecessor, did not
preoccupy himself with solar-energy research in the 1940s to no
purpose.) We hope it will provide a safe haven for millions of our
objects now stored in increasingly crowded and hence inefficient
spaces on the Mall, free up ample new exhibit space in the National
Museums of Natural History and of Man, and provide a center
for conservation, study, and research that should be exemplary,
a model for our peers. Here, too, is a paradigm of service to
people.

The dimensions of what people are finally able to do to trans-
form our natural environment from one state—a state of nature—
to another—a state of man’s creation—are incalculable. As best we

16 / Smithsonian Year 1979
can, while we chart this untraveled course, we should preserve frag-
ments of testimony of what the state of nature was like, so that
we can measure our path into change. As mankind moves along
this path of manipulation of the environment, it is better, as if
descending into the darkness of an abandoned mineshaft, to leave
a silken cord behind, with markers at intervals. Just as we keep
specimens of fossils to tell us of the world of aeons past, we should
keep the evidence of what tropical forests were like, what birds
were like, and reptiles, and sea creatures.

Perhaps we could even develop an early-warning system, as if
carrying a caged canary with us into the abandoned mineshaft, to
warn us of the unknown presence of carbon-monoxide gas. We
might develop a system in our markers. When half the bird species
of the tropical habitats have become extinct, should we pause to
look backward or should we measure the consequences of forging
ahead? Perhaps in such a way some measure of rational, disciplined
thought about where we are going might intervene. “Jiminy-
crickets,” we might say to ourselves, “look out, there’s a sheer
drop ahead. I see the crack in the wall of the House of Usher. I
see the stone legs of Ozymandias protruding from the sand.”

And what of the anthropological collections of our National Mu-
seum of Man? I know that in the future, people everywhere will be
grateful that we have preserved the evidence of how different we all
are, for in this recaptured sense of diversity there is pride and iden-
tity. These two words also speak eloquently to the collections of the
Museum of African Art, which in August became a member of the
Smithsonian family by an Act of Congress, inspired by our former
Regent Hubert H. Humphrey. The art objects in this newest of
the Smithsonian’s museums capture with striking force and beauty
the symbolic richness and cohesiveness of the societies which
created them, and form today a substantial part of the cultural
heritage of millions of our citizens. Whether through objects or
films, documents or symbols, we will always hunger to know who
we are and were so that we may take comfort in being ourselves
and not anyone else.

yi

All these things and many more embody our perceptions of
service to people. They are diffused outwards in a continual stream,
helping to evoke our past, preserve our present, and lend convic-
tion to our future.

Statement by the Secretary / 17
There have been a number of changes in senior staff positions at
the Institution this year. Our accomplished treasurer for a decade,
T. Ames Wheeler, retired June 30, though he will continue to serve
as a member of the Regents’ Investment Policy Committee. Mr.
Wheeler has been succeeded as treasurer by Christian C. Hohen-
lohe, the former assistant treasurer and former executive assistant
to the Secretary. Mr. Richard Ault, our energetic director of Support
Activities, retired to Arizona in July to pursue his lifelong interest
in aviation. His former responsibilities have been assumed in large
measure by the very able Tom L. Peyton, our director of the Office
of Facilities Services, who came to the Institution this year from the
General Services Administration. The very resourceful Porter Kier
resigned in June as director of the National Museum of Natural
History to resume his research activities and has been succeeded
temporarily by James F. Mello as acting director, while the search
for a permanent director continues. Off for other vineyards went
Dennis Gould of our Traveling Exhibition Service, Carl Larsen, our
director of Public Affairs (succeeded by Alvin Rosenfeld), and
Edward Kohn, the assistant director of the National Zoo. The skill-
ful and diplomatic Dean Francis B. Sayre retired this year from the
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and his col-
league George Packard, the center’s assistant director, has left to
become the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Inter-
national Studies. As always, we are sorry to have lost these and
other industrious co-workers at the Institution, but we rejoice in
having them as colleagues in the vital cultural pursuits of America.

We have been fortunate in welcoming some fine new senior staff
to the Smithsonian this year. Two new museum directors, Noel
Hinners from nasa and Roger Kennedy from the Ford Foundation,
have been selected and promise to give fresh new leadership to their
very popular museums, the National Air and Space Museum and
the National Museum of History and Technology, respectively. Dr.
Robert Maloy has come to head the Smithsonian Libraries unit,
and Glen Ruh has joined us in the new position of Coordinator of
Publications. With the help of these exceptional personalities, the
Smithsonian will move positively and smoothly into the future.

On December 7th, the Institution suffered an immeasurable loss
in the death of its sixth Secretary (1945-52) and long-time asso-
ciate, Alexander Wetmore. I will always remember Alex as a friend

18 / Smithsonian Year 1979
and inspiration in ornithology and as an able, practical administra-
tor as Secretary. Having assumed the Secretaryship amidst the
trying times of the war, he went on to lay the groundwork for two
additional Smithsonian museums, the National Museum of History
and Technology and the National Air and Space Museum. During
his tenure, the Institution also assumed control of the biological
research station in Panama (now part of the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute), celebrated its own centennial in 1946, and
undertook significant construction of the National Zoo.

Dr. Wetmore’s career at the Smithsonian began in 1924, when he
joined the Institution as superintendent of the National Zoo, and
then, less than a year later, he became assistant secretary for
science and director of the National Museum of Natural History.
A museum man, he was also a man of the world of birds, and he
served both with remarkable devotion. He was a scholar of inspired
intensity and a proud man with a gift of humility and understand-
ing. He enriched this Institution and the lives of those who knew
him; his pursuit of his life’s work somehow never interfered with
his capacity for compassion and friendship.

The Smithsonian is one of those rare places in the world that still
clings to its memories of the wonderful people who helped to build
and shape it—none more so than Alex Wetmore, who shared his
genius with the past and the future, and who will always be re-
spected for his scientific contributions and loved for himself. In
Coventry Patmore’s phrase, he lived in the “traditions of civility.”
He shall not be forgotten.

Statement by the Secretary / 19
Board of Regents

The Board of Regents held three formal meetings during the last
year, as well as a number of additional executive committee meet-
ings. The JANUARY 22, 1979, meeting of the Board of Regents was
designated The Alexander Wetmore Memorial Meeting in honor
and in memory of the late sixth Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, who died on December 7, 1978. The Regents noted that
“This gentle and affectionate man, loved by all who knew him,
made invaluable contributions to the Smithsonian and to biological
science.”

The Regents recognized both the distinguished services of Repre-
sentative Elford A. Cederberg as a Regent of the Institution and
his profound effect on our nation through his twenty-six years in
the Congress of the United States. This recognition was bestowed
at the conclusion of Representative Cederberg’s term in Congress.

The board memorialized the untimely death of Representative
Leo J. Ryan, who, although a Regent for only a short period, had
expressed an intense interest in the affairs of the Institution.

The Board of Regents welcomed newly appointed Regents from
the House of Representatives, Messrs. Silvio O. Conte of Massa-
chusetts, Norman Y. Mineta of California, and Frank Thompson,
Jr., of New Jersey.

The financial report was reviewed in detail and a special oral
presentation was made concerning past, present, and future projec-
tions of all Institution funds. The board approved the revised
statement of investment objectives recommended by the Invest-
ment Policy Committee for the guidance of the investment man-
agers.

The Regents approved the Five-Year Perspective (later known as
the Five-Year Prospectus) covering fiscal years 1980-84. The
planning process continues in tandem with the annual budget
cycles, and the five-year plan will be updated annually.

The Regents approved continued study of the proposed develop-
ment of the quadrangle in the south garden area and authorized

20
the use of $100,000 of nonappropriated funds for continuing the
development of preliminary plans and program details leading to
the presentation of an appropriate legislative proposal.

The Regents considered proposed bylaws that they plan to adopt
in the near future.

The Secretary was authorized to continue negotiations with the
Boston Athenaeum for acquisition of the Gilbert Stuart portraits of
George and Martha Washington.

The Regents approved a Program of Regents’ Fellowships. These
fellows, perhaps two or three scholars of great distinction, would
enrich the intellectual atmosphere of the Institution and would
explore areas of scholarship not already intensively studied here.
The program would be evaluated periodically.

The board expressed its support of legislation to raise the statu-
tory budget ceiling for programs at Barro Colorado Island, part of
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.

The Regents approved reports concerning the membership and
acquisitions of the National Collection of Fine Arts Commission
and the National Portrait Gallery Commission. The Regents also
received the report of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden.

The chairman of the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory
Board (NAFMAB) recommended a change in the status of the board
to reflect its current advisory role with the Eisenhower Institute for
Historical Research in the National Museum of History and
Technology. The matter was to be considered by NAFMAB.

The Institution’s continuing attention to the recommendations of
the General Accounting Office report, the report of the Regents’
Audit and Review Committee, and the report of the Surveys and
Investigations Staff of the House of Representatives, has resulted
in implementation of virtually all of the recommendations.

Progress reports on continuing projects of the Institution included
the Museum Support Center status of planning; Smithsonian
Exposition Books plans; Mall Parking Study, Phase II; a description
of approved projects under the special program for collections
acquisitions and scholarly and educational outreach projects; trans-
fer of the Trade (Tariff) Commission Building; Equal Opportunity
Program describing Affirmative Action Plans; the status of major
renovation and repair projects of various Smithsonian buildings; the

Statement by the Secretary / 21
status of the collections inventory project; participation by the
Institution in the celebration of the Einstein Centennial and the
International Year of the Child; Smithsonian Television Programs;
and the National Associates Program.

The Board of Regents voted to confer the title of Regent Emeritus
upon George H. Mahon for his long and faithful service to the
Institution. Mr. Mahon retired from the Congress of the United
States and had been a Regent since 1964.

MAY 7, 1979, MEETING: The spring meeting of the Board of Regents
was held in the Regents Room and was called to order by the
chancellor, and notice of the Executive Committee meeting held on
April 18, 1979, was taken.

The board considered a draft of bylaws which will be acted on
at the next meeting. It was noted that the enabling statute for the
Smithsonian Institution, codified as subchapter 1 of Chapter 3,
Title 20, U.S. Code, defines with considerable specificity many of
the procedures and policies usually set forth in an organization’s
bylaws, and the bylaws of the Board of Regents will convey the
methods and rules by which the board intends to conduct its super-
visory and fiduciary activities.

The financial reports indicated that preliminary hearings on the
federal budget for fiscal year 1980 were favorable. The nonappro-
priated trust-funds budget, when initially presented, proved to be
somewhat conservative, and projections for the future showed a
higher return on investment income, as well as results of auxiliary
activities. As a result of an earlier recommendation to select a new
certified public-accounting firm to conduct the annual audit of the
nonappropriated trust funds, the selection of Coopers and Lybrand,
made by the Executive Committee, was ratified by the Board of
Regents to begin with fiscal year 1979. It was pointed out that the
change in the auditing firm, a common practice in financial busi-
ness, was not in any way a criticism of the present auditors, but
rather a desire to have a new look at the accounting and financial
operations of the Institution.

The Secretary submitted a written report on progress to date
concerning the South Quadrangle development, detailing par-
ticularly the recent pledge of $1 million from the Japanese govern-
ment toward the cost of the project. The revised architectural con-

22 / Smithsonian Year 1979
cept was described and the new model was shown, and the review
of legislative action to authorize and fund further action revealed
that favorable action by the Congress was anticipated. The Secre-
tary advised the Regents of the creation of an ad hoc committee to
assist in raising funds for the project.

With the Regents’ consent, the Smithsonian and the Boston
Athenaeum decided to postpone a final agreement concerning
acquisition of the Gilbert Stuart portraits of George and Martha
Washington, pending the result of a Boston-based fundraising
campaign.

The Board of Regents approved publication of the Smithsonian
Exposition books entitled Animals Alive and The American Land,
contingent on confirmation by the Executive Committee that
satisfactory test-mailing results have been received. Three other
projects, selected for preliminary development based on reader
surveys, include a book on the sun and a series of children’s books.

The research at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental
Studies is presently being conducted on land holdings sufficient to
enable the Institution to control and monitor the Rhode River
estuary and enable the center to pursue its research in upland
ecology, watershed studies, and estuarine ecology. It was reported
that scientific integrity of the area could be protected by acquisition
of additional land, and the Secretary was authorized to pursue the
matter.

The board approved the acquisition and operation of aircraft for
research purposes in connection with a coral-reef project, to be
conducted by the National Museum of Natural History in the
Pacific and Indian oceans.

The board expressed its approval of the introduction of legisla-
tion to extend the existing appropriations authority of the National
Museum Act. Also, the Regents are supporting pending legislation
to raise the ceiling on appropriations for Barro Colorado Island at
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

The Regents approved the award of the Henry Medal to Dr.
Porter M. Kier in recognition of his important contributions to the
Smithsonian Institution and his successful stewardship of the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History.

The Secretary reported to the Regents on various programs.
The Museum Support Center project is progressing and an appro-

Statement by the Secretary / 23
priations request for construction funds is pending in the 1980
federal budget; the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory
Board generally agreed that the board should continue in its present
form and meet at more frequent periodic intervals to offer advice
and assistance to Smithsonian programs concerned with armed-
forces history; the transfer to the Smithsonian of the Museum of
African Art was proceeding and the necessary transfer arrange-
ments were being worked out. Status reports were presented on
major plant-improvement projects: the National Museum of the
Building Arts, the Trade (Tariff) Commission Building, the Mall
Parking Study, television programs, the Smithsonian Science In-
formation Exchange, and the National Associates Program.

On the evening preceding the Regents meeting, at the Regents
dinner, the Secretary, on behalf of the Board of Regents, presented
to T. Ames Wheeler, retiring treasurer, the Secretary’s Gold Medal
for Exceptional Service. The Regents wished to record their special
appreciation to Mr. Wheeler in recognition of the substantial con-
tributions he made to strengthening the Institution’s financial-
management systems and controls, in guiding and directing its
increasingly significant auxiliary activities, and in providing con-
stant wise counsel to the Secretary and the board on financial and
administrative matters. The Regents approved the appointment of
Mr. Christian C. Hohenlohe to succeed Mr. Wheeler as treasurer
of the Institution.

SEPTEMBER 17, 1979, MEETING: The autumn meeting of the Board of
Regents took place in the Regents Room and was called to order
by the chancellor. It was noted that the Executive Committee met
on August 20, 1979.

The board had previously considered a draft of bylaws by which
the Regents would administer the Institution. The board adopted
the bylaws and authorized their printing and distribution. Appoint-
ments to the Regents’ Audit and Review Committee, established in
the bylaws, and to the Regents’ Personnel Committee, were
affirmed.

A detailed report on the financial affairs of the Institution dis-
closed the status of the fiscal year 1980 and 1981 federal appropria-
tion requests, the supplemental request for 1979, and the non-
appropriated funds budget. The proposed federal budget for fiscal

year 1981 was reviewed and approved for submission to the Office
of Management and Budget, together with a preliminary budget of
the nonappropriated funds for fiscal year 1981. The board voted
to confirm the authority of the Secretary to establish on behalf of
the Institution and any of its bureaus such commercial bank ac-
counts as are necessary for the conduct of its business.

A draft update of the Five-Year Prospectus of the Institution for
fiscal years 1981-85 was circulated for review and consideration
by the Regents, and a report by the Investment Policy Committee
was received.

P.L. 96-36 was signed by the President on July 20, 1979, author-
izing planning and up to $500,000 to be appropriated for the South
Quadrangle Project. The Secretary reviewed the status of the In-
stitution’s budget request for the planning in the current appropria-
tion bill and reviewed plans for fundraising in the private sector.
The Institution expects to seek authorization to complete planning
and to construct the project in the Second Session of the Ninety-
sixth Congress.

The Museum of African Art officially became a bureau of the
Smithsonian on August 13, 1979. In accordance with P.L. 95-414,
the Regents appointed ten members to the Commission for the
Museum from its former board, and the Regents will appoint five
remaining commission members at the January meeting.

Publication of The Smithsonian Book of the American Land was
approved.

A draft of an updated survey of Smithsonian property was
presented for the Regents’ review. For each Smithsonian facility,
the survey provides identification and purpose; location; size; date,
type, and cost of acquisition; and details of major repairs, renova-
tions, or improvements. Revised and updated as required, the survey
will supplement the Five-Year Prospectus and the Programs and
Activities book and will provide a useful cross-reference to the
Institution’s annual budget request.

The Regents voted to approve the naming of the Silver Hill
facility of the National Air and Space Museum “The Paul E.
Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility” in honor of
Mr. Garber’s sixty years of service at the Smithsonian.

The Secretary reported on the status of:

—the Museum Support Center, on which construction may soon
begin;

—transfer of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange to the
Department of Commerce;

—special programs for collections acquisition, scholarly studies,
and educational outreach.

The board approved presentation of the James Smithson Medal
to Pope John Paul II on his visit to the United States in October
1979.

The Regents noted the award of the Secretary’s Medal for Ex-
ceptional Service to Dorothy Rosenberg and approved their own
resolution recognizing her effective work for over two decades.

Smithsonian Institution - 1979
FINANCIAL REPORT

CHRISTIAN C. HOHENLOHE, TREASURER

Summary: Fiscal year 1979 was a generally favorable year for the
Smithsonian, with substantial financial support from all sources and
better-than-balanced budgets. As demonstrated by the chart on the
facing page, there was again overall growth in the Institution’s
funds, sufficient primarily to continue existing programs but also,
in a few cases, to pursue new initiatives. A welcome newcomer to
the Smithsonian family during the year was the Museum of African
Art. A federal appropriation to the Institution for the museum’s
operating support permitted the acquisition to take place on August
13, 1979, and the financial activities of the museum since that date
are incorporated in this report.

Generous congressional support of the Institution continued in
fiscal year 1979, with overall appropriations totaling over $110.5
million, an increase of more than $6 million over the previous year.
These federal appropriations provide core support for the Institu-
tion’s basic research, exhibition, and education programs; for ac-
quisition, care, documentation, and study of the national collections;
and for construction, maintenance, restoration, and protection of all
Smithsonian facilities. While much of the increase over the prior
year was necessary to cover the inflationary costs felt throughout
Smithsonian operations, additional funds were provided for high-
priority needs, such as collection inventories and the multiple-
mirror telescope. Appropriations also permitted substantial progress
on the National Zoo Master Plan construction and on planning for
the Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland. Congressional
understanding and backing of the Institution’s research and educa-
tion programs are deeply appreciated.

In recent years, as these financial reports have indicated, the
enthusiastic public acceptance of the Smithsonian Associates Pro-

29
gram and other educational auxiliary activities, as well as gifts and
grants from individuals and foundations, have enabled the Institu-
tion to support a significant portion of its programs from nonappro-
priated funds. Net revenues from these sources declined in fiscal
year 1979 but were sufficient to continue the $2-million-per-year
program established last year for major collections acquisition,
scholarly studies, and educational outreach, as well as numerous
operating allotments to Smithsonian bureaus and programs, and
reserves for construction and land acquisition. But for the success
of auxiliary activities, appropriations would have been sought for
many of these projects. Because of favorable projections for unre-
stricted fund activities and as a measure to reduce directly the
Smithsonian’s costs to taxpayers, the Board of Regents approved
the application this year of $1 million of nonappropriated funds to
support expenses for the Smithsonian fellowship program and costs
of certain leased space that previously had been covered by appro-
priated funds. In recognition, however, that current financial suc-
cesses are not guaranteed in the future, a transfer of the unrestricted
fund surplus of over $2.5 million to endowment was also author-
ized, in order to ensure the Institution’s continued ability to provide
nonappropriated funds for research and educational programs.

This combination of congressional and private financial support,
of grant funds and earned revenues, has been a source of strength
to the Institution in meeting its goals and seizing new opportunities.
A major new priority of the Institution, the South Quadrangle, will
seek to draw further on this dual public/private partnership. The
anticipated financial plan for this project, which will include con-
struction of an Oriental Gallery and a new building for the Museum
of African Art in the area south of the Smithsonian “Castle,” will
rely on contributions, self-generated funds from auxiliary activities,
and appropriated funds. As an initial commitment to the project,
the Board of Regents authorized a transfer of $1,385,000 to plant
funds from unrestricted nonappropriated trust funds for ongoing
and future planning and design effort. The government of Japan
informed the Institution during the year that it will provide $1
million towards construction of the Oriental Gallery.

In an ongoing effort to provide full financial information on
Smithsonian activities in this report, minor changes have again been
made in Table 1 and the supporting tables that follow.

Operating Funds—Sources and Application

As indicated in Table 1, as well as the chart on page 28, there has
been substantial and sustained growth in gross operating revenues
to the Institution in recent years. Total gross operating funds in-
creased over $16,000,000, or 10 percent, from $168,518,000 in fiscal
year 1978 to $184,945,000 in fiscal year 1979. Federal appropria-
tions constitute 53 percent of total gross operating funds provided,
federal agency grants and contracts 6 percent, and nonappropriated
funds 41 percent.

The growth in net operating funds, after deducting the necessary
expenses of the nonappropriated fund auxiliary activities, was a
more moderate 2 percent. These funds, available to support the
wide range of Smithsonian programs, are 77 percent from federal
appropriations, 9 percent from federal agency grants and contracts,
and 14 percent from nonappropriated sources. Application of these
monies by all Smithsonian bureaus is displayed in Table 2, with
further supporting detail contained in other tables.

FEDERAL APPROPRIATION

Federal appropriations provided $98,202,000 toward the Institu-
tion’s operating needs in fiscal year 1979, an increase of $4.8 million
over the previous fiscal year. As in the past, much of this increase
($3,300,000) was required to fund legislated salary increases; sev-
eral program areas, however, received significant new funding,
including an Institution-wide collections inventory program, the
newly acquired Museum of African Art, the multiple-mirror tele-
scope project of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and
the Research Awards Program. In addition, some $160,000 was
appropriated directly to the Smithsonian for programs previously
supported through grants awarded by the National Endowments
for the Arts and Humanities. As referred to above, $1,000,000 of
nonappropriated funds was applied in fiscal year 1979 to reduce the
cost to the federal appropriation of leased space ($400,000) and the
Institution’s fellowship program ($600,000).

FEDERAL AGENCY GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

Grants and contracts from federal agencies totaled $11,412,000 for
fiscal year 1979, a slight increase over the previous year. These

32 / Smithsonian Year 1979
funds, representing 9 percent of net operating revenue, continue
to constitute a very important source of support for the Institution’s
research. As in previous years (see Table 3: Grants and Contracts—
Expenditures), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
provided the majority of the awards (about 73 percent of the total),
primarily for research and experimentation at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory. Some examples of the projects supported
by federal agency grants are: studies of biological systems in the
Antarctic, research in medical entomology and establishment of a
lower mammal tumor registry directed by the National Museum of
Natural History, analysis of lunar geological features by the Na-
tional Air and Space Museum, experiments in high-energy astron-
omy by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and investiga-
tions of the chemical components of marsh water at the Chesapeake
Bay Center for Environmental Studies.

NONAPPROPRIATED TRUST FUNDS

Nonappropriated trust funds continue to be the second-largest
source of operating support for the Smithsonian. During fiscal year
1979, gross trust funds provided rose by 18 percent over fiscal year
1978; however, net funds provided, after deduction of costs incurred
by central auxiliary and bureau activities, decreased 15 percent to a
level of $17,774,000, compared to $20,898,000 in fiscal year 1978.
This decrease was due to reduced gifts and grants for restricted pur-
poses, as well as a decreased net revenue from auxiliary activities.
The net revenue, for both restricted and unrestricted purposes, con-
stitutes 14 percent of total net operating funds provided to the
Institution.

Revenue for Restricted purposes totaled $4,577,000 this past
year (see Table 4) and was derived from gifts ($1,775,000), invest-
ment income ($2,075,000), and other sources ($727,000), including
fundraising activities of the Archives of American Art and the
museum shop of the Freer Gallery of Art. Endowment investment
income, as discussed below, provides major support for the Freer
Gallery of Art and oceanographic research at the Fort Pierce
Bureau, as well as funding a large number of specific research and
educational projects annually. Major gift support was received dur-
ing the year for important collection acquisitions at the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden, National Collection of Fine Arts,

and the National Museum of Natural History; for documentation
of the Catalogue of American Portraits at the National Portrait
Gallery; for exhibits at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and the Na-
tional Museum of History and Technology; and for a range of
research and other projects supporting virtually every aspect of
Smithsonian interests.

The Special Purpose fund category of Unrestricted Nonappro-
priated Funds includes moneys generated by various bureau activ-
ities, and allotments to bureaus as shares of income from shops and
concession activities. Table 5 details the source and application of
these funds by bureaus. The major sources of revenues are the
National Air and Space Museum, with a new film, Living Planet,
drawing large attendance at its theater, and the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum in New York, which enjoys continued success with its
membership and educational programs, fundraising auction, and
museum shop sales. Also accounted for as transfers to special pur-
pose funds are the allocations authorized for Collections Acquisi-
tion, Scholarly Studies, and Educational Outreach ($2,000,000); the
fellowship program, previously funded from federal appropriations
($600,000); a reserve for potential magazine liabilities; and support

for a number of other Institutional endeavors. Due to the success of
its bureau activities, the National Air and Space Museum was able
during the year to make a further transfer of $100,000 to the
Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace History Endowment Fund, for a
total amount transferred of $350,000 to date toward a goal of
$900,000.

General Unrestricted Purpose funds include all unrestricted
moneys provided for general Institutional purposes, including
auxiliary activity revenues (Tables 6 and 7). Net General Unre-
stricted Purpose funds provided were lower in fiscal year 1979 than
the prior year by approximately $1,500,000 (see Table 6). While
investment income was substantially higher, due both to rising
short-term interest rates as well as to prior-year additions to unre-
stricted endowment, the net gains from auxiliary activities declined
by almost $2,500,000. Contributing to this decrease were the appli-
cation, for the first time, of rental charges to auxiliary activities
occupying space in Smithsonian buildings, higher central admin-
istrative overhead fees, and severe inflationary cost pressures. As
shown in Table 7, the majority of auxiliary activity revenue comes
from the Associates Program, primarily through the Smithsonian
magazine, which continues to enjoy a widespread and enthusiastic
reception. Also important in generating net revenue for other In-
stitutional needs are Smithsonian Exposition Books, which bene-
fitted this past year from the newly published Smithsonian Book
of Invention as well as continued sales of earlier publications, and
the Division of Performing Arts, which released nine recordings
for sale to the public. The decline in net revenue from the Museum
Shops, due to continued start-up costs of the Mail Order Divi-
sion, was offset by the gain of the Smithsonian Institution Press,
primarily from its mail sales of the new book The National Air and
Space Museum. Significant financial support was also received from
public concessions in various Smithsonian buildings.

Notwithstanding this decline in unrestricted funds provided, the
Institution was able to continue the support of numerous programs
and central administrative units with these funds. Major operating
support was provided to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Office of
American and Folklife Studies, the Office of Fellowships and
Grants, the Visitor Information and Associates Reception Center,
and the Office of Telecommunications, in addition to a large num-
ber of small allocations to other bureaus of the Institution. Awards
for program support, including collections acquisitions, were made
to the Freer Gallery of Art, the National Air and Space Museum,
the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, the Reception Center,
the National Museum of History and Technology, and the Na-
tional Portrait Gallery from funds raised by the Smithson Society

of the Associates. Other allotments this year provided for the full
equipping of the new Laboratory Wing at the Chesapeake Bay
Center for Environmental Studies and the renovation of the Dis-
covery Theatre in the Arts and Industries Building, at which puppet
shows are held, primarily for younger visitors. As referred to above,
the Regents authorized continuation of the $2,000,000 annual pro-
gram for major collections acquisitions ($1,000,000), scholarly
studies ($500,000), and educational outreach ($500,000). These
moneys are reserved in the Special Purpose Funds until expended
by the recipient Smithsonian bureaus.

Other major applications of unrestricted funds were transfers of
over $1,800,000 to Plant Funds (discussed below) and the addition
of over $2,500,000 to unrestricted endowment funds.

Other Operating Programs

Separate federal appropriations are also received for the Smithsonian
Special Foreign Currency Program, which provides grants to United
States institutions for field research in other countries in which
“excess” foreign currencies are available, and the Smithsonian
Science Information Exchange, which serves as a national source
for the exchange of information on research in progress. The fiscal
year 1979 appropriation for the Special Foreign Currency Program
totaled $3,700,000, or $300,000 less than provided in fiscal year
1978. This amount reflected an increase of $700,000 for grant
awards and a reduction of $1,000,000 for the United States’ con-
tribution to the campaign to save the Egyptian monuments at
Nubia, the fourth and final payment of which was made in fiscal
year 1978. The general areas of research and geographical activities
of this program are contained in Table 8.

The Smithsonian received an appropriation for the Smithsonian
Science Information Exchange of $2,063,000 in fiscal year 1979, an
increase of some $200,000 over the previous fiscal year. This in-
crease covered essentially the cost of inflation experienced over the
past few years.

Construction

The Institution received a federal planning and construction appro-
priation of $6,575,000 in fiscal year 1979, somewhat higher than
that provided in the previous year. As shown in Table 9, the
greater part of this appropriation was for the National Zoological
Park, $3,000,000 for construction of the Great Ape House, an im-
portant part of the National Zoo’s continuing Master Plan, and
$900,000 for restoration and renovation of existing structures at
Rock Creek Park and Front Royal. A further $2,100,000 was appro-
priated for ongoing repair to all other Smithsonian facilities, includ-
ing phased projects to improve access for handicapped visitors, to
correct existing hazardous conditions, to continue facade and roof
repairs, and to improve fire-detection and -suppression systems.
Finally, $575,000 was appropriated for use in association with fiscal

year 1978 funds for architectural and engineering planning for
the Museum Support Center. Construction of this facility, which
will provide 302,000 gross square feet of storage, office, laboratory,
and conservation space, is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 1980.
The Institution is being assisted by the General Services Admin-
istration in the management of the design and construction of this
project.

A total of $1,857,000 was allocated to construction and land
purchase from nonappropriated trust funds during the year, the
majority of which ($1,385,000) was for development of the South
Quadrangle, described more fully above. A total of $135,000 was
transferred to this project for development of a conceptual study
and preliminary engineering surveys, and the remaining $1,250,000
will fund architectural plans in fiscal year 1981. The South Quad-
rangle will be a major funding priority, for both appropriated and
nonappropriated funds, in the future.

Additional support ($411,000) was provided for continued land
acquisition at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental
Studies, and minor transfers to plant funds were also made for
other construction projects.

Endowment and Similar Funds

The total market value of the Smithsonian Endowment Funds was
$66,619,000 on September 30, 1979, as compared to $58,097,000 on
September 30, 1978. These funds include $65,556,000 invested in
the Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund, $1,000,000 on per-
manent deposit in the United States Treasury, and $63,000 of mis-
cellaneous securities. Of this total, $44,097,000 (66 percent) are
Restricted Endowment Funds, with income to be used only for the
purposes specified by the donor, and $22,522,000 (34 percent) are
Unrestricted Funds for the general support of the Institution (see
Table 10). Table 13 is a listing of the Institution’s Endowment
Funds, the largest of which are the Freer Fund, supporting the
operations of the Freer Gallery of Art, and Endowment Fund No. 3,

research and museum projects.

The Pooled Consolidated Endowment Fund is invested under the
management of four professional advisory firms under the close
supervision of the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer,
subject to policy guidelines set by the Smithsonian’s Board of
Regents. These firms (with the portion of the Fund under their
management) are BEA, Incorporated (23 percent), Batterymarch
Financial Management Corp. (25 percent), Fiduciary Trust Co. of
New York (43 percent), and Torray Clark & Company, Inc. (9 per-
cent). During fiscal year 1979, the total rate of return of these

Financial Report / 45
funds, as calculated by an independent investment measurement
service, was +14.3 percent (including interest and dividend yield
as well as market value appreciation), compared to +12.5 percent
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 average and +7.8 percent for the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.

As outlined in prior reports, the Institution follows the Total
Return policy, under which the total investment return of the
Endowments is defined as yield (interest and dividends) plus
appreciation (realized and unrealized gains). A prudent portion of
this return is paid to each Endowment as income for current ex-
penditures. Since 1973, this income payout has been at the rate of
41/2 percent of the running five-year average of endowment market
values, adjusted for additions or withdrawals of capital. During
fiscal year 1979, the Board of Regents amended this policy to pro-
vide that the annual total return income payout set each year would
be based not solely on the five-year market average but would also
take into account anticipated dividend and interest yields, support
needs of the Institution’s bureaus, and inflationary factors. In ac-
cordance with these principles, and due largely to the increased
yield of both debt and equity investments, the total return income
payout approved by the Board of Regents for fiscal year 1979 was
equivalent to 4.7 percent of the five-year market average. Even at
this level, the payout was $989,000 less than interest and dividends,
and this difference was therefore reinvested into Endowment prin-
cipal, in contrast to prior years, in which appropriation of capital
gains was required to meet the required total return payout.

Included on Table 12 as additions to the Endowments were re-
stricted gifts of $91,000, primarily for the Harold P. Stern Memorial
Fund, a transfer to Unrestricted Endowment Funds of $2,650,000
approved by the Board of Regents, and additional transfers repre-
senting reinvestment of Endowment income pursuant to the terms
of individual Endowments.

A listing of the securities held in the Pooled Consolidated Endow-
ment Fund as of September 30, 1979, may be obtained upon re-
quest from the Treasurer of the Institution.

Related Organizations

The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., was incor-
porated by the Smithsonian in 1971 as a separate nonprofit entity.
Its purpose is to facilitate the planning, management, and coordina-
tion of the nation’s research efforts through the collection, process-
ing, and dissemination of information about ongoing research. In
addition to an annual contract from the Smithsonian, equal to the
appropriation provided the Smithsonian for this purpose, the ex-
change also receives substantial revenues from users of its services.
In fiscal year 1979, these user revenues totaled $1,133,000 and
accounted for 35 percent of the operating costs of the exchange. As
a step toward the transfer of the exchange’s operations to the
Department of Commerce, the appropriation for support of the
exchange will be made to this department in fiscal year 1980,
rather than to the Smithsonian. To assist in the transition, the
Institution will continue to provide administrative and _ fiscal
services.

Reading is Fundamental, Inc. (r1F), associated with the Institution
since 1968, is an independent, separately incorporated entity dedi-
cated to the improvement of reading abilities in children. Primary
support is derived from private contributions and a federal contract
with the United States Office of Education to operate the Federal
Inexpensive Book Distribution Program. Administrative services
are provided by the Institution on a contract basis.

During the year, action was taken to close out the books of the
Smithsonian Research Foundation, and this corporation will be
legally dissolved in the near future.

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the
National Gallery of Art, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, were established by Congress within the Institu-
tion but are administered by separate Boards of Trustees. Inde-
pendent financial reports are presented by each of these organiza-
tions. Office space and fiscal and other administrative and support
services are provided the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars on a reimbursement basis.

The Friends of the National Zoo (Fonz) is an independent, non-
profit corporation working closely with the National Zoological
Park. It operates under contract a number of beneficial concessions

50 / Smithsonian Year 1979
for the National Zoo. Fonz provided concession and rental fees to
the zoo amounting to more than $164,000 during calendar year
1978 (FoNz’s fiscal year). In addition, Fonz contributed other impor-
tant financial and volunteer support for zoo programs. Financial
affairs of this organization are disclosed separately elsewhere in
Smithsonian Year 1979.

Accounting and Auditing

An audit of the nonappropriated trust funds of the Institution is
conducted annually by independent public accountants, and their
fiscal year 1979 report is contained in the following pages. For over
thirty years, this work had been performed in a competent and pro-
fessional manner by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. In January
1979, the Board of Regents authorized its Executive Committee to
invite audit proposals from other major accounting firms as well.
After extensive proposal review and interviews with the nation’s
eight largest firms, Coopers & Lybrand was selected to perform the
Institution’s audit for 1979 and the succeeding four years. During
the year, the internal audit staff continued their reviews of various
operations of the Institution. Additionally, grants and contracts re-
ceived from federal agencies, as well as their allocated overhead
costs, were audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

The Audit and Review Committee of the Regents, under the By-
laws of the Institution, has the responsibility for reviewing the
Smithsonian’s accounting systems and internal financial controls;
of facilitating communication between the Board and internal audi-
tors, independent auditors, and auditors of the General Accounting
Office; and of reviewing operations of the Institution for compliance
with approved programs and policies.

We have examined the balance sheet of the Trust Funds of Smith-
sonian Institution as of September 30, 1979 and the related state-
ment of financial activity for the year then ended. Our examination
was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and, accordingly, included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. The statements of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian
Institution for the year ended September 30, 1978, totals of which
are included in the accompanying financial statements for compara-
tive purposes, were examined by other auditors whose report dated
December 15, 1978 expressed an unqualified opinion on those state-
ments.

The statements of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution do
not include the accounts of the National Gallery of Art, the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts or other departments,
bureaus and programs administered by the Smithsonian Institution
under federal appropriations as detailed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended Sep-
tember 30, 1979, referred to above, present fairly the financial posi-
tion of the Trust Funds of Smithsonian Institution as of September
30, 1979, and the results of operations and changes in fund balances
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted ac-
counting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the
preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION—TRUST FUNDS
Notes to Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of presentation. The financial statements of Smithsonian Institution—
Trust Funds (Institution) have been prepared on the accrual basis.

Fund accounting. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed
on the use of resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Insti-
tution are maintained in accordance with the principles of fund accounting.
This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified
for accounting and reporting purposes into funds established according to
their nature and purposes. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund;
however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar
characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial
transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.

The assets, liabilities, and fund balances of the Institution are reported in
self-balancing fund groups as follows:

Current funds, which include unrestricted and restricted resources, rep-
resent the portion of expendable funds that is available for support of
Institution operations. Separate sub-fund groups of current unrestricted
funds have been reflected in the financial statements for auxiliary activi-
ties (representing primarily the revenue and expenditures of the Smith-
sonian Associates Program, including the Smithsonian magazine, and
museum shop sales) and for special purposes (representing internally
segregated funds for certain designated purposes). Amounts restricted by
the donor for specific purposes are also segregated from other current
funds.

Endowment and similar funds include funds that are subject to restric-
tions of gift instruments requiring in perpetuity that the principal be
invested and the income only be used. Also classified as endowment and
similar funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principal but
only under certain specified conditions and quasi-endowment funds.
Quasi-endowment funds are funds established by the governing board
for the same purposes as endowment funds; however, any portion of such
funds may be expended. Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent
gifts for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the prin-
cipal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the gov-
erning board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the
income for the purpose stipulated by the donor.

Plant funds represent resources restricted for future plant acquisitions
and funds expended for plant.

All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection or other disposition of
investments are accounted for in the fund in which the related assets are

58 / Smithsonian Year 1979
recorded. Income from investments is accounted for in a similar manner,
except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds,
which is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted, or, if unrestricted,
as revenue in unrestricted current funds.

Inventories. Inventories are carried at the lower of average cost, computed on
a first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value.

Deferred revenue and expense. Revenue from subscriptions to Smithsonian
magazine is recorded as income over the period of the related subscription,
which is one year. Costs related to obtaining subscriptions to Smithsonian
magazine are charged to income over the period of the subscription.

The Institution recognizes revenue and charges expenses of other auxiliary
activities during the period in which the activity is conducted.

Works of art, living or other specimens. In accordance with the practice gen-
erally followed by museums, works of art and living or other specimens are
not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

Property and equipment. Capitalized improvements and equipment purchased
with Trust Funds and utilized in income-producing activities are capitalized
in the current unrestricted fund at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years.

Real estate (land and buildings) are recorded in the plant fund at cost, to the
extent that restricted or unrestricted funds were expended therefor, or ap-
praised value at date of gift, except for gifts of certain islands in Chesapeake
Bay and the Carnegie Mansion, which have been recorded at nominal values.
In accordance with the practice of many museums, depreciation on buildings
is not recorded.

All other land, buildings, fixtures, and equipment which were principally ac-
quired with federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

Government contracts. The Institution has a number of contracts with the
U.S. Government, which primarily provide for cost reimbursement to the
Institution. Contract revenue is recognized when billable or received.

Contributed services. A substantial number of unpaid volunteers have made
significant contributions of their time in the furtherance of the Institution’s
programs. The value of this contributed time is not reflected in these state-
ments, since it is not susceptible to objective measurement or valuation.

2. Related Activities

The Trust Funds reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds obtained from
private sources, from federal grants and contracts, and from certain business
activities related to the operations of the Institution.

Federal appropriations, which are not reflected in the accompanying financial
statements, provide major support for the operations and administration of
the educational and research programs of the Institution’s many museums, art
galleries, and other bureaus, as well as for the maintenance and construction
of related buildings and facilities. In addition, land, buildings, and other
assets acquired with federal funds are not reflected in the accompanying
financial statements.

Financial Report / 59
The following federal appropriations were received by the Institution for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 1979 and 1978:

1979 1978

The Institution provides fiscal and administrative services to several sepa-
rately incorporated organizations in which certain officials of the Institution
serve on the governing boards. The amounts paid to the Institution by these
organizations for the aforementioned services, together with rent for Insti-
tution facilities occupied, etc., totaled approximately $422,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1979. The following summarizes the approximate ex-
penditures of these organizations for the fiscal years ended September 30,
1979 and 1978, respectively, as reflected in their individual financial statements
and which are not included in the accompanying financial statements of the
Institution:

For the years ended September 30, 1979 and 1978, the Smithsonian Research
Foundation did not receive federal grants, and the corporate structure will be
dissolved in fiscal year 1980. The Institution is working with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce to effect a transfer of the Smithsonian Science Information
Exchange operations to the U.S. Department of Commerce on October 1,
1980; until that date the Institution will continue to provide fiscal and admin-
istrative services.

3. Investments

Investments are recorded at cost, if purchased, or fair market value at date
of acquisition, if acquired by gift. At September 30, 1979, investments are

The Institution utilizes the “total return” approach to investment manage-
ment of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds. Under this approach,
the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized
gains and losses, in addition to interest and dividends. An amount equal to
the difference between interest and dividends earned during the year and
the amount computed under the total return formula is transferred to or from
the current funds.

In applying this approach, it is the Institution’s policy to provide, as being
available for current expenditures, an amount taking into consideration such
factors as, but not limited to: (1) 412% of the five-year average of the market
value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period), (2)
current dividend and interest yield, (3) support needs for bureaus and scien-
tists, and (4) inflationary factors as measured by the Consumer Price Index;
however, where the market value of the assets of any endowment fund is less
than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation),
the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received. The
total return factor for 1979 was $4.74 per unit of fund participation. The total
return applied for 1979 was $2,516,098.

The balance of the plant fund at September 30, 1979 includes $1,997,525 of
unexpended plant funds.

7. Pension Plan

The Institution has a retirement plan in which substantially all Trust Funds’
employees are eligible to participate. Under the plan, both the Institution and
employees contribute stipulated percentages of salary which are used to pur-
chase individual annuities, the rights to which are immediately vested with
the employees. The cost of the plan for the year ended September 30, 1979
was $1,746,293. It is the policy of the Institution to fund plan costs accrued
currently. There are no unfunded prior service costs under the plan.

8. Income Taxes

The Institution is exempt from income taxation under the provisions of Sec-
tion 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Organizations described in that
section are taxable only on their unrelated business income. The Internal
Revenue Service is presently considering a Request for Ruling filed by the
Institution pertaining to the proper interpretation of the current regulations
concerning the method of calculating certain unrelated business income. If
the Institution’s interpretation is approved, no tax would be imposed on this
income. It is the opinion of the Institution that it is also exempt from taxation
as an instrumentality of the United States as defined in Section 501(c)(1) of
the Code. Organizations described in that section are exempt from all income
taxation. It is the intent of the Institution to seek such dual status. Manage-
ment believes that any income taxes required as a result of settlement of these
maters would not have a material effect upon the financial position of the
Institution.

ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR SCIENCE

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies

WATERSHED AND ESTUARINE STUDIES

One of the research goals of the Chesapeake Bay Center for En-
vironmental Studies (cBces) is to develop an understanding of the
functions of an estuarine watershed ecosystem and the ways in
which changes in the land use of a watershed affect the biota in
downstream receiving waters. The Rhode River estuary and its
watershed on the Chesapeake Bay have been the focus of this long-
term study, and several interesting results have begun to emerge.
Most of the Rhode River watershed drains into bordering tidal
marshes and tidal mud flats before entering the estuary. David
Correll and Jack W. Pierce have analyzed the effects of these areas
on estuarine water quality. Samples of land runoff were analyzed
for sediments, phosphorus, nitrogen, and organic matter. Overall,
less organic matter moved into the estuary (26.8 tons of carbon)
than was discharged from the watersheds (71.0 tons of carbon).
During a period when land runoff was low because of drought, a
net amount of 65 tons of carbon was observed to move from the
estuary into the tidal marsh area. Carbon output from the marshes
only exceeded input when land runoff was very high. Overall, only
1.86 tons of phosphorus moved into the estuary of the 2.72 tons
discharged from the uplands into the marshes. During four drought
months, a net movement of phosphorus from the estuary to the
marshes (0.69 tons) occurred. Generally, high discharges of phos-
phorus from the watersheds were followed in a week or two by high

65
discharges from the marshes. Orthophosphate constituted a sig-
nificantly lower fraction of the phosphorus that moved into the
estuary (38 percent) than of the phosphorus that was discharged
from the watershed (49 percent).

In all, only 7.45 tons of nitrogen moved into the estuary of the
10.2 tons discharged from the watershed. During four drought
months, a net of 1.63 tons of nitrogen moved from the estuary into
the marshes. Nitrate and reduced forms of nitrogen had independ-
ent patterns. There was no net movement of nitrate between
estuary and marshes during this time.

The important effects of the headwater intertidal zone on the
estuary seemed to be: (1) a less variable rate of materials delivery,
and (2) a change in the average composition of each material before
delivery. However, these headwaters, marshes, and flats appear to
process, rather than trap, the bulk of these materials as they are
transported from the watershed to the estuary.

At the mouth of Rhode River, seasonal mean concentrations of
phosphorus increased steadily for each season each year from the
fall of 1971 to the fall of 1976. The most dramatic increases were
observed in the summer and fall (a four-fold increase). A much
smaller increase occurred in the winter and spring. In contrast, the
year-to-year concentrations of total phosphorus in surface waters
in upstream stations over the same period of time showed less clear-
cut trends. Also, phosphorus loadings from local watershed runoff
fluctuated widely but had no steadily rapid rise with time. Although
total phosphorus increased dramatically at the mouth of the Rhode
River, dissolved orthophosphate, nitrate, and dissolved ammonia
remained essentially constant, especially in the summer and fall.
This data could indicate the increasing effect of summertime anoxic
bottom waters on the phosphorus dynamics of the upper western
shore of the bay.

Estuarine studies were undertaken by Maria Faust to determine
the effect of pleasure-boating activity on the water quality of the
Rhode River. Faust’s study, conducted during a holiday weekend,
indicated that fecal bacteria in the water increased soon after the
arrival of boats, persisted during the weekend, and decreased im-
mediately after the boats departed the area. It was concluded that
in shallow estuarine waters, boating appears to be an important
source of fecal contamination during periods of high boating ac-

66 / Smithsonian Year 1979
tivity. However, the contribution of land runoff to fecal contamina-
tion of the estuary is of longer duration, occurring mostly during
spring, fall, and winter.

Faust and postdoctoral fellow Ryszard Chrost are investigating a
biological nutrient-enrichment phenomenon in the estuary, which
is a result of the metabolic activity of microorganisms. Current
studies have been concentrating on three interdependent areas:
analysis of phytoplankton photosynthesis and the release of dis-
solved organic matter; the assimilation of dissolved organic matter
by bacterioplankton; and the size distribution of the dissolved or-
ganic matter that regulates the activity and productivity of estuarine
microorganisms. Results indicate qualitative and quantitative
changes in the excreted dissolved organic substances appearing in
the water.

On the Rhode River watershed, the distribution of the herbicide
atrazine in runoff and rainwater has been the focus of recent
studies by Tung Lin Wu. Wu attributes the disappearance of atra-
zine from surface soils at elevations above sea level of 15, 22.5, and
30 meters to such processes as volatilization, runoff of rainwater,
and biological degradation. Wu’s investigation shows that, at an
elevation of nine meters, atrazine persists in the surface soils as a
result of the deposition of eroded materials from the higher eleva-
tions. The runoff measured at Wu’s test stations showed that of the
total atrazine applied in the experiment, 1.3 percent was lost in the
runoff, and 55 percent of that amount was accounted for by a storm
that occurred eleven days after application. An additional 32 per-
cent of atrazine loss was the result of another heavy rainfall sixty-
two days after application. In another study, Wu found evidence
that atrazine may travel long distances and maintain residence in
the atmosphere for an extended period of time. Atrazine was de-
tected in samples from the Rhode River and in rainwater samples
collected during the summer months. An unexpected finding was
the detection of generally higher levels of atrazine in rainwater
collected during winter months, long after the herbicide had been
applied to local crops.

LAND USE STUDIES

Another aspect of the Environmental Research Program at cBCES is
concerned with analyzing the effects of present and past land-use

Science / 67
changes on plant and animal communities. An example of this work
is an ongoing project of James Lynch and Dennis Whigham on the
effect of fragmentation and isolation of habitat on plant and bird
communities. Their results suggest that forest size has little effect
on the distribution of plant species. However, forest disturbance
appears to be a significant determinant of the bird species occurring
in a given area.

Specific types of woodland birds, such as flycatchers, warblers,
wood thrushes, vireos, and tanagers, are affected by forest size.
These birds, mostly tropical migrants, do not have the ability to
switch from one source of food to another as do permanent resi-
dents, such as blue jays and cardinals. In addition, competition with
the more adaptable species, and what appears to be a psychological
need for the food and cover of large wooded areas, make the migra-
tory birds more dependent on large wooded areas for survival.

The results of this in-depth examination of forest patches should
provide useful data on the minimum area requirements for the
maintenance of bird species and on the relative merits of small
forest stands vs. large preserves. This information should be par-
ticularly applicable to the work of environmental planners, who
need specific information for the placement of roads, mass transit
systems, power-line right-of-ways, and other construction projects.

Other investigations focusing on the effects of land use are being
conducted by James Lynch. His work on the community ecology of
ants has been conducted in forest, old field, and pasture habitats at
csces. Recent results of this long-term study show that virtually all
of the common ant species that occur at CBCES possess distinctive
patterns of seasonal occurrence, daily activity, food preference,
habitat utilization, and occurrence along the spectrum of secondary
successional vegetation types. His investigations indicate that ant
species associated with the mature hardwood forest belong to genera
with either north-temperate or worldwide distributions. He has
found that this assemblage has very few species in common with
the ant community that inhabits brushy old fields and similar open
disturbed habitats. The old-field ant contains, together with a com-
bination of distinctive species of the north temperate genera, a
large component derived from ant genera with basically tropical or
subtropical centers of distribution and diversity (e.g., Monomorium,
crematogaster, Pheidole).

68 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Relative to their north-temperate counterparts (e.g. Formica,
Lasius, Myrmica), these tropical “invaders” tend to be smaller in
size and more aggressive and often form large aggregations to de-
fend food sources. In addition, the old-field ant community appears
to be adapted to function at higher temperatures than the forest ant
community. The latter group exhibits more nocturnal activity and is
active earlier in the spring and later in the fall than the old-field
community.

Lynch’s work suggests that competitive interactions among ant
species at concentrated food sources are extremely common, and
experimental field manipulations of food supply and ant abundance
confirm that the ability of one species to forage may be severely
depressed by the presence of other species.

Dennis Whigham and Daniel Higman have been conducting a
detailed study of phenodynamics of an old-aged hardwood forest.
These long-term studies are being used to determine norms and
variances for structural and functional components of successional
and old-aged forests, as well as to produce detailed studies of in-
dividual species. The phenology data will be correlated with clima-
tological data to determine the environmental factors responsible
for controlling species and/or community phenodynamics. Whig-
ham’s research on the Cranefly orchid (Tipularia discolor) has
shown, for example, that the rate of population turnover is much
higher than expected for a species that occurs in old-aged stable
forests. The study has also shown that Tipularia is pollinated by
a single noctuid moth (Pseudaletia unipuncta) and that pollinator
interaction is necessary for the production of seeds. The moths, in
turn, are capable of selecting those portions of the orchid inflores-
cences that contain the most nectar. The moths also respond to total
nectar resources in the orchid populations. In Whigham’s investiga-
tions, moth activity increased sharply as the total available nectar
increased and then stopped abruptly once nectar resources began
to decline, even though open flowers were still present.

EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PUBLIC INFORMATION

Part of the research program at cBceEs is concerned with environ-
mental influences on human behavior and the ways in which human
preferences for various landscapes are formed. Through develop-
mental investigations, John Falk and John Balling have begun to

Science / 69
explore the hypothesis that man’s evolutionary history has, at least
in part, determined his landscape preferences. Current theory sug-
gests that much of human evolution took place along or near the
river courses in the East African savanna. Present-day preferences
for natural settings with scattered trees, short grass, and some type
of water body may reflect an innate preference for the environment
in which much of our biological (and psychological) apparatus
evolved.

The results from three completed studies and one currently in
progress are provocative. Although the first investigation revealed
that infants under one year of age can discriminate among natural
environments, future research will attempt to determine whether
infant discrimination among biomes is a function of preference,
visual complexity, or some other variables. Investigation of children
three to five years of age clearly demonstrates a preference for
savanna-like environments and the persistence of this preference
throughout the elementary-school years. However, by the time the
individual reaches high school and throughout adult life, the pro-
nounced preference for savanna disappears and savanna is judged
similarly to the natural environments with which the person is most
familiar.

Most of the nation’s environmental education occurs in the con-
text of school field trips to various outdoor sites. How well do such
trips accomplish their educational objectives? This question has
been the subject of a study by John Balling and John Falk. Balling
and Falk have been seeking to determine: (a) the effects of the field-
trip environment on student behavior, attitudes, and learning; and
(b) the current thinking of educators about field trips and the
relationship of these attitudes to the outcomes of actual field trips.

In one study, fifth- and sixth-grade children from urban, sub-
urban, and rural schools performed a science activity in one of three
settings that differed both in terms of familiarity and relevance to
the learning task. The data revealed that learning was greatest
where the number of relevant examples and the setting novelty
were at a maximum. Attitudinal findings showed that the students
learned a great deal from the field-trip experience and were very
enthusiastic about it.

Significant developmental differences emerged from a study
conducted to determine the interaction of the variety of environ-

70 / Smithsonian Year 1979
” aie

mental factors surrounding the usual field trip—the day away from
school, the disruption of routine, the bus ride—with learning and
behavior. In the groups of third-graders and fifth-graders who were
studied, the younger group learned best when the milieu was
familiar and minimally disruptive to their normal school day, while
the fifth-grade students reacted better to a full-fledged field trip
away from school. Both groups showed significant retention of the
subject matter of the field activity one month later. Behavioral ob-
servations revealed that the third-grade students performed better
in the setting outside their school than they did in the nature center,
while the reverse was true for the fifth-graders.

All four groups surveyed in an assessment of attitudes and per-
ceptions regarding field trip experiences—elementary school teach-
ers, school administrators, college instructors in science education
methods, and nature center professionals—were remarkably similar
in stating positive attitudes toward field trips. The consensus was
that the major benefits of field trips are, in decreasing order of im-
portance: (a) the development of more positive attitudes toward
science among the students; (b) the learning of certain science facts,
concepts, and related skills; and (c) the improvement of the social
climate in the class.

These studies suggested that field trips are a valuable part of the
science education of elementary school children, providing many
cognitive and effective benefits for the students. The project also
demonstrated that the characteristics of the setting for a field trip
and certain aspects of the relationship of the participants to this
setting can have a significant influence on student attitudes, be-
havior, and learning.

Another aspect of the Education Program at cBces focuses on the
use of scientific information for planning and decision-making
purposes and public perceptions of environmental issues. In regard
to the latter, Suzanne Pogell and John Balling are seeking to de-
termine ways in which public involvement and psychological theory
can be used to mediate potentially contentious environmental de-
cisions. In a paper presented at the 1979 Environmental Law Con-
ference, Pogell suggested that environmental compliance can be
encouraged through the participation of an informed public. In
particular, this participation includes involving the public in early
stages of the decision-making process; making available full and

to monitor experiments on foraminifera populations in the Indian River. Directed by
Dr. Martin Buzas, the foraminifera research program is concerned with the role of
foraminifera in the trophic structure of the Indian River estuary.

adequate information to create awareness of the technical and
socioeconomic dimensions of the issue; and providing opportunities
for the general public to participate on an equal footing with
government and economic interests, thereby fostering a climate of
open and honest discussion.

Balling’s paper at the same conference sought to provide a basis
for considering people’s cognitive abilities and perceptions of the
natural world in environmental decisions. Specifically, he suggested
that: experts be used to help those involved in the decision-making
process to interpret statistical data; explicit consideration be given
to the relationship between human perceptions of environmental
quality and the more usual indexes of physical and biological en-
vironmental quality; the decision-making process be broken down
into a series of small steps; and communication among potentially
conflicting groups be encouraged at the earliest possible time.

Fort Pierce Bureau

The Smithsonian’s Fort Pierce Bureau, located on the central east
coast of Florida, is in a zoogeographic transitional zone that offers
an unrivaled opportunity for biological study. Research at the Fort
Pierce Bureau emphasizes studies of the life histories, systematics,
and ecology of a wide spectrum of marine invertebrates. Contribut-
ing to the research efforts are resident scientists, postdoctoral fel-
lows, and numerous visiting investigators. A reference museum
houses 13,000 catalogued specimens that are representative of local
marine flora and fauna. Facilities include small boats for work in
the Indian River lagoon and the nearshore oceanic waters and an
electron microscope laboratory with both scanning and transmission
microscopes. Limited laboratory space is available for visiting scien-
tists.

Studies of life histories directed by Dr. Mary Rice this past year
have centered on various aspects of reproduction and larval biology
of sipunculan worms and bivalve molluscs, with ancillary research
projects on phoronids, bryozoans, polychaetes, gastropod molluscs,
and echinoderms. In studies of the reproductive biology of sipuncu-
lans, Dr. Mary Rice and postdoctoral fellow Dr. John Pilger have

Science / 73
documented the breeding seasons of two species by monthly mea-
surements of coelomic oocytes and observations of spawning in the
laboratory. It was concluded that an offshore species, Golfingia
misakiana, collected from oculinid coral rubble at depths of fifty to
sixty meters, is similar to many temperate species in that it shows
seasonal spawning with a peak in November, whereas Themiste
lageniformis, a species that inhabits the intertidal oyster beds in the
Indian River lagoon, spawns continually from July through Decem-
ber. Development in the former is by means of a planktonic feeding
larva; the latter has a short-lived nonfeeding larva.

Studies by Dr. John Pilger on a parthenogenetic sipunculan,
Themiste lageniformis, have continued for a second year. The sex
ratio of the local population is nine females to one male. Females
produce eggs that are capable of developing with or without fertili-
zation. Preliminary results, using microphotometry to quantify
chromosomal nucleic acid, support the working hypothesis that
fertilized eggs may develop into either males or females, whereas
unfertilized eggs develop only into females.

As part of ongoing studies of the phylum Sipuncula, Dr. Rice has
continued a systematic survey of the Sipuncula of southern Florida
and the Caribbean. Additional specimens have been collected and
illustrated. Collections from 186 stations, totaling 500 lots, were
sorted, identified, and carded.

Reproduction of a brooding clam, Parastarte triquetra, was in-
vestigated by postdoctoral fellow Dr. Bruce Bartlett. The clam is
abundant in the Indian River, occurring in densities as great as
45,000 and 51,000 per square meter in the two sites chosen for
study. Bimonthly measurements of population density, laboratory
observations of juvenile release, and examination of gonads, sug-
gested that the species breeds throughout the year. Developing
embryos are brooded within the gills of the females and released as
benthic juveniles through the excurrent siphon. During brooding,
the embryos are attached to the gill filaments of the maternal parent
at the site of papillary outgrowths. The possibility of a nutritional
link between papilla and embryo is being investigated by use of
electron microscopy. The entire developmental period is estimated
to be one month, and a given female may produce up to nine broods
per year. The clams reach reproductive maturity at three months of
age and have a life span of approximately one year. The population

74 / Smithsonian Year 1979
has a high mortality rate, presumably because of predation by shore
birds, naticid snails, and an infestation of a trematode parasite that
results in castration of the clams.

The question of what induces oceanic larvae to settle and under-
go metamorphosis into bottom-dwelling adults has been investi-
gated by Dr. Mary Rice in a series of experiments on sipunculan
larvae from the Florida Current. For the species studied most in-
tensively (Golfingia misakiana), experiments have shown the exist-
ence of a water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compound associated
with and presumably produced by the adult, which significantly en-
hances metamorphosis of the larva in the presence of a suitable
substratum. It has been demonstrated that the substratum must
contain organic compounds to be effective in inducing metamor-
phosis. Investigations are continuing on the nature of the metamor-
phosis-inducing factors and the manner in which larvae respond to
them. Experiments on young larvae, reared from spawnings of
adults, are in progress to determine at which stage of development
and growth the larva becomes ready to metamorphose.

To provide a basis for understanding the responses of larvae to
various environmental stimuli, including metamorphosis-inducing
factors, Dr. Rice began a cinematographic analysis of the behavior
of oceanic larvae. With the assistance of Kjell Sandved of the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History, footage was produced for a
documentary film on the functional morphology of specific organs
of sipunculan larvae and juveniles before and after metamorphosis.
Feeding, locomotion, substratum-testing, and burrowing of several
species have been recorded on film.

In an effort to interpret function on the basis of cellular anatomy,
two collaborative studies have been undertaken on the ultrastruc-
ture of various larval organs of sipunculans. Dr. Patricia Dudley of
Columbia University, and Dr. Mary Rice have collaborated on an
investigation of larval epidermal organs. Scattered over the larval
body, these organs open to the exterior through minute pores and
have been found to consist of both glandular and sensory elements.
The ultrastructure of another larval structure, the terminal attach-
ment organ, has been studied by Dr. Edward Ruppert of Clemson
University, and Dr. Mary Rice. The terminal organ, common to
most planktonic sipunculan larvae, functions in attachment and re-
lease of the larva; it may be implicated also in larval feeding and

Science / 75
in sensing the substratum prior to settlement and metamorphosis.
The electron-microscopic investigation has demonstrated sensory,
glandular, and adhesive components.

Dr. Richard S. Houbrick of the National Museum of Natural
History has continued his studies on life histories of gastropod
molluscs of the Indian River lagoon, concentrating during the past
year on two common species, Modulus modulus and Battalaria
minima. He has found that the population of Modulus modulus
has a life cycle of approximately one year. Mating occurs in early
winter and spawning in the spring. Cylindrical spawn masses,
comprised of gelatinous tubes, are deposited on marine grasses in
the Indian River. All stages of larval development take place within
the egg capsule, the young snails emerging after three weeks of
incubation. Detailed studies of the reproductive anatomy of the
two species are in progress.

Echinoderm studies by Dr. David L. Pawson, National Museum
of Natural History, and Mr. John E. Miller, Harbor Branch Founda-
tion, Inc., have continued in the areas of ecology, systematics, and
larval development. Population density, movement, and breeding
cycles of the sea cucumber Holothuria lentiginosa enodis were made
using the research submersible Johnson-Sea-Link. This holothurian
is a dominant faunal member of the Oculina reefs found 220 to 300
feet off central-east Florida. Preliminary investigations, including
studies of sediment composition, suggest that population dispersal
around these reefs is dependent upon sediment organic content.

A study on the systematics of shallow-water holothurians from
the western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean regions is
under way. Skeletal ossicles from nearly one hundred species of
holothurians are being photographed by means of scanning electron
microscopy. These ossicles, composed of a calcium carbonate matrix,
are taxonomically invaluable in identifying sea cucumbers. Results
of this study were being compiled for publication in a monograph
on the western Atlantic holothurians.

Three subspecies of the common variable sea urchin Lytechinus
variegatus occur in the western Atlantic. A developmental study
has been initiated in an attempt to identify the factors responsible
for phenetic differences between these subspecies. Larvae reared
from adult Bermudan and Floridian Lytechinus are being main-
tained under controlled conditions of light, temperature, salinity,

76 / Smithsonian Year 1979
and food availability. Examination of metamorphosed juveniles
should determine whether the external morphological differences
are controlled environmentally or genetically.

Research in crustacean biology by Dr. Robert H. Gore empha-
sized larval development of several species of decapod crustaceans
in the families Porcellanidae, Paguridae, Grapsidae, Majidae, and
Hapalocarcinidae. Of particular interest was the development of
Troglocarcinus corallicola, a crab that inhabits galls induced by its
presence on various species of hermatypic and ahermatypic corals.
The larvae were heretofore almost completely unknown. Two
species of porcellanid crabs, Petrolisthes tridentatus and P. tonso-
tius, and the majid crab Mithrax corphye, collected from marine
waters at Santa Marta, Colombia, constituted another part of an
ongoing systematic program in which the larvae of Caribbean and
trans-Panamanian conspecific or geminate species are compared, in
order to elucidate the taxonomic status of the adults. Additional
collections from the Indian River region of ovigerous females in
other brachyuran and anomuran families continued to provide data
on crustacean larval development in the eastern central Florida area.

Taxonomic and ecological investigations on the decapod crusta-
cean community inhabiting the inshore and offshore Oculina coral
reefs in the Indian River region showed a diverse and species-rich
faunal assemblage, with pagurid, porcellanid, and xanthid crabs
comprising a major component in this biotope. Completion of these
studies will complement previously published research by Dr. Gore
on decapod communities associated with sabellariid worm reef, and
seagrass and drift algae biotopes. This data is also applicable to the
long-term baseline study on the systematics of decapod and stoma-
topod crustaceans from the Indian River region of Florida. Ancil-
lary research on the taxonomy and systematics of euphausiacean
crustacea (krill) from eastern central Floridan neretic and pelagic
waters has also been initiated, using material collected earlier by
R/V Gosnold.

Research on foraminifera, directed by Dr. Martin Buzas of the
National Museum of Natural History, has emphasized the processes
that limit populations in the Indian River and the role of forami-
nifera in the trophic structure of the estuary. In this subtropical set-
ting in which seasonal changes are not severe, biotic controls are
important in structuring foraminiferal populations. Exclosure ex-

Science / 77
periments have examined predation as a possible biotic control.
Results of these experiments, run for three- to four-month periods
over four years, have demonstrated greater densities of foraminifera
inside the exclosures. Gut analysis of some fish and benthic inverte-
brates from the exclosures and the estuary have shown that a num-
ber of deposit feeders ingest foraminifera. Abiotic controls are
being studied in collaboration with the chemistry section of the
Harbor Branch Foundation, Inc. Fluctuations of foraminiferal popu-
lations in bare and grassy areas are being compared with variations
of nutrients, trace metals, and organic carbon in sediment pore
water. Other projects include an offshore exclosure experiment,
laboratory culture of foraminifera, and a taxonomic survey of the
foraminifera of the Indian River.

Dr. Malcolm G. Erskian, postdoctoral fellow, is studying the pat-
terns of organization in the foraminiferal community. Spatial pat-
terns in benthic foraminifera are influenced by both microhabitat
substrate type and the population dynamics of the foraminifera.

During the past year, the Reference Museum has placed empha-
sis on improving the organization of the existing collection. Major
additions have been made within the Foraminiferida, Porifera,
Cnidaria, Polychaeta, Mollusca, and Amphipoda. Significant collec-
tions recently catalogued include the J. L. Taylor Polychaeta from
the Tampa Bay region and the R. W. Harrington Fish Collection,
compiled locally during the 1950s and ‘60s.

National Air and Space Museum

The National Air and Space Museum (NasM), which in its first three
years of operation has become the most visited museum in the
world, has embarked on a significant new phase of development.
Dr. Noel W. Hinners, former associate administrator for space
science of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was
selected as the museum’s new director after an extensive search. He
suceeds Michael Collins, who became under secretary of the
Smithsonian.

Dr. Hinners plans to continue the strong exhibit program that
has contributed so greatly to the museum’s success, but with a

78 / Smithsonian Year 1979
gradually increasing emphasis on new programs in appropriate areas
of research and education. In addition, he intends to expand the
collections management program, tying it into a carefully planned
review of the process of collections acquisition and disposal.

The year 1979 represented a pivotal time for the museum, for
while plans were being developed for this shift in emphasis, the
museum’s basic functions were continued at their previous levels.
The exhibit program was divided almost equally among opening
new galleries, updating existing galleries, and creating a series of
small, specialized ‘“mini-exhibits.” Similarly, the important work of
preservation went on unabated at Silver Hill at the same time that
inventory efforts were expanded and an extensive facility-improve-
ment program was concluded. The basic foundation for an exten-
sive education program was laid, and full fruition of these efforts
will come in 1980 and beyond.

The Center for Earth and Planetary Studies (cers), headed by
Dr. Farouk El-Baz, continued as the major element in the museum’s
research program. Research included photogeologic interpretations
of the moon, Mars, and Mercury, and investigations of the deserts
in Egypt and China. These studies utilized the extensive collection
of planetary photographs at the center and included programs
jointly conducted with research teams in the United States and
abroad. The results appear in the thirty-eight publications that were
published during the course of the year.

Lunar research concentrated on the Smythii basin, the effects of
topography on impact cratering, and a unique volcanic feature
named Ina. The Smythii basin, an ancient impact feature on the
moon’s east limb, has the most extensive topographic coverage of
any lunar multiringed basin. This fact, along with Smythii’s sparse
volcanic mare fill, which leaves much of the underlying basin floor
exposed, makes it an excellent site for the study of basin structure
and morphology.

The effects of variable pre-impact topography and substrate
on slumping and terrace formation have been studied in a group
of thirty craters in the lunar highlands. These craters are character-
ized by preferential terracing on one side of each crater and distinct
upper terraces that are much wider than lower terraces that are to
be found within the crater.

Study of the lunar feature Ina has been initiated. This D-shaped

Science / 79
depression is located in Lacus Felicitatis between the Apennine
Mountains of the Imbrium basin and the Haemus Mountains of
Serenitatis. The region is characterized by highland materials
dominated by lineations radial to Imbrium. The study concentrates
on the local stratigraphy, the regional structural setting, and the
origins of volcanic morphology.

ceps staff maintain and update the primary computer records for
names of lunar surface features. These records include all names
previously approved by the International Astronomical Union and
currently in use, names for future use, biographical and historical
information on commemorated persons, and features locations.

Photogeologic investigations were also conducted of Mars, with
emphasis placed on the classical albedo feature Cerebus. Images
obtained by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 and the Viking Or-
biter I spacecraft in 1977 show that the boundaries of the dark
feature have shifted in a general NE-sw direction by as much as
130 kms.

In a comparative planetology study, mare-type ridges on Mer-
cury were contrasted with lunar features of similar morphology.
Proposed origins of ridges are still controversial; both tectonic and
volcanic modes of formation have been hypothesized for these per-
plexing features.

Research continued on the project entitled ‘Desert Erosion and
Sand Movement in Egypt.” The research is jointly conducted by
the Smithsonian Institution and Ain Shams University, Cairo,
Egypt. A book by Farouk El-Baz on Egypt as Seen by Landsat was
published.

During September and October 1978, a field trip to the remote
desert regions of southwestern Egypt was undertaken in order to
study both sand movement and wind erosion and possible analogs
of features on the surface of Mars. The multidisciplinary team of
U.S. and Egyptian scientists included geologists, archaeologists, and
one botantist.

The Science and Technology Department expanded its research
program of historical studies, including such topics as the origins of
swept-wing aircraft in the United States, lifting-body reentry, and
Soviet ramjet research, and began an artifact acquisition program.

The Aeronautics Department supplemented its basic role of
historical research for publications and exhibits with several im-

80 / Smithsonian Year 1979
portant public-service functions. These include the preparation of
a Guide to Aerospace History Sources, an intensive collections-
acquisition process to fill gaps in the existing files, and the publica-
tion of Engines in Museums Around the World.

The Education Department conducted a very successful multi-
cultural aerospace education conference, one which apparently filled
a long-felt need, judging by the continuing response from partici-
pants and attendees. This effort to reach communities that in the
past have not been made fully aware of aerospace activities was
supplemented by a pilot teacher workshop for Prince Georges
County educators and a Regional Resources Workshop. All of
these activities were designed to test the extent of the need for the
museum’s resources in these areas.

The magazine Air and Space was stabilized at a circulation of
30,000, although evidence exists that there is a still greater demand
for the publication. The thrust of the magazine will be changed
slightly in the coming year, to provide a more museum-related
content.

An extensive, twenty-one-title filmstrip program was completed
and is entering production. These filmstrips, based on the museum’s
collections, will provide educators around the country with a handy
tool to impart valuable insight into aerospace history.

The design for the new Education Orientation Facility was put
out for construction bids. This facility will enhance the awareness
of visiting schoolchildren of the museum’s offerings and provide
an opportunity for teachers to expand their curriculum on aerospace
subjects.

Similarly, the design for the Center for Live Demonstrations was
completed. This center, which will be located in the Flight Tech-
nology Gallery, will provide direct instruction on aerospace subjects
that are difficult to explain by graphic or audio-visual means and
will enhance the educational value of the museum visit.

The Education Department is also conducting a regional Museum
Assistance Program. Exhibit units, educational materials, and other
activities, including design suggestions, are provided on a limited
basis to museums around the country. As an example, the mini-
exhibit “The Question Mark and the Growth of Aerial Refueling”
was sent to the Air Force Museum, and design consultation has
been going on with the Visitors’ Center at Langley Research Center.

Science / 81
This mini-exhibit was followed by “Aerospace Medicine,” which
related the remarkable progress made in overcoming the sometimes
hostile environment of flight.

Deputy Director Melvin B. Zisfein expanded the exhibits pro-
gram with several major improvements. The Exploring the Planets
Gallery opened in November and featured an intensive concentra-
tion of information on the planets, the tools of exploration, individual
space missions, and comparative planetology. It represents a new
trend in the museum’s exhibit programs, for it must be updated
concurrently with the new knowledge being transmitted back to
earth from spacecraft depicted in the gallery.

On May 5, 1979, an exhibit entitled “Our Beautiful Earth—The
View from Air and Space” opened in the Art Gallery to widespread
critical and public acclaim. The exhibition included the work of
four aerial photographers—William Garnett, Georg Gerster, Robert
Bucknam, and George Hall—as well as space photographs taken by
astronauts and the unmanned Landsat satellite. This exhibit cap-
tured the public’s fancy and received extensive coverage in a wide
variety of publications.

The seventy-fifth anniversary of powered flight was celebrated
by a public symposium in which five papers on the Wright Brothers
and their 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer were presented. The museum also
opened an exhibit and, with the Smithsonian Institution Press,
published a book in honor of the occasion, The Wright Brothers:
Heirs of Prometheus.

The tenth anniversary of the first manned lunar landing was
honored on July 20, 1979. Special events, extended hours, and a
commemorative book formed part of the celebration of that historic
occasion. The crew of Apollo 11, Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz”
Aldrin, and Michael Collins, participated in a press conference and
a public ceremony on the Mall, in cooperation with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The museum remained open
until 1:30 a.m. on the night of July 20th, with real-time network
coverage of the first walk on the moon being replayed to several
thousand happy, enthusiastic visitors, who seemed to enjoy greatly
a nostalgic “happening.”

Other galleries were improved. A beautifully restored Albatros
D.Va fighter was placed in the World War I Gallery, and Mariner
10, an important spacecraft, was moved from the discontinued Life
in the Universe Gallery to the Space Hall.

The National Air and Space Museum’s Exploring the Planets Gallery, which opened
in November 1978, is highlighted by a full-scale replica of a Voyager spacecraft.
Two Voyagers, launched by nasa in August and September 1977, passed by Jupiter
in March and July of 1979 and will continue to send back data into the 1980s.

Secretary Ripley’s guest book during a special tour of NAsM in February 1979. The
Secretary is behind Deng and to his right is Zhou Lin, Deng’s wife. Melvin Zisfein,
the museum’s deputy director, stands behind Secretary Ripley.

The museum’s most popular gallery, Apollo to the Moon, re-
ceived a very important updating with the inclusion of the “Apollo
Results Exhibit.” This exhibit relates the actual scientific results of
the Apollo missions.

The Vertical Flight Hall was changed to include the Piasecki
PV-2 Helicopter, as well as a unit depicting the many life-saving
roles played by U.S. Coast Guard helicopters.

An important facet of the exhibit program has been increased
attention to maintenance. The visitor traffic has been so much
heavier than predicted that there has been more simple wear-and-
tear on exhibits than expected. As a result, a considerable effort
has been made to repair damage, touch up paint, and so on, to
preserve the museum’s appearance.

A new Max film, Living Planet, sponsored by the Johnson Wax
Company, was introduced. Improved scheduling procedures per-
mitted two more daily showings, and attendance at Living Planet
has actually exceeded attendance of To Fly. The critical response
was very favorable. To Fly, however, has a strong following, and
public demand caused it to be brought back to be shown three times
a day. More than 5,000,000 visitors have attended showings of the
two films. Research is now under way for follow-up films.

A new planetarium show, “Worlds of Tomorrow,” opened in the
Albert Einstein Spacearium in November. This show has proved to
be even more popular than its predecessor, ““Cosmic Awakening,”
and has stimulated additional attendance at other spacearium
events, which now include a weekly presentation ““Noontime with
the Stars” as well as Monthly Sky Lectures.

The preservation, restoration, and storage facility at Silver Hill
completed its facilities-renovation program with the installation of
a sprinkler system in all the major buildings. Some 21,000 people
have visited the ‘‘no frills’ museum, which is open by appointment
only, and now features four complete warehouses and the large
workshop in which restoration takes place. More than 200 aircraft,
spacecraft, and engines can be seen, and during the week, it is
possible to view the craftsmen actually at work on the restorations.

Restoration was completed on the 1912 Curtiss Pusher, the 1911
Bleriot, and the 1944 Messerschmitt Me 262 (the world’s first opera-
tional jet fighter), as well as more than a score of engines and a
dozen large models. The Curtiss and Bleriot engines and models

84 / Smithsonian Year 1979
will be featured in the new Early Flight Gallery, while the Messer-
schmitt will be seen in the Gallery of Jet Aviation. Both galleries will
open in 1980. Work continues on the Langley Aerodrome, Bellanca
CF, Vought F4-U Corsair, and Northrop N1-M Flying Wing.

The inventory program at Silver Hill unearths more artifacts as
it goes on; early museum record-keeping sometimes lumped several
items under a single heading, and the inventory process makes
possible proper identification and cataloguing.

The museum’s strong artifact loan program was improved by
procedures which guarantee that artifacts are properly insured,
stored, and handled, and by a systematic inspection of items at the
loan site. More than 1,531 artifacts are on loan to 214 museums in
the United States and abroad.

A very extensive publications program provided scholars and
public with a number of excellent works during the year.

NASM staff members participated actively in national and re-
gional meetings of professional societies across the country. Per-
haps even more important were the public programs given at the
museums. The 1978 Grierson Memorial Lecture was delivered by
John Fozard, chief designer of the Hawker Siddley Harrier. His
subject was ‘“The Problem and Potentials of Vertical Flight.’”” Mr.
Rocco Petrone delivered the annual von Braun Memorial Lecture,
speaking on “Reflections on von Braun and the Saturn-Apollo
Team.”

A very successful seminar on the “Battle of Britain’ was held on
November 15, 1978. The speakers—two participants in the battle
who had actually engaged in aerial combat with each other—were
General Aldoph Galland of the Luftwaffe and Wing Commander
Robert Stanford Tuck of the Royal Air Force. The seminar was
preceded by a dramatic slide presentation of aviation art prepared
by Curator of Art James Dean.

Brigadier General Benjamin S. Kelsey, usar (Retired), a distin-
guished engineer and test pilot, accepted an appointment as the
Lindbergh Professor of Aerospace History in 1979. General Kelsey
is working on a book on the creation of U.S. airpower for World
War II.

Michael Collins and his “Nasm Team” were presented the Thirty-
sixth Annual Frank G. Brewer Trophy, which is awarded yearly for
the most outstanding development in aviation or space education.

Science / 85
A busy schedule of lectures, films, and special events provided
attractions for visitors on most nights of the week. Lectures in-
cluded “The Active Universe” by E. Margaret Burbidge and
“Spaceship Earth” by Buckminster Fuller. The Aeronautics Depart-
ment continued its well-attended free film series, which will be
followed next year by a similar series on science-fiction films. The
Smithsonian’s Frisbee Disc Festival was held on September 2nd
and was, as usual, a happy, fun-filled event with about 11,000
participants.

In the spring of 1979, the nas Library published a guidebook to
the programs, services, and publications of the National Air and
Space Museum Library collection. The guide describes the scope of
the book and journal collection, as well as the unique archival docu-
mentary files of photographs, drawings, and the audio-visual col-
lection.

A computer terminal and data-storage cassette enabled the li-
brary to access the Office of Computer Services’ central terminal
fasters, eliminating optical character-recognition scanning. The
method produces a rapid turnaround time and allows for major
revisions in the subject organization of the machine-readable func-
tion for the documentary files.

The bibliographic and news data base, Information Bank, based
on the New York Times and other newspaper and magazine biblio-
graphic sources, was introduced as a new information service.

The degree of public service provided to visitors was made the
subject of an informal study, and the results were so surprising
that they had to be validated to be believed. Visitor requests for
information ranging from the ordinary—Where is the restaurant?”
—to the extraordinary—Please show me the proof you have that
Gustave Whitehead was not the first man to fly’—numbered in the
hundreds of thousands. There were 42,312 letters, 5,120 visitors to
the museum offices, and over 800,000 telephone and direct requests
for information.

Curator of Art James Dean received fifty-six offers of artwork,
of which fourteen were accepted, including the largest donation
the museum has ever received from a private source, the Stuart M.
Speiser Collection of Photo-Realist art. Mr. Speiser received the
Smithson Medal in recognition of his donation, which will be the
subject of a special showing in the future.

NATIONAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL FILM CENTER

The National Anthropological Film Center (NaFc) is working to de-
velop the means to take greater advantage of the potential for visual
and aural records as a means of furthering human understanding.
The Film Center deals with questions having to do with the nature
of the human condition, including all aspects of the human heritage,
such as behavioral development, philosophy, ethics, cultural his-
tory, aesthetics, the visual arts, and the behavioral and human
sciences.

Many scholarly interests and currents form the background of
the new field of visual inquiry into human affairs. They come from:
visual arts and pedagogy; the medical and behavioral sciences;
aesthetics and epistemology; anthropology and ethnology; psy-
chology, sociology, and economics; history and political science;
ecology and natural history; and information theory and communi-
cations. Cross-disciplinary approaches have begun to emerge, but
the required new frameworks embracing both the humanities and
sciences still do not exist.

At present, the narc is collaborating with leaders and scholars in
several Third World nations on film documentation of their threat-
ened cultural heritages. Facilities for preservation and retrieval of
the visual data obtained are being developed, in response to interest
and invitations received by the Film Center. The Narc is now re-
sponding in the following countries: Nepal, Tibet, India, Papua New
Guinea, Brazil, Micronesia, the Cook Islands, Bolivia, Pakistan, and
Sudan.

In order to provide the broadest possible latitude for independent
scholarly development of visual data on vanishing ways of life, the
NaFc has been experimenting with various kinds of support to
filmmakers and scholars interested in producing films as permanent
scholarly resources. This effort includes: providing consulting
services, filmmaking expertise, or equipment; supplying film stock,
processing facilities, logistic support, training, assembly, and an-
notation services; helping with grant applications; and supplying
preservation service and facilities for analysis. In providing such

Science / 87
assistance, the NAFC maintains a flexible policy aimed at filling
project gaps with resources not otherwise available.

For accurate, up-to-date information on the variety, distribution,
and conditions of the ways of life currently extant in the world,
the Film Center relies on scholars who are personally knowledge-
able about particular regions. In this way, the NaFc can share the
sophisticated understanding possessed by specialists affiliated with
various universities and research institutes actively investigating
and learning more about the state of human organization across the
world.

The National Research Film Collection is being developed as a
means of preserving the irreplaceable records of visual data that
document the various expressions of human potential, organization,
and behavior in social and cultural contexts.

The growing National Research Film Collection is now nearing
2,000,000 feet of film. This body of irreplaceable documents repre-
sents aspects of life throughout the world (see the “List of Donors
to the Smithsonian Institution,” Appendix 9).

The research efforts of the NaFc touch on several program areas:
(1) inquiry into the human condition; (2) studies of human behavior
and development. As the characteristic patterns of behavior take
hold of and mold a growing child, they can reveal how basic human
potential may respond to various conditions of life and how the
patterned responses characteristic of a culture emerge from these
conditions; (3) examination of the nature of human knowledge.
Emerging as a natural corollary to the Narc’s studies is the question
of the nature of human knowledge. Such important issues as the
limits of contemporary scientific method in humanistic studies keep
arising in the course of inquiry into human nature—theoretical
issues relating to the problems of applying the methodology of the
natural sciences to studies of human existence. Key among these
issues is the problem of reflexivity. The objective methods of natu-
ral science are well suited to obtaining knowledge by which the
materials and things of the world can be manipulated for human
benefit, because, in part, these methods divorce the question of
value from the process of inquiry. However, when people examine
people; when humankind is both examiner and examinee, a reflex-
ive epistemological situation is established that may not be separa-
ble from values.

88 / Smithsonian Year 1979
All purposeful human activity is impelled by some human value.
A great variety of different human values exists in the world. All of
these values impel inquiry and activity in their own ways, and in
the arena of life, the human condition partakes of and adjusts to
the many currents of meaning and value. While the methods of
natural science are powerful tools, they remain servants of human
values and thus are poorly equipped to fathom the nature of life
itself. This poses a rather fundamental difference between the na-
ture of natural science on the one side and humanistic studies on
the other. The narc seeks to bridge this gap between the humani-
ties and science.

From the earliest days of the concept of a National Film Studies
Center, the need for research and development on systems of visual-
data management, collection, and retrieval, has been recognized.
The narc has continued to work on equipment and systems design
as part of the task of developing an effective program.

In order to surpass the existing camera technology so as to ob-
tain high-quality, synchronous-sound, visual records of daily
activity in remote cultures, the Narc has established some new
specifications for equipment to gather visual data in daily life
situations.

Professional filmmaking had required a two-person team in order
to record both picture and sound. Experience showed that two
people created a society of their own in other cultures and so
attracted considerably more attention than one person with a
camera. The interactions between these “strange beings” was in
effect a show. For this reason, the narc developed design specifica-
tions for a rig that would be operated by a single person. Then
the Film Center obtained the services of specialized instrument
makers. After a year and a half of testing and reworking, the NAFc
has equipment that works well. It has equipped all its teams with
this new data-gathering instrument.

Developed from the small Ethnofilm Training Program for De-
veloping Nations (initiated in 1974 with a grant from the Wenner-
Gren Foundation), the current Ethnofilm Training Program has
been designed in cooperation with the Anthropology Film Center in
Santa Fe to train students to obtain researchable film samples of
human behavior in the context of vanishing and changing cultures.
Based on the belief that individuals from other cultures enrich such

Science / 89
samples, because of their different, often more expert, cultural per-
ceptions, this program specifically involves members of non-
Western cultures.

The first such participant was a graduate student in anthropology
from the University of Delhi in India. He returned to India to
complete a comparative film study on the divergent patterns of hu-
man development among the ironsmithing nomads of northern
India and isolated Tibetan-speaking mountain people in Lahul. The
naFc has also trained students from the Western Caroline Islands
of Micronesia and from Tibet; from Harvard University and Ameri-
can University; and, from Brazil, a psychologist from the Museu
do Indio. All of these students have already been involved in film
study projects in Third World nations.

On the occasion of the visit of His Holiness the fourteenth Dalai
Lama, spiritual leader of the world’s Buddhists, the Nnarc prepared
a special program of excerpts from its Study of Traditional Tibetan
Civilization. This program included showings of ancient Tibetan
rites and rituals for the first time; aspects of the movements, ex-
pressions, and styles of dialect exchanges; the training and lives of
young monks; the basic respect-relations that are part of Tibetan
family organization; and the spirit-possession and oracle of Stok,

Ladakh.

RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC STUDIES

The Research Institute on Immigration and Ethnic Studies (r1£s)
has maintained its efforts to facilitate and promote the study of the
impact of contemporary immigration upon, and its discernible im-
plications for the future of, the United States and the international
community.

In the past year, the institute continued to expand its publication
series, completing and sending to press: Quantitative Data and
Immigration Research, edited by Stephen R. Couch and Roy S.
Bryce-Laporte, as a part of the Research Notes Series; Culture,
Disease, and Stress Among Latinos, by Lucy M. Cohen, as a special
study; and Sourcebook on the New Immigration: Implications for
the United States and the International Community, edited by Roy
S. Bryce-Laporte, with the assistance of Delores M. Mortimer and
Stephen R. Couch, as a special publication published by Transac-
tion Press. It is accompanied by the Sourcebook on the New Immi-

90 / Smithsonian Year 1979

gration: Supplement, edited by Roy S. Bryce-Laporte, with the
assistance of Delores M. Mortimer and Stephen R. Couch.

The staff attended numerous symposia in 1978-79. Dr. Roy
Bryce-Laporte, rues director, served as a participant and official
North American unesco observer at the unesco Conference on
Studies of the African Diaspora and the Caribbean, in the Domini-
can Republic. He participated in the Ethnohistory Society Meetings
in Chicago and the Spring Symposium on the Political Economy of
the Black World, at the Afro-American Studies Center, ucLa, where
he presented the paper “American Plantation Expansion and West
Indian Labor Migration into Central America: Limon, Costa Rica,
4870-1948”; and at the Afro-American Studies Symposium, held at
the University of Pennsylvania and at Haverford College, Haver-
ford, Pennsylvania, he presented the paper “The Persisting Signifi-
cance of Race: The Perplexing Significance of Class.” He partici-
pated in the Columbia Faculty Seminar on Cultural Pluralism,
Columbia University, and served as an official observer and par-
ticipant at CARIFESTA in Cuba, where he participated in the seminar
on Identity and Culture. He also opened a session at the Interna-
tional Conference on the Caribbean sponsored by the Center for
Economic and Social Studies of the Third World, Mexico City,
Mexico, where he presented his paper on ‘Problems in Defining
the Caribbean: An Overview.”

Dr. Stephen R. Couch, rues research coordinator, presented the
paper “Directions of Research on Recent U. S. Immigration:

National Museum of Natural History

Of the many events at the National Museum of Natural History
(nMNH) during the past year, two stand out: the opening of ‘“Dy-
namics of Evolution’’—a new exhibit hall that outlines the evolu-
tionary process—and the beginning of a comprehensive inventory
of the sixty million specimens in the museum’s collections.

Involving anthropology, botany, paleobiology, and zoology,
evolution is a unifying theme for the natural sciences, and for this
reason, “Dynamics of Evolution” was installed in a central location
on the museum’s main floor. As the visitors walk through the hall,
they pass through areas that sequentially illustrate the basic con-
cepts of the evolutionary process.

Over the next five years, all of the older natural science exhibits
on the museum’s main floor will be thematically integrated with the
new hall. The east dinosaur gallery and the smaller fossil halls
around it have already been closed for renovation and are scheduled
to reopen in phases between March 1980 and December 1981.

Until this year, inventories of the museum’s collection had been
performed piecemeal, partially by manual means and partially by
using the museum’s Automatic Data Processing (app) facilities. But
now an accelerated app program has begun, with the objective of
establishing a computerized record of the museum’s full collection.

By the end of fiscal year 1979, more than 11 million specimen
and lot records will have been entered into the computer. In the
years ahead, just over eight million more records are expected to
be added to this data base. From then on, it will be possible to
reinventory the full collection swiftly, efficiently, and inexpensively
on a regular basis.

The initial inventory work—which more than eighty persons
were hired to help carry out—focused on collections that are to
be moved to the Smithsonian’s Museum Support Center when that
facility opens in 1982. Because of this priority, much of the in-
ventory work was concentrated in 1979 on the museum’s 3.5 mil-
lion anthropological specimens, approximately 90 percent of which
will be relocated to the Support Center.

In carrying out the inventory, all the newly recorded app data
is compared against the old records to make certain that collection
specimens are in their proper places. Many specimens—such as
minerals and fossils—are becoming very valuable, and the inven-
tory will make it possible to improve control of these objects.

Note is also being made of the conditions of specimens so that
conservation measures can be taken when necessary. This is
especially important with the anthropological materials, many of
which were collected in the nineteenth century and are subject to
deterioration.

Other significant exhibit events at the museum in 1978-79 in-
cluded the opening of an exhibit of 185 ceremonial Mexican dance
masks purchased by the museum from Donald and Mary Cordry of
Cuernavaca, Mexico, who had assembled the most completely docu-
mented and extensive collection of Mexican masks in existence. In
late 1978, through funding provided by the Women’s Committee of
the Smithsonian Associates, the museum launched a series of ex-
hibits on the staff’s research. These exhibits, to date, have focused
on John Ewers’s Plains Indian studies; Storrs Olson’s fossil bird
research; Brian Mason’s Antarctica meteorite investigations; and
Lyman Smith’s and Robert Read’s bromeliad research. A small
gallery area was opened in 1979 in the second floor Indian Hall to
show photographs from the collections of the museum’s Anthro-
pological Archives. ‘“The Working Woman,” depicting traditional
activities of American women, was the first of these exhibits. The
museum’s Office of Education opened a new gallery area in 1978 in
its Learning Center. Exhibits shown there included a collection of
Japanese dolls, nature photographs by NmMNH photographer Kjell
Sandved, and Eskimo graphics and sculptures.

The Office of Education expanded its Outreach Program to elderly
and institutionalized adults and children in the Washington, D.C.,
area in 1978-79, and inaugurated free Saturday film and demonstra-

94 / Smithsonian Year 1979
tion programs, especially aimed at family audiences. Major renova-
tions were begun in the office’s Discovery Room, visited by over
100,000 persons annually since its opening in 1974. Funding for
this renovation was provided by the Smithson Society and the
Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates.

In June 1979, Porter M. Kier stepped down after six years as
director of the National Museum of Natural History and was
awarded the Smithsonian’s Henry Medal by Secretary Ripley, for
“carrying the museum into a new era—developing modernized ex-
hibits that interpret the natural sciences for the American people.”
Dr. James F. Mello assumed the acting directorship of the museum.

NMNH archaeologist Dr. Gus Van Beek has completed nine sea-
sons of field excavations at Tell Jemmeh, an ancient town site in
Israel’s western Negev desert, unearthing a mass of valuable data
on an area of unique historical importance.

In the last two years of work at the site (1977-78), two deep
probe excavations sunk in the twelve-acre, forty-five-foot-high tell,
confirmed that it was first occupied on the east side about 3200 B.c.
by asmall group of farming and hunting people.

The first settlement lasted only 200 years. A long period followed
when Tell Jemmeh and other areas of the Negev were left in the
hands of roaming nomads.

Canaanites resettled the Negev about 1700 B.c., and agriculture
was resumed on the Negev land. About 1550 B.c., the town began
to spread over the entire site. An astonishing amount of debris—
as much as eighteen feet at points—accumulated on the tell over
the next 350 years. According to Van Beek, this suggests that the
city was razed by rival Canaanite invaders more than once—and
rebuilt each time.

When war was not raging, Canaanite Tell Jemmeh was a thriving
international trade center. It provided an inland market, only 61/2
miles from the Mediterranean coast, for the sale of imported goods
from Cyprus and the Aegean area. The tell also lay along the great
Arabian incense route. Camel caravans laden with frankincense and
myrrh, bound for the Mediterranean port of Gaza, made the town
an overnight stop.

The probe excavations pointed to considerable industrial activity
by 1500 s.c. within the little Canaanite town. Pottery kilns, black-
smith shops, and possibly lime-burning furnaces were in operation.

Science / 95
One of Van Beek’s discoveries on the west side of the tell—
progressively excavated seasonally from 1971 to 1978—was a
cobblestone courtyard (forty-six feet long by eighteen feet wide)
that he believes may have been a public gathering place associated
with a temple or possibly the palace of the reigning king. It dates to
the thirteenth century B.c., the final period of Canaanite occupation
at Tell Jemmeh.

The Canaanites were overcome in the twelfth century B.c by an
onslaught of Philistine tribes. The Philistines, who had a strong
ethnic identity, created new interregional markets, and the town
continued as a bustling production and trade center.

A large kiln operated by the Philistines in the twelfth century
was excavated by Van Beek’s team (1975-77). Study of this kiln,
one of the largest and most technically sophisticated that has ever
come to light in the Near East, is shedding light on ancient ceramic
technology.

Philistine control of Tell Jemmeh ended in the seventh century
B.c., when the region was invaded by Assyrians. The archaeological
team excavated and examined in detail a large, six-room, mud-brick
building that was the residence of an Assyrian military governor.
Its vaulted basement ceilings were built with the first known
keystone-shaped mud bricks, a discovery that adds a new chapter
to Middle Eastern architectural history.

As part of a massive grain conservation project for the Negev
region, huge cylindrical grain silos were erected in the final century
or so of Tell Jemmeh’s occupation (about 310-200 B.c.), when the
Negev was part of the Ptolemaic Empire. One of these granaries—
the largest and best preserved ever found in Israel and one of con-
siderable architectural interest—was excavated and studied by Van
Beek.

Tell Jemmeh was abandoned between 200 and 150 s.c. Van Beek
believes that its water resources—springs in the riverbed that winds
along and cuts into the tell’s north side—dried up.

Scientists at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural
History are playing a significant role in supporting an international
conservation effort to preserve the Galapagos Islands. Some 600
miles off the coast of Ecuador, the islands are populated by unusual,
often bizarre animals, marine life, and plants, amidst a spectacular
panorama of volcanoes, active and extinct. Observations of this

remarkable setting were important to the naturalist Charles Darwin
in his development of the concepts of evolution.

In 1959, the centenary of the publication of Darwin’s Origin of
Species, action was taken to begin the reversal of trends which had
begun to disrupt the islands’ fragile ecosystem. Ecuador declared
all of the archipelago a natural park and enacted laws for the pro-
tection of the indigenous wildlife, and the Charles Darwin Founda-
tion (cDF) was established, an international organization devoted to
conservation and science in the Galapagos.

The success of conservation in the Galapagos Islands depends
upon scientific study. NMNH’s Raymond Fosberg, a world authority
on tropical island ecology, said about the archipelago:

“Man has initiated the degradation of a remarkable ecosystem.
Whether he can put “Humpty-Dumpty together again” is question-
able. It is possible to try, however, and the first step should be to
make a serious attempt at understanding the ecosystem, both as it
was and as it is.”

Over the past fifteen years, scientists working at the Darwin
Research Station and in scientific institutions throughout the world
have made important strides in this direction. Some NMNH contribu-
tions are listed below.

NMNH’s Thomas Simkin, who specializes in studies of volcanoes
that erupt in midocean, has been monitoring Fernandina, currently
the most active Galapagos volcano. It is the most westerly of the
large Galapagos islands, and the rim of its crater rises nearly a mile
above sea level. Simkin first went to the Galapagos in 1968, when
one of the most spectacular volcanic events of this century took
place as the floor of Fernandina crater collapsed, dropping 1,200
feet in the course of nine days.

Caldera collapses are common in the geological record and have
created features such as Oregon’s Crater Lake. But they occur
rarely in historic time. The last collapse of this magnitude was
Katami, Alaska, in 1912. The much more advanced remote sensing
capabilities of recent decades have provided far more useful data
about the Galapagos collapse.

Simkin has been continuing his studies of the effects of this event
and the lesser eruptions that followed at Fernandina in 1972, 1973,
1977, and 1978. The physical processes that he is studying are
those that have repeatedly modified the Galapagos’ physical and

98 / Smithsonian Year 1979
biological environment over the three million years of the islands’
existence.

The list of NMNH scientists who have published taxonomic studies
of the Galapagos flora and fauna is a long one. Included are: J.
Laurens Barnard, amphipods; J. F. Gates Clarke, microlepidoptera;
F. R. Fosberg, vegetation; Richard C. Froeschner, lace bugs; Paul
Hurd, carpenter bees; A. Colby Child, sea spiders; John M. Burns,
skipper butterflies; Harold Rehder, mollusks; Thomas Bowman,
amphipods; George Watson, seabirds; S. Dillon Ripley, rails;
Raymond Manning, shrimp; and David Steadman, fossil verte-
brates. The late Waldo Schmitt was the first NMNH scientist to take
a major interest in the islands.

NMNH’s James Norris and Katina Bucher are working offshore
from the islands to collect marine algae and quantitative data for
ecological, systematic, and chemical studies. One important benefit
of this work is baseline information necessary to monitor environ-
mental changes in Galapagos waters as a result of tourism.

To compare different marine provinces within the archipelago,
permanent transects were established on island sites with warm
water temperatures and colder upwelled water. This data is being
analyzed for interisland and seasonal variation comparisons of
species composition, diversity, and community structure of the
benthic marine plants and invertebrate animals. Seasonal changes
are being recorded by resurveying the same transects at different
times of the year. Over 20,000 specimens from twenty-four islands
in two seasons represent the most extensive marine botanical col-
lections ever made in this unigue region. Over 36 percent of the
marine flora is endemic to the archipelago. Norris and Bucher sug-
gest that the new collections will increase the species known from
the Galapagos by 30 percent. Many new distributional records and
some new species have already been found in their systematic
studies.

NMNH’s Duane Hope, a specialist on nematodes, accompanied
Norris and Bucher on one of their recent diving expeditions to
collect nematode species that live amidst the Galapagos algae. He
brought back general collections of marine fauna, including speci-
mens of the giant starfish Luidia superba, measuring thirty-three
inches across and with arms up to sixteen inches long, now under
study by nmnu’s Maureen Downey.

Science / 99
Nearly 300 miles northeast of Galapagos, giant worms ranging
up to five feet in length were discovered 8,000 feet beneath the
ocean last year by National Science Foundation-supported scientists
diving in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s submersible
Alvin. The worms possess no mouth and no digestive tract. NMNH’S
Dr. Meridith Jones believes that as they have no capability for
handling particulate foods, their nourishment must be at the mo-
lecular level. For this reason, he says, one is forced to accept the
fact that an animal five feet long and one-and-a-half inches in
diameter can take up molecular food in sufficient quantities to sup-
port this large mass of tissue.

The worms live in seafloor rift zones in which water is heated by
deep fissures into the earth’s interior. The waters in these areas are
saturated with sulfur compounds that are toxic to most animals.
But communities of sea animals are able to survive in this unique
ecological niche by feeding on bacteria and other microorganisms
that metabolize sulfur dioxide rather than oxygen, or, in the case
of the worms, molecular metabolites. The worms appear to be
unique among the higher animals in that they deposit crystals of
elemental sulfur in their tissue. Whether this is a result of sulfur
metabolism by them or a means of detoxifying body fluids has yet
to be determined.

The Galapagos worms are members of a relatively newly recog-
nized taxon, the Vestimentifera, first described ten years ago and
considered to be either part of the phylum Pogonophora or the
phylum Annelida, according to the views of different researchers.
The phylum Pogonophora has some basic morphological similarities
—such as the lack of mouth and digestive tract—to the Galapagos
worms, but there are other morphological characters that the two
groups do not share. The net result is that Jones believes that the
Galapagos worms should be assigned to a subphylum status in the
phylum Pogonophora, even though the Vestimentifera as a whole
has relationships to the phylum Annelida. Jones expects to delve
deeper into this matter in November 1979 when he will take part
in an expedition to the Galapagos to dive in the Alvin to collect
and observe the worms.

In the dim recesses of the basement of the National Museum of
Natural History, marine researcher Walter H. Adey and a team of
coworkers have succeeded, for the first time anywhere, in develop-

100 / Smithsonian Year 1979
ing a functioning, growing coral reef. More than 130 species of
Caribbean reef plants and animals have been transplanted into an
1,800-gallon tank, which creates a balanced reef ecosystem with
functions and processes that mirror the natural habitat.

Dr. Adey attributes his success in preserving the reef’s natural
balance primarily to two devices. First, the twelve-by-four-by-six-
foot tank is lighted by sixteen 400-watt metal halide lamps. These
lamps simulate the intensity of tropical sunlight and are timed to
provide a normal daily cycle of light and dark. The second key
piece of equipment is an automatic wave generator that simulates
both the wave action and current required by a natural reef. These
and other totally new procedures, which have ultimately led to the
creation of the reef microcosm, were the result of more than eight
years of intensive study of Caribbean reefs.

For years, Caribbean reefs were thought to be stunted and barren
in comparison with those in the western Pacific, but the investiga-
tions of Adey and his colleagues have shown the fallacy of this
belief. His findings are based on numerous reef cores taken from
many lesser Antillean Islands, the study of the cross section in a
ship channel cut through the reef in St. Croix, and recent studies
of water chemistry in St. Croix and Martinque.

Modern reef development, Adey found, is controlled by complex
factors. The single most important of these is the shape and nature
of the pre-existing shoreline. Its influence is strongly modified by
the pattern of sea-level rise after each glaciation. A secondary factor
of considerable importance is the strength and constancy of wave
action. Adey’s work has shown that eastern and western Caribbean
reefs differ in ways principally related to sea and swell charac-
teristics.

Adey and his students also have discovered that tropical reefs,
as they build and develop over several thousand years, pass through
a series of well-defined successional stages, much as do many
terrestrial communities. The organisms present in a reef, and its
surface appearance, can differ markedly in each stage, so much so
that in some cases one structure might not even be recognized as a
coral reef.

It has been known for several decades that coral reefs are very
productive biological systems. Adey and his students have shown
that primary productivity—the building of organic compounds

Science / 101
using sunlight—varies according to the stage of succession, later
stages being more productive than the earlier ones in which most
reef building occurs.

Adey and his students have demonstrated that the reef’s algal
turf, in combination with wave surge, produces the tremendous
productivity of mature reefs. Constant wave surge serves to provide
maximum exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to
these rapidly metabolizing plants.

The algal turf grows so rapidly that it is never totally consumed
by the large number of parrot fish, sea urchins, and other reef
animals that graze on it. Contrary to expectations, maximum pro-
ductivity and energy flow derive in part from biomass being con-
centrated in grazers.

Well-developed reefs occur in the tropics, where sunlight is
usually consistent and intense. Adey’s observations show that the
mature reef is a master in capturing solar energy and inducing it to
flow through its system. It was because Adey wanted to study this
energy flow, a necessity for all biological systems, as well as other
features of reefs, that he decided to build his reef microcosm in
NMNH’s basement. By working simultaneously with natural reefs
and this experimental unit, Adey and his team hope to understand
the mechanics of this most complex of ecosystems.

This past year, NMNH mineralogist Daniel Appleman collaborated
with predoctoral fellow Izumi Nakai from Tsukuba University,
Japan, to determine the crystal structures of the rare minerals gerst-
leyite and laffittite. Gerstleyite, a hydrous sodium arsenic-antimony
sulfide, proved to have a unique structure based on rings of
antimony-sulfur pyramids linked to chains. Laffittite, a silver-
mercury-arsenic sulfide, is a sulfosalt with close-packed sulfur and
ordered metal atoms. Both structures enlarge our knowledge of the
role of arsenic and antimony in sulfide ore deposits.

Foraminifera are tiny, single-celled, shelled protozoa, each the
size of a tiny sand grain, which live almost everywhere in the sur-
face waters and on the bottoms of the present oceans. Because of
their great abundance and their limy shell (preserved in mud after
the death of the animal), they are recovered in large numbers in
rock deposits formed under the sea millions of years ago.

The world’s largest collection of foraminifera fossils is housed
at the National Museum of Natural History—a half million speci-

102 / Smithsonian Year 1979

mens, each preserved on a glass microscope slide. These specimens
are consulted frequently by petroleum geologists to date sediments
and to help determine potential locations of oil deposits.

Dr. Richard Cifelli is charting the distribution of the so-called
“pelagic” foraminifera that live in the surface layers of the oceans,
where currents transport them over hundreds of square miles.
Working on oceanographic vessels in the North Atlantic, Cifelli
drags a fine-meshed plankton net in the water, separating the
“forams” from the other animals collected with a special furnace
technique he has developed. In the furnace, the soft, organic-tissued
plankton burn up, leaving the shelly remains of foraminifera.

When these remains are identified and counted, Cifelli can plot
the species distribution and relate them to ocean currents. By doing
so, he can see that different water masses in the North Atlantic are
characterized by different species associations, and he can make
estimates of what the water masses were like. Thus he is learning
more about the ancient ocean and past climatic conditions and how
they have changed through time.

Dr. Martin A. Buzas studies the bottom-living foraminifera, the
so-called “benthonic” forms, which have been important rock
builders in the past. He specializes in ones that are found in shallow
water and close to the shore.

Buzas is especially interested in ecological factors that influence
foraminifera distribution and abundance. Until recently, scientists
looked only at physical conditions, such as temperature and water
salinity. But Buzas’s data indicates that competition between differ-
ent species of animals is equally important. He is trying to find out
what effect predation has on foraminifera populations and how
important the foraminifera are as food for clams, crabs, fish,
worms, and other large marine animals.

At Fort Pierce, Florida, where the Smithsonian operates a floating
barge as a marine laboratory, Buzas and an assistant, Karen Carle,
recently set up an experiment designed to provide insight into these
ecological questions.

Cutting sections out of the sides of large trash cans, Buzas and
Carle covered the holes with nylon screen fine enough to keep out
predators and yet sufficiently large for microorganisms such as
foraminifera to flow into the can. The bottom of the can was first
filled with sediment, and then the entire container was placed in

Science / 103
shallow water. Screens were changed twice a week to keep them
from becoming fouled. Every month, the sediment in the can was
sampled and the foraminifera density measured. Less than a thou-
sand individual foraminifera were found for every twenty milliliters
of sediment outside the can. However, the researchers found five
times that many forams inside the can in the same sediment quan-
tity, clear evidence of the importance of predation in pruning
foraminifera populations.

Buzas estimates that the living wet-weight of foraminifera being
consumed adds up to twenty to thirty grams per square meter per
month—a substantial food source for predators. His experiments,
now in progress, are giving some indication of just how important
foraminifera are to the ecology of an estuarine area.

Early in the autumn, as the skies over the Atlantic coast become
crowded with millions of birds winging south for the winter, a less
visible migration is also taking place. In late September and early
October, herds of bottle-nosed dolphins are swimming south be-
tween Long Island, New York, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina,
on the return leg of an annual journey.

For the past several years, their migration has been closely
monitored by NMNH marine biologist Dr. James G. Mead. How
many dolphins are there? Where, what, and when do they eat?
When and where do they mate? What affects their migration
patterns?

To answer these questions, Mead and his assistant, Charles Potter,
travel along the coast almost as much as the dolphins. From his
studies, Mead has learned much about migration patterns, which
vary from year to year, depending on such factors as the tempera-
ture of the water and the abundance and kinds of fish available to
the dolphins. Basically, the dolphins winter off the North Carolina
coast, or sometimes farther south, until spring, when they begin
heading north. Each herd is composed of several hundred members,
organized loosely in groups of ten or fifteen, moving a mile or two
apart. One herd follows another, and it takes as long as two months
for all the herds to get under way. Although no census has been
taken of this migration in many years, there are probably more
than 10,000 dolphins involved, according to Mead. By the end of
May, the first herds are off Virginia and, by late June, they are as

far north as Sandy Hook, New Jersey. There they remain for up
to two months before starting back.

Mead is making plans to track one of the dolphin groups through
its entire journey. Radio transmitters and other sophisticated
technological equipment will not be needed—only field glasses.
Dolphins are prone to injuries on their dorsal fins, and these create
distinct markings. The scars are not visible from the air but can be
spotted by observers from shipboard or on shore and should make
it possible to follow individual animals and other members of the
group as they move up the coast.

In addition to these studies, marine animal strandings also pro-
vide valuable information to Mead and Potter. Of 480 marine mam-
mals stranded along the Atlantic shore last year, 320 were dolphins.
Arriving at the scene of a stranding, Mead performs detailed
autopsies on the animals. External body measurements are taken to
provide data for systematic studies. He also examines stomach
contents and reproductive organs and collects samples of tissue,
blood, and parasites for laboratory analysis.

To cover the hundreds of miles of Atlantic shore that hs is un-
able to patrol, Mead relies on a network of observers organized by
the museum’s Scientific Event Alert Network (sean). These indi-
viduals pass along information about dolphins, whales, and other
beached marine mammals. If Mead or Potter cannot go to the
scene, SEAN tries to find someone living in the area of the stranding
who can autopsy the animal and send study samples to the
museum, adding to the museum’s already large collection of infor-
mation on marine mammals.

The box that recently arrived at the Smithsonian from Southeast
Asia contained a new species of Anopheles mosquito—a deadly
carrier of drug-resistant malaria that infests Thailand, Cambodia,
and Vietnam.

The mosquito had been collected in Thailand by U.S. Army
malaria researchers and had been identified as Anopheles balaba-
censis, a malaria carrier common to Borneo, Malaya, Assam, Burma,
the southern Philippines, and Java.

It was shipped to the Smithsonian because a scientist in Thailand
noticed that its biting behavior was peculiar. Balbacensis and other
Anopheles malaria-carriers as a rule attack humans at dusk, where-
as swarms of this mosquito were found looking for a meal much

106 / Smithsonian Year 1979
later in the evening, biting most people between midnight and
2:00 A.M.

At the Smithsonian, E. L. Peyton, a staff member of the Medical
Entomology Project (mer) at the National Museum of Natural His-
tory, examined the specimen, compared it with the Philippine Type
of balabacensis, and discovered that it had been misidentified. The
alternating light and dark bands on its wings were slightly different
from the true balabacensis mosquito. Here was a distinctly new
species.

Peyton determined the taxonomic character of the new species,
making it possible to distinguish it from other mosquitoes. He also
carried out biological studies that demonstrated that the mosquito
is a probable major vector (carrier) of malaria wherever it occurs
in Southeast Asia. In some areas, it may be the only vector. In
recognition of the harm that it causes, Peyton selected the Latin
name dirus (fearful) for the species.

Identification of dirus is making it possible to learn where the
immature stages occur—usually in small scattered puddles on the
forest fringes—information essential to any efforts to eradicate the
species.

MEP is the leading center of research on mosquito biosystematics
in the United States, and Anopheles dirus is only one of hundreds
of Southeast Asian Anopheles mosquitoes that have received de-
tailed taxonomic study over the past fifteen years by the staff.

The Southeast Asia Mosquito Project (sEAMP) was established in
1964 at the National Museum of Natural History, funded by the
U. S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. This
cooperative arrangement continues today as the Medical Ento-
mology Project (MEP). The change in the name reflects the expansion
of the staff’s research to Africa and Latin America and to the
mosquito groups that are the vectors of yellow fever, filariasis,
dengue fever, and encephalitis. These diseases, combined with
malaria, kill and debilitate several hundred million persons every
year. Malaria has been reduced considerably throughout the world
over the past twenty years, but now, because of lack of funding
for control programs, it is experiencing a resurgence.

NMNH’s contributions to research in tropical medicine date back
to the early 1900s, when the United States was attempting to eradi-
cate yellow fever and malaria in Cuba, where U.S. troops were

Science / 107
stationed, and in Panama, where the U.S. was engaged in construc-
tion of the canal. The museum has large holdings of tropical
mosquitoes as a legacy of this work, including such historically
interesting specimens as those studied by Major Walter Reed in
Cuba.

The geographical coverage of the museum’s collection was
further enlarged in the World War II years, when the museum
became the depository for large numbers of specimens collected in
the South Pacific and Asia. Mep’s work has added to this nucleus
hundreds of thousands of Southeast Asian mosquitoes. Over all,
the Smithsonian mosquito collection is now the largest in the world,
numbering more than 500,000 specimens, including 1,200 Types.
Currently the museum is in the process of accessioning an addi-
tional 250,000 mosquitoes collected from North, Central, and South
America by Dr. John Belkin of the University of California.

MEP is currently directed by Dr. Oliver Flint of the museum’s
Department of Entomology. mer has its own support staff, con-
sisting of an administrative assistant, collections manager, several
scientific illustrators, and museum technicians. Scientists on the
staff are working on a variety of projects. Dr. Yiau-Min Huang is
studying African yellow fever and virus vectors; Mr. George K.
Bryce and Dr. Sunthorn Sirivankarn are focusing on New World
vectors of malaria and viral disease, including Venezuelan equine
encephalitis; Captain Michael Faran, one of the project’s Walter
Reed collaborators, is studying South American malaria vectors;
E. L. Peyton and Walter Reed’s Dr. Ronald Ward are continuing
their work on important Southeast Asian vectors, in collaboration
with Major Bruce Harrison of Walter Reed’s Thailand research
laboratory.

The Peruvian Amazon Basin, especially the western periphery
along the moist eastern slope of the Andes, contains what is per-
haps one of the largest unexplored rain forests in the world.

For a volume on the Flora of Peru that is under preparation,
NMNH botanist Dr. Dieter Wasshausen has made four collecting
trips over the last five years to learn what species of Acanthaceae
plants inhabit this rich tropical region.

The Acanthaceae is a family of flowering tropical plants that
makes up an important part of the vegetation of Peru and other
countries of the New World tropics. For most of northern and

108 / Smithsonian Year 1979
coastal Peru, sufficient material is now available to permit the
floristic treatment of Acanthaceae. But there is still a significant
lack of knowledge about the east Andean slopes.

This is largely because the east Andes is such a difficult region
for a botanist to survey. The roads stop at Andean coffee-planta-
tion outposts. To penetrate farther, Wasshausen must travel in a
canoe or small motor launch, stopping downstream where there
are logging trails on which he can hike into the wilderness and
collect.

Wasshausen has been focusing his survey on certain areas of
the Andean slope that survived the dry Quaternary periods as wet-
forest refuges. Here he finds that the evolutionary differentiation
of the Acanthaceae is at its zenith. Some of these refuge areas are
in the Upper Maraftén Valley, the Chanchamayo and Apurimac
valleys, the Upper Urubamba Valley, and the Upper Madre de
Dios basin, comprising the Rios Manu and Inambari valleys.

One of the important questions that these refuges pose concerns
the ways in which plants there are related to the vegetation in the
neighboring forest zones. Opportunities to study this problem are
arising as the Peruvian government opens up new agricultural
lands. Wasshausen points out that new roads being constructed
into the Amazonian lowlands usually cross the Andes chains at the
lowest passes, and it is in these vicinities that overlapping vegeta-
tion areas may be found. He feels it is critical for botanists to study
these newly accessible ecological habitats while the vegetation is
still relatively pristine.

Sharing Wasshausen’s interest in this region is his colleague
Dr. Laurence Skog, a specialist in the Gesneriaceae, the African
violet family. This family occurs as almost 2,000 species in the
tropics. It will be a key part of the Peruvian Flora. Like Wass-
hausen, Skog has sparse material from the eastern slopes of the
Andes. He collected in Andean cloud forests in several parts of
Peru in 1978 and hopes to make species inventories in other areas
of the region before they are cleared for agriculture and the natural
vegetation is lost forever.

In the field, both scientists are interested in making observations
of the reproductive biology of their plants. There is a great diver-
sity of animal groups important to this process for both families,
including hummingbirds, bats, moths and butterflies, and small

Science / 109
bees. These plant/animal relationships must be studied in order to
understand the different breeding systems used for maintaining the
species.

One Generiaceae genus studied by Dr. Skog is an epiphyte, a
plant that hangs from tree branches. Ants, drawn to the plant by
nectar glands on its leaves and stems, collect the plant’s seeds,
which are coated with a tissue that ants like to eat. The ants carry
the seeds back to the nest that they build on the branches of forest
trees. After they eat the tissue coating, they leave the seed core in
the nest, where it can germinate. Soon a plant sprouts out of the ant
nest. In this way, the ants serve the plant by dispersing it and by
literally planting the seeds in their nest. There is some evidence
that they also pollinate the plant’s flowers.

Ants were long thought responsible for the pollination of many
red-flowered rain-forest species of Acanthaceae. But on a recent
trip to Peru, Dr. Wasshausen discovered that the true pollinator is
a small bee. The ants found on the plants are in a symbiotic rela-
tionship with leaf-hoppers on the flowers. It appears that the leaf-
hoppers extract leaf nutrients from the plant and give off a sticky,
sweet substance that is ingested by the ants. The ants in turn pro-
tect the leaf-hoppers from other predators.

The biological scope of the museum’s Scientific Event Alert Net-
work (sEAN) broadened substantially with the addition of a grow-
ing network of correspondents reporting beachings of marine
turtles, many species of which are endangered by egg collecting,
incidental catches by fishermen, and habitat encroachment. In its
first 8 bulletins of 1979, seEAN reported 181 turtle beachings in
addition to 620 whale strandings (9 of which were mass strandings),
71 beachings of pinnipeds, and 62 deaths of manatees, another
endangered species.

A sean-sponsored interdisciplinary workshop on the April 1979
eruption of Soufriére of St. Vincent was held at the Smithsonian’s
Front Royal, Virginia, conference center, September 6-8. Volcanol-
ogists, seismologists, meteorologists, climatologists, physicists, and
satellite technologists discussed their research on this eruption and
explored possibilities for improved cooperation and communication
between workers who will be studying future eruptions.

Under the auspices of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting
Center (sosc), museum biologists Leslie W. Knapp, Colby A. Child,

110 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Herman A. Fehlmann, Frank D. Ferrari, Joseph D. Libbey, Jr., and
Ernani G. Menez, participated in a major expedition in the spring
of 1979 to the central Philippines. It was the second trip in a pro-
jected multiyear program to explore the marine biology of a com-
paratively unknown portion of the Indo-Pacific basin. Funding
was provided by the Max and Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, Inc.

Northeast was published by nmnu’s Handbook of North Ameri-
can Indians office in November. It is volume fifteen of a twenty-
volume set that is under the general editorship of Dr. William
Sturtevant. The series of volumes will summarize all that is known
about the history and cultures of North American Indians and
Eskimos, from their earliest prehistory through the present. This
volume was edited by Bruce G. Trigger, professor of anthropology
at McGill University in Montreal. It contains seventy-three chap-
ters by fifty-four outstanding authorities on the Indian cultures of
the region. A chapter is devoted to each of the tribes native to the
area, which includes the entire northeast of the United States as
far west as the Mississippi River and as far south as North Caro-
lina, as well as southeastern Canada.

OFFICE OF BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

The Office of Biological Conservation was established by the Secre-
tary on October 1, 1978, as part of the Office of the Assistant
Secretary for Science. Dr. Edward S. Ayensu was appointed as its
director. The scope of its mandate includes the coordination of the
various environmental conservation activities already in progress
in the Institution and the development of new projects within areas
of staff interest and expertise. The office is also charged with articu-
lating and representing the Institution’s views on conservation
issues to both administrative and scientific circles, as well as to
the public at large.

The office is embarking on a two-pronged effort to disseminate
information. On a professional scientific level, bulletins will be
issued detailing the Smithsonian’s concern regarding critical en-
vironmental issues. These bulletins will be sent to scientific
authorities and governmental organizations in this country and
abroad, where they can be used as guides for the judicious use and
assessment of the environment. In the public domain, the office has
recently collaborated with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of

Science / 111
the Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service in
preparing endangered-flora postage stamps that were issued on
June 7, 1979. It has also collaborated on related Postal Service ex-
hibitions, and additional exhibits are planned. An Occasional Papers
series and educational seminars and symposia will reach both the
scientific and lay communities and serve to amplify the office’s role
as a source of data for information-seekers from both groups.

National Zoological Park

Fiscal year 1979 brought a number of new animals to the National
Zoological Park (Nzp), through successful breeding and acquisition.
nzp also made progress on construction projects and expanded its
programs in animal management, research, conservation, and health.
At year’s end, staff members in all offices at the National Zoo could
take pride in having contributed to a successful year for animals,
visitors, and employees.

THE ANIMAL COLLECTION AND ITS EXHIBITS

Highlighting the year’s innovations was the new Beaver Valley
Exhibit, which opened in May. It features aquatic animals such as
seals, sea lions, beavers, and otters, as well as two canids—bush
dogs and timber wolves. Covering eight acres, the exhibit is grace-
fully landscaped, with waterfalls, pools, rocks, and hundreds of
plantings, so that it preserves the natural, wooded setting of Rock
Creek Park. A massive underground system of pumps and filters,
which circulate and cleanse the 375,000 gallons of water in the
seal and sea-lion pools, is hidden from public view and thus does
not intrude on the quiet beauty of the area—a major triumph of zoo
architecture. In the months since Beaver Valley’s official opening,
the animals have delighted and fascinated thousands of visitors
from all over the world.

An unusual means of acquiring animals was employed in the case
of the California sea lions. Staff of Hanna-Barbera’s Marineland in
Rancho Palos Verdes, California, rescued young animals aban-
doned by their mothers and then rehabilitated them under Marine-
land’s program for stranded and beached animals. The sea-lion

112 / Smithsonian Year 1979
pups were then acquired by the National Zoo, where they now
make their home.

During the spring, keepers began to train the sea lions and grey
seals, using an operant-conditioning method by which desired be-
havior is rewarded with a piece of fish. This training has several
benefits: it helps to establish trust between keeper and animal; it
provides a stimulating activity for the seal or sea lion; and, in cases
in which the animal is learning to retrieve objects from the water,
it helps to ensure that foreign matter will not be ingested. Training
also provides material for planned educational demonstrations for
the public.

For the enrichment of visitors, Beaver Valley provides innova-
tive exhibition techniques. Three-dimensional sculptures, housed
in plexiglas cases mounted on I-beams, accompany explanations
about communication in grey seals and in sea lions. A beaver skull
illustrates a passage about dam-building and dentition. Colorful
pipes and filters comprise a model explaining how Beaver Valley’s
water system works. At underwater viewing areas, visitors can
watch sea lions and otters gliding gracefully and can browse
through a brochure entitled “Aquatic Adaptations,” which answers
many questions.

To manage the complex of animals, personnel, and equipment
that forms the total of Beaver Valley, a curator of aquatic mammals
was hired in fiscal year 1978. At the end of fiscal year 1979, he
obtained his Ph.D., after having done extensive studies on the
reproductive behavior of grey seals in the wild. Once the zoo’s grey
seals attain breeding age, related research projects will be pursued
with them.

With the rest of the animal collection, breeding—with its result-
ing births and hatchings—continued. Emphasis was placed on
captive reproduction and conservation programs for endangered
species. Notable births among mammals, both at Rock Creek and
at the Conservation and Research Center (crc) near Front Royal,
Virginia, included three orabussu titi monkeys, one Bactrian camel,
one yellow-backed duiker, one bongo, thirteen lesser pandas, nine
Pere David’s deer (a species extinct in the wild), four onagers, six
bush dogs, three Matschie’s tree kangaroos, five southern potoroos,
six white-fronted wallabies, and five red kangaroos. With its off-
exhibit collection, the Office of Zoological Research was rewarded

Science / 113
with baby big fruit bats (the most ubiquitous of the larger fruit bats
in the Neotropics), elephant shrews, and short bare-tailed opos-
sums. The opossum colony arrived in May 1978 and has already
entered its second generation.

Among the reptiles, important hatchings included red-footed
tortoises; a third generation of leopard geckos; and emerald tree
boas (possibly the first time a U.S. zoo has bred these snakes three
years in a row). A second year of births in the pancake tortoises
was a victory in this species, which does not in many cases survive
—let alone breed—in captivity.

Fertile eggs were laid by the rarely hatched African plated lizard.
This was the first time keepers were able to recover this species’
eggs close to hatching, for incubation. At year’s end, the eggs,
containing live embryos, were being incubated and carefully moni-
tored; some had begun to hatch.

Bird news was also quite encouraging. At Rock Creek, three out
of four species of swan bred. The Stanley cranes laid seven eggs,
of which four have already hatched; the sarus cranes laid six, of
which four have hatched. A roseate spoonbill chick, hatched in the
incubator, was reintroduced to and successfully raised by its
parents.

At crc, partial stocking of twenty-one crane yards began in
September 1978 and continued to spring 1979. Three unrelated
pairs of Rothschild’s mynahs were breeding: this was the first time
unrelated pairs of this species had been set up to reproduce. Seven
Florida sandhill cranes hatched from one breeding pair. Particular
productivity distinguished a female emu, which laid thirty-three
eges in 1979. Of these, National Zoo staff hatched twenty-eight
and raised twenty-seven. Later, they found the male emu sitting
on six more eggs. For unknown reasons, he was unsuccessful in
hatching them.

A year ago, survival of young ruddy ducks had amounted to a
complete failure. This year, however, nineteen chicks at Rock Creek
were raised from a total of thirty hatchlings; at crc, fifteen out of
fifteen were reared. This welcome new ruddy duck flock was at-
tributed to a change in diet and seclusion of the young. Further
evaluation of this year’s success is under way to ensure optimal
conditions for future hatchlings.

A significant note of progress in the management of the animal
collection is the development of a number of cooperative breeding

loan programs with other U.S. institutions. Animals placed under
such agreements during the year included sloth bears, elephant
shrews, orangutans, gorillas, lesser pandas, Masai giraffes, and
fennec foxes.

International breeding exchanges and loans involved bush dogs,
maned wolves, orabussu titi monkeys, Atlas lions, and golden lion
tamarins. For this last species, an exceedingly rare primate in the
wild, an international studbook was maintained at nzp. This record
keeps track of all golden lion tamarins that have been born, been
imported from the wild, been transferred, and died in captivity
internationally. All zoos maintaining this species are thus informed
about the status of captive individuals worldwide; appropriate mat-
ings are recommended and medical problems are identified. From
nzp’s successful breeding program, a number of golden lion tamarins
were transferred in fiscal year 1979 to both national and interna-
tional institutions, ranging from the Lincoln Children’s Zoo in
Chicago to the Frankfurt (Germany) Zoo and the Jersey Wildlife
Preservation Trust in England.

“Enchantress”: for nearly twenty years, Mohini, the National
Zoo’s first white Bengal tiger, lived up to her Indian name, delight-
ing millions of visitors in a generation of zoo-going. But in April
1979 Mohini was put to sleep because of extensive degenerative
osteoarthritis, an incalculable loss for visitors and staff alike. Her
residence at nzp began in 1960, after a journey from her native
India with National Zoo Director Dr. Theodore H. Reed. At her
death, she was survived by seven descendants: two yellow tigers
and two white tigers at nzp (her daughter’s offspring); a white
daughter, on loan to the Rare Feline Breeding Compound in Center
Hill, Florida; and two other related tigers, one yellow and one white,
on loan to the Cincinnati Zoo.

Opening in October at the Bird House was Birdlab, a small center
for public information about birds. Resources include learning
boxes, books, an extensive bird information file, a film-loop called
The Birdkeeper, and trained volunteers from the Friends of the
National Zoo (Fonz), who maintain the center. Clipboards, work-
sheets, and binoculars can be loaned for use in the bird area. Initial
evaluation indicated that it was operating as planned: there are
more adult visitors than families, and more visitors stop to gain
information about birds than to use materials.

RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION

The National Zoo continued to pursue its conservation and research
goals this year. By scientific study of the ecology and behavior of
exotic animals, researchers can amass data that can then be utilized
by wildlife managers around the world for the preservation of
endangered species.

Research with the nzp collection, at both Rock Creek and crc,
progressed in many directions during the year. Broad comparative
studies of pair-bonding and monogamy in mammals continued,
including investigations of golden lion tamarins, South American
canids, and elephant shrews. Tamarin studies are now focusing on
juveniles’ behavior, to assess how sex roles are established and
maintained. South American canid studies at crc have concen-
trated on analysis of pair-bonds, parental care, social development,
and play.

A project continued on the reproductive behavior of that most
famous of nonreproducing creatures, the giant panda. Data re-
vealed this year that the male is sexually mature and, in fact, has
previously ejaculated during the female’s estrous period. Because
of the fatefully improper orientation of the couple during those
attempted matings, there were no successful copulations. In spring
1979, urine was collected from the male and female and was sent
for hormonal analysis to the Wellcome Institute of Comparative
Physiology at the Zoological Society of London. Zoo staff hope to
compare hormone levels in the urine of the pair of giant pandas in
London and of those in Washington. Current analysis suggests
normal levels in the National Zoo’s pair.

A research study was begun on pair-bonding in Carolina wren
subspecies, funded by the Smithsonian Research Awards Program.
Work continued on a comparative study of mother-young relation-
ships among hoofstock. Also in progress was a project on the social
behavior, scent-marking, and chemical composition of the pre-
orbital gland secretion of the dik-dik, a very small antelope.

A study in the Office of Zoological Research on inbreeding in
captive animals represents a major contribution to zoos. This proj-
ect was the first statistically accurate study of the problem of
inbreeding in zoos. Zoo researchers studied juvenile mortality in
selected species of hoofstock, with regard to inbreeding. After
eliminating all other variables, they concluded that if parents are

Science / 117
related, infant mortality increases, compared to those young pro-
duced by nonrelated parents. This finding will have a significant
effect on the pairing of individual animals in breeding programs at
Nzp and elsewhere.

Like the research conducted at the National Zoo’s home sites of
Rock Creek and crc, field studies abroad also yielded fruitful results
during the year. In Sri Lanka, research on the toque macaque con-
tinued into its twelfth year. A typhoon struck the study area,
causing major vegetational changes that have influenced the habi-
tat’s carrying capacity. This occurrence has given NzpP scientists an
opportunity to study population changes among three sympatric
species in the study: the toque macaque, purple-faced langur, and
gray langur.

In Venezuela, research continued on the red howler monkey.
Projects involved a comparison of two populations in adjacent
habitats, in an effort to understand environmental factors that
limit population growth in this species.

In fiscal year 1979, the Office of Zoological Research initiated a
program that provides an opportunity for scholars conducting field
studies to write up the results of their work for the public. Three
researchers were awarded entry into the first year of this program:
Melvin Sunquist documented his studies on tigers in Nepal; Jack
Frazier, on sea turtles in the Indian Ocean; and Rasnayagam Rud-
ran, on red howler monkeys in Venezuela. Under the arrangement,
they were granted stipends and access to both the National Zoo’s
library and the Smithsonian’s computer center. The program is
projected to continue in fiscal year 1980.

Initial investigation was made into a project on the giant civet of
Sulawesi (formerly Celebes). To establish a breeding colony in
Indonesia for the giant civet’s conservation, the Indonesian govern-
ment has agreed to a joint survey of its wild status. In this connec-
tion, the curator-in-charge of crc journeyed to Sulawesi in Sep-
tember, to assess future directions for NzP involvement. The pro-
gram is operating through the sponsorship of the Jakarta Zoological
Park, the Indonesian National Institute of Biology, and the Indo-
nesian Directorate of Nature Conservation.

Significant progress was made on the Smithsonian Nepal Tiger
Ecology Project in Nepal’s Royal Chitwan National Park. Be-
ginning in 1973, the Smithsonian Institution and His Majesty’s

118 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Government of Nepal have cooperated on a long-term study, cen-
tered in this park, of the Bengal tiger’s behavior, ecology, prey, and
competitors. Located in the terai lowlands between the Ganges Plain
to the south and the outermost Himalayan ranges to the north, the
Chitwan Park is a key region for the preservation of many species
of large mammals in the terai. It contains riverine forests and tall
grass areas, supported by rich soil and a plentiful supply of surface
water year-round. At the mutual boundary of two faunal regions
(the main Asian land mass, featuring mostly palearctic forms, and
the terai at the base of the mountains, containing those species
related to the Ganges Plain and the south), the park provides one
of the finest refuges for the magnificent animals for which the
subcontinent has been distinguished throughout history. Here lives
one of the remaining populations of the Indian rhinoceros, among
other endangered mammals.

From the project’s inception, careful research has emphasized
modern field techniques, such as radio-telemetry monitoring and
rapid immobilization with tranquilizing darts. These methods have
yielded fundamental data on breeding, feeding, territorial behavior,
anatomy, and mortality.

Since last year, University of Minnesota student David Smith has
continued his work on tiger dispersal. This work will have implica-
tions for conservation problems associated with managing large
predators in small reserves. Hemanta Mishra, an officer of His
Majesty’s Government of Nepal’s Park Service, has joined the
project to make a detailed study of one of the tiger’s principal prey,
the axis deer. Several investigators have concluded their work on
the project: Dr. John Seidensticker, a Smithsonian research associ-
ate, returned to the National Zoo from Nepal after thirteen months’
work; Melvin Sunquist completed his doctorate in 1979; and Kirti
Man Tamang was continuing his studies in the U.S. In August,
almost all of the members involved over the years in tiger research
in Nepal were brought together at crc to discuss ongoing research
and to identify needs and establish future priorities.

Highlighting the year’s activities in the Office of Pathology was
the “Symposium on Comparative Pathology of Zoo Animals,” the
first of its kind in North America. nzp hosted and cosponsored it
October 2-4, supported in part by ronz. Other cosponsors were the
Registry of Comparative Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of

Science / 119
Pathology, Zoological Society of San Diego, Registry of Tumors in
Lower Animals, Smithsonian Institution, and Baltimore Zoological
Society. More than 200 pathologists, veterinarians, and other medi-
cal scientists assembled to hear 76 papers on pathological entities
in a wide variety of zoo species and captive domestic animals. The
participants, many from major zoos in the U.S. and Europe, re-
viewed current knowledge of disease in zoo animals and provided
a wealth of new information on such topics as disorders associated
with captivity, the pathophysiology of aging in zoo species, and
several previously undescribed infectious diseases. The proceedings
of the symposium will be printed in fiscal year 1980 as one of the
continuing series on the symposia of the National Zoological Park,
published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.

Also in this series, published in late 1978, was the book Myco-
bacterial Infections of Zoo Animals, edited by the National Zoo’s
pathologist Dr. Richard J. Montali. An outgrowth of a symposium
held in October 1976 at crc, the volume brings together valuable
information on the pathological mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment,
and control of mycobacterial infections in nondomestic animals,
including nonhuman primates and poikilotherms. There is also an
overview of these infections in domestic animals.

An important development in the Office of Pathology’s teaching
role was the initiation on October 1, 1978, of a full-time residency
training program in pathology.

ANIMAL HEALTH

Animal health activities center on the delivery of quality health
care to NzP’s animal collection, at both Rock Creek and crc. The
mainstay of the health program is ongoing preventive medicine. The
newly constructed Quarantine Building, with capability for both
large and small species, has been a welcome addition to the hospital
complex.

The sphere of responsibility for animal health has been expanded
during the year to include the nursery and intensive care unit. The
Office of Animal Health also began coordinating a pest-control
program for the National Zoo.

The Office of Animal Health’s teaching role continued through
both pre- and postdoctoral training of veterinarians in zoological

120 / Smithsonian Year 1979
medicine. In cooperation with the Office of Graphics and Exhibits,
various techniques and procedures were documented on videotape
for teaching purposes. The first tape, ‘“Laparoscopy in Zoological
Medicine,” has been well received; others were being produced, in-
cluding one on immobilization procedures for giraffes.

The Office of Animal Health has a commitment to its clinically
related research programs. These programs have benefitted from
the addition of a permanent research assistant within the office.
Additional grants were awarded to the office by the Smithsonian
Institution, Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Combined Shows,
Inc., and the Schering Corporation. It is by this support that the
animal health division has been able to maintain its varied clinic-
ally related research projects. The results of this research have
been, and will continue to be, directly applicable in helping im-
prove the quality of health care in nondomestic species.

During the year, the major research projects of this office were:
physiological evaluation of anesthesia and restraint in nondomestic
species; pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in nondomestic species;
and a study of reproductive physiology, with special emphasis on
electroejaculation and artificial insemination. The anesthesia and
restraint study was funded by the Smithsonian. Its aim has been
an in-depth evaluation of the physiological changes that occur when
nondomestic species are anesthetized and/or restrained, procedures
necessary for routine management and surgery. Attempts were
made to monitor changes so that abnormalities could be recognized
early and prompt corrective measures be taken, as well as to
minimize adverse reactions and decrease the risk caused by these
procedures in nondomestic patients. At year’s end, these studies
were being intensified with birds and reptiles, as well as continuing
with mammals. Preliminary results from this ongoing study have
provided information that has reduced the danger in anesthetizing
NzP’s patients.

The antibiotic study was funded by Ringling Brothers Barnum
and Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. In this ongoing study, staff have
attempted to determine the appropriate antibiotic dosage and treat-
ment schedule for the many species of animals. This basic informa-
tion is vital to insure that antibiotics produce adequate levels of
drug in the patient’s bloodstream but do not accumulate excessively,
which can result in organ toxicity and death. If the dose is too low,

Science / 121
no beneficial therapeutic effect will occur; if the dose is excessive,
severe adverse reactions may set in. The studies have made specific
recommendations for therapy with several antibiotics in reptiles
and birds. Staff are expanding these studies to include other anti-
biotics.

The study of reproductive physiology is designed to provide the
basic information and expertise necessary to aid in captive propa-
gation of zoological species, when indicated. The study has three
aims: first, to document the reproductive cycle in the female and
determine how it can be hormonally manipulated; this has been
done in tigers and cheetahs, with the aid of the laparoscope. A
second goal is to develop techniques for semen collection and
storage. Numerous mammals have been electroejaculated and their
semen frozen for further study and possible use. This year, staff
successfully collected from a black rhinoceros, bongo, and giant
panda. The third phase of this project is to combine the previous
two and artificially inseminate selected species. This year, this pro-
cedure was performed on one cheetah and two white tigers.

In these reproductive studies, staff of the Office of Animal Health
collaborated with Dr. Seager, Dr. Wildt, and Mr. Platz of the Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.

CONSTRUCTION AND SERVICES

Fiscal year 1979 was a busy one in terms of construction projects.
Work began on the Great Ape House, scheduled to open in summer
1980. This new exhibit will feature gorillas, chimpanzees, and
orangutans in large, glass-fronted indoor enclosures and ample
outside yards, with play material such as logs and tires. Holding
areas, a quarantine room for newly arrived animals, and a spacious
keeper facility are other innovations.

A “North American Animals Exhibit,” to be completed in spring
1980, was also under construction during the year. Jaguars, pumas,
raccoons, prairie dogs, and wolverines will be among those native
continental species displayed in natural wooded settings. Visitors to
this exhibit will enjoy a rustic walk through the climax forest.

In spring 1979, new leopard and serval cages were occupied.
These unobtrusive enclosures were constructed by the National
Zoo’s own Office of Facilities Management, supplemented by
temporary carpenters. NzpP staff concluded that for small exhibit

122 / Smithsonian Year 1979
projects such as these, it is more economical to build with the Na-
tional Zoo’s own work force than to contract out, as was done with
the new owl and eagle exhibits near the Bird House, which were
also completed in the spring.

At crc, progress continued on the perimeter fencing project and
on construction of new yards for the breeding herd of Eld’s deer.

Thanks to adjustments in the filtration plant and water-flow
system, visitors at the underwater viewing area of the Polar Bear
Exhibit can gain a much clearer picture. The size of the filtration
system was doubled, and the amount of water flowing from pool
to pool was also increased. Both changes have helped provide
greater clarity.

A late-winter storm deposited about two feet of snow on the
Washington area, with drifts of up to ten feet, blanketing every-
thing almost beyond recognition. To combat the silent siege, a
snow-emergency plan was activated. Working day and night, a
valiant group of support staff cleared roadways and sidewalks so
that the animals, trapped in their houses, could be fed according to
schedule and be seen by the veterinarian. The National Zoo could
point with pride to the absence of any animal casualties. Zoo staff
were thankful that the storm’s unusual severity brought to their
attention items that they could update and incorporate in future
snow-emergency strategies.

During the torrential storm caused by Hurricane David in Sep-
tember, a tornado swept through the park, snapping ancient oaks
and beeches, stripping bark and branches, clearing a wide swath of
densely wooded hillside, and twisting the tops off of smaller trees.
Fortunately, there was only one casualty in the animal collection: a
female ostrich, killed by a tree falling in her yard. The loss was
nonetheless traumatic for Nzp (and for the male ostrich).

Facilities staff worked diligently throughout the night and next
day to undo the Creek’s damage. Thanks to the staff’s perseverance,
quick thinking, and elbow grease, destruction from the memorable
night of Hurricane David was kept to a remarkable minimum.

PERSONNEL

In December, Edward Kohn resigned his position as the National
Zoo’s deputy director to become director of the Minnesota State
Zoo. At this time, it was deemed appropriate to conduct a thorough

Science / 123
study of NzpP’s management methods, in order to establish the best
organizational structure for the zoo’s current needs and operations.
The study was completed in spring 1979 and contained many
valuable recommendations. Among the changes made, Dr. John
Eisenberg, formerly head of the Office of Zoological Research, as-
sumed the position of assistant director, responsible for all animal
and education programs. As the year drew to a close, the National
Zoo was recruiting an assistant director for support services.

In June, the first horticulturist in Nzp’s history joined the staff.
His contributions to the park’s extensive gardens, landscaping, and
natural flora are much welcomed.

FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL ZOO

For FONzZ, fiscal year 1979 brought new accomplishments and in-
creased support in a wide range of educational, research, and con-
servation programs of direct benefit to the National Zoo.

After completing the award-winning movie Zoo: Behind the
Scenes at the National Zoo, Fonz funded the filming of a sequel on
captive breeding and research at crc. This half-hour color-and-
sound film is scheduled for national distribution in fiscal year 1980.

Since 1975, Fonz has sponsored many of NzpP’s conservation and
research projects. These included the first-ever joint expedition with
the New York and Philadelphia zoos to study and procure rare
birds-of-paradise in Indonesia; a field study to save the endangered
Utah prairie dog; and an expedition to Sulawesi to lay the ground-
work for the study of the giant civet.

FONZ also sponsored an expanded intern and fellowship program.
Summer interns and college fellows assisted the National Zoo’s
scientists in studying animal-health problems and in conducting
behavioral research at both crc and Rock Creek.

Expanded grants underwrote part of the expenses for the com-
parative pathology symposium at Nzp, attended by 200 pathologists
and medical technicians.

Instrumental to expanded and effective education at NzP were
FONZ’s volunteers, who contributed more than 40,000 hours con-
ducting school tours for more than 15,000 students; staffing
Zoolab, Birdlab, and information booths; and assisting NzP scien-
tists with animal behavior and breeding studies. During summer

124 / Smithsonian Year 1979
1979, some sixty junior FONz members staged daily puppet shows
on animal themes for enthusiastic audiences.

More than fifty different educational programs and special events
were offered to FONZ members and the public in fiscal year 1979.
They ranged from classes for all ages, lectures, films, and tours, to
trips to places as near as Rock Creek and as far away as China.
Such diverse activities helped make ronz the third largest zoological
society in the world.

Most of the ronz-generated revenues were derived from sales of
food and merchandise and from public-parking services. Financial
information for calendar year 1978 is provided in detail below. In
addition, a percentage of the restaurant and parking concessions is
available directly to the Smithsonian for the benefit of the National
Zoo and is reported as income in the Financial Report of the
Smithsonian.

Office of Fellowships and Grants

In its role as a leader in the international scholarly community, the
Smithsonian Institution maintains close scholarly ties with uni-
versities, museums, and research institutions around the world.
Among the most important of these connections are those that
have been developed in the areas of cooperative research through
the Fellowship Program and the Smithsonian Foreign Currency
Program. Both are administered by the Office of Fellowships and
Grants.

Major events in 1979 affecting the Office of Fellowships and
Grants included the launching of the important new Smithsonian
Regents’ Fellowship for distinguished senior scholars and scientists.
In addition, a further consolidation of Institutional research pro-
grams was effected when the administration of the Smithsonian
Research Awards Program was assumed by the office.

PROGRAM OF VISITING ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS

With policy direction from the Board of Fellowships and Grants,
the Office of Fellowships and Grants acts as the center through
which the Smithsonian offers its resources to the academic com-
munity for the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge. The aca-
demic program reflects the character of the research and collection
strengths of the Smithsonian. It avoids duplication of university-
based study and research, stressing new perspectives on academic
subjects and disciplines not commonly studied in the university.
The program’s offerings range from off-campus undergraduate
studies to traditional postdoctoral research-training fellowships.
They are flexible, giving assistance to individuals who need to study
at the Institution for a few days and to persons who require the
research resources of the Institution for a year or more. Since 1965,
when most of the formal Institutional award programs were estab-
lished, the Smithsonian has been the appreciative host to more than
a thousand visitors supported by its fellowship awards, including
825 pre- and postdoctoral fellows. These scholars now form an
international network of individuals who have studied at the
Smithsonian and in many cases continue their association by sub-
sequent visits, consultation, and frequently shared research efforts
with members of the Institution’s research staff.

126 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Postdoctoral fellowships are awarded to scholars to allow them
to spend six months to one year participating in a program of ad-
vanced research training; predoctoral fellowships are awarded for
a similar period to doctoral candidates for the conduct of research
necessary to complete their dissertations. During 1978-79, seventy-
five postdoctoral and predoctoral fellowships were awarded. Gradu-
ate students who need to spend a shorter period pursuing their
research in consultation with the research staff of the Smithsonian
are offered ten-week appointments. During 1978-79, twenty-two
such appointments were made. The Office of Fellowships and Grants
also supports short-term visitors; thirty-seven such visitors were
enabled to spend one week to a month at the Institution during
the past year.

Among the new activities of the office, the most gratifying was
the successful inauguration of the Regents’ Fellowship. The fellow-
ship is intended to encourage outstanding scholars and scientists to
participate in the research, curatorial, and educational programs of
the Smithsonian. Regents’ Fellows will spend a period of residence
at the Institution conducting research on subjects of mutual interest
to Smithsonian scholars and scientists, thereby enriching the intel-
lectual atmosphere of the Institution. The first three Regents’
Fellows are scheduled to begin their tenure in 1980.

Other new offerings include a fellowship in museum exhibit
operations at the National Air and Space Museum developed by
the museum in cooperation with the Office of Fellowships and
Grants. In the summer of 1979, two such awards were made to
persons in positions related to the creation and execution of mu-
seum exhibits. Awards are expected in subsequent summers as well.
In addition, a fellowship in materials analysis has been established
for the application of techniques developed in the physical sciences
to problems in anthropology, art history, and history. The fellow
will work with staff members in the Conservation Analytical Lab-
oratory and other conservation facilities at the Smithsonian, as well
as with curators in anthropology, mineral sciences, history, and art
history. It is hoped that the National Bureau of Standards will also
provide some assistance and access to specialized scientific instru-
ments. One such fellowship was awarded in 1979.

The Office of Fellowships and Grants has undertaken a major
restructuring of its open study program, a program of academic

Science / 127
internships in which students work directly under members of the
professional staff. In a survey in 1979, it was found that there was
increasing interest in this program by Smithsonian curatorial staff
and that colleges and universities that encourage their students to
seek alternatives to traditional classroom learning have been ap-
proaching the Smithsonian in greater numbers during the last
several years. Twenty-three students worked in Smithsonian facili-
ties under the open study program in 1978-79. It is expected that
the development of a more formal program and the first full-scale
advertisement of the program in the fall of 1979 will enable more
students and more staff members to participate in these valuable
learning experiences.

For all academic programs, the Office of Fellowships and Grants
depends upon the support and cooperation of the Smithsonian’s
bureaus to provide fellows with staff guidance, facilities for re-
search, and access to collections, archives, and libraries. Sometimes
direct stipend support is also provided by the bureaus. In 1979, the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, National Air and Space
Museum, National Collection of Fine Arts, National Zoological
Park, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Radiation Biology
Laboratory, International Environmental Science Program, and the
Division of Performing Arts, all offered additional support for
academic appointments.

A total of 161 individuals participated in the Smithsonian’s
academic studies program during 1978-79. A listing of the names of
participants and their research or study projects may be found in
Appendix 7.

SMITHSONIAN RESEARCH AWARDS PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Research Awards Program provides awards on a
competitive basis to Smithsonian scholars and scientists who wish
to pursue new and innovative research projects. Proposals are sub-
mitted by members of the Smithsonian’s science, history, and art
research staffs and are reviewed by a panel of distinguished scholars
drawn from a variety of universities and research organizations
throughout the United States. Intended only to fund projects
through an initial investigative phase, the program is designed to
provide the opportunity and stimulus for Smithsonian staff to
respond quickly to new research initiatives. The competition for

128 / Smithsonian Year 1979
the relatively limited funds stimulates continued innovation and
creativity, vital features of the intellectual growth and integrity of
the Institution.

The program does not contribute toward any part of the salary
of a Smithsonian staff member receiving the award but supports
field and laboratory assistants hired for the duration of the project.
It permits research travel, purchase of specialized equipment and
extra supplies, and similar requirements for new research projects.

During 1979, thirty-nine awards were made to support projects
in the biological sciences, astrophysics and earth sciences, anthro-
pology, archaeology, history, and the history of science. Since the
program’s beginning in 1966, some 515 projects have been funded.
A listing of principal investigators and research projects in 1979
may be found in Appendix 7.

SMITHSONIAN FOREIGN CURRENCY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program (srcp) awards grants
to support the research interests of American institutions, including
the Smithsonian, in those countries in which the United States holds
blocked currencies derived largely from past sales of surplus agri-
cultural commodities under Public Law 480. The program is active
in countries in which the Treasury Department declares United
States holdings of these currencies to be in excess of normal
federal requirements, including, in 1979, Burma, Egypt, Guinea,
India, and Pakistan. Research projects are moving toward conclu-
sion under program support in the former excess-currency countries
of Israel, Morocco, Poland, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, and Yugoslavia.

In 1979, preparation was under way to terminate at the end of
fiscal 1981 the availability of these funds in Egypt, because of heavy
demands that have drawn the account down rapidly. The Smith-
sonian Special Foreign Currency Program has been the principal
supporter of American archaeological and historical research in
Egypt and of the Cairo Center of the American Research Center in
Egypt, a consortium of American institutions with research interests
in Egypt. When the funding is terminated in 1981, it is unclear
whether continued support for American research in Egypt will be
developed from sources other than “excess” foreign currencies. The
Smithsonian has urged government and university officials to try to
plan for replacement funding for the future.

Science / 129
The Smithsonian has received a fiscal year 1979 appropriation
of $3.7 million in “excess” currencies to support projects in anthro-
pology and archaeology, systematic and environmental biology,
astrophysics and earth sciences, and museum professional fields.
From its inception in fiscal year 1966 through fiscal year 1979, the
srcp has awarded about $38.5 million in foreign currency grants to
206 institutions in 39 states and the District of Columbia.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

Fifty years ago, in May 1929, an experimental research group within
the Smithsonian began to study the effects of sunlight on growth
and development of plants and animals. The principal motivation
for this laboratory grew out of the interest which its founder,
Charles G. Abbot, had pursued for many years in measuring the
quality and quantity of solar radiation impinging upon the earth’s
surface. It had long been suspected that solar radiation was a con-
trolling environmental factor that could influence growth and de-
velopment, but little was known of the molecular mechanisms oc-
curring, and only a few of the responses controlled by light had
been quantitatively described.

It is a tribute to the foresight of Secretary Abbot and the first
members of this laboratory that several significant major areas of
photobiology were selected for emphasis, such as photosynthesis,
phototropism, and photomorphogenesis. However, it is unlikely
that any members of the laboratory team realized how complex
and lengthy the research would be to obtain answers to their initial
questions. In fact, partial solutions have been obtained only recently
as the techniques and instrumentation from other fields—such as
biochemistry, biophysics, and the technology of engineering in
development of new light sources, detectors, and data handling—
have grown more sophisticated and been applied.

Photobiology is still a fledgling science, having been formalized
with its own American Society only seven years ago. It is interest-
ing that the same research problems that were initially investigated
by the laboratory still occupy a major portion of the annual meeting
program of the society. A great deal has been learned in fifty pro-

130 / Smithsonian Year 1979
ductive years, and, in fact, there is a growing sense of optimism that
the detailed molecular pathways of some of these important photo-
biological processes that affect all our lives are just within our grasp.
We are about to obtain answers to some of the difficult questions,
such as the nature and identification of the photoreceptors, the lo-
cation of the intracellular photoreceptor molecules, and, most im-
portantly, the nature of the initial reactions after light sets a chain
of events into motion.

However, these answers open up many new avenues for research,
especially the questions concerning the importance in the natural
environment of these processes that have been characterized in
the laboratory and the ways we may use this knowledge for the
control of growth and development. It is in these areas that the
research of the laboratory has continued this last year. Specifically
these are: (1) environmental processes and energy flow in biological
systems, such as photosynthesis and carbon metabolism; (2) regula-
tory processes of plants, such as membrane synthesis and pigment
synthesis; (3) the measurement of the amount, duration, and color
quality of sunlight present in the environment; and (4) the age
estimation of biological artifacts based upon their radiocarbon
content.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

For the study of photobiological processes, it is important to have
accurate measurements of sunlight over a long period of time and
under different meteorological conditions. The spectral data ac-
cumulated by the Radiation Biology Laboratory comprise the only
long-term data base now in existence. The solar radiation data now
include three continuous years of uv-B (erythemal ultraviolet) in
five-nanometer bands from Rockville, Maryland, and one year of
like data recorded in Hampton, Virginia. Continuous recording was
started in Hampton in September 1978 with a newly developed
instrument. Very close agreement is shown in comparing data for
the two sites that are 240 km apart.

From the data collected thus far at four stations (Barrow, Alaska,
71°N; Rockville, Maryland, 39°N; Hampton, Virginia, 37°N; and
Panama, 9°N), predictions based on ozone variability alone cannot
yield quantitatively valid results concerning the levels or wave-
lengths of uv-s that reach the earth’s surface at sea level. The major

Science / 131
variation in the intensity of uv-B is owing to weather and to air
pollution. As pollution increases, the amount of uv-B lessens.

Although spot measurements of solar irradiance below a forest
canopy have been made, there has never been a sustained effort to
monitor such an environment. The Radiation Biology Laboratory
has installed a scanning radiometer on Barro Colorado Island in
the Panama Canal Zone. The unit is recording data on both the
spectral quality and the distribution of the solar irradiance below
the rain-forest canopy. Since irradiance levels vary greatly from
spot to spot, an integrating device was installed so that a true
average value could be determined for the forest floor.

Fluctuations in the ozone content of the stratosphere result in
variation in the ultraviolet light that reaches the earth’s surface.
Some of the variation occurs naturally, but recent studies have
suggested that exides of nitrogen (from the exhausts of supersonic
aircraft or released from nitrogen fertilizers) and fluorocarbons (re-
leased from refrigerants or aerosal sprays) could catalytically de-
stroy 8 to 20 percent of the ozone. Measurements made at Pt.
Barrow, Alaska; Rockville, Maryland; and Flamenco Island, Canal
Zone, indicate at least a 25 percent seasonal variation due to ozone
changes and a daily variation of 100 percent caused by local
meteorological conditions.

Ultraviolet energy obtained in the laboratory, from low-pressure
mercury arc lamps that emit primarily at a wavelength of 254
nanometers, is highly injurious to animals, plants, and microorga-
nisms. This radiation primarily affects nucleic acids, often resulting
in cell death. Thus, it has been speculated that ultraviolet energy at
slightly longer wavelengths in the region designated uv-B (285-320
nm) might also be deleterious to organisms. It is this region that
would be principally affected by ozone changes.

A source of uv-s that closely simulates the spectrum of sunlight
penetrating the atmosphere was developed in the laboratory using
fluorescent lamps with special phosphors and appropriate transmis-
sion filters. Using such lamps installed in canopies of environ-
mentally controlled chambers, plants were grown under conditions
simulating normal and enhanced uv-s levels. A feedback-regulating
detector system was constructed and coupled to the lamp drive to
maintain constant irradiance at 320 nm over extended periods of
time (up to 45 days). Such lamps and filters age and decay rapidly,

132 / Smithsonian Year 1979
and, for quantitative results, it is necessary to monitor the lamp
output continuously with such a feedback system. Using this sys-
tem, the absolute intensity and wavelength distribution of uv-B solar
irradiation at noon have been achieved and maintained. By employ-
ing various filters, the ultraviolet enhancement resulting from de-
pletions of 82, 47, 41, and 29 percent of the ozone content were
obtained. Effects on growth and development in duckweed (Lemna)
and dwarf bush peas (Pisum) were evident only for the very high
enhancement levels of uv-s. For lower levels, no striking damage
was observed. The results indicate that under natural lighting con-
ditions, photoreactivation and repair mechanisms occur that mini-
mize the effects of enhanced vuv-s radiation.

Photosynthetic utilization of incident light energy provides the
earth with renewable fuels, namely, the carbohydrates comprising
the bulk of plants. At the beginning of this century, it was observed
that light energy delivered in flashes, rather than continuously,
caused apparent changes in this photosynthetic utilization. Using
an electronically controlled, direct-current, fluorescent-lamp, flash-
ing-light system, plants have been grown in different periods of
light and dark.

The older work used mechanically operated flash units and indi-
cated a minimal light utilization, with light and dark periods of
about one minute duration. Current work in the laboratory has
dramatically confirmed this observation. However, in the region of
very short flashes (less than 100 milliseconds) the utilization in-
creases and may surpass the utilization found under continuous
lighting. This increase in light utilization appears to be caused by
better light distribution within the plant canopy, rather than an
increased photosynthetic utilization at the molecular level.

For several years, the productivity of a marsh community of
grasses and sedges on the Chesapeake Bay has been measured to
determine the energy and nutritional interaction between the marsh
and an adjoining estuary. Using a sensitive gas analyzer to monitor
the carbon flow in the marsh community, researchers found that
about half of the carbon taken in by the plant community is left
over for use by the estuary.

In the marsh, these plants utilize only 2 percent of the available
sunlight, while under greenhouse conditions they utilize much more.
Experimental determinations were made of the photosynthetic

Science / 133
efficiency, in which the spatial orientation of leaves at different
seasons of the year was mechanically altered by thin transparent
nylon filaments from horizontal to vertical and vice versa. The
position of the leaves in the canopy was found to be a crucial con-
trolling element and confirms the prediction made by several mathe-
matical models. It is still not certain whether the positioning effect
is mediated by changes in the light absorption properties or by
changes in the availability of carbon dioxide to the leaves.

Environmental stress factors, such as low nitrogen and high salt
in marsh soils, also may affect productivity. Just because marshes
border upon open water, they may not necessarily have all of the
water they need. During certain “dry” times of the year, the soil
may contain high levels of salt. This salt has two effects. First, it is
toxic to plants. Second, it causes a fraction of the water to remain in
the soil and, therefore, unavailable to the plants. If the evaporative
demand on the rapidly growing marsh plants becomes excessive
because of high temperatures, the community loses more water
than it receives. This may result in lower photosynthetic efficiency.
However, when the availability of water in salt-marsh soils was
studied, it was found that the osmotic effects of salt did not restrict
the availability of water. No evidence was found to indicate that the
plants were suffering water stress. The salt effects on the distribu-
tion of species or productivity are probably manifested secondarily
through plant nutrition.

The productivity of the phytoplankton in the estuary may be
controlled by the quality and quantity of light penetrating the
water. In collaboration with the Chesapeake Bay Center for En-
vironmental Studies, measurements of the transmission properties
of water samples in the estuary were initiated this year and are be-
ing correlated with biological productivity measured at the same
locations. A scanning radiometer has been designed and constructed
in the laboratory for measuring the spectral distribution and
amounts of radiation at various depths. This unit is powered in the
field by a series of solar panels on the shore and is connected by
cable to the underwater radiometer. This automatically recorded
data is being correlated with the measurements of radiation above
the surface to determine the amount of energy that penetrates into
the estuary.

The distribution of zooplankton in a column of water may also

134 / Smithsonian Year 1979
be regulated by light signals. In the laboratory, experiments have
been initiated to determine the phototactic responses of the water
flea Daphnia to various intensities and monochromatic colors of
light. A population of Daphnia has been maintained in a water
column in a temperature-controlled darkroom in which light stimuli
may be given. Their swimming and migration responses may be
observed under safelight conditions. Initial results indicate that the
Daphnia readily couple their movement to other external stimuli
and thus maintain rhythmic movements that are independent of the
light exposure.

In higher plants, the pigment molecule phytochrome acts as a
receptor of light signals for inducing flowering. However, the
sensitivity to light signals for the flowering responses of plants is
also dependent upon the species of plant and the time in the de-
velopmental cycle during which the signal is received. The nature
of the environmental light signal remains unclear. However, it has
been postulated that the relative amounts of red and far-red energy
in sunlight may play a role. This postulate was based on laboratory
measurements of changes in the relative amounts of red and far-red
light occurring around twilight. Critical experiments with barley,
a plant that requires long daylengths to flower, indicate that the
effectiveness of the far-red light is dependent both on the total and
relative amount of energy.

A detailed time dependence of the ability of the plant to perceive
this far-red energy has shown that it is controlled by an endogenous
change in the plant itself. The far-red light not only is capable of
promoting flowering when the environmental light signal occurs at
the proper time, but it also affects the timing mechanism, so that
the plant becomes sensitive increasingly early in the day. This
result has led to a modification of the hypothesis that the twilight
shift in spectral energy distribution is required as the environmental
light signal. It now appears that only the absolute length of the
day is important and that such twilight shifts serve only a secondary
role in daylength extension during periods of very clear atmos-
pheric conditions.

REGULATORY BIOLOGY

Once the light signals are correct to induce flowering, a chemical
stimulus is produced. The chemical control of flowering is not

Science / 135
understood, despite considerable effort over many years. A search
for a single substance formed by light that will induce flowering
has not been very successful, with the exception of salicylic acid,
which will induce flowering in different species of duckweed
(Lemna). Cyanide ion has now been found to stimulate substantial
flowering in short-day Lemna paucicostata under continuous light.

Although these chemicals are probably not the endogenous sub-
stances responsible for the control of flowering, they do influence
the endogenous system and may lead to clues about its functions.
For instance, the effectiveness of these two chemicals is strongly
daylength-dependent in some cases and suggests that both flower-
inducing and flower-inhibiting substances may be exerting control.
Perhaps it is the interaction of these two types of substances that
ultimately decides whether a plant flowers or remains vegetative.

The photoreceptor pigment involved in flowering and in con-
trolling growth and development is phytochrome. It has been puri-
fied and extensively characterized in the laboratory as to its general
physical and chemical properties without any direct knowledge of
its biochemical function within the plant cell.

Comparison of several general properties of the biologically ac-
tive form (P:r) and the inactive form (P;) have led to the conclusion
that the protein portion of the molecule does not undergo any major
changes during phototransformation. Conversion to the biologically
effective form probably only involves a change at an active site on
the protein.

In an attempt to locate and characterize the active site, it has
been found that phytochrome binds to the polymer Blue Dextran
and its dye chromophore. Both the free dye and the dextran con-
jugate have been found to associate with nucleotide binding sites
on many proteins. This binding is usually reversed by addition of
high concentrations of salt or a low concentration of the naturally
binding ligand for the protein.

The biologically active phytochrome (Prr) binds to the dye with a
higher affinity than P,; and meets the operational criteria for a
nucleotide binding site on the phytochrome protein. Experiments
indicate that the binding site is specific for a flavin-like molecule.
This site is more accessible in the Prr than P; form and implies that
it may be involved in the primary action of phytochrome.

The conversion of light energy to chemical energy in photosyn-

136 / Smithsonian Year 1979
thesis takes place in membranes composed of proteins, lipids, and
pigments. Some of the proteins of chloroplast photosynthetic mem-
branes (thylakoids) are made in the chloroplast on chloroplast ribo-
somes and some in the cytoplasm on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Up to
50 percent of chloroplast ribosomes are bound to thylakoids. The
properties of these thylakoid-bound ribosomes resemble the proper-
ties of ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore,
it has been suggested that the thylakoid-bound ribosomes are
specifically making those thylakoid proteins that are synthesized in
the chloroplast.

Total ribonucleic acid (rRNA) has been isolated from thylakoids.
This RNA contains mostly ribosomal ribonucleic acids (rrNas) but
also contains about 2 percent messenger RNAS (mRNAS). The mRNAS
in the total nna have been used as templates in the in vitro wheat-
germ protein-synthesis system. Conditions required to obtain poly-
peptide synthesis on addition of the total thylakoid rna have been
established, using radioactive amino acids such as leucine and
methionine. Labeled polypeptide products obtained in vitro have
been compared with polypeptides labeled in vivo in the presence of
cycloheximide (polypeptides made in the chloroplast) by means of
electrophoresis on gradients of acrylamide gel. Some of the poly-
peptides made in vitro, on addition of thylakoid RNa to the wheat-
germ system, have electrophoretic properties similar to polypeptides
made in vivo on chloroplast ribosomes. This result suggests that the
thylakoid rNa contains mrnas for thylakoid properties.

In some algae, pigment protein complexes (phycobilisomes) are
attached to photosynthetic membranes. Light energy is absorbed,
converted, and transferred to reaction centers in which oxygen is
evolved. An understanding of this mechanism of energy conversion
in specific plants may lead to insights and solutions for directly
converting solar energy into chemical energy on a commercially
feasible basis.

Complexes of two of the pigments, phycoerythrin and phyco-
cyanin, have been separated and recombined. The first step toward
in vitro recombination, an examination of pigment-to-pigment
binding within the phycobilisomes, has been accomplished. The
recombined complexes have the same properties as those of the
original phycobilisomes. Of special significance is their energy-
transfer characteristics, which are the same as those obtainable for

Science / 137
intact phycobilisomes. Specific polypeptides, in addition to phyco-
biliproteins, are involved in the recombination. Furthermore, these
polypeptides appear to be species-specific, suggesting that the
assembly of the phycobilisomes is not random but is specifically
controlled by each species of algae.

Light regulates the biosynthesis of carotenoid pigments and their
oxygenated derivatives, the xanthophylls, which are widely dis-
tributed in nature. These pigments are responsible for many of the
yellow, orange, and red colors observed in both plants and animals.
Many of these compounds also act as accessory pigments in photo-
synthesis. The carotenoid B-carotene is important in the diet of
many animals because it is a precursor of vitamin-A needed for
vision. In many organisms, the carotenoids have been shown to
protect against adverse effects of visible light.

On the basis of inhibitor studies, it has been suggested that one
or more enzymes in the blue-light-induced carotenoid pathway in
the fungus Neurospora crassa are absent or at low levels in dark-
grown cultures. The level of these enzymes may increase following
the light treatment.

Albino strains have altered carotenoid biosynthesis. One albino
mutant designated wc (white collar) produces normal levels of
carotenoid pigment in the conidia but not in the mycelia. In albino-
1, albino-2, and albino-3 strains, both the conidia and the mycelia
show a defect in carotenogenesis.

The conidia in wild type strains of Neurospora are known to
produce pigment in the dark, whereas light is required for carote-
noid production in the mycelia. Thus, the conidia are somehow
able to bypass the light-regulation process. For this reason, it is
proposed that we albinos, which show normal pigmentation in the
conidia but not in the mycelia, are regulatory mutants that are
blocked in some part of the light-induction process. In such a
mutant, the conidia can still make normal levels of pigment, since
the mutation is not in any genes that code for enzymes in the ca-
rotenoid pathway (structural genes). The other albinos are probably
mutated in structural genes, and carotenoid biosynthesis is thus
blocked in both conidia and mycelia.

Data that support the hypothesis that wc mutants are blocked in
the light-induction process have been obtained. The enzyme system
required for the conversion of the precursor molecule isopentenyl-

138 / Smithsonian Year 1979
pyrophosphate (irr) to phytoene is present in dark-grown we
strains but shows no increase following a light treatment in vivo. A
nine-fold increase in this enzyme activity has been demonstrated
in a wild type strain.

This result suggests it will be possible to isolate we albinos that
are blocked in the first step of the light induction process, i.e., photo-
receptor mutants. If this is the case, these mutant strains may be
used to identify the photoreceptor.

Action spectrum measurements of the effectiveness of different
colors of light for carotenogenesis in Neurospora implicate either a
flavin or carotenoid photoreceptor. Phototropism (the bending of
cells in response to a blue-light stimulus) and the light growth
response of the fungus Phycomyces have similar action spectra. If
carotenogenesis after blue-light exposure is measured in Phycomy-
ces mycelia, the amount of carotenoid synthesized is a biphasic
response to the total dose of blue light given. Preliminary dose-
response measurements for several wavelengths at two-dose levels
indicate that two photoreceptors may be involved in Phycomyces in
the light regulation of carotenogenesis. For low light levels, a
carotenoid is suggested and a flavin for high light levels.

CARBON DATING LABORATORY

A major portion of laboratory research continues to focus upon the
early occupations of the Americas. Geologic, cultural, and climatic
chronologies are being developed for a number of Early Man Sites
in Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, as well as Alaska, Colorado, and
Wyoming, many of them in association with now-extinct mega-
fauna. Two sites in southeastern Alaska strongly suggest the use
of water transport there as early as 10,000 years ago.

Studies of Pleistocene and Recent geologic and climatic histories
are under way for Pleistocene Lake Bonneville in Utah, the western
coast of Mexico, the upper Chesapeake Bay, interior and coastal
Maine, and Labrador. Contrary to current thought, studies indicate
that at least one area of southern interior Labrador may not have
been covered by the last major ice advance.

A comparative dating program continues on a wide variety of
sample materials from assorted environments to assess their relia-
bility as dating materials and to develop new techniques for extrac-
tion of fractions that can be carbon dated.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

On May 9, 1979, the Multiple Mirror Telescope (mmT) was dedi-
cated by its builders, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
(sao) and the University of Arizona. A week of festivities con-
ducted at Mt. Hopkins Observatory marked the official commence-
ment of observational programs by the mmr, the first in a new
generation of ground-based optical instruments. Invited guests
gathered by the score to celebrate the advent of a new era in astro-
nomical research, as the MMT took its place as the world’s third
largest optical telescope.

The more than 500 ceremony participants had reason to celebrate:
the mrt had already discovered what appears to be a new class of
pulsating white dwarf stars. In other observations, the instrument
was used to confirm that the spectra and redshifts of the so-called
“twin quasars” were nearly identical, thus suggesting that a gravi-
tational lens effect predicated by general relativity was actually
producing the mirror image of a single object in deep space.

The week’s highlights also included a symposium, ‘“The mut and
the Future of Ground-Based Astronomy,” held at the University of
Arizona. The proceedings, which chronicle the design of and ex-
pectations for the new instrument, have been published as SAO
Special Report No. 385. In addition to the public lectures, exhibits,
tours of the mountaintop, and sessions for the press, a 16mm color
film entitled Mirrors on the Universe: The MMT Story was copro-
duced by the Office of Telecommunications and the University of
Arizona’s Radio-TV-Film Bureau.

The second in the series of nasa’s High Energy Astronomy Ob-
servatories (HEAO) was launched on November 13, 1978. Nicknamed
Einstein, the satellite carried an x-ray telescope designed by mem-
bers of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which is
capable of focusing images of x-ray sources. Einstein’s launch last
fall also represented the culmination of nearly two decades of plan-
ning and design.

Data returned by HeEAo-2 have allowed investigations of the
brightest, most distant, and most powerful objects observed to emit
X-rays: quasars. sao scientists discovered the quasars by using the
high-resolution telescope in the so-called serendipity mode to make
deep-space surveys. The Einstein has now observed more than

Mirror Telescope operated jointly by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Arizona photo.)

twenty quasars; of these, only three have failed to show a positive
x-ray flux, which demonstrates that the quasars are generally strong
x-ray emitters. This intense x-ray emission suggests that they may
contribute significantly to the widespread low-level background of
cosmic x-ray radiation seen throughout the skies, a finding that
may have implications for theories regarding an open or closed
universe.

Other observations by the Einstein have provided the first photo-
graphs of an x-ray burster in a globular cluster—a relatively rare
phenomenon. An x-ray burster is characterized by sudden, very
intense increases in x-ray brightness. These as-yet-inexplicable
bursts may release more x-ray energy in ten seconds than our sun
does in a week. Bursters were originally discovered by a Harvard-
Smithsonian team using instruments flown aboard the Astronomical
Netherlands Satellite.

It has been said that with the flight of HEAo-2—and the success
of the Einstein satellite—x-ray astronomy has come of age. Indeed,
the Einstein satellite has provided x-ray astronomers with the capa-
bility to produce celestial images with a sensitivity and accuracy
equal to the best instruments in both optical and radio astronomy.
Already, the success of the Einstein Observatory has generated
significant new requirements for optical observing, ranging from
traditional stellar classification to the observation of high redshift
objects. In fact, approximately 50 percent of the observations at
Mt. Hopkins relate in one way or another to the new x-ray data.

With the construction and operation of these two new powerful
observational tools—the mmr and the x-ray telescope aboard HEAO-
2—a quantum leap in the understanding of astronomical phe-
nomena and astrophysical processes may be anticipated for the
coming decade. The rapid increase in the sensitivity of x-ray tele-
scopes over the past ten years is comparable, according to Riccardo
Giacconi, principal investigator for the program, “to the 350-year
evolution of the optical telescope from Galileo’s crude refractor to
the 200-inch Palomar reflector.” The successful completion of the
MMT has also encouraged astronomers at several other institutions
to begin design on similar telescopes with possible diameters up to
1,000 inches.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory is a member, with
the Harvard College Observatory (Hco), of the Center for Astro-

physics. The programs of the two observatories are combined in
this joint enterprise and grouped by divisions representing areas of
interest.

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PHYSICS

The research program of this division concerns the study and
determination of processes and parameters in atomic and molecular
physics that are important to astrophysics.

In the laboratory, ongoing measurements are made of the gf-
values of atomic and molecular transitions and of photoionization
cross sections of astrophysically important species. Division mem-
bers utilize the recently completed Ion-Beam Facility to study the
feasibility of determining dielectronic recombination cross sections
in an electron-ion inclined-beams experiment and to measure the
absolute cross sections near threshold for electron excitation of
multiply charged ions, e.g., Be-like and Li-like. New experimental
approaches using, for example, lasers and ion traps, are under in-
vestigation to measure f-values of allowed, forbidden, and inter-
system transitions. The facility is also being used to determine
fundamental properties of multiply charged ions in order to under-
stand more fully the nature of a diverse set of astrophysical objects.
Programs to measure electron excitation and dielectronic recom-
bination of C** have begun, and measurements of photoionization
and autoionization cross sections of neutral atoms with shock tubes
have continued.

A joint research program on the part of theorists and experi-
mentalists in the division is under way to examine the destruction
of astrophysically important molecules by radiation.

The initial flight of a rocket-borne Lyman Alpha Coronagraph
was fully successful and yielded the first direct determinations of
solar temperature above the base of the corona. These measure-
ments are critically linked to coronal heating and solar-wind acceler-
ation mechanisms.

The far-infrared laser spectrometer has been modified for use as
a free radical detector in measurements of chemical reaction rates.
Preliminary measurements have been made on reactions of methoxy
(CH3O) with atmospheric gases, in order to assess the importance of
methoxy in the photochemical balance of the lower atmosphere.

144 / Smithsonian Year 1979
The division’s programs to measure oscillator strengths of im-
portance to astrophysics continue. A new method for combining
these measurements in absorption and emission has been formu-
lated. Both new and improved oscillator strengths for over 180 Co I
transitions are being derived from combined hook measurements
taken in the laboratory and branching-ratio and Fourier transform
spectroscopy data from the California Institute of Technology. This
data forms the body of critically compiled oscillator strengths for
Co I that will be published by the National Bureau of Standards.
Absolute oscillator strength values for 34 Y I transitions between
272.3-476.1 nanometers, obtained from hook measurements with
reference to Hanle effects and beam-foil lifetime data, are also being
prepared for publication. In addition, excellent hook spectra for
both V I and U I in the region 240-850 nanometers have recently
been obtained.

An exploratory investigation of the oscillator strengths of rare-
earth ions in crystals, in particular Nd*? in CaF and LaFs, has been
undertaken and is expected to yield the first relative oscillator
strengths of the 4f* interconfigurational transitions in Nd**, by use
of the hook method.

The 6.65-meter vacuum spectrograph, which is equipped for
photoelectric scanning, has obtained spectra of CO in emission and
Oz and NO in absorption at the previously unattained resolution of
0.01 A. In addition, the spectrograph was used to study the absorp-
tion spectra of the Rydberg bands of Nz» in the region 88.5-99.5
nanometer; a multi-level deperturbation program is now being
applied to the interactions between the Rydberg and valence states
of Ne. In another analysis, the vacuum ultraviolet emission spec-
trum of the argon dimer has yielded information on the excited state
symmetry and potential curves.

Among theoretical activities, particular attention has been given
to the study of charge transfer processes in atrophysical plasmas
and to mechanisms of dissociation of molecules in interstellar clouds
and in shocked regions. Work has continued on relativistic effects
and on theoretical molecular spectroscopy. The studies on shocked
interstellar gas were supported by observations at the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and on the Orion molecular
cloud by observations at Kitt Peak. The chemical nature of the
pedestal sources was illuminated.

Science / 145
Division members have used the International Ultraviolet Ex-
plorer (1uE) satellite telescope to study the ultraviolet spectra of
globular cluster, x-ray sources, interstellar matter, and the eclipsing
binary star VV Cephei. Analysis of the interstellar absorption line
data includes surveys of highly ionized species in nebulas and of
CO molecules in diffuse clouds.

Investigations related to ground-based observations include the
analysis of interstellar Co towards Zeta Persei and the interpretation
of the spectrum of the unusual emission-line star V645 Cygni. Study
of the photochemistry of nitrogen ions in the terrestrial thermo-
sphere has revealed that the reaction N(?D) + OT > Nt + Oisa
significant, previously unrecognized source of N*. Predictions were
made of the fluxes of quadrupole rotational transitions of Hz in the
OH maser source W30H and in the hot region of the Orion molecu-
lar cloud.

RADIO AND GEOASTRONOMY

The resources and facilities of the Geoastronomy and Radio Astron-
omy divisions have been coordinated into a single division. The
combined program will concentrate on related research on very long
baseline interferometry (vLBI), atmospheric research, and the de-
velopment of maser clocks.

Research objectives in radio astronomy have emphasized micro-
wave atomic and molecular spectroscopy of the interstellar medium,
very long baseline interferometry of galactic and extragalactic
sources, participation in the Very Long Baseline Interferometry
Network, and experiments in radio aeronomy.

Observations of radio-frequency spectral-line emission from a
variety of atoms and molecules were carried out in several different
galactic and extragalactic regions. In particular, the nucleus of the
Milky Way Galaxy was studied extensively, which resulted in the
suggestion that there exists a giant whirlpool of gas, the center of
which is dominated by a supermassive object, perhaps a black hole.

A study of atmospheric ozone with the portable ground-based
millimeter-wave spectrometer continued. This year, an investigation
of reference source characteristics was performed and the profile
inversion program was incorporated into the software operating
system of the spectrometer’s minicomputer.

146 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Very long baseline synthesis mapping techniques were used to
map the Stokes parameters of several OH masers near H II regions.
An unambiguous method of distinguishing among Zeeman split
spectral features was provided that will allow the mapping of the
magnetic field strength in these regions. The intensity variations
of H2O maser spectral features were studied over a three-week
period, and nine features were seen to flare on a time scale of days
to weeks. The light curve of these features made it possible to dis-
tinguish between various maser models.

The first successful vLBI experiment at 43 GHz was completed in
the fall of 1978 on the 74-kilometer baseline between Haystack
Observatory and the University of Massachusetts’ Quabbin Ob-
servatory. Maps of the distribution of SiO maser emission were
made toward Orion and some supergiant stars. The maser in the
Orion nebula arises in a compact shell around a proto-star, which is
known in the infrared as IRC2, a part of the Kleinmann-Low
Nebula

vLBI observations of HzO masers used Network sites at Tyngs-
boro, Massachusetts (Haystack); Greenbank, West Virginia (NRAO);
Onsala, Sweden (Chalmers Institute of Technology); Bonn, Ger-
many (Max Planck Institut); and Semerz, Russia (Crimean Astro-
physical Observatory). First epoch measurements of the motion of
the high-velocity H2O features were made to an accuracy of ~100
parcsec revealing transverse motions of ~30 kilometers per second.
Absolute positions and maps of the masers in Cepheus OB3 were
obtained, and in other observations, newly discovered sites of star
formation were made. In addition, a series of eighteen-centimeter
VLBI experiments utilized three to five stations of the viB1 network,
including the Harvard Radio Astronomy Station (Fort Davis, Texas)
to measure absolute positions and study the structure of several
OH masers. Most of this effort has gone into Type I OH emission
sources, which have been less studied in the past.

Observations at seven millimeters with the 100-meter telescope
at Bonn, which were about five to ten times more sensitive than
previous investigations, show that there are probably no SiO
masers near star formation regions. Except for the Orion-KL SiO
source, all other SiO masers are associated with evolved, late-type
giants and supergiants, which gives the Orion SiO source an out-
standing role in the Galaxy. A detailed investigation has begun.

Science / 147
The division’s geoastronomy programs are concentrated in geo-
physics, upper atmospheric research, relativity, and support of hard-
ware and software systems development. Among the ongoing ac-
tivities are the study of earth dynamics and composition from
satellite measurements; the development of models to describe
temperature and density variations in the atmosphere; the analysis
of data from a spacecraft-borne gravitational redshift experiment;
the development of state-of-the-art hydrogen masers; and the study
of a spaceborne tether system for payload manipulation and in situ
measurements of gravity-field gradients and electrodynamics.

During the past year, sao’s satellite-tracking network provided
routine laser tracking coverage for geophysical research conducted
by the division and other research organizations in the U.S. and
abroad. The network was upgraded with an improved optical pulse
chopper installed at all stations to reduce laser pulse width and
improve ranging accuracy. Data-handling capabilities were im-
proved by modified software, allowing more direct transmission of
data from the field stations to sao. A minicomputer was used in
communications, and software was adapted for operations on the
recently installed pEc vax-11/780 computer in Cambridge. All field
stations continued local coverage of Lageos, Geos C, and other
satellites useful for geodetic applications.

The determination of the earth’s gravity field, expressed in
spherical harmonics to degree and order 30 (i.e., over 900 coeffi-
cients), was completed. This is the latest in the series of gravity-
field models that began in 1961, based on the combination of
satellite-tracking data and other data. The main new feature of
this solution is the inclusion of satellite-to-sea-surface altimeter
data, used as a direct measurement of the geoid in ocean regions.
Altimeter data from the Geos 3 satellite allowed both greater resolu-
tion and greater accuracy in the geopotential model, which is now
known with a horizontal resolution of 600 kilometers and an ac-
curacy of two meters.

Satellite-to-sea-surface altimeter data also contain information
about the ocean circulation, derived from the small difference (less
than one meter) between the physical sea surface and the geoid. By
using suitable filtering methods to eliminate the long wavelength
errors in knowledge of the geoid, a strong western boundary cur-
rent (the Gulf Stream) has been measured with altimeter data pro-

148 / Smithsonian Year 1979
vided by the Seasat satellite, which operated for three months in
1978.

The mechanical properties of the lithosphere were investigated
to identify the factors that influence those properties. The litho-
sphere is known to cool and thicken with increasing age, and this
fact will be reflected in the main trend. There are, however, many
deviations from that simple relationship. The data used for the
investigation are the geoid heights derived from the Seasat and
Geos 3 radar altimeters and their relationships with bathymetry.

Investigations of the variations in the earth’s thermosphere
associated with geomagnetic activity have led to the discoveries of
a broadening of the latitudinal profile of temperature increase at
high geomagnetic latitudes during large geomagnetic disturbances
and of local time variations related to the size and shape of the
auroral oval. An improved model of the geomagnetic variation in
the thermosphere is being constructed using mass spectrometer data
from the Esro 4 and other satellites.

Efforts to improve the 1977 thermospheric models continue,
mainly in the areas of the geomagnetic effect and of the diurnal
variation and its harmonics at relatively low altitudes (150-300
kilometers). Models have been developed that relate the shape and
extension of the auroral oval with the temperature profile along a
meridian of magnetic latitude. The computation of temperatures
and composition at any given height has been greatly simplified by
the development of analytical approximations of the laborious inte-
grations from the assumed boundary (90 kilometers). Mass spec-
trometer data from the Esro 4 and ae-c satellites are used to check
on the models; use is also made of copious published observational
material from a multitude of sources.

Analysis of the 1976 gravitational redshift experiment is com-
plete. A recalculation of all systematic errors and the formal statisti-
cal errors has led to a final result that the relationship between the
observed redshift and the prediction from the equivalence principle
is verified to within 143 parts per million.

A second test of the equivalence principle involving clocks was
done in April 1978 when hydrogen maser and superconducting
cavity clocks were compared at Stanford University to search for
a possible nonmetric behavior of gravitation. The evidence for this
would be that the frequency difference between clocks operating

Science / 149
on different physical principles would be affected by changes in the
sun’s gravity potential, owing to the laboratory’s motion during the
period of measurement. No effect was seen at the 1 percent level of
sensitivity.

During 1979, a hydrogen maser was successfully operated at 25
K, which was made possible by the introduction of a new type of
gaseous wall-coating material frozen in place. The stability avail-
able from the new cold maser is at the 10~1'" level, and work is in
progress to demonstrate this tenfold improvement over present
technology.

Research on the electrodynamics of long orbiting tethers and an
investigation of the interactions between an orbiting tether and the
earth’s ionosphere have shown that a long conducting tether in
orbital motion embedded in the earth’s ionosphere can generate,
under certain conditions, a broad spectrum of hydromagnetic and
electromagnetic waves. The frequency band of these emissions
spans the region from subhertz frequencies up to the optical band
and can be detected with state-of-the-art sensors.

A second study of the electrodynamic interactions of a long
metallic tether with ionospheric plasma is under way. A trans-
mission line model of the tether has been developed that allows
both the transient and steady-state electrical behavior of the wire
to be studied. The model has been included in the Skyhook dynamic-
simulation computer program, in order to study the effect of electro-
dynamic forces on the system dynamics. This computer program
will be used during the coming year to examine the possibility of
electrodynamic control of the Skyhook tether and its use in the
generation and injection of waves in space plasma.

HIGH ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS

Scientific activity in the High Energy Astrophysics Division during
the past year has concentrated on the reduction and analysis of
the very large amount of data returned by the Einstein Observatory
mission, which was successfully launched on November 13, 1978,
as the second in nasa’s HEAO series. In the first five months of
operation, the Einstein (HEAO-2) satellite, which carries a CFA-
designed telescope capable of focusing images of x-ray sources, has
observed the brightest, most distant, and most powerful objects
yet seen in this wavelength: quasars estimated to be more than

150 / Smithsonian Year 1979
ten billion light-years from earth. The intense x-ray emission from
the quasars, and the unusual number so far observed, suggests
they may contribute significantly to the low-level background of
cosmic x-ray radiation, thus implying that the proposed mass
necessary to close the universe is not present in the form of hot gas
between the stars and supporting theories that the universe may
continue to expand forever.

The Einstein Observatory has also observed “normal stars”
similar to our sun, a new class of young hot stars with strong x-ray
emission in their outer atmospheres, the remnants of supernovas,
“cosmic bursters” in globular clusters, distinct sources of x-ray
emission in other galaxies much like our own, and the most distant
clusters of galaxies yet observed by any instruments. Spectral
analysis of x-ray emissions from supernova remnants has also re-
vealed the presence of a variety of heavy elements, in abundances
similar to those found in the solar system, thus supporting the
theory that the sun and planets were formed out of the debris from
similar supernova explosions billions of years ago.

The data returned by HEAO-2 are of extremely high quality, and
the mission represents qualitative improvement in the observational
capabilities available to x-ray astronomers, in that a 1,000-fold in-
crease in sensitivity with respect to previous missions has been
achieved. This capability is coupled with the ability to image ex-
tended x-ray sources to a resolution of four seconds of arc and to
obtain higher resolution spectra with greater sensitivity than any
previously achieved. As a result, the scope of x-ray astronomy has
been enormously increased to encompass all known objects of astro-
physical interest, from nearby stars to objects at a cosmological dis-
tance, including the most distant detected in any wavelength range.

Finally, a very advanced software system has been developed,
which allows the processing of the returned data in less than real
time (the data input corresponds to fifty kilobits per second con-
tinuously in real time). Because of the wealth of data already in
hand, several years of interpretive efforts are needed to realize fully
their scientific import. In addition to the cra’s own observing pro-
gram, a program for guest investigators of unprecedented number
for a mission of this kind is being carried out: observation programs
by 170 guest investigators have been approved during the first seven
months of the mission.

Science / 151
Data returned by the HEAO-1 scanning modulation collimator ex-
periment have provided significant results: identification of BL Lac
objects, groups of galaxies, and cd cluster cores as classes of x-ray
emitters. In particular, these studies have led to the precise posi-
tioning of SS Cygni and EX Hya, thus firmly establishing the dwarf
novas as a clan of hard x-ray emitters; to the discovery of an ex-
tended component of x-ray radiation associated with the active
radio galaxy Cygnus A; and to the x-ray measurement of the di-
ameter of the Tycho Supernova Remnant. In addition, locations
were obtained for emission-line galaxies, Seyfert I galaxies, and
many galactic objects, including the second or third examples of
hard x-ray emitting dwarf novas, RS CVn stars, low mass binaries,
and magnetic white dwarfs. Finally, data from HEAO resulted in an
increase to 1,500 in the catalog of celestial x-ray sources from the
350 previously known.

Other divisional programs include research on extragalactic x-ray
sources with the sas 3 x-ray observatory. Three-year light curve
measurements were completed for the Seyfert galaxies 3C120 and
III Zw2, as well as the Abell cluster A478.

On the x-ray imaging ccp projects, single x-ray photon imaging
with some energy resolution has been achieved, and an x-ray camera
system was developed for testing of a variety of ccp chips.

Fabrication, alignment, and testing of the x-ray spectrometer
were completed, and the instrument was transferred to it (for the
Alcator Tokamak). Interfacing is nearly complete, and Tokamak
spectra are expected shortly. Further studies of holographical
formed x-ray transmission gratings were conducted at the Stan-
ford synchrotron.

With respect to the work for the future, the division is engaged
in the development of new technology and is participating in
NasA’s planning activities, which, it is hoped, will lead to major
new x-ray astronomy programs. In particular, division members
are involved in the overall design of the Advanced X-Ray Astron-
omy Facility (axar), which is currently planned for flight in 1987,
as well as in several activities for the Spacelab proposed for flight
aboard the Space Shuttle between 1981 and 1985. (Two of these
proposed experiments, the Large Area Modular Array of Reflectors
[LaMaR] and the Spherical Crystal Imaging Spectrometer [scis],
have been tentatively accepted by nasa for future shuttle flights.)

152 / Smithsonian Year 1979
The technological developments are particularly directed toward a
second generation of detectors for the AXAF mission.

OPTICAL AND INFRARED

The principal research activities in the Optical and Infrared (or)
Division continue to be in the areas of extragalactic astronomy,
infrared astronomy, and the study of the optical counterparts of
x-ray sources. A highlight of the division’s activities this year was
the dedication of the Multiple Mirror Telescope (mmr) (a joint
project of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Ari-
zona) at the Mt. Hopkins Observatory, in May. After the final
alignment and performance testing were completed, the initial
astronomical observations were made in March and April. Later,
members of the division helped obtain the first scientific results:
spectroscopic observations of the twin QSOs 0957-++561 A, B.

In extragalactic research, studies continued of the Hubble flow,
using the H magnitude-21-centimeter profile width relation to de-
rive accurate distances to several clusters of galaxies around the
sky. SAO scientists and their collaborators at Kitt Peak and Steward
observatories find a value of Ho (the scaling between velocity and
distance in standard cosmological models) of eighty-five kilometers
per second per mega parsec; they also find that our galaxy is falling
into the local supercluster center with a velocity of a few hundred
kilometers per second. In addition, P-Cygni profiles have been
found in the broad emission lines of the Seyfert galaxy III 2w 2 that
appear to vary on time scales of days, which places strong con-
straints on models of the central energy source.

The Z-machine, initially configured for redshift surveys, is now
routinely available to all observers and has been used in a variety
of observations. The Z-machine detector has also been used with the
echelle spectrometer to conduct programs of research on the inter-
stellar medium and on stellar chromospheric activity.

Other projects in extragalactic research include grid photography
of the faint outer regions of NGC 4565, a spectroscopic test of spin-
orbit coupling in close binary galaxies, and work on the redshift
survey, which will contribute to the measurement of the mean
mass density of the universe. In addition, a dynamic study of the
bulges of disk galaxies is under way to determine the relative
contributions of the disk, the bulge, and any unseen third com-

Science / 153
ponent to the observed galaxy rotation curves. Programs in galactic
spectroscopy that utilize a photon-counting Reticon detector at Mt.
Hopkins include measurement of the velocity dispersions in ellipti-
cals to study the variation in mass-to-light ratio among elliptical
galaxies.

A program of studies of x-ray sources based on ccp images at R
and I wavelengths has begun. The first run on the sixty-inch tele-
scope provided excellent images of two sources of very red color
but stellar appearance, and a cluster of galaxies at z = 0.7 based
on R-J colors of the brightest three cluster numbers. The threshold
for detection of stars or galaxies is found to be R = 21.5 or V =
22.5 on the sixty-inch telescope, and will, it is hoped, be at least a
magnitude fainter on the MMT.

During the last year, two successful flights of the 102-centimeter
balloon-borne telescope were made, the twelfth and thirteenth of
the series. In April 1979, eight hours of high-quality astronomical
observations were acquired and included observations of fourteen
different astronomical regions obtained with the University of
Palermo four-color, single-beam photometer. This unique pho-
tometer has the capability of mapping with high resolution (one
minute of arc) simultaneously at four different infrared wavelength
bands.

Data from previous flights have yielded new insights into star
formation and evolution in the galaxy and have produced new in-
formation on the structure of the outer planets. Considerable study
was devoted to the H II regions at the boundary of giant molecular
clouds in an attempt to understand the processes of star formation
in these objects. Evidence was found for a variable far-infrared
source in a molecular cloud, indicating a possible transient stage of
stellar evolution, and new information on the rate of mass loss
from the carbon star IR + 10216 was obtained.

In June 1979, the telescope was launched carrying the Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectrometer (Firs). This instrument produced
high resolution (0.03 per centimeter) over the spectral range from
40 to 120 microns. Spectra of three astronomical objects were ob-
tained, as well as spectra of the earth’s atmosphere. Preliminary data
indicate that the balloon platform provides an ideal method of ob-
taining far-infrared astronomical spectra.

Division members continue their participation in construction

154 / Smithsonian Year 1979
of the small helium-cooled infrared telescope for Spacelab 2, now
scheduled for launch in early 1982. The experiment is a joint ven-
ture with the University of Arizona and the nasa Marshall Space
Flight Center.

Observational programs aboard the International Ultraviolet Ex-
plorer satellite emphasize ultraviolet studies of strong x-ray sources
and of globular clusters. In particular, the eclipsing binary VV Cep
is the subject of an investigation.

Construction of two new detector systems is nearly complete: the
twin-1024 Reticon photon-counting detector head is planned for use
in the next version of the Z-machine and the new rca ccD camera
for use in direct photography. Future plans include a cooled direct-
illuminated Reticon system.

PLANETARY SCIENCES

A wide variety of solar-system investigations that exclude the sun
and concentrate on the origin of the solar system, studies of ex-
traterrestrial materials, and the astrophysics of small bodies are
carried out by the division.

Solar-system studies have produced an explanation for the
century-old mystery of the changes in nongravitational motion of
Encke’s Comet. Calculation of the jet sublimation forces on a
slightly oblate icy nucleus showed that the spin axis pole has pre-
cessed through some 130° across the sky since the comet was dis-
covered in 1786, which accounts for the variable period and the
asymmetrical comas observed.

Other work on the early history of the solar system includes the
following studies: the interaction between the primitive solar
nebula and a giant gaseous protoplanet; the rapid coalescence and
rain-out of minerals deep in the interior of an evolved giant
gaseous protoplanet; the origin of meteoritic FUN anomalies and of
mechanisms within giant gaseous protoplanets for producing them;
and the r-process caused by neutron-producing conditions when
supernova shock waves traverse the helium and carbon shells in
the presupernova star.

The division’s lunar research programs include the initiation of
an intensive study to be carried out in the consortium mode of
some Apollo 16 rocks. As part of a new program to examine the
evolution of the ancient rocks of the highlands, research is focused

Science / 155
on North Ray Crater ejecta. The following investigations are also
being pursued: an experimental, thermodynamic, and geochemical
research program on pristine spinel-bearing lunar highland rocks—
the first comprehensive work of its kind that has established a non-
surficial or deep-seated origin of these materials; petrologic studies
of some Apollo 16 coarse-fines; and the determination of 'C in
lunar samples.

The heating effect of 7°A1 in early solar-system planetesimals,
and its relationship to time scales defined by the metallographic
cooling rates and radiometric ages of meteorites, have been investi-
gated. In addition, a thermochemical interpretation of experimental
phase equilibria on silicate solid-liquid systems of planetary in-
terest is in progress for the purpose of modeling the early forma-
tion of the crusts and mantles of earth- and moon-sized planets.

The division’s orbital research programs on comets and minor
planets have continued, with the following studies in particular:
the nongravitational effects on periodic comet Temple 2 throughout
its 105-year history, routine calculations on new comets, more ex-
tensive calculations on minor planets, and calculations to check the
results of the astrometric observing program at Agassiz Station at
Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

A comprehensive study of the dust tail of Comet West 1976 VI
has provided the following results: (a) identification of twelve
explosions of dust from the nucleus between six days before
perihelion and twelve days after perihelion; and (b) explanation of
peculiar striae (pseudosynchronic bands) in terms of fragmentation
of dust particles in the tail. A method was developed for determin-
ing the orientation of the rotation axis of the comet nucleus and
the characteristic thermal lag of the sublimation process.

Planetary research programs have yielded results in studies of
both Uranus and Jupiter. For Uranus, analysis of Stratoscope II
photographs has showed clear detection of the ring system in pro-
jection, which in turn provides a measure of confirmation of the
value for the dynamical oblateness of the planet; detection of faint
surface features; and determination of the ellipticity (e = 0.22 =
0.001). With regard to Jupiter, one phase of a study of the outer-
belt asteroids has been completed and indicates that the observed
population cannot be accounted for by Jovian gravitational per-
turbations alone, whereas other asteroids now moving in stable

156 / Smithsonian Year 1979
orbits suggest that Jupiter’s eccentricity has never exceeded
—O.075:

In a search for meteoritic fireballs and related nighttime phe-
nomena, a division member has discovered in the Jovian atmosphere
an aurora and flashes that are thought to be lightning. These ob-
servations of the darkside of Jupiter gathered by the Voyager
mission to Saturn have provided photographic evidence of an elec-
trically supercharged atmosphere. The light output from the flashes
has been estimated to be about ten billion joules—far greater than
that produced by terrestrial superbolts. These light flashes may
provide the energy source required by proponents of theories sug-
gesting that organic chemical activity exists on Jupiter.

A member of the division continues direction of the 1au Central
Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which issued some 135 Iau
Circulars and some 40 telegram books, and the rau Minor Planet
Center, which issued some 400 Minor Planet Circulars during the
fiscal year.

Finally, a division scientist spent six weeks of the December-—
January austral summer in Antarctica searching for meteorites
from two field camps: one in the Darwin-Byrd Glacier area (80°S;
157°E), the other in the Allan Hills (76°S; 159°E). Specimens were
collected from patches of stagnant (?) blue ice and three other
types of terrain: in moraines, on steeply sloping ice surfaces, and
on the rocky sides of Derrick Peak, a mountain in the Transantarc-
tic Range. X-ray and sem study has begun on some white Mg-
carbonates that were found on a few Antarctic stones when they
were unpackaged in Houston.

SOLAR AND STELLAR PHYSICS

The research activities in the Solar and Stellar Division focus on
the goal of understanding the physics of the sun and the stars.
Analysis and interpretation continued of data from Harvard's
two solar experiments on the Skylab satellite—the soft x-ray tele-
scope and the extreme ultraviolet spectroheliometer. Studies con-
centrated on the physics of magnetically confined dense plasma
in active-region coronal loops, coronal bright points, and other
features. A major new experimental capability was successfully
inaugurated with the first rocket flight of the Hco Lyman Alpha
coronagraph. This instrument, flown in a joint payload with a

Science / 157
white-light coronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory, ob-
tained the first measurements of coronal temperatures at distances
beyond 1.5 radii from the sun center. This data will provide
valuable constraints on proposed mechanisms for coronal heating
and solar-wind acceleration.

Studies of long-term solar variability conducted as part of the
Langley-Abbot Program included theoretical investigations of mag-
netic diffusion in the photosphere and observational analysis of the
location and rate of emergence of magnetic flux elements revealed
by x-ray bright points. The rate of flux emergence in bright points
was found approximately to equal that of active regions, though it
varies throughout the cycle approximately in opposite phase to the
sunspot number, so that the total magnetic flux emergence rate may
even be approximately constant.

The evidence for variability of the solar “constant” gathered at
sao by Abbot, as well as in recent space data, was carefully ex-
amined, and small but definite decreases due to sunspots, as well
as increases due to active regions, were discovered. Observations
from ground-based facilities confirmed that magnetized regions in
the photosphere rotate faster than nonmagnetized regions—a result
of considerable importance to dynamo theory. Finally, evidence
was obtained for a significant decrease in the solar radius over the
past several hundred years. If confirmed by more modern data,
this result will be of extraordinary importance for an understanding
of the time-varying dynamics of the solar convection zone.

Theoretical studies of radiative transfer in the solar chromo-
sphere continued, with the development of a series of statistical
equilibrium models of solar features (the quiet sun, the magnetic
network, sunspots, active regions, and flares). In addition, new
calculations elucidated a density dependence correction to ioniza-
tion equilibrium relationships.

In parallel to these solar programs, stellar ultraviolet and x-ray
data were acquired using the Copernicus (rue) and Einstein
(HEAO-2) satellites. The ultraviolet observations concentrated on
chromospheres and chromosphere-corona transition zones of late-
type stars, x-ray binary stars, and horizontal branch stars of
globular clusters. The x-ray observation involved, in addition to
specific objects, a survey of the range of x-ray-emitting coronas on
stars in all parts of the temperature-luminosity (H-R) diagram.

158 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Studies were pursued of stellar variability over time scales vary-
ing from minutes to years. This included the development of
scaling laws relating stellar flares to solar flares; study of ultra-
short period variability (minutes) of chromospheres of giant stars;
analysis of luminosity variations of late-type dwarf stars that show
“sunspots”; and photoelectric photometry of peculiar variables.

Theoretical studies of stellar atmospheres included investigation
of relative instability in O-star winds; calculation of empirical
statistical equilibrium models of stellar chromospheres based on
Copernicus ultraviolet data; and publication of arrays of models
giving temperature distribution, Balmer line profiles, and colors of
stars of a wide variety of surface temperatures and compositions.

Programs are under way on the definition of new instrumenta-
tion for solar space astronomy, including a coronal dynamics ex-
periment, an improved Lyman alpha coronagraph, and a precision
solar-variability experiment.

THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS

The Theoretical Astrophysics Division carries out research on a
diverse range of astrophysical phenomena, with theoretical studies
often applied to the support and interpretation of observational
data. Division members frequently work in collaboration with
members of other divisions as well as with scientists in other insti-
tutions. In addition, they contribute significantly to the educational
programs of both the Smithsonian and the Harvard College ob-
servatories.

Valuable progress was made in the understanding of dust grains,
charge transfer processes in ionized plasmas, chemistry of shocked
regions, collision-induced dissociation, stellar dynamics, and the
evolution of globular clusters. Basic studies continued of stellar
dynamics, gravitational theory, radiative transfer, kinetic theory,
scattering theory, and cosmology.

Emphasis continues on the development and application of the
methods of quantum mechanics to atomic and molecular processes,
with special reference to energy-related problems. Studies also con-
tinue on the role of atomic and molecular processes in astrophysical
and atmospheric phenomena.

A substantial effort has been directed toward the formulation of
an equation of state for diffuse clouds, which includes the impor-

Science / 159
tant influence of radiative transfer. One aspect is the development
of an accurate method for treatment of the penetration of diffuse
ultraviolet radiation into clouds subject to scattering by dust grains.

Investigation of quantum gravity and supergravity theories has
focused on a study of the so-called gravitational index theorems.
These theorems relate properties of the field equations of fields of
arbitrary spin to the topological invariants of the background
gravitational field upon which these fields propagate. Use of such
theorems can provide information about the quantum-field theo-
retical divergences that appear in such theories. Supertheorems
were also developed in the context of supergravity theory, and it
was found that under special conditions supergravity theory can
be made finite.

Studies of the halos of galaxies continue. Exploration of various
scenarios for the formation of galactic halos is under way, in addi-
tion to a determination of the velocity dispersion and mass of the
halos of elliptical galaxies (e.g., M 87) from the x-ray observations.

An investigation of the effect of deviations from local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium (LTE) on the structure of a stellar atmosphere
and on the emergent spectrum has led to the conclusion that the
customary description of deviations from LTE in terms of departure
coefficients is deceptive and can be misleading.

A study of the efficacy of chemical sputtering for the destruction
of graphite grains, with particular application to H II regions, has
been carried out. The physics of dust grains in hot gas was investi-
gated, as well as the importance of various mechanisms for the
destruction of interstellar dust. Work was done on the nucleation
of interstellar and circumstellar dust, with particular attention paid
to the thermodynamics of small clusters and the applicability of
“classical” nucleation theory.

The existence of an ionization-coupled acoustic instability of
interstellar matter at temperatures of 30-100 K, previously believed
to be stable, has been demonstrated. Recent hydrodynamic study
of the nonlinear developments suggests that the instability affects
the gas simply by including a “stirred-up” state at low enough
temperatures. Also, fluctuations in temperature over the cycle of
the disturbance can induce portions of the gas to cross into the
regime of the previously found thermal instability.

Research has been carried out in the area of grand unification—

160 / Smithsonian Year 1979
the development of theories that unite the strong with the weak
and electromagnetic interactions. In particular, one aspect of these
theories that may be of importance to cosmology has been ex-
plored: baryon nonconserving processes in the early universe can
produce a baryon-entropy ratio of the order of the observed ratio.

Finally, study of models of x-ray emission from active galactic
nuclei provided new techniques for describing Comptonization in
these sources. An investigation of radiative pumping of fine struc-
ture levels has continued, in order to deduce constraints on the
nature of the clouds producing absorption lines in quasar spectra.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Why study the tropics? First, biologists still attain understanding
primarily through comparison, as did Aristotle and Darwin. The
sheer diversity of tropical plants and animals provides a field for
comparison and perspective without rival. The tremendous variety
of competitors and predators implies that adaptation will be most
finely tuned and most easily studied in the tropics. Similarly, the
mechanism maintaining this diversity in balance will be most pre-
cise and sensitive in tropical communities. Finally, a great many
people live in the tropics, and their fate is decisive to the political
and economic stability of the world. Understanding the ways in
which the balance of nature works in tropical communities may
allow these people to use this balance to their profit rather than
destroy it to everyone’s harm.

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (str1) is a major
center of basic research in the tropics, without equal in the New
World. On Barro Colorado Island, the institute administers a
tropical forest reserve, which is less disturbed and has a more com-
plete animal community than any other equally accessible tract of
tropical forest. The value of this reserve is decisively enhanced by
the understanding and the background information built up by a
half century of research. The institute’s Caribbean and Pacific
marine stations permit easy access to the spectacular natural experi-
ment started when the Isthmus of Panama formed three million
years ago. Fossils document in some detail the conditions that pre-

Science / 161
vailed before the isthmus formed and provide the background by
which one can judge how the biota has responded to the very
different conditions on the two sides: the clear, low-productivity
waters of the Caribbean contrasting greatly with the high-produc-
tivity waters of the eastern Pacific, enriched by seasonal upwelling.
Preserving these matchless opportunities has, however, brought
new responsibilities.

In spite of the enormous administrative demands to prepare STRI
for the treaty-related changes in operations, this year has been
particularly fruitful scientifically. Over 140 scientific articles were
published and 75 seminars delivered by str staff, fellows, and stu-
dents in 1979. William Eberhard, Donald Windsor, and David
Roubik joined the permanent scientific staff.

The Barro Colorado Island Nature Monument has been increased
by several tracts of forest in adjoining mainland areas, which will
need vigorous protection. strI personnel is helping in various ways
to bring about an interest in conservation among Panamanian
citizens, and N. Smythe is advising Panama in the management of
a large national park that Panamanian authorities have proclaimed
on the mainland east and north of Gatun Lake, all in the hope that
Barro Colorado will not be left a small oasis in an otherwise tree-
less landscape.

Members of stri feel strongly that the economic resources of the
developed nations should be used to help the developing tropical na-
tions preserve some of their biological resources. A system of tropi-
cal reserves, financed internationally, will help insure the genetic
reservoir in tropical forests for the future needs of all mankind.

sTRI staff and students also work in other tropical countries and
sometimes even in the temperate zone, thereby providing an essen-
tial perspective for studies closer to home. These studies help to
show how typical Panama is of the tropics in general, permit com-
parisons that shed light either on the origins or on the functions of
phenomena encountered in Panama, and bring str1 personnel in
contact with researchers in other lands.

Martin Moynihan visited Sumatra and Singapore to study cora-
ciiform birds—hornbills, kingfishers, and the like—trying to gain
perspectives on the very odd behavior some birds of this order
display in Africa. He also went to Guam and Palau to study the
squid Sepiateuthis, comparing its modes of communication with

Center in northern Sumatra. The center is responsible for returning orphaned or

those of relatives on the Caribbean coast of Panama. These squid
have a system of communication more complicated than those of
any bird or of most monkeys. They communicate entirely by
changes of color or position and can perform up to seven displays
at once. They live in groups and are much preyed upon, and often
have to play to different audiences simultaneously, hiding from a
predator by a cryptic display, or surprising or confusing it with
some sudden and totally unexpected color change, while trans-
mitting useful information “in code” to other members of the
group. This year also saw the completion of Moynihan’s studies
on Andean birds, with the publication of his book Geographic
Variation in Social Behavior and in Adaptions to Competition
Among Andean Birds.

A group of stRr scientists, Yael Lubin, Michael Robinson,
Barbara Robinson, and Thane Pratt, is working at the Wau Ecology
Institute in Papua New Guinea. Lubin and the Robinsons have been
working in part on social spiders. At Wau there are at least five
species of web-building spiders with gregarious or social tenden-
cies: their presence at one place provides a unique opportunity for
learning both the functions and the evolutionary origins of social
behavior in spiders. Yael Lubin and Thane Pratt are also studying
the social behavior of terrestrial isopods in the montane forest at
Wau. They have found immense aggregations of isopods ranging
over hundreds of square meters of the forest floor.

Olga Linares complemented her study of the Diola wet-rice
peoples of Senegal by gathering comparative data on South Asian
societies, especially the Batak of Sumatra, some of whom are wet-
rice cultivators. Unlike the Diola, who are politically decentralized,
nonhierarchical, and loosely organized into patrilineages three
generations deep, the Batak are carefully organized into marga,
exogamous patrilineages twenty or more generations deep. The
descendants of the founding members of one of the marga control
the village lands and “rule” the community in accordance with
their traditional law. Despite their differences in social organiza-
tion, the wet-rice cultivations of the Diola and the Batak share
many features adapted to unpredictable rain and intermittent irri-
gation.

Mary Jane West Eberhard has been working in Colombia. She
studied colonial wasps of the genus Synoeca in the eastern llanos.

164 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Their social behavior shows much evidence of competition within
the colony, contradicting the image of social insects as communities
of perfect harmony. Rather than devoting themselves to the benefit
of the queen and brood, some females remain idle and behave like
queens when near established queens or their eggs. These females
live longer than foraging workers and may become workers when
other workers are scarce. William Eberhard, who has just joined
the stri staff, completed a study of combat in male beetles, show-
ing that the elaborate horns that have long puzzled naturalists are
often used as weapons of battle. The Eberhards have just moved
to Costa Rica, where Mrs. Eberhard will continue studying social
wasps, while Mr. Eberhard continues to work on orb-web spiders
and the behavior of insects.

Alan Smith has completed seven years of research on the rosette
plants Espeletia spp. of the Venezuelan paramo. The population
of the most common species, Espeletia schultzii, is self-regulating:
increased mortality leads to increased growth among the remaining
plants. On densely vegetated sites, the dead leaves that adults drop
about their bases inhibit the growth of other species but do not
affect young schultzii. The adults thereby create safe zones for
juveniles, whose main source of mortality here is competition from
plants of other species. Higher up, where vegetation is sparser,
inhibiting the growth of other species may harm young schultzii
by exposing them to frost heave, and this species is replaced by
others better adapted to the harsher conditions. The giant Senecios
of Mt. Kenya, which live in the same type of habitat, resemble
Espeletia both in form and in mode of population regulation. Alan
Smith spent five months on Mt. Kenya, continuing his comparison
of these Senecios with Espeletia.

Egbert Leigh continued his comparative studies of “elfin wood-
lands,” the stunted, seemingly wind-planed thickets that occur on
foggy, breezy mountaintops in the tropics. As part of his research,
he visited Puerto Rico to look at ways in which the elfin forest trees
there arrange their branches and leaves. As in Malaya, Costa Rica,
and elsewhere, these plants tended to arrange their leaves in spiral
decussate fashion around erect twigs, as do rhododendrons and
frangipani, rather than in the horizontal sprays of foliage so char-
acteristic of beech. It seems that here, as elsewhere, the shape of
elfin forest trees allows them to grow with the least shedding of

Science / 165
shaded twigs, although this forces upon them an inefficient form,
requiring a great deal of wood for the leaves carried.

Some understanding of the meaning of tree shape was suggested
by the outcome of a local windstorm that opened two clearings of
several hectares apiece near the laboratory of Barro Colorado
Island. With admirable opportunism, Phyllis Coley, Arlee Montalvo,
and Francis Putz, all graduate students at the station, and Annette
Aiello, proceeded to map the damage and found that trees with
dense, strong wood were uprooted, while those with lighter wood
were snapped off their stumps. The trees with the densest wood
were built most like trees of elfin forest; moreover, most plants
react to wind by forming denser wood. The coincidence of Leigh’s
trip, the windstorm, and the studies of these students may lead to
an entirely new approach to the study of the shapes of trees.

At Barro Colorado Island most of the research is devoted to
learning more about the myriad interactions that together maintain
the balance of nature in this forest. Here, predoctoral and post-
doctoral students, many financed now or previously by the Smith-
sonian fellowship program, are leading the way.

Phyllis Coley, a Smithsonian predoctoral fellow from the Uni-
versity of Chicago, has learned that young leaves are eaten far
more rapidly than older, tougher ones, and that leaves of light-
demanding plants that sprout only in clearings are eaten far more
rapidly than less weedy, more shade-tolerant plants. She is now
trying to learn why some leaves are eaten more than others, and
how hairiness, toughness, protein content, and the levels of various
classes of distasteful or toxic compounds influence the rate at
which leaves are eaten. Katharine Milton, just finishing a Smith-
sonian postdoctoral fellowship, has been analyzing physical, chemi-
cal, and nutritional properties of different leaves, flowers, and
fruits in order to understand better the ways in which the seasonal
rhythms in the abundance of fruit and new leaves control the
numbers of spider and howler monkeys on Barro Colorado.
Katherine Troyer has begun an eighteen-month study of the ways
in which diet affects bacterial fermentation in iguana guts, and how
this in turn affects the growth of young iguanas, which are unusual
among lizards in their ability to live on a strictly vegetarian diet
even as hatchlings.

The seasonal rhythm of new leaves is important to the life of
much of the forest. Henk Wolda is continuing to study the relation

166 / Smithsonian Year 1979
between the abundance of leafhoppers on Barro Colorado and
fluctuations in rainfall and the availability of new leaves. He is also
comparing the seasonality of leafhoppers on Barro Colorado with
those of areas possessing different rainfall regimes.

There is also a seasonal rhythm of leaf fall and decomposition,
leaves dropping in the dry season and beginning to rot in earnest
when the rains come. Nigel Franks has been studying population
regulation in army ants, which live in swarms of several hundred
thousand ants apiece, plundering the leaf litter like little armies
for arthropods and other invertebrates. Swarms seem to be most
abundant and active early in the rainy season, when the litter fauna
is richest. Army ant populations seem to be limited primarily by
the abundance of just two species of forest floor ant. Franks intro-
duced army ants to a small island from which they were previously
absent but which had an abundant supply of these two food
species. He was able to demonstrate an increase in reproduction
rate, and, for the time being, the army ants are thriving. Russell
Greenberg, a former Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, and Judith
Gradwohl have been studying the mixed flocks of insectivorous
birds that form in the understory about two species of antwrens.
Two pairs of antwrens, one of each species, share a territory, and
often move about together, attracting other birds as they go.

Different species of trees produce fruit according to different
rhythms, attracting different dispersers. Andrea Worthington, from
the University of Washington, has been studying the relation be-
tween seasonal changes in the abundance of fruits on different
understory shrubs and the feeding and breeding behavior of the
birds that eat these fruits, trying to learn how these birds respond
to a patchy and variable supply of food. Henry Howe, former post-
doctoral fellow at str1, and Gayle Vande Kerckhove are beginning
a study of fruiting rhythm in a species of canopy tree related to
nutmegs, the fruit of which is dispersed very largely by toucans.
How does fruiting rhythm differ from tree to tree or from year to
year? How do these differences affect dispersal? What degree of
dispersal accords best with survival of the seedlings? How does
the amount of fruit wasted and the pattern of dispersal differ from
plants that attract a wide variety of consumers to a huge feast of
fruit?

Other rhythms are being studied that we are only beginning to
understand. Male euglossine bees obtain from orchids and other

Science / 167
flowers fragrances that they seem to use in connection with mating.
James Ackermann, a strI predoctoral fellow, finds that the number
of male euglossines attracted to different fragrances of known
chemistry changes from season to season. Fragrances attract these
bees in greatest numbers when flowers that they pollinate, and that
supply them with fragrances, are blooming.

George Angeher completed his study of seasonal changes in
territorial behavior of hummingbirds. He found that the intensity
with which hummingbirds competed for control of flowers in the
clearing of Barro Colorado had rather little relation to the number
of flowers available there; instead, hummingbird activity was con-
trolled very largely by the abundance of flowers ten or fifteen miles
away along the Panama Railroad, and when these were in bloom
many hummingbirds left the island.

The Environmental Monitoring Program on Barro Colorado
Island is designed to provide the background information needed
to meld these studies into a coherent picture. Records are kept of
rainfall and other climate variables: the runoff from Lutz ravine, a
ten-hectare catchment; soil moisture in that catchment; the weekly
fall per unit area of leaves, fruit, etc., to the forest floor; and those
trees on a census of 400 that are putting out flowers, fruit, or new
leaves each week. Changes in soil moisture seem to be the most
important factor in the rhythm of the forest, timing the onset of
flowering and/or the production and fall of leaves in many plants.

As the results of its first seven years are being written up, the
Environmental Monitoring Program at sTr1 is being reorganized
and new proposals prepared for the next five years. Dr. Donald
Windsor has joined the permanent staff at str in order to run the
tropical phase of this program.

Environmental monitoring plays a large role in the research at
sTRI's Caribbean marine station, Galeta, where John Cubit, Mark
Hay, and John Kilar, along with James Norris of the National
Museum of Natural History, are studying the ecology of the inter-
tidal reef flat and the habitats fronting it.

Mark Hay has been studying turf-forming algae, finding that
algae photosynthesize less when in a turf but are safer from
dessication and herbivores. Indeed, turf-forming algae depend on
herbivores to protect them from fast-growing but less resistant
competition.

Before beginning a sabbatical at Stanford University in Cali-

168 / Smithsonian Year 1979
fornia, Peter Glynn continued his studies on the factors affecting
reef growth in the eastern Pacific. He and predoctoral student
Gerry Wellington were guests of the government of American
Samoa to investigate the impact of Acanthaster upon coral reefs.
Ross Robertson has been continuing his analysis of the interactions
between different damselfish and between them and the algae they
eat. Harilaos Lessios, a new member of the stri staff, began a study
of the effect of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema on coral reefs:
to what extent do they kill coral or prevent its recruitment? He is
also examining the degree of reproductive incompatibility between
congeneric sea urchins of the two coasts. Echinometra lucunter of
the Caribbean coast wiil, for example, not accept fertilization by
sperm of the Pacific urchin E. vanbrunti, although the reverse mat-
ing works. He will be able to check the correlation of reproductive
incompatibility with either morphological or genetic differences.

Freshwater organisms have not been completely ignored this
year. Mary Power, a Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, completed
another stage in her study of the effects on armored catfish of
seasonal variation in the amount and quality of their food. These
fish live in pools in streams and graze algae from the rocks of the
stream bottom. Their food supply is affected by shade over the
pool, which slows algal growth, and the time elapsed since the last
major flood scoured the rocks clean. High sediment content can
also slow algal growth or even kill the algae—there is more sedi-
ment the more slowly the stream flows. It appears that these fish
populations are limited primarily by their food supply, which is
greatest early in the rainy season when there is little sediment but
few devastating floods.

Professors Luis D’Croz and Rat Amores, with several of their
students from the University of Panama, began a long-term study
of the population dynamics of cladocerans in Gatun Lake. They
will be making weekly plankton tows and hydrographic stations
along a transect between Frijoles and Barro Colorado Island.

There is, however, much more to tropical biology than the simple
adage of eat or be eaten; there is a host of nuances, some affecting
the function of the community in a vital way, some shedding light
on aspects of natural selection not directly related to finding food
or escaping predators, some helping us to understand the diversity
of the community.

David Janos, a Smithsonian postdoctoral fellow, is continuing

Science / 169
his studies of the different relationships between tropical forest
trees and the mycorrhizal fungi that assist their roots in extracting
mineral nutrients from the soil. Most trees here, especially those of
the mature forest, cannot grow without mycorrhizae; some second-
growth trees only need mycorrhizae when on poor soils, and some
plants, characteristic either of early succession or of very poor
soils, do not need them at all. David Janos is starting another set
of experiments to show how mycorrhizae affect the growth and
competitive ability of plants from different stages of succession.
Laurie McHargue is studying the nodules of nitrogen-fixing bac-
teria, which one finds on the roots of many legumes: how do they
affect the growth of seedlings of tropical leguminous trees?

Several people have been studying the ways in which organisms
attract mates. Robert Warner, a former Smithsonian postdoctoral
fellow, has been working on the blue-headed wrasse, a coral reef
fish. Most of its individuals are born female and change color and
sex when large enough to be able to compete with the other males.
These fish mate at special sites: on most reefs, the largest males,
which attract the most mates, hold mating territories at the down-
stream end of the reef, where eggs will most quickly drift off the
reef. On the largest reefs, however, there are many small, non-
territorial males, which mate in swarms and often occupy the
downstream end of the reef while large, brightly colored males
establish mating territories on its side. Warner wishes to learn
whether the females choose the male or the mating territory he
occupies.

Beverly Dugan, a stri fellow, discovered that during the breeding
season male iguanas use three different mating strategies. Very
large males turn bright orange, and each defends an isolated tree
as a territory, where females come to mate with him. Medium-sized
males defend territories peripheral to those of large males and
thereby attract the occasional female. Small males, which are the
size and color of the green females, lurk in the territories of large
males and attempt to fertilize the females gathered there. Large
males do most of the mating, but small males are occasionally
successful.

Michael Ryan, a Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, is studying the
ways in which female frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, choose a
mate, and why. These females prefer large males and seem to be

170 / Smithsonian Year 1979
able to judge a male’s size by his call. Naida Zucker, of the Uni-
versity of New Mexico, has been examining the same question for
fiddler crabs at Naos.

Male Jamaican fruit bats, Artibeus jamaicensis, keep harems.
Douglas Morrison, a former Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, has
affixed small radios to bats from the same roost in order to follow
their movements. He finds that during mating season they are very
solicitous of their females, always guarding the roost when females
are present, and escorting them in as they return at dawn. To sup-
port all this activity takes a great deal of energy; harem males eat
twice their weight in figs every night, half again as much as other
conspecifics.

“Africanized” honeybees are spreading northward from South
America and should reach the Panama Canal in a few years. When
European honeybees were introduced to America many years ago,
they apparently displaced many native pollinators and greatly
changed the economics of pollination in the eastern United States.
Africanized honeybees show every sign of exerting a similar effect.
David Roubik has joined the stri staff to study this effect, and he
is now working on the ecology and pollinating habits of those
native bees and other pollinators with which the invading bees are
most likely to compete.

Gordon Burghardt and Stanley Rand have been studying thermo-
regulation in nesting iguanas, using radiotelemetry to monitor the
temperatures of nesting female iguanas on Slothia Island. These
females normally thermoregulate rather precisely, but they are
much less careful when nesting and continue to dig nest burrows
even when their body temperature drops well below the normal
activity range.

Francis Putz, anew Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, has come to
study the lianas of Barro Colorado Island. Lianas account for be-
tween a tenth and a sixth of the leaves in most tropical forests, and
for nearly 40 percent of the leaf production for one rain forest in
Gabon. They are a great nuisance to tropical foresters because of
their adverse effect on the tree growth, but very little is known
about them. Putz would like to know how a liana’s mode of climb-
ing, and its degree of commitment to vegetative reproduction by
side shoots to other trees, affects its role in the forest.

Robert Silberglied has extensive records on Anartia, a common

Science / 171
species of butterfly living in the laboratory clearing at Barro
Colorado Island. He and Annette Aiello captured nearly all the
butterflies of this species in the clearing every week for months on
end and took extensive notes on the state of each insect captured.
He can therefore judge the effect of different sorts of damage on
the butterfly’s life expectancy and determine how often the butter-
fly comes within a given degree of being killed by a bird, and from
what direction these threats usually come. He also painted over
some of the markings of these butterflies to see how this affected
their life span and the types of damage they suffer.

Barbara Thorne, a Smithsonian predoctoral fellow, has come to
study seasonal changes in the diet and behavior of termites. Very
much to her surprise, she soon discovered that many termite
colonies had several queens, something known at the turn of the
century but utterly forgotten since. This rediscovery may shed light
on the ways in which colonial behavior evolved among termites.

Catherine Phillips has been studying the distribution of the two
common ferns of the forest, Adiantum lucidum and Tectarias
incisa. These are restricted to steep slopes and show few signs of
competition. They seem to be limited by the places in which their
gametophytes can become established. The gametophytes do not
readily become established in flat areas where they can be dis-
rupted by rain splash or smothered by litter. On steep slopes,
gametophytes are more likely to find shelter from overhanging
roots and stems, and litter accumulates only with difficulty. A
parallel situation may exist in some marine organisms, such as the
corals of the eastern Pacific, which are limited primarily by the
capacity of their young to settle and become established. Thus they
are rare even in places in which it has been shown that adults can
survive without difficulty. It would be interesting to know how true
this is of land plants.

Through the provisions of the Panama Canal Treaty, a contract
with the Ministry of Health, and arrangements with the Panama
Canal Authority, strr will continue to operate research facilities in
Panama indefinitely. There will be some changes in its mode of
operation, but these operational changes are yet to be formalized.

One significant change will occur on October 1, 1979, when the
research reserve of Barro Colorado Island will be expanded under
the designation of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument. In

172 / Smithsonian Year 1979
September 1979, under a separate agreement pursuant to Article
VI of the 1940 Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife
Preservation, the negotiators of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty, repre-
senting the governments of the United States and Panama, estab-
lished the Barro Colorado Nature Monument and designated the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute as its custodian. The Barro
Colorado Nature Monument will include not only Barro Colorado
Island but also the adjacent areas of Orchid Island; the peninsulas
of Bohio, Buena Vista, and Frijoles on the east bank of the canal;
and the penisulas of Pifia Blanca and Gigantito, south and west of
Barro Colorado Island. According to the nature monument defini-
tion in the 1940 convention, “strict protection will be given to this
area” and only scientific investigations and government inspections
duly authorized will be permitted. The scientific management and
protection of the 5,400-hectare Nature Monument will be an im-
portant new conservation responsibility for strR1.

In addition to the establishment of the Nature Monument, the
Republic of Panama has declared its intention to develop a 22,000-
hectare national park in the Summit and Pipeline areas of the
Canal Zone that will revert to Panama on October 1, 1979. Dr.
Smythe, head of stri’s Office of Conservation and Environmental
Education, has been working with officials of the Republic of
Panama (National Directorate of Renewable Resources [RENARE],
Ministry of Agricultural Development) and of the U.S. National
Park Service and U.S. arp to prepare a master plan for the develop-
ment of this park. The protection of this national park adjacent to
the Barro Colorado Nature Monument should assure the continua-
tion of the enormous animal and plant diversity that has long
attracted scientists from around the world.

Construction of a new circulating seawater system at the Naos
Marine Laboratory was initiated on May 1, 1979. Work will soon
begin on a replacement for the Barro Colorado Island dormitory
and on a library wing for the Ancon laboratory building. The R/V
Benjamin completed its refitting in February, and it began its re-
search with a voyage in March to Cocos Island off Costa Rica. str1
scientists were joined by Costa Rican conservation officials in the
effort to obtain data necessary for the designation of Cocos Island
as a national park.

HISTORY AND: ART

CHARLES BLITZER,
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HISTORY AND ART

Archives of American Art

The sources of information scholars expect to find at the Archives
of American Art comprise a wide variety of manuscript and printed
material. Several of this year’s most notable acquisitions offer an
extraordinary richness of such forms.

The earliest piece of material received is unusual for a special
reason—it consists of a single item. It is a long and informative
letter written by the painter Eastman Johnson from Germany in
1851, describing, in gratifying detail, his studies in Diisseldorf, his
work with Emanuel Leutze, and his painting a copy of the latter’s
Washington Crossing the Delaware. Another source of information
consists of the papers of Johnson’s contemporary, Thomas Buchanan
Read, famous in his time as a painter-poet. The papers are made up
chiefly of Read’s fascinating correspondence, with letters from such
luminaries as Hiram Powers, Frederic E. Church, Harriet Hosmer,
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Generals
Sheridan and Sherman. Since Read’s best-known work was a poem
(and several versions of a painting) entitled Sheridan’s Ride, inspired
by a celebrated Civil War incident, several appreciative letters from
the general come as no surprise. A more unexpected item is a neatly
twisted lock from the mane of Sheridan’s horse.

Significant acquisitions reflecting American art in the later nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries include records of the painters
J. Francis Murphy and John White Alexander, the latter an active
figure in art organizations and president of the National Academy of
Design. Both collections contain a large number of photographs, and

175
Murphy’s papers include a finished but unpublished biography of
the artist. The same period is covered in twenty-six volumes of a
diary kept by Desmond Fitzgerald, a leading Boston art collector and
patron whose daily observations provide a valuable record of the art
establishment in his city.

The papers of John Storrs, an early modernist sculptor, are of
particular interest for the years during and after World War I, when
he corresponded with Marsden Hartley, Joseph Stella, John Sloan,
John Reed, Louise Bryant, William E. Bullitt, and many others. The
Storrs collection includes correspondence, diaries, poetry notebooks,
sketchbooks, scrapbooks, business and commission records, photo-
graphs, exhibition catalogues, notes, and even accounts of dreams,
all in great abundance.

The same critical epoch in American art history is covered in a
splendid collection of several hundred rare exhibition catalogues that
reflect, among other things, the rise of modernism through gallery
and art-society exhibitions, from The Eight show of 1908 (a par-
ticularly scarce item) to the wide acceptance of the new art in the
galleries of the 1920s. It brings to light dozens of short-lived galleries
and associations that played a vital role in the burst of public art
consciousness at the time.

Scholarly concern with federal sponsorship of the arts under the
New Deal is still growing, an interest that will be fed by large new
additions to the papers of Holger Cahill, who directed the wra
Federal Art Project, and of Adele Clark, head of the Federal Art
Project in Virginia. A useful group of records of the critic and writer
Sheldon Cheney, including a series of letters from Alfred Stieglitz,
also touches on cultural activities of the Depression period. The
papers of John Steuart Curry, a painter closely connected to the
regionalist movement of the 1930s, offer a well-rounded view of his
life and career through several thousand items of correspondence,
writings, financial records, and photographs. With the recent dona-
tion of a considerable group of family letters, scrapbooks, notebooks,
calendar diaries, and photographs, another artist often identified
with the same decade, Reginald Marsh, is now represented by the
complete corpus of his records.

The remaining papers of the late Hudson Walker, art dealer,
collector, and patron, filled seven cartons. They include extensive
correspondence with artists, particularly Marsden Hartley and Philip

176 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Evergood, family letters, records of the Hudson Walker Gallery, and
useful documentation on his own collection and on his work with the
American Federation of Art and Artists Equity.

One of the largest of the year’s acquisitions was the correspond-
ence, notes, and draft writings of the art historian and curator W. G.
Constable, covering much of the twentieth century. His papers in-
clude voluminous material on the history of art collecting in both
Europe and the United States and on the role of American museum
personnel in the protection and restitution of works of art in Europe
during and immediately after World War II. This latter subject is
also treated in the papers of Andrew C. Ritchie, the lecturer, writer,
and museum director who served with the U.S. Army’s Monuments
and Fine Arts Section in its task of locating and saving works of art
in Europe toward the end of the war.

Gallery and institutional records among the year’s acquisitions in-
cluded those of the Doll and Richards Gallery, a Boston firm that
recently went out of business after well over a century; the League of
New Hampshire Craftsmen, the first state-supported crafts group
in the country; and the Renaissance Society at the University of
Chicago. Since the society’s founding in 1915, its exhibitions and
lectures have contributed much to Chicagoans’ understanding of
contemporary art.

The Archives Oral History Program began producing videotapes
in 1979 with tapes of interviews with the sculptors Louise Nevelson
and Isamu Noguchi, both conducted in Detroit under the sponsor-
ship of the Center of Creative Studies. More conventionally recorded
interviews were conducted with the writer and authority on Alfred
Stieglitz, Dorothy Norman; the scholar, curator, and museum
director Adelyn Breeskin; and the artists Grace Hartigan, Richard
Stankiewicz, Frans Wildenhain, Allan Crite, and Richard Hunt.

The use made of archives resources is reflected in two statistics:
2,460 research visits and 1,150 rolls of microfilm circulated through
interlibrary loans. A further indication of scholarship pursued at the
archives appears in books, articles, dissertations, and catalogues
acknowledging indebtedness to its holdings. Among these are a
general survey of American art over three hundred years; a history
of art in American culture in the years between 1865 and 1920;
biographies of Louis Eilshemius (by the director of the Archives
West Coast Center), Winslow Homer, Walt Kuhn, and Gertrude

History and Art / 177
Vanderbilt Whitney; major catalogues on the work of Charles
Burchfield, Adolph Gottlieb, Seymour Lipton, Edward Moran, Mark
Rothko, John Singer Sargent, David Smith, and Elihu Vedder; and
volumes on the Columbus Museum of Art collection and on Ameri-
can expatriates in England.

In order to encourage research and promote its resources among
the scholarly and lay public, the archives cooperated in the publica-
tion this year of The Archives of American Art: Collection of Exhi-
bition Catalogues, a large volume listing holdings of over 15,000
American art-exhibition catalogues available on microfilm. A supple-
ment updating the Checklist of the Collection was also published in
fiscal year 1979, while the Archives of American Art Journal, under
new editorship, continued to inform readers of acquisitions and pro-
vide a medium for the results of research by art historians.

The archives’ regional office in Boston cosponsored a well-
attended symposium on American watercolors and drawings. During
the course of the year, members of the archives staff delivered fifteen
lectures, addressed several seminars, and published six articles and a
monograph.

Several small exhibitions of archives material were held at the
regional offices in Boston, San Francisco, New York, and Washing-
ton, D.C. A larger installation of nearly one hundred documents and
photographs was lent to the Whitney Museum in connection with
its fiftieth anniversary, an event coinciding with the archives’ own
twenty-fifth anniversary.

A significant event in the archives’ Washington Center took place
in January, when its quarters underwent a complete rearrangement
and redecoration of offices, working space, and research area. The
new design, incorporating additional space acquired in 1978, enables
the staff to operate more efficiently and allows researchers greater
privacy.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum

In many ways, the past year has been the most fruitful and successful
in the history of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Institution’s Na-
tional Museum of Design. Attendance continued to increase over

178 / Smithsonian Year 1979
the previous year, with more than 180,000 visitors to the museum
attending some of its most popular exhibitions to date.

Beginning in October 1978, ‘“Crosscurrents: French and Italian
Neoclassical Drawings and Prints of France and Italy from the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum” was on view on the museum’s second
floor, and a photographic show, “Form Follows Film,” was installed
in the Contemporary Design Gallery. On October 3, “Ornament in
the 20th Century” opened to the public. This exhibition contained
ornament from jewelry to buildings and consisted of over 500 ob-
jects. On October 10, “Artists’ Postcards, Series II” opened, consist-
ing of 51 framed designs for postcards, as well as supplementary
materials.

“Vienna Moderne, 1898-1918” opened November 27. “Vienna
Moderne” was the first major exhibition of Viennese work from this
period to be installed anywhere in the United States. It proved to
be extremely popular. “The Shopping Bag: Portable Graphic Art”
opened on December 7 in the Contemporary Design Gallery. On
January 23, 1979, “The Dream King, Ludwig II of Bavaria,” opened,
with a selection of drawings and gouache designs for Ludwig II’s
castles and their contents, in addition to articles of furniture, metal-
work, ceramics, and memorabilia. ‘“Indelible Images: Contemporary
Advertising Design” opened in the Contemporary Design Gallery
on February 6 and ran through March 25. It consisted of a selection
of magazine advertisements and posters, with a videotape of tele-
vision commercials.

In the spring, “Japan Today,” a festival celebrating Japanese cul-
ture, was held in a number of American cities. In honor of the
occasion, the Cooper-Hewitt devoted the two main floors of its
galleries to Japanese subjects. The major show, ‘Ma: Space/Time in
Japan,” was designed by Arata Isozaki. The show consisted of nine
sections, each expressing an aspect of the ancient Japanese space/
time concept of Ma by means of photographic essays, sculptures,
and traditional structures, such as the teahouse and the Noh stage.
The extensive catalogue was written and designed in Tokyo and then
edited and printed in New York. The show opened to the public on
March 13. On March 27, “Porcelain: A Selection from the Cooper-
Hewitt Collections” opened in the Carnegie Library.

On June 12, three exhibitions opened for the summer. “Fantastic
Illustration and Design in Britain, 1850-1930” occupied most of the

History and Art / 179
first floor. Organized by the Rhode Island School of Design, the
show consisted primarily of original drawings, with a small selection
of books, furniture, ceramics, and other items of decorative art.
“Alvar Aalto,” a retrospective show on the work of this major
architect, was installed on the second floor. A traveling exhibition
circulated by the Finnish Museum of Architecture, it was largely a
photographic panel show, with a selection of models, furniture, and
which was hung in both the Con-
temporary Design and Decorative Arts galleries, was the third sum-

J

glassware. “Roma Interrotta,’

mer show, and ran until August 12. It consisted of drawings of
idealized schemes for Rome by twelve contemporary architects.

On June 26, the museum’s third immovable objects exhibition,
“Urban Open Spaces,” opened in the Mansion Garden, with a
mayoral proclamation and a festive balloon launching. On this same
occasion, Fifth Avenue from 86th to 102nd Street was closed to traffic
for two hours in the evening so that visitors could stroll along “Mu-
seum Mile” and visit the nine museums that make up one of the
densest concentrations of cultural institutions in the world. The most
extensive immovable objects show yet, “Urban Open Spaces” in-
cluded a sixty-four-page newspaper catalogue, profusely illustrated;
a postcard tour of outdoor art; a videotape on community gardens;
and eleven exhibitions at sites throughout the city.

The year’s final exhibition was “Glass: Selections from the
Cooper-Hewitt Collections,”
Decorative Arts Gallery.

The Smithsonian Traveling Exhibition Service circulated three
Cooper-Hewitt offerings: ‘“Crosscurrents: Neoclassical Drawings
and Prints of France and Italy,” ‘Close Observation” (112 oil
sketches by Frederic E. Church), and ‘““Subways” (the second im-
movable objects exhibition).

In cooperation with the Book-of-the-Month Club, the museum has
completed four parts of a twelve-part series, The Smithsonian IIlus-
trated Library of Antiques. The museum has also published the
following eight catalogues on its collections: Porcelain; Glass; Em-
broidery; French and Italian Neoclassical Drawings; Bandboxes
and Shopping Bags; Japanese Woodblock Prints; Kata-gami:
Japanese Stencils; and Tsuba: Japanese Sword Guards.

During the past year, the museum offered four semesters of
courses covering a wide range of topics relating to design and decora-

which opened on August 28 in the

180 / Smithsonian Year 1979

tive arts. The museum continues to increase audience participation in
these programs, as well as its course offerings. In the summer of
1979, 25 percent more courses and tours were offered than the previ-
cus summer, and attendance reached 3,000, a substantial increase
over previous years. Tours continued to be the most popular of the
programs offered. Participation in lecture series also continues to
grow, as more New Yorkers become acquainted with the museum.
Total membership in the museum has now grown to 5,600, a 25 per-
cent increase.

The Sixth Annual Benefit Auction was held in May, with Sotheby
Parke Bernet conducting the sale. This event continues to be popu-
lar and an important source of revenue for the museum.

The success of the museum has been very much dependent on the
seventy volunteers who currently work there. In addition to their
other duties this past year, they conducted tours for 460 groups,
comprising some 16,000 adults and young people.

During the past year, the museum accepted into its collections
3,058 works of art from 70 donors. The departments of Drawings
and Prints, Decorative Arts, and Textiles purchased 13 items for the
museum collections through a variety of restricted acquisition funds.
Incoming loans to the museum continued to increase, as 4,598 items
were borrowed from 220 museums and private lenders. The Cooper-
Hewitt lent 555 objects to 30 museums and other organizations.

Following a special allocation of congressional funds for the plan-
ning and implementation of the inventory of the Cooper-Hewitt
collections, the staff worked with the Office of Computer Services
and with the Smithsonian Registrar to plan inventory systems and
procedures. The inventory is currently in progress. At the end of
fiscal year 1979, some 55,000 items had been inventoried, and 10
percent of the collection had been photographed.

The following staff appointments became effective this past year.
Christian Rohlfing was promoted to the position of assistant director
for collections management. Daniel O'Leary joined the staff in April
as assistant director for administration, and in November, David
Revere McFadden assumed the position of curator of decorative arts.

There were significant material changes in the mansion, with the
cleaning of the exterior of the building, the completion of the fourth
floor to house the textile collection, and the conversion of the old
Carnegie Library to a permanent Decorative Arts Gallery.

182 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Freer Gallery of Art

Several major appointments were made during the past year. Dr.
Shen C. Y. Fu joined the staff as associate curator of Chinese art. A
native of Shanghai, Dr. Fu received his Ph.D. in Chinese art from
Princeton University and most recently was on the faculty of Yale
University. The gallery’s new associate curator of Japanese art, Dr.
Yoshiaki Shimizu, came to the Freer from the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley. Dr. Shimizu is a native of Japan. He did under-
graduate work at Harvard and received his M.F.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Princeton. Julia K. Murray joined the Freer staff as a translator
of technical materials. Miss Murray holds a graduate degree in
Chinese art history from Princeton University and was formerly on
the staff of the Far Eastern Department at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York City. With the arrival of Mr. Ryo Nishiumi, the
Freer acquired the services of a specialist in the techniques of Far
Eastern painting restoration. Nishiumi was born in Japan and com-
pleted a ten-year traditional apprenticeship before coming to the
United States.

With the arrival of these new staff members, the need for addi-
tional office space became critical. To meet that requirement, some of
the corridor areas of the ground floor of the gallery have been desig-
nated for renovation. A proposal to study the possibility of enclosing
the Freer courtyard is also under way. Part of the preliminary study
will explore the possibility of excavating the space beneath the court-
yard to obtain additional space for offices.

All of the Freer’s exhibition galleries were repainted in 1979, and,
where appropriate, carpeting has been installed. A preliminary study
of possible alterations to the present lighting system has been com-
pleted. A pilot program for a comprehensive relighting system will
soon be tested.

The gallery installed two major exhibitions in 1979. ‘The Brush of
the Masters: Drawings from Iran and India” presented eighty-two
works executed between 1400 and 1800. The examples included the
earliest Islamic drawings from Iran made under the patronage of the
Jalairid, Timurid, and Turkmen dynasties in the fifteenth century. A
number of the Iranian drawings were signed and dated, including the
works of such renowned masters as Muhammedi, Sheykh Muham-
med, Muhammed Muhsin, and Riza and Muin Musavvir. The

History and Art / 183
drawings from India represented the Mughal, Deccani, and Rajput
schools, Esin Atil, the gallery’s associate curator of Islamic art, pre-
pared the illustrated catalogue.

The second major exhibition, entitled “Japanese Lacquer,” was
part of the Washington observance of the “Japan Today” program.
Fifty-nine examples of lacquerware, including richly decorated medi-
cine cases (known as inr6), food and water containers, writing boxes,
brush stands, and incense containers from the Freer’s permanent col-
lection, represented eleven centuries of lacquer-making techniques.
Publication of the catalogue, by Ann Yonemura, the gallery’s assist-
ant curator of Japanese art, was made possible by a grant from
Matsushita Electric (Panasonic).

An exhibition of early Armenian manuscripts opened on May 18,
International Museum Day. The Armenian manuscripts form the
largest single group among the world-famous early Christian manu-
scripts in the Freer. The Armenian collection includes six gospels, a
hymnal, and a psalter, and covers a span of seven centuries.

On June 15, the gallery opened a show of Chinese paintings from
the Ch’ing dynasty (1644-1911). The scrolls enabled visitors to com-
pare the styles of the older, intellectual and scholarly paintings with
those done by the eccentric, backward-looking artists during the
early years of China’s last dynasty.

During his visit to the Freer Gallery on May 2, Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira of Japan pledged a $1 million gift to help build the
new Asian Art Gallery that is part of the Smithsonian’s South Quad-
rangle Project. As an adjunct to the Freer, the new Asian Art Gallery
will provide room for expansion and will enable the Freer to increase
its programs for exhibitions, research, and public service.

Among visitors of note were Her Imperial Highness Princess
Chichibu of Japan, His Imperial Highness Prince Norihito Mikasa of
Japan, and Miss Chuo Lin, wife of the People’s Republic of China’s
Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-p’ing.

The collection was increased during the year by ninety-two ob-
jects. One of the most important pieces to be acquired was a Japanese
wood sculpture of a guardian king, which dates from the Kamakura
period (1185-1333). This acquisition provided the gallery with a
complete set of the four guardian kings.

The Freer Gallery of Art sponsored the twenty-sixth annual series
of “Illustrated Lectures on Oriental Art.” One of the six lectures, by

184 / Smithsonian Year 1979
Professor Yoshiaki Shimizu of the University of California, Berkeley,
was sponsored jointly with the Embassy of Japan and was entitled
“Landscapes of Muromachi Monks: Images and Words.” The
Rutherford J. Gettens Memorial Lecture, “Silver in Ancient Greece
and Byzantium: Production and Art,” was delivered by Professor
Constantin Conophagos of the National Technical University of
Athens. A special lecture on “Japanese Lacquer” was given by
Ann Yonemura of the Freer Gallery of Art for the “Japan Today”
program.

Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

During its first five years, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden has actively continued the important task of expanding its
permanent collection through gifts and purchases. The purpose of
these acquisitions is twofold: to keep the collection contemporary, so
that it will reflect current aesthetic developments, and to build upon
original strengths in the collection. During 1979, the museum ac-
quired 280 works of art, including a major gift of 57 objects from the
Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation.

A major acquisition was the museum’s purchase of Aristide
Maillol’s monumental sculpture Action in Chains (L’Action En-
chainée): Monument to Louis-Auguste Blanqui. The sculpture, meas-
uring seven feet in height, was acquired with nonappropriated trust
funds made available by the Smithsonian Board of Regents for the
acquisition of important works of art. This acquisition immeasurably
strengthens the museum’s collection of modern European sculpture.

Other important acquisitions consisted of works by Max Beck-
mann, Josef Csaky, Josef Albers, Burgoyne Diller, Kenneth Noland,
Raphael Soyer, and Richard Diebenkorn.

An important event in 1979 was the accreditation of the museum
by the American Association of Museums. The committee found the
Hirshhorn’s operation to be “exemplary. .. . The Hirshhorn is an
exceptionally well-run museum that more than satisfies all require-
ments for accreditation.”

The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden acted as host to the
College Art Association’s annual meeting held in Washington, D.C.,

from January 31 to February 3, 1979. With the cooperation of other
museums in the area, the Hirshhorn was able to arrange a series of
receptions and visits culminating with the convocation and a farewell
reception on February 2.

The museum’s year of exhibitions began with “Saul Steinberg,” a
large retrospective exhibition organized by the Whitney Museum of
American Art. Public interest ran high, with excellent attendance.
“Ben Nicholson: Fifty Years of His Art,” organized by the Albright-
Knox Gallery, opened at the museum in December 1978. This fas-
cinating display of Nicholson’s art, covering a half-century of the
British artist’s work, was elegantly installed and elicited favorable
comments in the press. “Richard Estes: The Urban Landscape,”
organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, attracted unusual
numbers of midwinter visitors. This exhibition seemed particularly
fascinating to young people, including artists and students, an indi-
cation of the current level of public interest in Neorealist art. The
Hirshhorn Museum added to the exhibition five of Estes’s silkscreen
proof prints and their original studies. ‘““Louis M. Eilshemius: Selec-
tions from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,” organized
for the museum by Paul Karlstrom, west coast area director of the
Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art, was probably the most
complete review of Eilshemius’s art since his death in 1941. Eilshem-
ius, a controversial figure since Duchamp’s “discovery” of him in
1917, was represented by eighty-five paintings alternating between
lyrical landscapes and eccentric nude and genre subjects, the sum of
which confirmed his reputation as a turn-of-the-century romantic
artist. “Alexander Calder,” organized by the Whitney Museum,
drew the attention of thousands of visitors. This traveling version
of the major retrospective of 1976 included over 125 works—
mobiles, stabiles, wire sculptures, paintings, drawings, gouaches,
tapestries, toys, and jewelry—from the fifty-year career of the re-
nowned American artist. “David Hockney: Travels with Pen, Pencil,
and Ink,” organized by the International Exhibitions Foundation,
opened at the museum on March 29, 1979. This exhibition, supported
by a grant from the SCM Corporation, consisted of 150 prints and
drawings, including portraits, interiors, still lifes, and views of Cali-
fornia, Europe, Japan, and North Africa. In the spirit of keeping
abreast of current developments in American contemporary art, the
museum organized and presented a major group exhibition, ““Direc-

186 / Smithsonian Year 1979
tions.” The show of recent work by eighteen young artists from
around the country included fifty-eight sculptures, drawings, paint-
ings, site-oriented projects, and videomovies. This exhibition was
received with remarkable enthusiasm by art critics both locally and
nationally and by the public.

Several smaller exhibitions, consisting of works from the mu-
seum’s own holdings, were presented. These included “Alfred
Maurer,” “David Smith,” “The Cubist Heritage,” “Josef Albers,”
“Cornell Boxes,” “Benin Bronzes,” and “Images of Children.”

The museum provided visitors with a variety of educational ma-
terials, including wall labels, checklists, brochures, and handouts,
the latter ranging from a single page to more ambitious illustrated
minicatalogues, all distributed free to the public. All major exhibi-
tions were accompanied by well-documented and -illustrated cata-
logues that served the general public as well as students and scholars.

Augmenting the museum’s exhibition program was a series of
lectures on various aspects of contemporary art and art history. The
speakers were Karyn Allen, John Canaday, Howard Fox, Henry
Geldzahler, David Hockney, Paul Karlstrom, Joan Martin, George
Rickey, Richard Rubinfeld, Linda Sweet, and Judith Zilczer. The
lively “dialogue” between Mr. Hockney and Mr. Geldzahler, New
York City’s commissioner of cultural affairs, attracted an overflow
audience, with many people being turned away.

The museum continued its tri-part film series: ‘““Lunchtime Films
about Artists”; “Evening Films by Artist Filmmakers”; and “Satur-
day Films for Young People.” Other events held in the auditorium
were concerts by the 20th Century Consort, two piano concerts by
Carla Hiibner, and an evening of “Visual Music” with John Dowell.

Two programs especially designed for children were given. The
annual Hirshhorn Holiday attracted 4,500 people, who were enter-
tained by mimes, a Punch ’n’ Judy show, and special children’s play-
lets. Musical accompaniment included a banjo player, flutists, and
a barbershop quartet whose members led crowds to and from per-
formance areas. This holiday event, sponsored in part by the
Women’s Committee of the Smithsonian Associates, continues to be
a great success, and another is scheduled for next year. A “Calder
for Kids” program was organized by the museum’s staff for eight- to
ten-year-olds and their parents. The program consisted of a screening
of the film Calder’s Circus in the auditorium, as well as a slide pro-

History and Art / 187
gram emphasizing recurring motifs in his works, his significance to
American art, and his unique contribution to the art of the century.
Participants were given a map showing the location of Calder’s works
in the museum for further study after the program.

In order to make the museum’s collection accessible to the widest
possible audience, extensive loans were made to museums in the
United States and abroad. The Hirshhorn Museum lent 131 objects
to 49 institutions, including the Fondation Maeght; Kunsthaus
Zurich; National Museum of Modern Art; and the Hakone Open-Air
Museum in Japan.

Members of the staff continued to lecture at the museum and at
other institutions; to write for publication; to work with graduate
and undergraduate museum interns and Smithsonian fellows; to re-
spond to written inquiries and visits from scholars, students, and
artists; and to carry forward the tasks of research and documenta-
tion.

An active group of specially trained docents offered guidance to
interested visitors with regard to the permanent collection and to
exhibitions. An extension program designed to prepare school classes
for their museum visits began in September 1978 and has already
reached approximately 2,000 children. An extension program, de-
veloped in conjunction with the Montgomery County School System,
was tested in Millcreek Town Elementary School in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, in January, February, and early March. The favorable
response indicates that such programs might be extended to other
areas and to metropolitan Washington in particular. Requests have
been received from Prince Georges and Fairfax counties and the City
of Alexandria for similar programs. On March 24, the Education De-
partment conducted two workshops for the Northern Virginia Coun-
cil for Gifted and Talented Education, and almost every teacher who
attended expressed interest in future participation. A grant has been
received from the Smithsonian Educational Outreach Program to en-
able the museum to continue this experimental project for one year.

All departments of the museum concerned with the care and
management of the collection and the mounting of exhibitions con-
tinued to make important contributions. Continuing changes were
made to the installation of the permanent collection, unit installa-
tions from the collection, and major exhibitions. The sculpture am-
bulatories on the second and third floors were completely reinstalled.

The Office of the Registrar completed an inventory of the painting
collection. Such inventories are conducted yearly and are rotated
among the sculpture, painting, and print and drawing collections.

Joseph Henry Papers

The third volume of The Papers of Joseph Henry was published in
the past year by the Smithsonian Institution Press. The longest
volume so far of the projected fifteen-volume series, it provides in-
tensive coverage of the critical years 1836 and 1837, devoted mainly
to Henry’s scientific tour of Britain and France—his formal introduc-
tion to the world of international science.

Two other publications are well on the way to completion. Volume
four (1838-40) documents Henry’s reflections on the American
scientific scene in light of his recent European experience and the re-
sumption of his electromagnetic research at Princeton. Scientific
statesmanship is the subject of the second publication in progress,
which will present essays and speeches by Henry from the entire
span of his career. It begins with an Albany-period statement about
the hierarchy of science and technology and closes with a presidential
address of 1876 to the National Academy of Sciences. A highlight of
the volume is another presidential address to the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, which pulls together major
elements of Henry’s scientific ideology. The theme of this special
volume, aimed primarily at college audiences, is the scientific way of
life in nineteenth-century America. Both the popular book and the
fourth installment of the Henry Papers are scheduled to go to press
late in 1979.

Members of the Henry Papers staff have been active in other ways.
Marc Rothenberg gave a course at the University of Maryland on the
theme of American scientific exploration. Arthur Molella did con-
sulting work for the newly launched Thomas Edison Papers at
Rutgers and prepared an exhibition for a new science-technology
museum in Richmond, Virginia. Nathan Reingold gave a University
Lecture at Wisconsin on the early years of the Institute for Ad-
vanced Study and again convened his monthly Nineteenth-Century
Seminar.

Two visiting scholars, Cynthia Field and Kenneth Hafertepe (a
Smithsonian ten-week fellow), did research at the Henry Papers on
the architectural and political origins of the Smithsonian Institution
“Castle” Building. James Flack used the resources of the Henry
Papers for research on the history of St. Elizabeth’s Hospital. Char-
lene Matthews carried out research for Arnold Thackray of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania on Americans at the British Association for
the Advancement of Science. These and other scholars availed them-
selves of the more than 47,000 documents now entered in the
project’s computer catalogue.

Museum of African Art

On August 13, 1979, the Museum of African Art, established as a
private museum in 1964 at the initiative of former American Foreign
Service Officer Warren Robbins, officially became a bureau of the
Smithsonian Institution. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey served as the
first chairman of the museum’s Board of Trustees, and continued to
be one of its strongest supporters until his death in 1978. Following
some four years of discussions, consideration by the Board of Re-
gents of reports and analyses of the museum’s resources, preparation
of congressional legislation, and negotiation of the terms of the
merger, authorizing legislation prepared by the late senator was in-
troduced on his behalf by Senator Wendell Anderson and thirty-two
cosponsors in February 1978 and, with the support of Senator
Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Rules Committee, passed by unani-
mous consent of the Senate on May 16, 1978. Similar legislation,
introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman
Lindy Boggs, with Majority Whip John Brademas and all of the
members of the Black Caucus among its ninety cosponsors, and
with the guidance of Committee Chairmen Lucien Nedzi and
Frank Thompson, passed by an overwhelming majority and was
signed by President Carter on October 5.

In keeping with the terms of the legislation and subsequent agree-
ments, the museum turned over to the Smithsonian its collections of
some 8,000 objects of African sculpture, artifacts, craftworks, tradi-
tional costumes, textiles, drums, musical instruments, and jewelry;
its archives of approximately 100,000 slides, photos, and film seg-

History and Art / 191
ments on African art, culture, and environment, bequeathed to the
museum by Eliot Elisofon, the late world-renowned photographer for
Life magazine; a specialized library of 6,000 titles on African culture
and history, to which were added several thousand titles from the
library of the late cultural anthropologist and pioneer American
Africanist Professor Melville Herskovits, for whom the library has
been named; a significant collection of early maps of Africa; and a
variety of other art and educational materials that reflect and en-
hance public appreciation of the African dimension of the American
heritage.

The museum is situated in a row of nine contiguous Capitol Hill
townhouses in the 300 block of “A” Street, Northeast, just behind
the Supreme Court, including the historic Victorian “bookend
houses” that served as the first residence in Washington (1871-77)
of the great nineteenth-century abolitionist orator and publisher
Frederick Douglass. To the Douglass buildings a new wing was
added and opened in 1971, through the munificence of Mr. and Mrs.
David Lloyd Kreeger and other benefactors. Mews properties of two
carriage houses and eighteen garages are also owned by the museum.
With twelve public galleries located in the Douglass building proper,
the other houses accommodate the Elisofon Archives and the Her-
skovits Library, which, together with classrooms, comprise the mu-
seum’s Department of Higher Education; a community workshop
center; a graphics studio; the Programming and Education Depart-
ment; administrative offices; and Boutique Africa, the museum’s
highly acclaimed gift shop, which also serves as a showcase for con-
temporary African crafts.

At the time of the merger, the museum, which has mounted some
fifty exhibitions in its fifteen years of existence, was showing “The
Sculptor’s Eye,” several hundred works from the collection of the
American sculptor Chaim Gross, one of the most important early
collectors of African art in the United States; “Traditional Art from
Upper Volta,” an exhibition of 150 works on loan from private col-
lectors or selected from the museum’s permanent collection; a display
of textiles from Upper Volta and Ghana; and permanent educational
displays, including “African Influences in Modern Art,” “2,000 Years
of Nigerian Art,” “Africa and Egypt,” “Animals in African Art,”
“Drums and Musical Instruments of Africa,” and “Memorabilia of
the Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.” Supplementing the mu-

192 / Smithsonian Year 1979
seum’s exhibitions at all times are the award-winning audio-visual
presentation “Tribute to Africa—The Photography of Eliot Eliso-
fon”; other topical slide shows; and numerous color panels and
black-and-white photo murals of Africa by Elisofon.

During the past year, the Curatorial Department has also been pre-
paring the exhibitions “The Useful Arts of Kenya” and “New Acqui-
sitions,” featuring the Samuel Rubin bequest and selections from the
Herskovits collection on permanent loan to the museum.

With the expansion of the museum’s inner court from the area im-
mediately behind the Frederick Douglass buildings to the consoli-
dated garden areas of the other seven townhouses, the museum’s
permanent outdoor exhibit on the spectacular geometric color murals
of the N’Debele people of southeastern Africa was greatly enlarged.
