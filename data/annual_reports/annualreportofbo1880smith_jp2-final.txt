REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD.

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1880.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith a report of the
condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year 1880.

As heretofore, in addition to matters pertaining strictly to the Smith-
sonian Institution, I shall give an account of the operations connected
with the National Museum, placed by Congress in charge of the Smith-
sonian Institution, as well as of those of the United States Fish Com-
mission, of which the present Secretary is the chief officer.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

In the report for 1879 the announcement was made of an appropria-
tion by Congress for the purpose of constructing a new building for the
service of the National Museum, and of the commencement and rapid
progress of the work upon the same. I now have the pleasure of stat-
ing that the work has been in the greater part completed during the
year 1880, and that a portion of the building is already occupied for its
legitimate objects.

The details of progress and completion will be given in full in the
report of the building committee and of the architect, to which I would
refer. It will be sufficient to say here that the work has all been done
within the estimates, and that it promises to be even more suitable to
its purpose than was anticipated. All the requirements in regard to
light and heat are fully met ; and in this respect, and in that of its slight
cost in proportion to the space obtained, the building iS believed to have
no parallel in the country. Including the building proper, the steam
heating apparatus, the gas and water fixtures, and all their accessories,
the cost has amounted to less than $3 per square foot of ground floor,
and to about 6 cents per cubic foot of entire capacity.

Another noteworthy event of the year has been the election of Mr.
James A. Garfield, one of the Regents of the Institution, to the office of
President of the United States.

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
MEMORIALS.

Statue of Professor Hexry.—The annual meeting of the Board of Re-
gents was held on the 17th of January, at which time the usual reports
of the year 1879 were presented. Prior to that date a bill had been
introduced into the Senate by Mr. Booth, a Regent of the Institution,
providing for the erection in the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution
of a statue of Professor Henry. This, in a somewhat modified form,
passed the Senate and House and became a law by the signature of the
President on the 1st of June, 1880.*

The total appropriation was $15,000, and it was agreed that one-fourth
should be paid on the completion of the design, one-fourth on the com-
pletion of the model in clay, one-fourth on the completion in bronze,
and the remainder on the placing of the statue in the Smithsonian
grounds.

Memorial representations of Professor Henry.—The Institution is in-
debted to Mr. I’. Gutekunst, of Philadelphia, for copies of an excellent
phototype of the late Secretary, Professor Henry, copied from a photo-
graph taken by the same artist during the time of the Centennial Exhibi-
tion. The portrait is a mechanical imprint of cabinet size, a close re-
production of the original photograph.

Although a partial account of various portraitures of Professor Henry
was given in the last annual report, it may not be improper, with the
view of making the record more complete, to repeat those formerly men-
tioned, as well as to indicate additional likenesses.

Of original photographs, there are one small front face (carte size) by
H. Ulke; one profile head (carte size) by T. W. Smillie; one small size,
fallieneens standing, by the same; one jront view of hea and bust, cabi-
net size, by the same, and one, imperial size, by the same; one, carte
size, and four different views, cabinet size, by M. B. Brady, of Wash-

*TIn view of the adjournment of the Board of Regents at the time of the passage of
the law, it was impossible to take any formal action in the matter: but in the exer-
cise of its general discretion, the executive committee entered into correspondence with
Mr. Story, the artist designated in the act as the seulptor, and obtained from him his
acceptance ofthe trust, and some suggestions as to the design and the general condi-
tions of carrying it out.

As the executive committee was doubtful as to its authority to carry out fully the
wovisions of the proposed agreement with Mr. Story, the members of the Board were
communicated with by letter and their assent obtained to such action as the com-
mittee might deem best in the premises.

It was therefore thought best to make a provisional ratification of the agreement
with Mr. Story, the session of Congress in the beginning of December rendering it
pessible to obtain the action of the Board before anything could be done by the sculp-
tor. A meeting of the Board therefore, was held on the 8th day of December, 1880,
and the action of the exce utive committee was approved and authority given to carry
jt into effect. A dispatch was sent by Atlantic cable to Mr. Story, and the work, ac-
cording to a recent communication from Hon. George P. Marsh, United States minis-
er at Rome, Mr. Story’s place of residence, is progressing satisfactorily.

ington; two, cabinet size, by A. Gardner, of Washington; three, cab-
inet size, by S. M. Fassett, of Washington; and one of cabinet size and
one of imperial size, both by F. Gutekunst, of Philadelphia.

Of crayon heads of life size, there are one by H. Ulke, from an oil
pertrait by the same; one by Mrs. Fassett, from a portrait by S. M. Fas-
sett; one by Mrs. MeG. Dayton, from a photograph by Fassett; one by
R. Reichmann, from a photograph by T. W. Smillie; and one by A. J.
Janvier, from a photograph by M. B. Brady.

Of wood-cuts, one was published in an “Account of the Smithsonian
Institution,” by W. J. Rhees, Washington, 1855; and one in Harper’s
Weekly of June 1, 1878, accompanying an obituary notice.

Of engravings on steel, one was produced by L. L. Punderson, from
a painting by Mooney, and published at Boston in the Annual of Sci-
entific Discovery for 1852; one was engraved by G. R. Hall, from a
photograph, and published at New York in the Helectic Magazine for
March, 1875; one was engraved by 8S. Hollyer, from’ a photograph, and
published at New York, in Appleton’s Annual Cyclopedia for 1879;
and one of small size, vignette, was engraved by the Bureau of En-
graving and Printing of the Treasury Department, at Washington, 1880,
for publication in the Memorial volume ordered by Congress.

Of oil paintings, of bust or half-length life size, one was painted by H.
Ulke, of Washington; one was painted by W. Ingalls; one by Thomas
Le Clear, of New York; and one by Theodore Kaufmann, of Washington.

Of busts in plaster, one of small size was modeled by C. W. Burton, of
Washington; one of life size by Clarke Mills, of Washington; one of
life size by Fisk Mills, of Washington; and one of life size by Mrs.
©. S. Brooks, of New York.

In the last report it was stated that Congress had authorized the
printing in one volume of the memorial services held in honor of Pro-
fessor Henry in the House of Representatives on the 16th of January,
1879. Of this volume a large edition was ordered; and after various
delays, beyond the control of the Institution, it will secon appear in a well-
printed form, accompanied by an excelleht portrait engraved by the
Treasury Department. There has been a great demand for this work
from all quarters of the country, and copies of it will be placed in all
the principal libraries at home and abroad.

Smithsonw’s Effects.—By the 6th section of the organizing act of Con-
gress of August, 1846, it was provided that “the minerals, books, mann-
seripts, and other property of James Smithson, which have been received
by the Government of the United States, and are now placed in the
Department of State, shall be removed to said Institution, and shall be
preserved separate and apart from other property of the Institution.”

The books belonging to the founder of the Institution have been cata-
logued and placed in a handsome walnut case with plate-glass front.
They consist of 45 duodecimo, 110 octavo, and 26 quarto volumes, many
of them in a worn, and a few ina dilapidated condit on. It has been
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

thought proper, however, to leave them exactly as they were when form-
ing the library of Mr. Smithson.

Such of the relics of Smithson and his family as have come into pos-
session of the Institution have also been appropriately arranged in frames
and placed on exibition in the Regents’ room. They consist of the follow-
ing articles: Pe

1. An oil portrait of Smithson as an Oxford student.

2. An oil portrait in miniature of Smithson, painted by Johns, at Aix-
la-Chapelle, in 1816.

3. An oil portrait in miniature of Col. Henry Louis Dickinson, a half-
brother of James Smithson.

. The dinner invitation card of Smithson.

. His visiting card, used in Paris.

. A copy of his will in his own handwriting.

. A manuscript in his handwriting.

. A commission from George III to Major Henry Louis Dickinson,
as Lieutenant-Colonel, dated 1st Jan., 1800.

9. A commission from the same King to Lient.-Colonel H. L. Dickin-
son, as Colonel of the 84th Regt., dated 4th Aug., 1808.

Smithson’s Tomb.—Itis, of course, eminently proper thatthe Smithsonian
Institution should do all in its power to preserve the remembrance of its
great founder, Mr. James Smithson; and an endeavor toward this end has
been made by the publication of a Life of Smithson and a reprint of all
his works. In the efforts to obtain a memorial of some kind of the last
resting place of Mr. Smithson, at Genoa, in Italy, a photograph of the
tomb was obtained from Mr. Hazelton, the United States consul in.
that city, with a statement of its present condition. In accordance
with a suggestion from him he was authorized to put the monument
in thorough repair and to arrange to have it kept in good condition at
the expense of the Institution. The monument is an appropriate and
substantial one, and as long as the Institution is in existence this
reminder of its founder should be carefully protected.

INAUGURAL RECEPTION.
teference should be made to the granting of the use of the new Museum
building for the purpose of holding the inaugural reception in honor of
the newly-elected President. A petition to that effect, from a committee
of citizens of Washington, was presented at a meeting of the Board on
the 8th of December, and the following resolution, granting the request,
was passed :

‘Whereas the new Museum building is unfinished and not ready for

occupancy of the government collections, and whereas such a contin-

gency will not again occur, and no precedent is to be given for the use
of the building for other purposes:

“fesolved, That the use of the new National Museum building be
granted for the inaugural reception of the President of the United
States, on the 4th of March, 1881, and that the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution be authorized to make all necessary arrangements
for this purpose.”

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Subsequently application was made to the Institution by several
other committees for the use of the building after the inaugural recep-
tion on the 4th of March. These were all refused, although the objects
in view were praiseworthy in themselves.

FINANCES.

General Condition.—lIt is believed that the finances of the Institution
have never been in amore favorable condition than they are at the pres-
ent time.*

As the income of the Smithson fund is a definite one and can be
calculated upon alinost to a cent, year by year, it is, of course, practicable
to estimate the expenditures with much precision. Nothing but some
calamity, such as the destruction or serious injury of the building, is
likely to involve an outlay that would seriously interfere with the general
programme for the year. ;

Under the general limitations of the appropriations made by the
Board of Regents, for the different classes of expenditure, it is, of course,
a matter of proper business management to incur no liabilities for the
year beyond those that the fund is able to meet; and a strict adher-
ence to this rule has prevented any embarrassment in regard to pay-
ments. There has been no indebtedness at the end of the year except
that for some incomplete publications, and for which the necessary pro-
vision had been made.

Reference has been made in this report to several bequests, by which
the principal of the fund has been increased, the first of these being
that of Mr. James Hamilton, of Carlisle, which, amounting to $1,000
was added to the principal of the Smithson fund in the United States
Treasury.

Hiabel Bequest—An account was given in the last report, of the
bequest of $402.59 to the Smithsonian Institution by Dr. S. Habel, of
New York. By authority of the executive committee, the sum of
$97.41 was appropriated from the annual income of the Institution and
added to the above in order to make up the amount of $500. This
was then deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the
Smithsonian endowment, under the provisions of law.

The Habel bequest thus slightly enlarged and added to the Hamilton
fund of $1,000, making the sum of $1,500, will yield annually at 6 per
cent. an income of $90. It is proposed to devote this special income to
the prosecution of ethnological and archzxological research.

The funds of the Institution now in the treasury, according to the
report of the executive committee, amount, with these two bequests, to

*The endowment (referred to elsewhere) is for the most part in the U. S. Treasury,
where the principal can never be touched, and it yields an annual interest of six per
cent. A small portion is invested in Virginia State securities.
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

$651,500, leaving a balance of $348,500 necessary to make up the million
dollars authorized by Congress as its perpetual endowment. It is very
much to be hoped that some of our wealthy men may feel inclined to
contribute a part or even the whole of this sum, as it is believed that
no more desirable contribution to science and education could be devised.
The machinery of the Institution is extensive enough to administer a
much larger amount than it at present possesses, so that no part of such
contribution would be required for salaries, rent, or other attendant
expenses. It may safely be said that the addition of one-half to the
present fund would at least double the efficiency of the Institution in
carrying out its mission of the “increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.”

Relation to the National Museum.—It is, of course, fully understood
that while the Smithsonian Institution is supported and administered
at the expense of the Smithson endowment, the cost of carrying on the
National Museum is necessarily defrayed entirely by Congressional
appropriations. Although the estimates presented by the Institution
from time to time as desirable for the prosecution of the work have
sometimes been reduced by the Congressional committees, there is no
reason to complain of the feeling of Congress toward this interest, and it
is confidently believed that as the plans in regard to the reorganization
of the Museum in the new building are carried out a cordial support
will be extended in the future. The appropriations required for the
maintenance of an establishment five times as great as the present one
must necessarily be largely increased, although not in proportion to its
expansion. It is evident that to supply a building covering two anda
half acres of ground with cases willrequire a large expenditure of money
until they are completed. It is estimated that the cases needed will
in a continuous line extend a mile and a half; and of course several
years will be required for their proper construction. After this the cost
of the Museum will be essentially that of maintenance only, and be
reduced much below the figures for the fiscal year of 1881.

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building.—The disastrous fire which destroyed a large
portion of the roof and upper story of the Patent Office building in the
summer of 1877, gave rise to the formation of a commission of govern-
ment officers, consisting of Col. Thomas L. Casey, Mr. I. Clark, and Mr.
J. G. Hill, to inspect all buildings of the government in the city, and to
report what measures might be necessary to better secure them and
their contents from injury by fire. The Smithsonian building was one
of those carefully examined by the commission, and it was recommended
that iron doors should be placed in the passage ways between certain
rooms. An appropriation of $3,000 was subsequently made by Con-
gress for this purpose; and a contract for its execution was accordingly
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

entered into with Mr. George L. Damon, of Boston. After considerable
delay in the performance of this contract, the doors were del.vered and
put in place by Mr. Damon, to the entire satisfaction of the executive
committee. This arrangement has greatly promoted the safety of the
building and its contents from the risk of the spreading of any fires which
might accidentally occur within its walls. A few additional changes
are still desirable to give still further security to the public property
placed in the charge of the Institution. :

For the purpose of facilitating the operations of the freight and trans-
portation department of the Institution, an ele ‘ator was constructed in
1879, by which packages could be carried from the southeastern entrance
of the building, either to the basement floor below, or to the document
room above. During 1880, the work has been completed by the erec-
tion of a very substantial platform outside of the door, on which boxes
can be conveniently delivered, or from which they can be shipped.
From the rapidly increasing ainount of transportation connected with
the natural history operations and the scientific exchanges, every facility
in the handling of packages, by economizing labor, becomes an item
of importance.

For many years a pump at the southeastern corner of the Smithsonian
building has furnished a supply of excellent water, estéemed throughout
the neighborhood. Although the introduction of the Potomac water
naturally reduced considerably the demand upon this pump it was still
constantly drawn upon by persens passing by, and was used for supply-
ing the water-coolers in the building. A chemical and microscopic ex-
amination of the water made during the summer showed that it was not
entirely wholesome, in consequcnce as was thought, of the rotting of the
inner wooden lining of the well. As a necessary step to the improve-
ment of the sanitary condition of the water the original lining was
replaced by one of brick. An iron pump was also substituted for the
former wooden one. These repairs have been satisfactorily completed,
and the water is now restored to its original quality.

The protection of the buildings in charge of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion and the preservation of the property contained therein require, of
course, the vigilance of competent watchmen, both day and night.
One of these, Mr. T. S. Nelligar, a night watchman in the new
musetumn building, has been made a special policeman by the Board of
police.

The situation of the Smithsonian building, so far to the south of the
principal avenues of travel in Washington, renders it somewhat incon-
venient of access, especially during inclement weather. At present
the nearest street railways are those along Seventh street and along
Twelfth street. The completion of the new building for the ac-
commodation of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the
Treasury Department, on South B street (at the corner of Four-
teenth street), as also of the new National Museum building, on
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the same street (near Ninth street), occasioning a large increase of travel
in that direction, induced the proprietors of the so-called “ Belt Line”
of railway to memorialize Congress for permission to change the track of
their road by extending it down Fourteenth street to South B street,
thence along South B street past the entrance to the National Museum,
and thence south along Ninth street to Maryland avenue, along which
it now passes. Congress has not yet taken any action on this memorial.
Should that body authorize the proposed change of route it will add
greatly to the convenience of all who are interested in that line of travel.

Armory Building.—The Armory building is still in use as the deposi-
tory of the Centennial and other collections belonging to the govern-
ment. These articles will be removed to the new Museum during the
present year, but as there is no provision in this building for storage of
boxes, packing matcrials, &c., a part of the Armory will always be re-
quired for this purpose. It is also contemplated to use one of the halls
or stories of the Armory for the storage ef the large amount of property
belonging to the United States Fish Commission, and the lower flcor
may perhaps be occupied by aquaria, hatching apparatus, &e.

Laboratory of Natural History.—The building erected as a laboratory
of natural history and a photographie atelier in which to prepare speei-
mens, illustrations, W&e., for the Centennial Exhibition is still devoted to
similar uses. A large number of photographs of fish, ethnologica, &e.,
have been made during the year by the artist of the Institution, Mr.

“T. W. Smillie.

Mr. Joseph Palmer and his son have continued in this building the
preparation of plaster casts of fish, reptiles, and antiquities, and in
another apartment these have been colored by the artist, Mr. A. Z.
Shindler, the reproductions thus furnished being admirable fac-similes
of the living or original objects, and attracting general commendation.

Another large room occupied by Mr. Henry Marshall, the taxidermist,
has mainly been devoted to the mounting of birds and mammals.

In the new Museum building very commodious apartments have been
assigned to the photographer and other artists, a large and well arranged
sky-light has been provided, and everything will be done by the
Institution to secure the best possible results with all the apparatus
and appliances obtainable. To obtain ample working rooms in case
of an emergency, however, the tanks, dark-room, sky-light, &c., in the
old building will be left undisturbed so that if necessary an extra force
of photographers may be enabled to earry on their work.

ROUTINE WORK OF THE INSTITUTION.

Administration.—No change has been made in the officers and assist-
ants of the Institution since the death of the late Secretary. Mr. Wil-
liam J. Rhees, who has been chief clerk since June, 1853, still discharges
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. g

the duties of executive officer with zeal, industry, and efficiency. Dur-
ing the absence of the Secretary for several months in the year, when
on duty connected with the United States Fish Commission, Mr. Rhees
has been intrusted with the general administration of the business of
the Institution; having also the charge of publications, of financial de-
tails, of the purchase of supplies, and of the supervision of clerks and
employés, &c. The operations connected with the erection of the new
Museum building have added greatly to the labors and responsibilities
of the chief clerk, as weli as of the other officers of the Institution.

The correspondence is in charge of Mr. Daniel Leech, who has been
in the Institution since 1867, and who has also acted as the secretary
of the National Museum Building Commission. In both these relations
his duties have been satisfactorily and creditably performed.

The division of accounts has been in charge of Mr. Clarence B. Young,
who entered the service of the Institution in 1870. To his duties as
bookkeeper is added that of the charge of the physical apparatus, the re-
vision of proof, mathematical calculations, and other work requiring
skill as a computer, and knowledge of physics and technology:

To Mr. Wm. B. Taylor has been assigned the duty of preparing re-
plies to correspondents involving scientific details in special depart-
ments; and he has also edited—under the direction of the special com-
mittee of the Board of Regents—the ‘ Memorial Volume” in honor of
Professor Henry.

The management of the literary and scientific exchanges has been
intrusted to Messrs. H. Diebitsch and G. H. Boehmer. The labor in
this department has grown to large proportions, and is increasing with
every year.

The reception, entry, and transfer of books for the library are in
charge of Miss Jane A. Turner, whose faithful and intelligent services
have frequently been recognized by my predecessor.

The translation of French and German letters and various clerical
duties have been well performed by Mrs. L. Stoerzer, while the filing of
letters, indexing, making out receipts and orders for books, and various
other duties have been assigned to Miss M. E. Griffin, Miss H. de C.
Daingerfield, and Miss I’. R. Schaeffer, who deserve commendation for
their faithfui services.

It is also proper to mention the fidelity and efficiency in the subordi-
nate duties assigned them of Messrs. Henry Gass and John S. Pollock.
Mr. Solomon G. Brown, in charge of the transportation department,
has discharged his duties satisfactorily.

Correspondence.—A most important branch of Smithsonian opera-
tions is that of correspondence, which expands from year to year in the
direct ratio of the ever widening influence and increasing activity of
the establishment. The principal consideration, however, in this de-
partment, is not the amount but the continuity of the labor involved,
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

since the rules of the Institution, while they insure a respectful reply
to all communications demanding an answer, also require that each
day’s mail shall be attended to on the day of its receipt, excepting where
immediate action is impracticable. In other departments of the Insti-
tution, as, for instance, that of publications, operations being more or
less dependent upon outside agencies, there is sometimes a temporary
respite; but in the department of correspondence this is absolutely im-
possible.

As during the past three years, so during 1880, the number of com-
munications has been very great in regard to anthropology, natural
history, mineralogy, exchanges, employment, and publications. In re-
gard to the first of these the immediate cause has been the unprecedented
interest awakened in the subject of anthropology by the Smithsonian
circular to which attention was called in the report of the Secretary
for 1878.

As the near completion and occupation of the new building for the
National Museum has become generally known, hundreds of colleges,
as well as proprietors of private collections, aware that the Institution
has only awaited the room requisite for the collation of its vast stores
of specimens of natural history and the elimination of the duplicates
previous to the distribution of the latter, have hastened to apply
for a share in this material, the applications in almost every instance
necessitating answer by reason of inquiries for information upon points
not covered by any of the many printed circulars of the Institution.

In mineralogy the number of applicants for information has largely
increased during the past year. Supposed discoveries of mineral wealth
still continue to be reported to the Institution, and specimens are for-
warded for examination. Qualitative determinations only, however, are
made gratuitously for individuals or for private or commercial purposes;
but these generally suffice. In making known the results of mineral
examinations the mineralogist presents his reports to the Secretary, on
blanks prepared for the purpose. If approved the substance of his re-
port is communicated by letter to the party submitting the specimens.

The increased activity in the department of exchanges has not only
continued, but this source of correspondence has during the past year
proved far more productive of communications than was anticipated;
and while the increase in the number of these has been marked, in very
many instances their nature has been such as to call for a general review
of the entire subject of exchanges, thus giving to the replies, on the part
of the Institution, the character more of memoirs than of letters. This
feature of a large part of the exchange correspondence grew out of the
action of the Paris Geographical Congress of 1875, in recommending to
the nations of the world the establishment of a system for the inter-
change of the official documents of their respective governments, which
recommendation has recently been favorably acted upon by a number
of governments, including the United States, which has designated the
Smithsonian Institution as its agent in the premises.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ig)

With reference to applications for employment, it may be said that
while in no single year of its history could the Institution claim en-
tire exemption from the receipt of this class of communications, the
year 1880 marks an epoch in this respect as being the period in which
the maximum number has claimed attention. Indeed, it is far from an
exaggeration to say that written and oral applications of this kind
have averaged half a dozen a day. As a majority of those in writing
are in the nature of requests through members of Congress, or other
persons of prominence, a double answer frequently becomes necessary,
one to the applicant and a second to the party through whom the claim
is presented, the latter generally necessitating a detailed explanation
of the cause for the refusal.

Lastly, an important part of the correspondence consists in the con-
stantly increasing demands for the Smithsonian publications. With
the increase of popular education throughout the land, and the springing
up of new villages or towns, new public libraries and scientific societies
are started, and very soon an application is made to the Smithsonian
Institution for its publications. Applications of this kind are required
to be entered on printed forms, and forwarded through the member of
Congress representing the district in which the establishment is located,
the member thus becoming sponsor for the library or society, so far
as its existence and standing are concerned.

The requests from individuals for publications, however, are not in-
frequently difficult to deal with. In a country where all are equal it
is sometimes difficult to satisfactorily explain why each individual
cannot receive this or that publication gratis. It is often useless to
state that the publications of the Institution are issued at the expense
of its own fund, and not at that of the general government; that this
fund is so limited as to forbid the issuing of more than a comparatively
small number of copies; that with these both hemispheres must be
supplied; that they are distributed free of expense to public libraries
and colleges throughout the country on condition that they shall be
accessible at all times to any who may desire to consult them; that
to individuals, other than specialists and contributors of material for
the national collections, they are sold at about the cost of paper and
printing; or, that the desired memoir, or memoirs, will be cheerfully
furnished in return for desirable objects for the National Museum. It
might reasonably be supposed that a statement of this character would
prove satisfactory ; but, unfortunately, this has not been our experience,
such a result being the exception, not the rule, and shortly the demand
is renewed through the member of Congress from the district in which
the applicant resides.

ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY TELEGRAPH.

The existing arrangements for disseminating telegraphic announce-
ments of astronomical discoveries, particularly between America and
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Europe, were set forth in the last report. This Institution is the center
of diffusion throughout our own country, of astronomical announce-
ments received by telegraph from foreign countries, and in like manner
acts as the medium of communication of American discoveries through
Atlantic cables to the European observatories of Greenwich, Paris,
Berlin, Vienna, and Pulkova; from which points the information is
spread throughout their respective countries. Through the courtesy of
various telegraph companies, the information received from abroad is
transmitted to the principal observatories (some seventeen in number)
throughout the United States, and also to the “‘ Associated Press,” free of
charge. This generous concession to the urgent needs of astronomical
research and progress is so valuable a boon to science that it should
annually receive a grateful and public acknowledgment. The com-
panies to whose liberality we are thus indebted are: The Atlantic Cable
Company, The United States Cable Company, The Pacific Cable Com-
pany, The Western Union Telegraph Company. To these must be
added the Northwestern Telegraph Company, which gives gratuitous
transmission of astronomical telegrams to Northfield, Minn.

Prof. B. A. Gould, the eminent superintendent of the observatory of Cor-
doba, of the Argentine Republic, when making a visit lately to the United
States on his way to Europe, had some conference with several leading
astronomers respecting certain proposed improvements in the exchange
of telegrams, and of the character of the abbreviations to be employed.
These suggestions, presented to the Institution, were by it embodied in

a circular, which was referred to the directors of the different observa- —

tories scattered over our country soliciting their opinion as to the
desirability of the changes proposed. Dr. C. H. IF. Peters, of the
observatory at Clinton, N. Y., to whom the original suggestion of tele-
graphic announcement is mainly due, was particularly desired to give
the subject his consideration. When the various responses to these cir-
culars of inquiry are received, it is intended to have them carefully con-
sidered by a commission of astronomers, and the formulas which appear
to meet the general approval wili be finally adopted as the uniform and
permanent method of designation.

The announcements of astronomical discoveries made during the past
year are as follows:

An arrangement in regard to the exchange of telegrams of astro-
nomical discoveries was proposed by Lord Lindsay in connection with
the working of his private observatory of Dun Echt, in Scotland, and
the Institution was invited to exchange therewith telegraphic commu-
nications in regard to the discovery of comets and asteroids. After
further conference with the director in charge of the observatory of
Greenwich it was concluded that dispatches sent to the latter would
answer all the purposes by simply providing for the prompt repetition
of these dispatches from Greenwich to Dun Echt.

EXCHANGES.

International Bxchanges.—The system of international exchanges which
has been successfully prosecuted for thirty years may be regarded as
having been inaugurated by this Institution. A method of exchange
had indeed been carried on for some years previously by Mr. Alexander
Vattemare, of Paris, France, but on essentially different principles. Mr.
Vattemare’s plan consisted in obtaining duplicate volumes and contri-
butions from booksellers, literary and scientific societies, public libraries,
and other sources, and then from the collected mass making to his
various contributors returns, at his own discretion, of what appeared to
him a fair equivalent. Such a method of course presupposed a great
familiarity with the actual possessions of the various bodies in corres-
pondence, as well as of their needs; and while undoubtedly beneficial in
some cases, was likely to be entirely unsuccessful in others.

The Smithsonian system consists substantially in offering to cor-
respondents a safe and gratuitous channel of intercommunication, each
being responsible to the other for the amount and character or value of
the packages interchanged, the Institution assuming, between them,
only the relation or function of carrier. It naturally happens, however,
not unfrequently, that the Institution is requested to designate suitable
parties to whom publications of a particular character should be sent.
Such a request is responded to, either by furnishing such lists of names
or societies as may be supposed to be desirable, or by undertaking the
actual assignment of such works as are submitted to its discretion, dur-
ing the process of making up its own packages.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Attention has frequently been called in previous reports to the steadily
increasing expense attending this system of international exchanges.
The cost of prosecuting various researches and investigations and the
general expenses of the Institution being provided for, the residue of
the income has usually been divided between the department of publica-
tions and that of international exchanges. So long as the latter interest
required the expenditure of but a few thousand dollars, a considerable
amount was available for the former, and the Institution was thus in a
condition to publish many important memoirs; but of late years the
cost of maintaining the exchange system has increased at so rapid a
rate (the expense for 1879 and 1880 having reached nearly $10,000 each
year) that only an inadequate and continually decreasing balance is
available for the very important department of publication of original
contributions to knowledge.

The official designation of the Smithsonian Institution by the State
Department, as the American agent of international exchange has
naturally, with the rapid extension of its operations, also added con-
siderably to the burden of expense.

In view of these circumstances, a communication was addressed to
the honorable Secretary of State, some months ago, by the Secretary of
the Institution, asking that an application be made to Congress for a
special appropriation toward defraying the expenses of international
exchanges, to be disbursed under the direction of the State Department.
This favor has been promised, and it is hoped that the desired relief
will be granted.

As a result of the convention already referred to as held in Paris a
few years ago, for promoting international exchanges between the vari-
ous governments of the world, the interest and exertions in this direc-
tion are slowly extending. In addition to the commissions and bureaus
of Belgium, France, Holland, and the Confeder: cy of Switzerland, men-
tioned in the last report as co-operating with the United States govern-
ment, the Government of Brazil has since been included in the move-
ment, and arrangements between it and the Institution have been sat-
isfactorily adopted. A disposition to co-operate in this work has also
been expressed by the Governments of Russia and of Italy, but no defi-
nite arrangements have as yet been concluded by them.

The interchange of scientific publications between the United States
and Cuba has for a number of years been effected through the agency
of Prof. Felipe Poey, of the University of Havana; and to that emi-
nent naturalist, for both the extent and the efficiency of his labors,
this Institution is greatly indebted. As the packages transmitted have
been addressed to Professor Poey, questions have constantly arisen as to
the duties charged to the Institution, in addition to the other cost of the
enterprise. As it was thought unjust that the Smithsonian fund should
be taxed with the entire expenses of this interchange, in both directions,
while the main benefits of the transactions were experienced by Cuba,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

the subject was referred to his excellency Senor Don Felipe Mendez de
Vigo, minister from Spain; through whose courteous efforts, a very sat-
isfactory arrangement has been effected, whereby the governor-general
of Cuba, in his official capacity, takes charge of our packages and de-
livers them to the University of Havana for distribution to their re-
spective addresses. This arrangement constitutes in effect an additional
link in the chain of international government agencies already referred to.

The total number of establishments outside of the United States with
which correspondence and exchange have been conducted amounts to
2,602—an increase of about 129 over the list of 1879. The number of
packages received from Europe for distribution in the United States
during the past year amounted to 6,670; the number of packages from
the United States received for transmission abroad has amounted to
14,175; making an aggregate of 20,845 packages.

The parcels received from Europe for distribution in America are gen-
erally forwarded to their respective destinations in smaller bundles, or
in paper wrappers. The parcels received for transmission to foreign
countries are carefully packed in boxes. Of these, there were shipped
during the past year 268; occupying a bulk of 1,976 cubic feet, and
weighing 60,300 pounds. :

As heretofore, the Institution is greatly indebted to the lines of ocean
steamers between the United States and other countries of the world ;
and grateful acknowledgment is due particularly to the agents of the
following companies for the continuation of their important favors in
the free transmission of Smithsonian packages: Anchor Steamship Com-
pany, Atlas Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,
Cunard Steamship Company, Hamburg American Packet Company,
Inman Steamship Company, Merchants’ Line of Steamers, Netherlands
American Steam Navigation Company, New York and Brazil Steamship
Company, New York and Mexico Steamship Company, North German
Lloyds Steamship Company, Pacitic Mail Steamship Company, Pacifie
Steam Navigation Company, Panama Railroad Company, Steamship
Lines for Brazil, Texas, Florida, and Nassau, N. P., White Cross Line
of Antwerp.

The railroad companies connecting Washington and Baltimore and
New York have also continued their favor of special rates of charges for
freight. These are the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, and the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad.

Acknowledgments are also due to the foreign ministers and consuls
of the various governments, for their assistance in taking charge of the
packages intended for the countries which they respectively represeut,
and transmitting them with care to their destination. |

In connection with the establishment of definite relations between
this Institution and the French commission of international exchanges
(a branch of the department of the ministry of public instruction), the
French Transatlantic Steamship Company has, through its agent, M.

Government Document Exchange.—In addition to its general function of
intermediary between the institutions of the New World and the Old,
the Smithsonian Institution has been for some years the agent of the gov-
ernment for the exchange of public documents and other officia! publi-
cations, in the interest of the Library of Congress, and under the provi-
sions of law. By act of Congress, fifty copies of all publications of the
United States Government, whether ordered for the use of Congress or
of the departments, are available for distribution, under the direction
of the Joint Library Committee of the two Houses of Congress, to such
foreign governments as agree to make a corresponding return. These
returns, when received, are forwarded’ directly to the Library of Con-

DISTRIBUTION.

Distribution of Publications.—One of the operations of the Institution
requiring constant attention and involving much labor and expense is
that of distribution of publications. Aside from the sending of books
and parcels through the great international exchange system there is a
constant demand upon the institution for works it has published or those
of a scientific character supposed to be at its disposal. These demands
have become sonumerous and are made by so many persons unknown to
the officers, while the supply ot books is so limited, that it became neces-
sary to adopt a new rule in reference to distribution. Hach applicant
jS now required to furnish evidence that he has contributed in some
way to the library, museum, or collections of the Institution, and an ex-
change is thus established, intended to supersede the former promiscu-
ous method of bestowing a gift. It may be mentioned that latterly no
jists have been kept of persons entitled to receive from year to year the
publications or even the reports of the Institution. It is necessary that
direct application be made by each person for any work desired.

Distribution of Specimens.—In view of the immense mass of material
received at the National Museum from the various government expedi-
tions and the geological survey, as well as from the contributions of cor-
respondents, it will be readily understood that the duplicates have ac-
cumulated very rapidly for many years and that the proper disposal of
this surplus has oceupied the attention of the Smithsonian Institution.

Under the organic law the Institution is authorized to increase the
collections of the National Museum by the exchange of duplicate speci-

mens ; but only a small amount is conveniently disposed of in this man-
ner, and by far the greater proportion is issued without any expecta-
tion or desire forareturn. The table appended to this Report will show
what has been done up to date, as the distributions of the year 1880.

The distributions indicated have represented a fair average for the
year 1880. It is expected that in the year 1881, the amount will be
vastly increased by the disposal of the Centennial collections, which
have been so long stored in the Armory building, and which it is ex-
pected will soon be transferred to the new Museum building, just com-
pleted. These objects will be principally those relating to the mineral
kingdom, the ores and building stones being in the largest proportion.
Applications for collections from establishments not well known, are
usually referred to the member of Congress in the district in which the
applicant belongs, and an expression of opinion is invited as to the char-
acter and standing of the same.

Asa general rule, no specimens are sent away without being authori-
tatively and accurately labeled by an expert, so that they become stand-
ards of reference.

LIBRARY.

The additions to the library of the Institution through its system of
scientific exchanges, continue to be very large. During the past year,
the books, pamphlets, and charts received, have amounted to 8,570
pieces; a portion of which consists of parts or continuations of volumes,
such as the current proceedings and transactions of learned societies,
and the accessions to established scientific journals. Making due allow-
ance for such fragmentary continuations, the whole number of complete
volumes may be estimated at 6,000 titles; of which by far the greater
portion has been as usual transferred to the custody of the Library of
Congress, where they constitute an important section of the great
national collection.

In this statement is not included the large number of volumes received
under the arrangement for international government exchanges, and
sent directly to the Library of Congress without being opened or eata-
logued at the Institution. hs

The Institution has received from Mr. John T. Fisk, president of the
American Industrial Deputation, at Puebla, Mexico, through his excel-
lency the Mexican minister, a very handsomely bound volume of small
size, of Prayers and Devotions, in the Spanish language. The binding
of this book is quite unique, the sides and back being covered with
highly polished plates of Mexican onyx, cemented upon a purple silk
cover, which is exposed only in the groove forming the flexible joint be-
tween the sides and the back. The front plate (four and a half inches
long, by two and seven-eighths inches wide, and probably about three-
sixteenths of an inch at its middle, gently rounding and thinning toward
its edges) is of a delicate mottled pink color, and is embellished with orna-
mental engraving filled in gilt. The corresponding plate forming the
opposite cover is, of course, of exactly the same size; but it is of a deli-
cate mottled green color: its ornamentation is similar to that of the front
side, though of a different design. The back of this curious volume is
entirely covered with a finely polished piece of delicately mottled blue
Mexican onyx, without ornament, nearly one inch in width, which has
been laboriously and skillfully hollowed ont to conform to the rounded
back of the volume. On the front fly-leaf of the book the following in-
scription is written: “The Very Rev. Monsignor Eulagio G. Gillou, do-
mestic prelate of the Pope, to the American Industrial Deputation, on
its visit to this city, presents this small token of the mineral produce
and industry of the State: it contains, besides, specimens of Mexican
poetry; with the request that it be placed by its distinguished president,
Mr. John Theo. Fisk, in some public institution of the United States
for the inspection of its citizens and artisans.”

The Institution has also received, through the honorable Secretary of
State (by official letter of the department dated December 3, 839),
from the international exhibition commission of Sydney (N. 8. W.),
Australia (under cover of a letter dated November 8, 1580, from R. W.
Cameron, esq., one of the United States commissioners to said exhibi-
tion), a specimen bronze medal of award of the said Sydney international
exhibition of 1879. This medal, three inches in diameter and a quarter
of an inch thick at its outer rim, presents a very fine specimen of die-
sinking. On its obverse side, within a border bearing the legend of the
exhibition, is represented in bold relief a female figure, standing, sur-
rounded by emblems of the arts, supporting with her left hand a shield
bearing the arms of the province, and extending with her right hand
the victor’s laurel wreath, while in the rear is shown in low reliet the
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

exhibition building. On its reverse side an elaborate floral wreath com-
prising native products forms the embellishment.

By the transfer to the Library of Congress of the greater portion of
the books belonging to the Smithsonian Institution, effected shortly
after the disastrous fire of 1865, the former library room was rendered
available for other uses. This occupation for other more pressing re-
quirements and purposes, necessarily prevented its further employment
as a reading room. In view of the increasing number of employés con-
nected with either the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum,
or the United States Fish Commission and Fishery Census Division, it
was thought proper to make some provision by which some of the more
interesting domestic and foreign periodicals received might be ren-
dered easily accessible to them. Accordingly the corridor of the east
range of the building has been fitted up as a reading room by the erec-
tion of reading desks on which are placed the successive numbers of
certain serials as they come to hand. These, of course, comprise but a
very small portion of the journals received by the Institution; a full
list of which is given in the appendix.

RESEARCHES.

An arrangement was made by the Institution a number of years ago for
the compilation of a series of tables of ascertained altitudes in the United
States, to be collected from data derived from State and county surveys,
and from miscellaneous surveys made in the construction of railroads,
wagon roads, &c.; the ultimate object being the preparation of a topo-
graphie relief model of the country. This work was put in charge of
Mr. Walter L. Nicholson, and a considerable amount of work was ac-
complished towards the end in view. Mr. Nicholson having, however,
been appointed topographer of the Post-Office Department, the con-
stant occupation of his time in the duties of his position interfered
with the prosecution of this work, so that he was unable to complete his
report, and for some years nothing further has been accomplished. The
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey having had committed to it
by act of Congress the charge of conducting a system of triangulations
to connect the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, has requested the use of this
material collected by the Institution with reference to elevations ; but
its transfer to that establishment has not yet been determined on.

A subject which has of late years attracted considerable attention
from physiologists and others is the peculiar affection of vision known
as color-blindness.* This defect of chromatic sensibility exists in various
degrees, and to a much larger extent than is generally supposed ; and as
it does not appear to be usually accompanied with other optical imper-
fection of the eyes, many of its subjects are even unconscious of their
deficiency in this respect. Inasmuch as danger signals used at sea, upon

*This abnormal condition of sight is by many French writers characterized (not
very appropriately) as ‘‘ Daltonism.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. m1

coasts, on railroads, at draw- bridges, and elsewhere, are usually character-
ized by special colors, it obviously becomes a matter of the greatest mo-
ment to public safety that those immediately in charge of such signals,
or appointed to observe them, should be known to be entirely free from
any imperfection or disqualification in this direction. The subject has
accordingly with justice assumed a character of great practical impor-
tance. In the Smithsonian Report for 1877 the Institution published
the translation of a paper by Prof. F. Holmgren, of Stockholm, in which
the vital consequence of this subject in many of the vocations of life,
and especially those connected with traveling and communication by
sea and by land, were strongly pointed out; and to this memoir is un-
doubtedly due in large degree the present appreciation of the subject.

An edition of this work had been contemplated by Prof. B. Jay Jeffries,
of Boston, who has himself conducted a very extended series of independ-
ent researches in the same direction.*

LABORATORY WORK.

A large part of the time of the chemist of the Institution is occupied
in determining the character of minerals sent to the Institution, with the
request for information. Under arule of the Institution, of which a copy
is herewith submitted, the examination of minerals for private parties
and private interests is confined to a simple qualitative examination, or, in
other words, an indication of the more important elements contained
therein. It is a comparatively easy matter to ascertain whether a cer-
tain specimen contains gold, silver, lead, or other metal, and examina-
tions of this kind are made daily. In all cases, however, where an act-
ual chemical analysis or assay is required, it is only done at the request
or in behalf of some branch of the government, or for. some other public
purpose ; in all other cases the applicant is referred to professional chem-
ists for the investigation. It will, of course, be readily understood that
if the Institution once establishes the precedent of making such assays
and analyses, it would soon require the services of dozens of chemists,
thus involving expense for which no adequate provision could be made,
and interfering with the business of those who depend upon such work
for a subsistence.

In the report of the chemist, which is submitted in the Appendix, will
be found a statement of the general character of the chemical work con-
ducted during the year, among which have been quite a number of in-

vestigations made for the government. Perhaps the most important of
these was the inquiry into the so-called Tichenor process of reducing
ores of gold by the use of one of the chlorides of gold. This investiga-
tion was made at the special request of the Commissioner of Patents,
and conducted at the expense of the Patent Office, and an elaborate re-
port transmitted to that officer. Very much public interest centered
around the analysis, as the disposition of a large amount of money in
the way of investment depended upon the decision.

In addition to the chemical work actually performed in behalf of the
government, the Institution is not unfrequently asked (especially by the
Treasury Department) to nominate chemical experts for special inquiries,
a request always promptly complied with.

In view of the large amount and variety of analytical investigations
continually required by the government for the faithful and intelli-
gent administration of several of its bureaus or departments, it is much
to be desired that a first-class laboratory, under efficient direction,
be established in official connection with some branch of the gov-
ernment, where all chemical work of a public character or value can
be thoroughly executed. Questions of grave importance, and subjects
requiring elaborate and conscientious research, are constantly being
presented in the revenue and other branches of the public service, which
demand precise and authoritative determination for the satisfactory
guidance of official agents, and which should be placed under the imme-
diate supervision of those (of whatever government bureau) charged
with the responsibility and interested in the accurate execution of the

work.
EXPLORATIONS.

Tn the summer of 1879, Mr. F. H. Cushing, the assistant in charge of
the ethnological department of the museum, was granted leave of
absence by the Institution for the purpose of accompanying a commis-
sion detailed to carry on ethnological research and exploration among
the Pueblo people of New Mexico. This expedition, in charge of Mr.
James Stevenson, was very successful in its mission; collecting large
numbers of specimens, an account of which was duly given in the Report
of 1879. Mr. Cushing found the field of inquiry among the Indians so
rich and extensive that he obtained permission to remain a longer time,
and is still there. He has established himself with the Zuni Pueblo,
under the special protection of the chiefs, and has gained the confidence
of the people to such a degree as to be permitted to attend all their
ceremonial observances, and make notes and even drawings. An inves-
tigation into the traditions and history of the people, their manners and
customs, their songs and dances, and their relationship to other tribes,
has kept Mr. Cushing constantly occupied. A rich harvest of inter-
esting discovery will undoubtedly result from his residence among these
people.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

Mr. Cushing has also been enabled to obtain many interesting speci-
mens of the handiwork of the Indians, both ancient and modern, and
has visited some of the mines from which minerals valued by them as
precious stones were obtained. In addition to the general inquiry into
the history of the Indians, Mr. Cushing has been instructed to take the
census of the Zuni village, at the request of Major Powell.

Dr. I’. M. Endlich, the mineralogist of the Institution, received, in
January last, leave of absence, for the purpose of visiting, as an agent
of the Treasury Department, certain sugar-producing islands of the
West Indies and Demerara, with a view of investigating the mode of
preparation of sugars, intended especially for exportation to the United
States. During his stay in the West Indies, as also in South America,
he made some interesting collections for the National Museum, among
them specimens of curious aboriginal pottery.

Dr. Endlich returned to Washington, after an absence of several
months, but was occupied for some months in completing his report;
receiving then an appointment in charge of certain mining operations
in Arizona, he resigned his position in the National Museum. The work
of the department of which Dr. Endlich had charge was then placed in
the hands of Dr. F. W. Taylor of Washington, as will be seen by his
report, given elsewhere.

The services to natural science, of Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First
Cavalry, have been appreciated for many years past by scientific men,
this officer, whose military record is understood to be entirely satisfac-
tory, devoting his leisure time to collecting specimens in all branches
of natural history and making very full notes in regard to the man-
ners, habits, and peculiarities of various Indian tribes. His succes-
Sive assignments to military duty have taken him into the most
inaccessible and least-known portions of the American Continent, in-
cluding portions of Arizona, California, Oregon, &e., which have been
thoroughly explored by him. Several questions having arisen during
the year in reference to the character of certain species of salmonide
in Oregon and Washington Territory, the acquisition of specimens of
which was considered very desirable in the interest of fish culture and
the fisheries, Captain Bendire expressed his willingness to undertake
a journey to the localities involved, provided the necessary authority
and orders could be obtained from the War Department. Application
to General Sherman and to the Secretary of War resulted in the comple-
tion of the necessary arrangements, by which Captain Bendire was
instructed to prosecute some desired reconnoissances and inquiries, in
which he would have the necessary opportunities for natural history
research. Under this arrangement he left Fort Walla Walla with a
portion of his command, and after an interval of several months spent
in the field, returned with rich results, consisting of very complete col-
lections of the fishes of the rivers and lakes of the interior of the
country, and with other objects of natural history, which have been re-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ceived at the Institution and will shortly be made the subject of special
investigation on the part of its specialists.

Mr. F. A. Ober, whose important researches into the natural patetdey
and ethnology of numerous islands in the West Indies have been referred
to in previous reports, made an expedition to that group of islands.
during the past summer, in connection with certain business enterprises.
As before, he devoted such of his time as he could spare to. scicntific
inquiry, and secured an excellent series of birds from several of the
islands not previously visited. These have been duly received and
entered in the catalogue of the Museum, making its series of West
Indian birds by far the most complete of any in existence. It is pro-
posed at no distant time to prepare a catalogue of the West Indian birds
in the National Museum, with appropriate notes.

Mr. Ober also secured important collections ofreptiles, fishes, mammals,
and objects of archeology for the National Museum.

In December, 1879, Prof. David 8. Jordan, of the Indiana University,
as assistant to the United States Fish Commission and special agent
of the Census Department, was sent to the Pacifie coast to investigate
the fishes and fisheries of that region. Prof. Charles H. Gilbert; of the
same institution, accompanied him as assistant. These gentlemen re-
paired at once to San Diego, Cal., where they began work January
1, 1880. Statistics were obtained at each of the fishing towns, and
large collections of fishes were made in turn at San Diego, San Pedro,
Santa Barbara, Monterey, Soquel, and San Francisco. The collection
obtained in Monterey Bay was especially extensive, comprising nearly
one hundred and fifty species. A stay of several weeks was made’
in San Francisco, after which, about May 1, Professors Jordan and
Gilbert left for Astoria, Oreg.; here studies were made of the “spring
runs” of salmon, which, supplemented by Professor Gilbert’s subse-
quent studies of the “fall runs” in the various rivers, have thrown much
light on this intricate subject. Later a visit was made to Puget Sound,
and considerable collections were obtained at Seattle, Neah Bay, Vie-
toria, and New Westminster. On June 15, the party returned to Asto-
ria and soon after to San Francisco. The chief ports south of San Fran-
cisco were again visited and large collections made.

About September 1, Professor Jordan returned eastward, stopping at
Lake Tahoe, Utah Lake, and Burlington, Iowa, for the purpose of study-
ing the fisheries of these regions. Professor Gilbert returned to the Co-
lumbia and Puget Sound to investigate the fall runs of salmon. In Novem-
ber he left San Francisco for Mazatlan, Panama, and Aspinwall, at each
of which places considerable time was spent and large collections made.

Lhe chief results of the expedition may be here briefly summarized.

1. The collection of statistics of the various fisheries along the coast.

. The discovery of about 50 species new to science on our Pacific
biotists and of nearly as many more on the coasts of Mexico and Central
Benerien,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

3. The collection in large numbers of nearly every species known on
our Pacific coast, about 265 in all. About 10,000 duplicates from this
collection have been already distributed to the principal museums of
the world.

6. The solution of many of the problems relative to the life-history of
the salmon.

In April, 1880, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, one of the assistants in the Mu-
seum, was detailed to visit Alaska to collect fishery statistics, fishes,
birds, and such other objects of interest as could be obtained Through
the courtesy of Capt. Carlile P. Patterson, Superintendent of the United
States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and at the suggestion of Mr. W. H.
Dall, who was in command of the vessel, Dr. Bean was permitted to ae-
company the party of the schooner Yukon, and was allowed all possible
assistance and facilities for making collections. While Mr. Dall devoted
his leisure more particularly to the dredging for invertebrates and bar-
tering for native implements and ornaments, he also contributed largely
to the collection of fish and other marine vertebrates. Valuable aid was
extended also by Capt. E. P. Herendeen, Mr. Marcus Baker, Mr. Wm.
BE. Noyes, Mr. H. W. McDonald, and Mr. Sylvanus Bailey.

Dr. Bean was absent from April to the middle of November, and dur-
ing that time visited Sitka, Port Althorp, Port Mulgrave, Cook’s Inlet,
Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands, Belkofisky, Unalashka, Saint Paul Isl-
and, Plover Bay (Siberia), Cape Lisburne, Icy Cape, Point Belcher,
Eschscholtz Bay, Port Clarence, Big Diomede Island, and Saint Mathew
Island. One hundred days were spent at sea, and seventy-eight days
in the various ports named. When it is remembered that rain pre-
vented work to some extent while in port, it will be seen that the sea-
son of actual collecting was short; yet the party succeeded in obtaining
47 packages, including 32 boxes, 10 kegs, and 3 tank-boxes of natural
history specimens.

Upwards of 80 species of fish and 50 of birds were secured—some
rare fishes being taken in considerable numbers with a view to their
distribution to other museums. Of the fish Dr. Bean has already de-
scribed 14 species as new to science—one of them representing a new
genus. The chief value of the fish collection, however, lies in the fact of
its including many hitherto doubtful or unknown Pallasian and Tilesian
species. A full series of specimens was secured, which establishes the
identity of the commercial cod and halibut of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans. Not fewer than 14 species of fishes were collected that are
common to both sides of Northern America. With the addition of this
summer’s results, the Museum is in possession of nearly all the known
Alaskan fishes. Eurynorhynchus pygmeus was obtained in Plover Bay,
and information of its occurrence at Point Barrow. Larus marinus was,
for the first time, taken in Alaska. A very large series of the great
Unalashkan song sparrow (Melospiza insignis Baird) was brought down
and formed the basis of demonstrating a perfect intergradation with
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the M. melodia. Actodromas acuminata was again captured at Port
Clarence, farther north than ever before in Alaska.

A single reptile—a toad caught by Miss Sallie Ball near Sitka—forms
a part of the collection.

Mr. Dall was fortunate in procuring a nduioet skin and skeleton of the
banded seal (Histriophoca equestris) in spite of the determination of its
Eskimo captors to carry off at least a piece of the nose! <A very large
number of skulls of Eskimo dog was gathered at Plover Bay. A few
good bones of fossil mammals were brought from Eschscholtz Bay.

On the island of Unalashka many skulls and implements of prehistoric
Aleuts were found in cliff burial-places. At [iuliuk, Mr. Dall obtained a
great prize in the skull of a prehistoric Aleut dog from a village-site
near Ulakhta Head. Throughout the Territory large collections of
implements of bone, ivory, stone, wood, copper, &e., were made, some
of the Eskimo north of the Arctic Circle furnishing many really valu-
able articles of ivory and stone.

Dr. Bean is now preparing a detailed report upon the fishes; and this,
in connection with some notes on the birds, and lists of the coleoptera,
lichens, &c., will form material for a Bulletin of the Museum. .

Mr. H. H. Rusby, a well-known botanist of New Jersey, has been en-
gaged for some time in investigating the botany, natural history, and
archeology of New Mexico, and it gave the Institution much pleasure
to be able to obtain for him certain facilities from the War Depar tment,
to aid him in his researches. His special attention has been given te
botany, and he has already addressed to the Institution a number of
interesting collections in this department. In archeology his prinei-
pal work has been the investigation of a cave, near Silver City, New
Mexico, filled with aboriginal relics, many of which he has succeeded in
securing. None of these collections have, so far, come to hand; but
they will probably be received in the early part of 1881. Mr. Rusby,
with the true zeal of the explorer, finding his means inadequate to the
carrying out of his plans, entered into certain business relations with
parties in New Mexico, by means of which he earned enough to con-
tinue his labors.

An exploring trip to the remarkable natural cave at Luray, in Virginia,
was made by a party from the Institution in the month of July last. An
account of this visit is given in the General Appendix to this Report.

Ever since the return of the schooner Florence from her expedition to
Arctic America, Captain Howgate, of the Signal Office, has been en-
deavoring to secure the interest of Congress in a second expedition;
and to that end he purchased in Scotland the steamer Gulnare, and had
it brought to Washington and placed in a condition of thorough repair.
Additional timbers were placed in the vessel and it was overhauled and
placed in an effective condition.

In connection with the same enterprise Congress passed a law author-
izing her acceptance, by the Navy Department, and her equipment for
the purpose, should she be considered seaworthy. The Secretary of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

War was also authorized to make a detail of officers and men from the
Army, to accompany the expedition. The plan of operations was to
send the vessel to Lady Franklin Bay, with a shore party, which was
then to be landed and to be provided with houses on shore, the vessel
herself returning to the United States for additional supplies. ‘The War
Department did its part, by detailing Lieutenant Doane and a number of
men for the purpose in question, the general supervision being placed
in charge of the Signal Office. A critical inspection of the vessel was
made by the several bureaus of the Navy Department, and after a careful
consideration she was declared to be not sufficiently reliable to be ac-
cepted and the Secretary of the Navy declined to take the responsibility
of forwarding her on the voyage. In this emergency Captain Howgate
himself provisioned the vessel and furnished the necessary commander
and crew, and she started on her journey via Newfoundland. Severe
storms, however, were encountered and her boilers became so injured
as to require repair in Newfoundland. She experienced numerous mis-
haps, some of which greatly injured the vessel itself and rendered the
further prosecution of the enterprise inexpedient. The vessel accord-
ingly returned to Washington with the party, and the expedition was
practically abandoned for the present. Dr. Pavy, the surgeon and
naturalist of the expedition, and one other, however, remained in Green-
land to carry on independent researches.

Captain Howgate, with his usual appreciation of all branches of science,
invited the Institution to furnish a collector to the expedition, promising
to supply the necessary quarters and subsistence. It was, however,
found impossible, in the brief notice given, to secure the services of a
competent person, and nothing was done beyond supplying some ap-
paratus for deep-sea research.

PUBLICATIONS.

The activity of the Institution is more marked and its influence more
extended through its publications than by any other of its agencies for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. However useful
and important its researches, explorations and collections, these would
be very limited in advantage to the public were it not for the dissemina-
tion of the new truths discovered and the facts collected through the
various classes of publications carried on by the establishment. These
publications are growing in number, size, frequency of issue, and value
every year, and more has been done in this way in 1880 ee during
any previous period.

For many years past the Saaenent Institution has been in the
habit of having all its memoirs (both octavo and quarto) stereotyped,
as thereby the number of copies of any memoir required for the use of
the public could be conveniently regulated. The demand by the public
(beyond the regular supply of everything to a definite number of insti-
tutions) being very unequal, there was danger of printing either too
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

many or too few. This induced my predecessor, many years ago, to
order that everything published by the Institution should either be elec-
trotyped or stereotyped, and the first edition for miscellaneous distri-
bution of 250 copies was generally printed. If more than this was
required a second and a third edition of similar extent were ordered.
In this way the expense of an investment in paper and printing, as -
well as an inconvenient and possibly dangerous accumulation of mate-
rials in the building, was avoided; and it has now become possible to
keep down the stock to the minimum. The stereotype and electrotype
plates have usually been kept in the basement of the building; but for
the greater convenience of reference and transfer to the printer when
required, they have been arranged during the year in a large fire-proof
room in the upper stories of the south tower.

By far the largest proportion of electrotype plates have been stored
in Philadelphia in a portion of the building of the Academy of Natural
Sciences of that city, and under the charge of the printers of the Insti-
tution, the T. K. Collins establishment. The Institution is under great
obligations to the Academy for permission to occupy so much of its
basement and for allowing, at the same time, free access to it by the
agents of the Institution.

Index to Smithsonian Publications.—In the constantly-increasing mass
of serial publications the general titles of which express but indefinitely
the character of their contents, the preparation of special indexes has
become a matter of great importance; and within the last twenty years
quite a number of such publications have been made; one of these, of
the most importance, namely, the Index of Periodical Literature, by Mr.
Henry Poole, has been of very great assistance to students and investi-
gators, and a still more elaborate system of indexing has lately been
carried out. An association of persons familiar with this kind of work
has been formed for the purpose of continuing this series of indexes.
Two propositions have been made to the Institution to prepare a full
digest of all the papers it has published.

Such a bibliography has, however, been in preparation by the Institu-
tion for some time past. Mr. Boehmer, one of the assistants, has prepared
a full alphabetical index to the subjects of ethnology and archeology,
contained in the Contributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collec-
tions, and the Smithsonian Reports; an abstract of which, published in
the Report for 1879, will give some idea of its plan. The complete work
will be printed as soon as funds are available for the purpose, and it
will meet an acknowledged want. Similar indexes will, in time, be
furnished, relating to other branches of science. ,

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—During the year, Volume
XXII of the quarto series of Contributions” has been made up and
published, consisting of independent memoirs previously issued by the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

Institution. This volume comprises 544 pages of text, illustrated by 20
plates and 474 wood-cuts; and embraces the following subjects:

Introduction, 16 pp.—1st. Explorations of the Aboriginal Remains
of Tennessee. By Joseph Jones, M.D. Published October, 1876.  4to.,
181 pp. 95 wood-cuts.

2d. The Sculptures of Santa Lucia Cosumalwhuapa in Guatemala.
With an account of Travels in Central America and on the Western
Coast of South America. By S. Habel, M. D. Published February,
1878. 4to., 94 p. 8 plates.

3d. The Archeological Collection of the United States National
Museum, in charge of the Smithsonian Institution. Washington, D.
C. By Charles Rau. Published August, 1876. 4to., 118 pp. 340
wood-cuts.

Ath. The Palenque Tablet in the United States National Museum.
Washington, D. C. By Charles Rau. Published November, 1879.
4to., 91 pp. 2 plates and 39 wood-cuts.

5th. On the Remains of Later Pre-Historic Man obtained from Caves
in the Catherina Archipelago, Alaska Territory, and especially from
the Caves of the Aleutian Islands. By W. H. Dall. Published Janu-
ary, 1876. 4to.,44 pp. 10 plates.

Palenque Tablet.—F rom the interest expressed by Mexican archeolo-
gists in the history of the Palenque Tablet, and in Dr. Raw’s memoir on
that subject, it was presumed that this paper would be translated and
published by the National Museum of Mexico, under the charge of its
eminent director, Senor Don Gumesindo Mendoza, and accordingly as
an act of international courtesy if was determined to offer to him
electrotype copies of the plates, as also a supply of phototype prints
from the tablet itself. This proposal was at once thankfully accepted
by Senor Mendoza, and the preparation of the translation of the text
promptly undertaken. Copies of the memoir in the Spanish version,
giving the text and all the notes in full, have lately been received by
the Institution.

Physiological Research.—A memoir has been published during the
past year on the subject of “Fever,” considered physiologically as well
as pathologically. The researches set forth in this work were under-
taken by Dr. H. C. Wood, jr., of Philadelphia, under the auspices of the
Institution; and a notice of the character of the investigation, pre-
pared by the author, was presented in the Report for 1878. The print-
ing of the memoir was considerably delayed by the necessity of a criti-
cal revision of the tables and calculations, which was intrusted to Mr.
C. B. Young, of this Institution, and which has received from him careful
and laborious attention. He also corrected all the proof-sheets. This
memoir, forming No. 357 of the Smithsonian publications, comprises 266
quarto pages, illustrated by 5 plates and 16 wood-cuts. The general
conclusion arrived at, as summarized in the memoir, is that the cause
of fever ‘is simply a state in which a depressing poison or a depress-
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ing peripheral irritation acts upon the nervous system which regulates
the production and dissipation of animal heat”; and that the nature
of fever is “a nutritive disturbance in which there is an elevation of
the bodily temperature and also an increase of the production of heat
by an increase of the chemical movements in the accumulated material
of the body; this increase being sometimes sufficient, sometimes in-
sufficient, to compensate for the loss of that heat which is derived di-
rectly from the destruction of the surplus food in the body; very little
or no food being taken in severe fever.”

It is the custom of the Institution to give to the author a certain
number of copies of his memoirs, this varying with the extent and cost
of production. The author is also invited to furnish a list of specialists
particularly interested in the research covered by the memoir, whether
resident at home or abroad, and to these, or as many as can conveniently
be supplied, copies are sent free of cost, and the fact of this being done
by the request of the author is stated:

The author is also allowed to print as many additional copies as he
thinks proper, at his own expense, and to dispose of them as he pleases,
either by giving them away or selling them. The more extended the
distribution of a memoir, the better is the principle of the Institution
earried out, viz, that of the increase and diffusion of knowledge.

Dr. Wood has availed himself of this opportunity by having 250 extra
copies printed and placed on the market with the imprint of J. B. Lip-
pincott, & Co., of Philadelphia.

Meteorology.—The relationship of the Smithsonian Institution to
the subject of American meteorology is well known, especially the
fact that until the establishment of the Weather Bureau of the War
Department the Institution had the entire burden of maintaining a series
of observing stations throughout the country and of publishing the re-
sults in a series of memoirs, which are accepted as of standard value by
all meteorologists. When in 1871 its system of active work was trans-
ferred to the Signal Office of the War Department the publication of
digested results was not intermitted, but continued, so as to cover the
entire period of activity up to the year in question.

Among the meteorological monographs published by the Institution,
that on the rainfall of the United States prepared under the direction of
Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the United States Coast Survey, was one of the
most important. This work, with its digested tables of rainfall and the
series of rainfall maps, extending from the earliest records to the year
1866, was used for a number of years in determining the questions of
general climatology and the relations of plants to altitude and locality,
and to the extent and degree of reservoirs for storing water, &c.

In the interval between the completion of the first work to the trans-
fer of the system many additional observations had been made, involv-
ing the rectification of some of the general conclusions, and it was
determined to publish a continuation of the work, down to 1878, em-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

bodying at the same time a recast of the generalizations. The work
was accordingly placed under the supervision of Mr. Schott, as-
sisted by Mr. E. H. Courtenay, of the Coast Survey, and completed
during the year. Arrangements were immediately made for publica-
tion, including the construction of new base charts. The printing of the
charts has been completed by Mr. Julius Bien and the text is in an ad-
vanced stage of preparation, and will probably be ready in a few months.

Among the important papers still on hand which have been accepted
and are awaiting publication are the continuation of Professor Caswell’s
meteorological observations, of Providence, and the observations made
by Mr. Sherman, while on board the schooner Florence as a member of
Captain Howgate’s polar expedition.

The observations of Mr. Sherman present many new points in the
climatology and physical condition of the arctic regions, and will be a
valuable addition to the other papers of a similar character published
by the Institution, as illustrating the works of Hayes, Kane, McClintock,
and others. The delay in the publication of these works is due to the
large amount of material on hand. It is hoped, however, that in the
course of a year they may be sent to press.

Archcology.—Reference has been made in previous reports to an ex-
tremely interesting collection of West Indian antiquities, probably of
Carib manufacture, presented by the late Mr. George Latimer to the
National Museum. This collection embraced many new forms of much
interest. The stone implements of this collection possessed many peculi-
arities, for the most part not illustrated at all by those of the continent of
North America; and amemoir by Prof. O. T. Mason, published in the An-
nual Report in 1876, illustrated by suitable wood-cuts, has attracted great
attention at home and abroad. Its dissemination has brought to light
additional collections in the West India Islands, and arrangements have
been made to obtain the use of some of these for publication.

Mr. Frederick A. Ober brought from Antigua a number of inter-
esting objects, quite different from those of Mr. Latimer; and Mr.
Guesde, of Guadaloupe, has communicated to the Institution a large num-
ber of beautifully-executed drawings of full-sized specimens in his collec-
tion, accompanied by detailed descriptions. Professor Mason has un-
dertaken to compile a special memoir on Mr. Guesde’s collection, to be
illustrated by his drawings and published at an early date.

The publication by the Smithsonian Institution, many years ago, of a
memoir by Mr. Lewis H. Morgan, upon the terms of relationship and con-
sanguinity employed by various nations of the world, led to the establish-
ment of almost a new branch of philological and ethnological investiga-
tion; or at least placed it upon a substantial footing. At the time of the
publication of the memoir there were few persons prepared to follow the
reasoning of the author ; but under its stimulus corresponding researches
have been carried on in various parts of the world and have produced
very good fruit.
Se REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Among such investigations was one by Mr. L. Fison, in regard to the
aborigines of Australia, and an agreement was entered into with him ~
by which the Institution was to publish it, uniform with Mr. Morgan’s
memoir. The number of manuscripts in hand waiting for publication
prevented Mr. Fison’s article from going to press, and he finally was
able to make arrangements at home for its appearance. The paper was
accordingly withdrawn and transmitted to the author through Mr. Mor-
gan.

There is now a sufficient number of the quarto memoirs completed to
form another volume of the “ Contributions,” Volume XXIII; and this
will be issued early in the year 1881. It will probably comprise :

Ist. Lucernariz and theirallies. By Henry James Clark. (130 pages,

Memoir of James Smithson.—It has long been the intention of the In-
stitution to publish a memoir of its founder, and from time to time ef-
forts have been made to collect materials for this purpose. It is much
to be regretted, however, that this work was not undertaken at an earlier
date, while some of Smithson’s contemporaries were living who could
have imparted valuable information as to his peculiarities and charac-
teristics.

Mr. Rhees, Chief Clerk of the Institution, has at last supplied the
want so long felt in the history of this establishment, and has made use
of every known source of information in the preparation of the work in
question. By extensive correspondence and advertisements in several
of the leading English periodicals some facts of interest not hitherto
known were secured, and the author was thus enabled to present a
more extended notice of Smithson than was at first anticipated.

The memoir under notice commences with a sketch of the ancestry of
the Smithson family, gives an account of the education of James Smith-
son at the Oxford University, where he graduated in 1786, describes his
devotion to scientific pursuits, his love of adventure in the search for
knowledge, recounts his achievements as a chemist and mineralogist,
enumerates his published scientific works, and gives the testimonials to
his worth and ability from the president of the Royal Society and
others.

An inventory of his personal effects is presented, and an account of
the likenesses of Mr. Smithson known to be in existence and in the pos-
session of the Institution.

Some attentionis paid to a consideration of the motives which probably
actuated Smithson in bequeathing his fortune to the United States, and
a resumé is given of the intellectual condition of the period in which he
lived, which is shown to have exhibited a remarkable spirit of scientific
activity, and the formation at that time of some of the most important
organizations for the advancement of science, education, and philan-
thropy.

S. Mis. 31——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The promotion of knowledge was peculiarly a characteristic of the
period, and Smithson was undoubtedly impressed with this idea.

Full details of the will and a fac simile of it are given.

Mr. Rhees then traces the steps taken by the United States Govern-
ment to secure the bequest, the various acts of Congress, the debates,
resolutions, messages of Presidents, &c., in relation to the subject, and
finally the reception, on the 29th of August, 1838, of £104,960 8s. 6d,
which, converted into American gold, realized $508,318.46 as the Smith-
son foundation.

A recapitulation is next furnished of the legislation of Congress in
relation to the disposition of the Smithson fund, and a brief abstract of
the notable speeches ‘made from time to time in which various plans
for establishing the Smithsonian Institution were advocated. These
speeches are given in full in the “‘ Documents relative to the history of
the Smithsonian Institution,” published in 1879; but in the present vol-
ume the narrative is continuous and the references to the names and locali-
ties of the Senators and members of Congress more minute and explicit.
In an appendix additional facts are given relative to the father of
Smithson, the first Duke of Northumberland; the half brother of Smith-
son, Earl Percy, who commanded the British re-enforcements at the battle
of Lexington, 1775; notices of some of Smithson’s papers; extracts from
his writings; a catalogue of iis library now deposited in the Smithso-
nian Institution; and notices of the city of Washington found in Smith-
son’s books.

The whole forms an octavo of 76 pages, with the following illustra-
tions :

Portrait of Smithson. Heliotype; from an oil miniature by Johns.
1816.

Portrait of Smithson. Heliotype; from an oil painting. Cabinet
size; full-length figure, sitting, in the costume of an Oxford student.
1786.

Portrait of Smithson. Profile; engraved on steel; from a medallion.

Temb of Smithson, at Genoa, Italy. Wood-engraving; froma recent
photograph.

Fac simile of Smithson’s visiting card, and of his dinner invitation
eard.

Silhouette portrait of Henry James Hungerford, nephew of Smithson.

Fac simile of Smithson’s will. Two sheets, of four quarto pages.

Portrait of Smithson’s father, Sir Hugh Smithson. From an engrav-
ing belonging to James Smithson.

North view of the Smithsonian Institution building at Washington.

The Memorial Volume in honor of the late Professor Henry, author-
ized to be published by Congress, though somewhat delayed, has been
cowpleted, and is now practically ready for distribution. It forms a
handsome octavo book of 528 pages, of which the main subject-matter
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

is divided into three parts. A brief introduction of 4 pages presents
the proceedings of Congress in relation to the holding of memorial serv-
ices in the hall of the House of Representatives, and also in relation to
the printing of the same, together with such other testimonials of respect
as the Regents might deem congruous with the object of the work. Part
first embraces the primary proceedings more immediately connected
with the obsequies, commencing appropriately with the reproduction
of the announcement of the death of Joseph Henry, by the Chancellor,
Chief Justice Waite, issued on the day following that melancholy event,
and addressed as a formal or official obituary notice to all the cor-
respondents of the Institution, In our own country or abroad, followed
by an account of the proceedings of the Board of Regents on the ocea-
sion of the funeral services, with the sermon of the Rev. Samuel S.
Mitchell, and of the steps taken by the Regents on the day following to
obtain a public commemoration. Part second comprises an account of
the memorial services at the Capitol, presided over by the Vice-Presi-
dent, taken from the Congressional Record, and consisting of an open-
ing prayer by President McCosh of Princeton, addresses by Senators
Hamlin and Withers, Representatives Garfield and Cox, Professors
Gray of Cambridge and Rogers of Boston, and by General Sherman,
the reading of telegrams by Representative Clymer, and a closing prayer
by the Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Dr. Sunderland. Part third com-
prises proceedings by, and addresses before, various bodies with which
Professor Henry had been prominently connected. The volume con-
cludes with an appendix of 4 pages, recounting the proceedings of
Congress with reference to the erection on the Smithsonian grounds of
a statue of Joseph Henry. The whole is followed by a general index of
12 pages.

Digest of Atomic Weights—Among the Miscellaneous Collections a
caretully-prepared digest of “Atomic Weights,” by George F. Becker,
of California, has been published during the past year, constituting No.
358 of the Smithsonian series. This work, comprising 150 octavo pages,
consists of a collection of all the determinations of the atomic weights
of the chemical elements heretofore made. The elements are alphabet-
ically arranged, with critical notices under each, and the authorities for
varying determinations, together with precise citations to the publica-
tions or records, are fully given. The whole is accompanied with a full
index of the journals and other publications, both foreign and domestic,
which have been laid under contribution ; and a second index gives an
alphabetical list of the authors of atomic weight determinations. The
work evinces a pains-taking diligence in collecting from every available
source (in whatever language) the information desired ; and it will prove
a valuable work of reference to both the theoretical and the practical
chemist.

This publication is in continuation of a line of scientific manuals on
the “Constants of Nature,” projected by the Institution, and may be
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

regarded as forming Volume IV of the series thus far attempted:
Volume I being tables of the Specifie Gravities of bodies, and also of
their Boiling and Melting Points ; Volume II, tables of the Specific Heats
of bodies; and Volume III, tables of Heat Hxpansion of bodies. All
three volumes were compiled by Prof. F. W. Clarke of the University of
Cincinnati.

The Toner Lectures.—On the 13th of April, 1872, a deed of conveyance
. of several pieces of property in Washington, with money and other
securities amounting in value to $3,000, was made by Dr. Joseph M.
Toner, of this city, to five trustees, instituting the Toner lectures, and
establishing a permanent and increasing fund for their support and con-
tinuance annually.

The trustees named in the deed were the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution (then Prof. Joseph Henry), the Surgeon-General of the United
States Army (then J. K. Barnes, M. D.), the Surgeon-General of the
United States Navy (then J. M. Foltz, M. D.), the president of the Med-
ical Society of the District of Columbia (then Grafton Tyler, M. D.).

The interest of this fund was set apart to be applied for annual
memoirs or essays relative to some branch of medical science, each to
contain some new truth fully established by experiment or observation ;
no such memoir or lecture to be given to the world under the name of
the “Toner Lectures” without having first been critically examined and
approved by competent persons selected by the trustees.

In accordance with this trust, arrangements were made for the deliv-
ery of annual lectures on subjects relative to medical science, and the
Smithsonian Institution undertook their publication in its series of Mis-
cellaneous Collections. The following is a list of the lectures published
up to 1880, and already described in previous reports: I. On the
Structure of Cancerous Tumors and the Mode in which adjacent parts
are invaded. By Dr. J. J. Woodward. Published November, 1873, 44
pp., 8vo. Ul. Dual Character of the Brain. By Dr. C. E. Brown-Se-
quard. Published January, 1877, 25 pp., 8vo. III. Strain and Over-
Action of the Heart. By Dr. J.M. Da Costa. Published August, 1874,
32 pp., 8vo. IV. A Study of the Nature and Mechanism of Fever. By
Dr. Horatio C. Wood. Published February, 1875, 48 pp., 8vo. V. On
the Surgical Complications and Sequels of Continued Fevers. By Dr.

ature, Acupressure, and Torsion. By Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare. Pub-
lished April, 1879, 71 pp., 8vo. And lastly, during the past year: VIII.
Suggestions for the Sanitary Drainage of Washington City. By George
ki. Waring, jr. Published June, 1880, 23 pp., 8vo.

This last lecture forms No. 349 of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

lections, and discusses a subject of special and practical importance to
the residents of this city.

The heaith and comfort of the Capital of the nation is a matter of so
zeneral interest that its hygienic conditions deserve careful study and
consideration. Very difficult problems are presented to the sanitary
engineer by the topography of the city and the river frontage on a large
area of flat land. The drainage of so large and so populous a city is
one of the first subjects requiring the attention of the local authorities
and of Congressional action. Mr. Waring having had long experience -
and much distinction in investigation of such topics, was, therefore, in-
vited by the trustees of the Toner fund to make a thorough examination
of the city and District, and requested to make suggestions for the im-
provement of their drainage.

Mr. Waring in his lecture presents Holland as furnishing a suitable
example for imitation in regard to the reclamation of low areas. In
that country about 4,000 acres have been reclaimed annually, while in
Washington the improvement of not more than 2,500 is required. He rec-
ommends strongly the adoption of the Dutch method of constructing de-
fenses, embankments, and bulk-heads, leaving the inclosed ground at its
present level, and to drain it by artificial power to a sufficient depth to se-
cure the same result as to dryness that would be secured by the filling it
with earth. This would substitute a dry and pleasant meadow for the
present noisome mud flats, would be economical, simple, and practically
equivalent to raising the whole city six or eight feet above its present
level, and give it high and dry ground to the shore oO! a clear running
stream on each side.

Next to bringing the flats about the city into a proper condition, the
drying of the soil of those parts now subject to saturation is considered
by the author, and for the latter purpose he recommends that the damp
lands should be drained by an independent system of pipes, entirely
disconnected, except at their outlets, with the sewer system.

The sewerage of the city is next considered, and the use of the same
drains for the streets and for houses is condemned as very objection-
able. It is urged as of prime necessity that every foot of the sewers
with which habitations are connected should be at-all times free from
deposits of organic matter.

The best size of sewer-pipes is fully discussed, and the conclusion
stated that large ones should be restricted to the removal of storm-water
only, and small ones used for house drainage.

A radical and almost universal improvement of the interior drainage
of houses is demanded, the defective house-drains being a far more im-
portant factor in the production of disease than defective sewers. By
the official statement, the deaths in the District in 1879 from diseases
which are believed to be very materially affected by bad drainage, either
by soil-moisture or by filth, amounted to just about one-half of the total
mortality. The author believes that five hundred persons annually die
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

within the District of Columbia because of the defective condition of
the houses in which they live.

The main features of a comprehensive scheme adequate to the im-
provement required are stated by Mr. Waring to be—

1. The flats and marshes to be reclaimed by embanking and pumping.

2. The discharge of the lateral streams and of storm-water sewers to
be carried beyond these defenses and delivered into the main channels
of the river.

3. The complete underdraining or subsoil drainage of the site of the
city.

4. The separate removal of the foul drainage.

5. The abolition of privy vaults and cesspools and the complete
reformation of the interior drainage of houses.

Physical Tables—Among the earliest publications of the Institution,
one now exhausted, but which has ever since been in great demand both
at home and abroad, is the very full series of meteorological and phys-
ical tables prepared by Prof. Arnold Guyot. This work (No. 31 on our
list), published in 1852, constitutes the principal portion of the first
volume of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and is universally
recognized as a standard work of reference on the subjects to which it
is devoted.

The expansion of certain branches of physical inquiry has made some
supplementary tables desirable, and Professor Guyot was invited by |
my predecessor to prepare the material for a new series. The greater
part of the work will of course be unchanged, and will be printed from
the original electrotype plates. But some modification of certain tables,
together with a number of new ones, has been arranged for.

Professor Guyot’s laborious duties at Princeton have interfered with
the speedy completion of the new edition; but the material is now
nearly ready, and the additional pages will be put in type at an early
day.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—In addition to the regular series
of publications printed entirely at the expense of the Smithsonian fund,
several series prepared under the direction of the Institution have the
expense of the printing of a small edition provided for from other sources.
Stereotype plates of these issues are preserved, and are afterward in-
cluded in the Miscellaneous Collections. These consist especially of the
Bulletins and Proceedings of the National Museum, the printing of which
is authorized by the Department of the Interior, and paid for out of its
fund. Anedition of one thousand copies is published, of which one-half is
distributed by the Department of the Interior and one-half by the Insti-
tution. As the pages are stereotyped, the cost of additional copies is
slight; and for the purpose of making sure that a sufficient number of
sets will be accessible forever to students in all parts of the world, it has
been considered expedient to print fifteen hundred additional copies of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

each as a portion of the Miscellaneous Collections. In this way the dis-
tribution of the first edition can be made to special students and the
minor societies that do not receive full series of Smithsonian publications.

In this manner the various numbers of the Proceedings of the Na-
tional Museum (forming the volumes for 1878 and 1879) have been asso-
ciated together to form the nineteenth volume of the Miscellaneous Col-
jections as already indicated. A similar arrangement has been made
in reference to the transactions of the Philosophical Society of Wash-
ington, the first three volumes of which have been printed from the
stereotype plates, and will probably form Volume XX of Miscellaneous
Collections, to be issued early in 1881.

The ‘ Bulletins” of the Museum, as heretofore stated, are designed to
furnish cheek-lists, system of classification, and descriptions of the
natural history material on hand, for the purpose of illustrating the
zoological and ethnological collections belonging to the U. 8S. National
Museum, &e.

The seventeenth Bulletin of the National Museum is on the zoological
position of Texas, by E. D. Cope. The author considers the subject of
the influence of environment on animal life, and the relation of the ne-
arctic and neotropical faune at their point of junction. Studies into the
zoology of Mexico have shown that the high plateau is populated by an
animal life which differs from that of the coastward plains. From in-
vestigations of the Batrachia and Reptilia, which are incapable of per-
forming migrations, the line of demarkation between the great northern
and southern reals is clearly indicated. The genera of South America
advance northwards along the lower lands of Central America and
Mexico to the mouth of the Rio Grande, which is about their northern
boundary. On the other hand various genera of the southern regions of
North America extend their range southward as far as the city of
Mexico.

The great State of Texas is the field where the boundaries of the va-
rious genera is to be sought, since its fauna is of a most diversified
character. The geology, topogranhy, climate, and vegetation of this
region are described, and the author then proceeds to a consideration of
the distribution of its vertebrate animals in the following order: Mam-
malia, Aves, Reptilia, Batrachia, Pisces.

The author concludes that Texas is to be placed within the nearctic
realm, for although it possesses a number of genera which are common
to this realm and the neotropical, there are numerous genera which be-
long to the former exclusively and very few that belong to the latter
alone. To display these relations lists are given side by side of genera
whose geographical relations are in these three directions.

The species are shown in four geographica. groups, (1) those of the
extreme southwest, (2) those of the plateaus, (3) those of the low coun-
try, and (4) the east.

The discussion is a valuable contribution to science, and the paper has
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

attracted marked attention from naturalists. It forms an octavo of 51
pages.

Bulletin No. 18is a pamphlet of 278 pages, and is entitled “‘ Exhibit of
the fisheries and fish culture of the United States of America, made at
Berlin in 1880, prepared under the direction of G. Brown Goode, deputy
commissioner.”

This work is a catalogue of the articles brought together by the United
States Fish Commission for exhibition at the International Fishery Ex-
hibition held in Berlin in April, May, and June, 1880. An account of
this exhibition and of the display made by the United States, with the
awards to exhibitors, will be found in another place in this report.

The bulletin or catalogue was used as the oflicial list or guide to the
American part of the exhibition, was republished in Berlin, translated
into German, and on account of its extent, classification, detail, and ac-
curacy, elicited much praise. *

The work is arranged under six sections or heads, viz:

A. Aquatic animals and plants of North America beneficial or in-
jurious to man.

B. Fishing-grounds of North America.

C. Means of pursuit and capture.

D. Methods of preparation.

EK. Animal products and their applications.

F. Research, protection, and culture.

Under each of these sections, subdivisions are made for the purpose
of systematic classification. °

Proceedings of the National Museum.—As stated in the reports for
1878 and 1879, another series of publications relating to the Museum
has been introduced, designed to furnish to naturalists early anncunce-
ments and descriptions of specimens received, particularly when of new
species, together with such other matters of zoological interest as may
be furnished by correspondents, to which series the title of ‘ Proceed-
ings of the National Museum” has been given. Of the articles published
in the Proceedings for the year 1880, Mr. R. Ridgway has furnished the
following:

(1) Revisions of Nomenclature of certain North American Birds. This
paper is an explanatory list of the names of North American birds
which, in accordance with the recognized rules of nomenclature, have
been changed or amended since the publication (in 1873) of the latest
catalogue of the species—Coues’s “Check List.” Thirty-one specific or
subspecific and twenty-five generic names are given as changed or
amended since that date, from the form given in the above-named
catalogue, while nineteen species given therein as geographical races or
varieties are raised to full specific rank, seven others being reduced to
the rank of subspecies.

(2) A Catalogue of the Birds of North America.—This catalogue is pre-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

pared with the view to supply the wide-spread deman4 for a catalogue
of North American birds which shall be complete up to date as z+zards
the enumeration of species known to occur in North America, and at the
same time includes a thorough though condensed digest, with references
of the additions to the fauna and changes of nomenclature which have
been made during the period of twenty-one years which has elapsed
since the publication of the last Smithsonian catalogue, in 1859. This
new catalogue, with numerous revisions and additions, is now (Decem-
ber, 1880) being printed for publication in pamphlet form.

(3) Catalogue of Trochilide in the collection of the United States Na-
tional Museum.—This is a list of the species of humming birds contained
in the National Collection, all the localities represented by the specimens
being given with each species. The chief object of this list is to call at-
tention to the desiderata, so that correspondents may be able to furnish
species which are lacking to the collection, and thus render it more com-
plete.

Dr. Tarleton H. Bean has furnished among other papers:

A list of European fishes in the collection of the United States National
Museum.—About 350 nominal species are mentioned. As this list is in-
tended simply to facilitate exchanges with museums in Europe, the
names under which the fishes were received are retained without refer-
ence to our latest knowledge concerning the classification and specific
identity of certain species.

Other articles have been supplied by Messrs. 8. T. Cattie, F. M.
Endjich, 8. Garman, C. H. Gilbert, T. Gill, G. B. Goode, O. P. Hay,
A. Heilprin, D. S. Jordan, G. N. Lawrence, W. N. Lockington, R.
Rathbun, J. A. Ryder, R. Smith, J. J. Smith, J. G. Swan, A. E. Verrill,
and C. A. White.

Systematic Nomenclature.—In carrying out investigations in systematic
natural history a large part of the labor consists in determining the prior-
ity of names, especially those of the genera employed or proposed; and
for many years each inquirer was obliged to repeat the labors of others
and to waste a vast amount of his time thereby. In 1846. the late Prof.
Louis Agassiz prepared a list of all names of genera that had been pro-
posed in zodlogy, giving the dates, references to place of publication, and
the group of the animal kingdom to which they belonged. No greater
boon could have been extended to students than this compilation,
which answered its purpose fully for a number of years. In 1873, Mr.
Marschall prepared a supplement to the work of Professor Agassiz,
which was also of very great moment. For many years past, however,
no convenient digest has been available to cover more recent researches,
as the spirit of scientific investigation is increasing in almost geomet-
rical ratio, and the need of anew nomenclature has been apparent.
Mr. 8. H. Scudder, of Cambridge, Mass., has devoted a large poxtion of
time lately to the preparation of a second supplement to Pyofessor
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Agassiz’s work, to include a general index to the whole; and by this
means, when published, the naturalist will be able to reduce the time
and trouble of a given research enormously. Mr. Scudder offered this
memoir to the Smithsonian Institution for publication, but as its own
funds were required for the other memoirs previously in hand, it was
accepted by the Department of the Interior, as a bulletin, and work
begun upon it. Some hundreds of pages have already been printed,
and it is hoped that the whole will be completed in the course of 1881.

Smithsonian Annual Report.—In consequence of the delay at the Gov-
ernment Printing Office, referred to in the last report, the Report for
1878 was not ready for distribution until March of the past year. Being
the first issued after the death of the late Secretary of the Institution,
Professor Henry, it was deemed proper to devote considerable of its space
to a presentation of his life and scientific work. For this purpose, the
biographical memoir prepared, at the request of the Board of Regents, by
Dr. Asa Gray was appended to the Proceedings of the Board, while in
the General Appendix were inserted the accounts of his researches on
sound with reference to fog-signaling—his latest scientific work—re-
printed from the several reports of the Light-House Board, in which they
originally appeared, the whole being arranged in a connected article.
With the same view, also, an article prepared by W. B. Taylor on Prof.
Henry’s connection with the telegraph was inserted, presenting his, as
yet, imperfectly recognized contributions to the scientific basis of that
invention. .

The other articles in the Appendix are: Accounts of explorations in
Greenland by L. Kumlien, and in the Caribbee Islands by F. A. Ober;
a table of some physical constants by J. Le Conte—a contribution to the
proposed collection of all the constants of Nature and Art; an account
of some experiments on the effect of irritation of a sensitive nerve by B.
F. Lautenbach; translations of Arago’s biography of Condorcet, and of
Favre’s biographical notice of Agassiz; an abstract of the results of the
researches on Fever, made, with the co-operation of the Institution, by
Dr. H. C. Wood; and a republication of a list of the apparatus in various
institutions in the United States available for scientific research. The
whole forms a volume of 575 pages with 12 illustrations.

A number of ethnological articles, intended for this report, were un-
avoidably thrown over to the next.

The report for 1879 was presented to Congress on the 10th of March,
1880, and an edition of 15,500 copies were ordered, 2,500 for the
use of the Senate, 6,000 for the use of the House of Representatives, and
7,000 for the Institution. It is again a matter of regret that the publi-
cation of this work has been so long delayed. The amount of work or-
dered to be done at the Public Printing Office is enormous and increases
every year, while the facilities for doing it remain very much the same.
As an evidence of the increase of work in this office, the Public Printer
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

states that the number of blanks printed during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1880, exceeded those printed during the previous year by
25,000,000. The number of copies of unfinished works on December 1,
1880, ordered by Congress was 922,107. It is absolutely impossible to
satisfy all the requirements of the Departments and of Congress in a
reasonable time, aud unfortunately the Smithsonian report is delayed
much beyond the desire and intention of the Institution.

In this report an unusually large space of the Appendix is devoted
to anthropology—all but four of the papers, in fact, coming under that
head. This was due, in part, to the increased attention given to that
branch of science within the past few years, and in part to the fact that
the ethnological articles prepared for the report of 1878 were unavoid-
ably thrown over to this.

The full list of titles comprises: A study of the savage weapons at
the Centennial Exhibition, by E. H. Knight; reports of American obser-
vatories, prepared by E. 8. Holden from the answers to the Smithsonian
circular asking for information in regard to the equipment and opera-
tions of the observatories in the United States; translations of Pisko’s
lecture on the present fundamental principles of physics; of Baumhauer’s
account of his proposed universal meteorograph for detached observa-
tories; and of Worsaae’s statement of the measures taken for the pres-
ervation of antiquities and national monuments in Denmark ; abstracts
of replies to the Smithsonian archeological circular; and a statement
of the anthropological investigations pursued in 1879, both prepared by
Otis T. Mason; an Index to the Papers on Anthropology, published by
the Smithsonian Institution from 1847 to 1878, prepared by George H.
Boehmer, and the following papers on local ethnology and anthropology:
The French Hali-Breeds of the Northwest, by V. Havard; Prehistoric
Remains in Montana, between Fort Ellis and the Yellowstone River, by
P. W. Norris; the Shoshonee or Snake Indians, their religion, super-
stitions, and manners, by Albert G. Brackett; Ruins in White River
Cation, Pima County, Arizona, by R. T. Burr; Mounds in Winnebago
County, Wisconsin, by Thomas Armstrong; Mounds near Quincy, Il.
and in Wisconsin, by William Gilbert Anderson; Notes on some of
the principal mounds in the Des Moines Valley, by Samuel B. Evans;
Composition of ancient pottery, found near the mouth of Chequest
Creek, at Pittsburg, on the Des Moines River, by Robert N. and Charles
L. Dahlberg; Prehistoric evidences in Missouri, by G. C. Broadhead ;
Mounds in Franklin County, Indiana, by Edgar R. Quick ; Mounds and
earthworks of Rush County, Indiana, by F. Jackman; Primitive man-
ufacture of spear and arrow points along the line of the Savannah
River, by Charles C. Jones, jr.; Mica beds in Alabama, by William
Gesner; Mounds in Washington County, Mississippi, by James Hough;
Mounds in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, by Benjamin H. Brodnax;
Wampum belts of the Six Nations, by W. M. Beauchamp ; Indian relics
from Schoharie, N. Y., by Frank D. Andrews; Preliminary Explorations
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

among Indian mounds in Southern Florida, by 8S. T. Walker; Report on
the shell-heaps of Tampa Bay, Florida, by 8S. T. Walker; and Mounds on
Gideon’s farm, near Excelsior, Hennepin County, Minnesota, by Frank
H. Nutter.

The whole forms a volume of 631 pages, with 205 illustrations.

Of the documents published annually by the United States Govern-
ment, those of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian
Institution are most in demand, as furnishing general information,
much sought after by various classes of the community. There is no
person of general literary or scientific taste who does not find in the
Smithsonian Reports something of interest, especially in the copious
store of archeological information and the statements of the present
condition and progress of science. The demand for the Smithsonian
Reports has been responded to by the publication of quite large editions
and the occasional reprints from the authorized stereotype plates. It
has been found, however, impossible of late years to meet the demands
in the increasing amount of interest manifested by the growing popula-
tion of the United States ; and although a liberal edition is published by
Congress, of which about 6,500 have been assigned to the Institution
for years, copies of the Report for 1877 are entirely exhausted.

Fully realizing this fact, Senator Hamlin, a Regent of the Institution,
introduced a resolution providing for the increase of the printing of the
number of copies to 15,500, of which 7,000 were to be distributed to
the Institution. This resolution became a law, and it is hoped that
the demand for the volume for 1879 now about being delivered by the
Public Printer will be met.

The series of the stereotype plates of the volumes begins with 1862,
and it is proposed to make application to Congress for the printing of a
small edition of the volumes extending from that year to 1878, inclu-
sive, so that sets can be furnished to the many new public libraries
which have made their appearance wlthin the last few years.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The reasons for asking Congress for a museum building of suitable
magnitude, and the steps by which this end was accomplished, have been
duly presented in the preceding reports. I am happy to announce at
the present time that the edifice has been substantially completed, and
that preparations are being made to oecupy it. In the accompanying
report of the architect of the building commission all the necessary de-
tails of the plan, cost, &c., will be found.

The magnitude of the edifice, and the complexity of the organization
necessary to fully occupy it, it is expected will require a considerable
time, but it is hoped that the work will be complete by the end of the
year 1881, and that the establishment will thereafter be in full tide of
SucCeSS.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

As has already been explained, the new museum is not intended
simply for the exhibition of objects of natural history, the controlling
idea being rather that of an ethnological exhibit, especially to include
illustrations of the applications of objects belonging to the animal, veg-
etable, and mineral kingdoms, and the requirements or luxuries of man.
To this end the collections made by the Smithsonian Institution and the
United States Fish Commission, for exhibition at the Centennial Expo-
sition of 1876, and the Berlin International Fishery Exposition of 1880,
come admirably into play, and constitute the basis of the material, which,
however, has been largely increased from other sources.

It is proposed to devote one-fourth of the space, about 25,000 square
feet, to an illustration of the mineral resources, in the form of building
stones, ores, combustibles, clays, pigments, ce.

Another fourth of the building will be taken up by illustrations of
the animal industries, with representatives of the originals, or plaster
or papier-mache casts, of the principal animals used for food or other
purposes by man, together with all the various apparatus by which
they are pursued, captured, and utilized ; then the results of the manip-
ulation, and also illustrations of the methods by which animals are pro-
tected or multiplied; this confining itself principally to an exhibition in
connection with the artificial propagation of fishes and other aquatic
animals.

A portion of the building will be filled by the display of other special
objects, including the materia medica, foods, paints, and dyes of all
nations.

In the purely ethnological collections, or such as relate to the savage
or semi-civilized races of modern times, space will be provided for in
this building, and a small area assigned to the exhibition of mounted
mammals and osteological specimens. Fuller details of arrangement
will be reserved for the next report.

The expansion of the scope of the National Museum of course in-
volves an enlarged foree, and the engagement of several specialists to
take charge of their respective departments. This has been deferred
until 1881.

In view of the large number of cases required in this building—not
less than one thousand in all—the selection of suitable plans and modes
of construction has been a matter of great importance, and we have
accordingly endeavored to obtain all possible information as to methods
of arrangement in foreign and home museums. Professor Agassiz has
kindly supplied working drawings of the newer cases of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology; and the authorities of South Kensington and
the new British Museum, as well as those of the Royal Museum of
Dresden, and other establishments, have rendered similar facilities.
Mr. G. Brown Goode, the curator of the museum, during the period of
his action as commissioner to the Berlin International Fishery Exposi-
tion, took occasion to visit all the principal museums in Germany, Italy,
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and Great Britain, and made himself familiar with the arrangements
prevalent therein. The result has been to supply many important ideas,
which will be carried out in connection with the new National Museum
at Washington.

In the necessary reorganization of the whole force of the museum, in
connection with the new departure, occasion was taken to reiterate and
enforce the rule which is adopted in most public museums through-
out the world, namely, that the officers connected with the museum
shall make no collections of any kind whatever for themselves
during the period of their connection with it. Although in most
cases a mere matter of form, it has been thought well to make such
a rule a condition of acceptance of a position and salary, as thereby
preventing any misunderstanding and removing any danger of making
an Ofiicial position the means of promoting private interest. Persons
in charge of a collection have many opportunities of securing speci-
mens from visitors, who offer objects of more or less interest, and who
are sometimes inclined to give them to the officer rather than to the
collection.

Increase of the Museum.—The additions to the National Museum dur-
ing the year 1880 have been fully up to the average, indeed scarcely
inferior to those of any previous year, with the exception of that of the
Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The collections of marine
animals, especially fishes and invertebrates from the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts of the United States, far exceed in value and extent those ever
before obtained. The most important sources of supply have been (1)
the collections of the United States Fish Commission, made on the
south coast of New England, and of the Gloucester fishermen, obtained
for the most part off the eastern banks, and transmitted through the
commission; (2) the collections made by Profs. D. S. Jordan and Charles
H. Gilbert, of fishes and invetebrates, between San Diego and Puget
Sounds; (3) the collections of Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. William H. Dall
in Alaskan waters of the North Pacific and in the Arctic Ocean; (4)
collections of marine animals made by Dr. White, Surgeon of the United
States revenue steamer Corwin, and by Captain Hooper commanding ;
(5) the general ethnological and zoological collections of Mr. E. H.
Nelson, of the United States Signal Service; (6) collection of archzo-
logical objects made by Mr. James Stevenson, assisted by Mr. F. G. Gal-
braith. While, however, these are the most noteworthy there are many
others of great interest that will be referred to hereafter. The catalogue
of donations accompanying the report will give fuller details on this
subject, bearing in mind that no small number of contributions have
been received without indications of their origin, so that it becomes impos-
sible to make the proper acknowledgments to their contributors.

The regions covered by these contributions relate almost exclusively
to North America, a few collections only coming from Mexico or the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

West Indies; and a still smaller number from the rest of the world. A
number of very important series of fishes was obtained by Mr. Goode at
the Berlin Fishery Exposition, but as they have not been unpacked and
arranged, reference to them will be deferred until the next report.

Alaska, as the least known portion of North America, and the one pre-
senting the most numerous problems of interest, received special atten-
tion during the year, and the amount of material gained has been pro-
portionally great.

Mr. E. W. Nelson, observer of the signal office at Saint Michaels, has
continued his most important transmissions covering all branches of
scientific iuquiry; among these the most specially noteworthy is the
collection of ethnological materials, illustrating the manners and customs
of the living Esquimaux of the region, as well as much of prehistoric
antiquity. Mr. Nelson has already sent in about 6,000 pieces of anthro-
pological matter. His collections of mammals, birds, &e., have been
of very great importance.

Under orders from Captain Patterson, of the Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey, Mr. Dall, assistant of the Coast Survey, made a second visit to the

Alaskan seas in the schooner Yukon, originally built under his direction
for the service. By permission of Captain Patterson, seconded by the
invitation of Mr. Dall, Dr. T. H. Bean was detailed to accompany the
expedition for the purpose of investigating especially the fish and fish
eries of the northern waters.

The vessel left San Francisco in April, 1880, and touching at various
points passed into the Arctic Ocean, where quite an extended cruise
was prosecuted in the interest of the survey. It returned to San Fran-
cisco in November, 1880, and the collections of specimens, in forty-five
packages, were received not long after in Washington. These embrace
very large numbers of ethnological and archeological objects, speci-
mens. of birds, fishes, invertebrates, and other articles of great interest,
to some of which further reference will be made.

No collections were received this year from Mr. Lucien Turner, super-
intendent of the volunteer stations of the Signal Service of the Aleu-
tian Islands. Large gatherings, however, have been made by him
which will be due during the year 1881.

Mr. James G. Swan, of Neah Bay, Puget Sound, has continued his
valuable contributions to the National Museum, which have now ex-
tended over a period of many years. Being especially interested in
ethnology, specimens belonging to that branch were particularly at-
tended to, while many fishes also have been forwarded.

Commander L. A. Beardslee, of the Jamestown, stationed at Sitka,
Alaska, has also made many contributions of birds and ethnological
objects.

A most important and extended exploration of the Pacific coast was
that conducted by Prof. D. S. Jordan, assisted by Charles H. Gilbert.
Professor Jordan was detailed by Mr. Goode, in charge of the fishery
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

branch of the census of 1880, to obtain all the procurable information
in regard to fishery of the western coast; and leaving Washington in
December, 1879, after spending some time in San Francisco he proceeded
to San Diego and thence by successive stages to Puget Sound, his work
there overlapping and uniting with that of Mr. Swan. In this work he
embraced the opportunity of making extensive collections of alcoholic
specimens, of which no less than 65 large cans were transmitted. These
contain about 260 species of fishes, a number of them new to science,
and for the most part in sufficient numbers to supply many institutions
with duplicates, and to transmit desirable exchanges abroad.

The revenue steamer Corwin, on her usual cruise in the seas of Northern
Alaska, during 1879, was accompanied by Dr. R. White, of the Marine
Hospital Service, and a trained, ardent naturalist. Many important col-
lections were made by Dr. White, especially of seals, including many
foetuses, birds, and fishes. His specimens were received in the early
part of the year, and submitted for examination to various experts. I
regret extremely to have to report the untimely death of Dr. White,
partly from exposure in the service. In a second cruise of the Corwin
in the North Pacific and Arctic Ocean, in 1880, Captain Hooper made
another collection of great interest, including a series of fossil bones from
Kotzebue Sound.

Mr. Belding, of Stockton, Cal., has furnished some interesting objects
from the interior of the State. The most important contributions, how-
ever, from the inland portion of the Pacific region have been those
supplied by Capt. Charles Bendire, of the First United States Cavalry,
an officer the value of whose services in the development of a knowledge
of the natural history of the West can scarcely be overestimated. For
many years, while stationed at military posts, he has been occupied in
securing eggs, nests, and birds, and other objects, and placing the infor-
mation and material thus gained in the hands of correspondents and
scientific specialists throughout the country. This service to science has
not involved any interference with his duties as an officer, his military
record being a brilliant one. Some months of the year 1880 were occu-
pied by Captain Bendire in the investigations of certain vexed questions
connected with the salmonidz of Oregon and Washington Territory.
Leaving with a small party of men he visited numerous localities and
brought in a series of fishes, which, when fully examined, will enable us
to solve many problems in regard to them. Many other specimens, as
birds, &c., were obtained by Captain Bendire and transmitted to Wash-
ington.

Arizona has been represented by collections of living reptiles, fur-
nished by Dr. Corson and Dr. Moran, of the United States Army, as
also by a series of plants from Colonel Burr.

The contributions from New Mexico have been extremely important,
consisting, first, of a series, in 1879, of specimens gathered by Mr. James
Stevenson, with the assistance of Mr. Frank H. Cushing; and, secondly,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

of a series gathered by Mr. Stevenson in 1880, assisted by Mr. Galbraith.
These explorations were under the immediate direction of Maj. J. W.
Powell, in charge of the Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology ; their special
object being the acquisition of a complete series of objects illustrating
the manners and customs of the pueblo towns of New Mexico and Ari-
zona. The investigation was carried from village to village, and about
one-half of the articles have been thoroughly worked up. The collection
embraces an immense quantity of pottery, of stone implements, dresses, or-
naments, &c. Mr. Hillers, a competent photographer, accompanied both
expeditions and obtained a large number of photographs, as also the
measurements of various Indian towns, both occupied and abandoned,
to serve as materials for a series of models. . :

Dr. J. C. Merrill, of the United States Army, has sent in a valuable
general collection from Fort Shaw and Montana.

Mr. Charles Rusby has also sent in some rare mammals from Wyoming
Territory.

The collections from Florida have been very extensive and valuable-
These consist, in part, of large numbers of fishes, furnished by Mr. Silas
Stearns, of Pensacola, while in the employ of the fishery branch of the
United States census and subsequently; and Mr. S. T. Walker, who, in
addition to fishes and reptiles, has sent large numbers of objects obtained
from the Indian mounds. From Mr. James Bell, of Gainesville, have
also been received valuable collection of ethnological objects and of liv-
ing reptiles, including many specimens of serpents of unusual size, which
have served to swell the series of plaster casts exhibited in the National
Museum. :

The Atlantic coast of Florida and other Southern States is well repre-

sented by collections of fishes by Mr. R. E. Earll and Prof. M. MeDon-
ald, of the fishery census department. From, or through, Mr. ©. C. Les-
lie, an extensive and well-known fish dealer of Charleston, have alSo
been received many rare and some undescribed species of fishes.
_ The operations of the United States Fish Commission have furnished
a large number of objects from the middle coast of the United States,
especially from the line of the Gulf Stream south of New England,
Further reference to this will be made under the special head of the
Operations of the United States Fish Commission. The receipts through
- the Commission include, also, large numbers of specimens obtained by
the Gloucester fishing fleet, and which is furnished in an alphabetical
record of the donors.

The ornithology of the peninsula of Virginia in the vicinity of Cobb’s
Island has been well investigated by Mr. Robert Ridgway, Mr. Henry
Marshall, and Mr. P. Jouy, all connected with the National Museum.
Many interesting birds, with their eggs, and of the young in downy
plumage, were secured in good condition for mounting.

On the western coast of Mexico, and especially in the Gulf of Cali-
fornia, Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, after completing his census work on the

S. Mis. 31——4 :
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

California coast, made large collections of fishes for the National
Museum. Not much else has been received from Mexico beyond some
contributions from its National Museum, through the director, Mr. G.
Mendosa, and some interesting objects from Prof. A. Dugés, of Guan-
axuato.

Previous reports have contained an account of the important services
of Mr. F. A. Ober in his natural history explorations in the West Indies.
This gentleman has renewed his work in that region in visiting a num-
ber of islands previously unexplored by him, and in sending the material
results to the Institution. The National Museum now, by his assistance,
contains by far the most complete collections of the birds of the West
Indies in existence.

Dr. H. H. Nicholls, of Dominica, W. I., has also made some valuable
contributions, including a large and undescribed species of parrot, named
by Mr. Lawrence Chrysotis nichollsti. The collections from Dr. Nicholls
include, also, some very interesting fishes, &c. From Mr. L. Guesde
has been received a series of excellently painted illustrations of Carib
antiquities in his possession, or accessible to him on the island. These
it is proposed to reproduce in a memoir to be published by the Institu-
tion.

Mr. Edward Newton, colonial secretary of Jamaica, has favored the
Institution with several specimens of living boas, to be reproduced in
plaster. Professor Poey, the eminent naturalist of Havana, has also
sent living reptiles, together with a number of fishes,—types of his elab-
orate papers.

South America is mainly represented by the contributions of Mr.
Figyelmesy, United States consul at Demarara. This collection con-
sists of ethnological objects, including a large boat, such as is used by
the natives.

As already stated, the collections from Europe have been principally
series of fishes obtained for the most part by Mr. Goode at the Fishery
Exposition in Berlin, and furnished in exchange for series of fishes, &c.,
carried from Washington for the purpose.

Some desirable specimens of native handiwork from Western Africa
have been forwarded by Mr. Smythe, the United States minister at
Liberia.

Having thus given a brief sketch of the principal regions illustrated
by the collections transmitted during the year 1880 to the National
Museum, a reference to the objects themselves in their systematic order
may not be amiss.

Mention has already been made of a large number of general collec-
tions from different localities; that is to say, transmissions embracing
more than one particular group of objects. The most important of these
were received from Alaska, Florida, and New Mexico, although many of
more or less importance came from other regions. In later years the col-
lections most attractive to visitors in a public museum have been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

those illustrating the character and mode of life of the various portions
of the human race, more especially of those whose existence on the
globe dates back to a greater or less period in the remote past; and
it is in this direction that the National Museum may claim a special
importance so far as North America is concerned. With the exception of
fishes, the larger number of objects received relate to archeology and
ethnology. A prominent collection of this character is that transmitted
by Mr. E. W. Nelson from Saint Michaels. This embraces illustrations
of the handiwork of the Esquimaux of a large portion of Northwestern
Alaska, gathered in the journeys made by Mr. Nelson under great risks
and privations. They include objects of special interest in the way of
modern carvings of bone and stone, as well as many purely prehistoric
articles obtained from old Esquimaux settlements, long since aban-
doned. Mr. Nelson’s return is expected in a year or two, and he will
then devote himself especially to the preparation of a series of elaborate
reports on these and other researches.

Searcely inferior in interest and value are the ethnological collections
made by Dr. T. H. Bean and Mr. William H. Dall, on the voyage of the
United States schooner Yukon, to which reference has been made in
previous pages. These were gathered at points of the cruise of the
vessel on her journey from Sitka and various pn places of the
North Pacific and the Arctic Oceans.

Captain Beardslee, of the Navy, has also furnished some valuable
additions to the Alaskan series.

The collections made, under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, by
Mr. James Stevenson, wiéh the assistance, first, of Mr. Frank H. ash:
ing, and, second, by Mr. Galbraith, coneataie: enormous additions of
material to the National Museum, illustrating the character of the pueblo
tribes of New Mexico. They embrace many thousands of SES GUNE DS of
pottery, dresses, ornaments, weapons, We.

For further information in regard to the smaller collections in anthro-
- pology, reference may be made to the alphabetical index of donors. Of
special note, however, among these, are some objects of stone collected
by Judge Henderson from the Naples mound in Illinois.

From Don Ignacio Galendo, of Monterey, was received an ancient
mummy from a cave in Coahuila. A stone image from Mr. Latimer, of
Porto Rico, constitutes an important addition to the collection of Porto
Rican antiquities bequeathed to the Smithsonian some years ago by Mr.
George Latimer, his uncle.

Mr. Figyelmesy, of Demarara, has sent some interesting objects, con-
sisting of an Indian boat, some Indian pottery, &e.

Of mammals, the most important contribution is that of a large series
of fossil bones (including some reptiles) from Capt. E. Crawford, U.S.
A. These, at his request, have been placed at the command of Pro-
fessor Marsh for investigation.

A fine skull of the fossil beaver (Castoroides) was obtained by ex-
change from Professor Kost, of Adrian College.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An extremely important addition to the collection of North American
mammals is that of two good, mountable skins of the Histriophoca
equestris, or parti-colored seal of the North Pacific, of which only a
tanned skin had been previously in possession of the Museum. These
were obtained through the instrumentality of Mr. Dall.

Dr. White, of the Revenue Marine, obtained many specimens of fur
4eals, including several embryos in alcohol. The Alaska Commercial
Company also supplied a similar collection. Judge Caton, of Llinois,
so well known for his great work on the ruminating animals of North
America, has furnished a specimen of Hydropotes inermis, a small horn-
less deer belonging to China.

Captain Howgate has presented two full-blooded Esquimaux dogs,
which have been sent to the Zoological Garden in Philadelphia for safe
keeping. From the garden itself has been oltained a series of skele-
tons of monkeys that had died in the garden. An embryo porpoise
from Mr. E. E. Small, of Provincetown, is also highly valued.

Of birds, many collections have been received, the most important
being the Alaskan series from Mr. Nelson, Dr. Bean, and Captain
Beardslee. Captain Bendire has furnished some much-appreciated
skins from Washington Territory; and a series of the birds of Cali-
fornia, from Mr. L. Belding, of Stockton, has filled some important gaps
im the collections.

During the summer Mr. Ridgway, curator of ornithology in the Insti-
tution, accompanied by Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist, and followed
subsequently by Mr. P. Jouy, an assistant in the Museum, visited Cobb’s
Fsland on the peninsula of Eastern Virginia, and obtained a series of
adults and young of a number of water birds from the remarkable breed-
ing grounds of that island.

A few specimens of Barrow’s Golden eyed duck, in the flesh, were
furnished by Mr. G. A. Boardman.

The barnacle goose (Lernicla leucopsis), presented by Mr. J. J. Kendall,
of New York, is the first specimen of that species obtained by the
Museum from a locality within the limits of the United States, although
a skin was received several years ago from Hudson’s Bay.

A finely-mounted specimen of the trumpeter swan, killed in Wiscon-
sin, was furnished by Prof. T. Kumlien, and a mounted sand hill crane
by Mr. Prouty.

The accessions of birds from Mexico and Central America were
fewer than usual, although some interesting Mexican specimens were
furnished by Professor Dugés.

An important addition to the West Indian collections was made by
Dr. Nicholls, of Dominica, in the form of a new and large species of
parrot. This, as previously stated, has been described by Mr. Law-
rence as Chrysotis nichollsiti. Mr. Ober, in a renewed visit to the West
Indies, also added ‘considerably to his former gatherings from islands
previously unvisited by him. The first series of his collections was
obtained by the Institution and placed in the National Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

The additions of reptiles, although not very extensive, have been very
important, especially in the way of living specimens to serve as models
for a series of plaster casts. Among these were living Gila monsters
(Heloderma suspectum), from Dr. Corson and Dr. Moran, of the United
States Army, together with some turtles and lizards.

A living leather back turtle was sent from York River, Chesapeake
Bay, by Mr. J. Henderson. Mr. Bell, of Gainesville, Fla., transmitted
a magnificent series of most of the serpents of that State; among them
a banded rattlesnake, nearly seven feet in length. These have been for
the most part cast inplaster. Some of them were supplied to Dr. Mason,
of Newport, for examination and to serve as material for microscopical
investigations of the tissue of the brain and spinal marrow.

Living boas were furnished by Mr. Edward Newton, of Jamaica, and
Professor Poey, of Havana, the latter gentleman sending also some
living species of lizards and snakes.

Fishes.—As might be imagined from the activity manifested during
the year by the United States Fish Commission, and the fish census of
1880, the collection of fishes has received great additions, no previous
year in the history of the National Museum comparing with it in this
respect. The most important contributiens in this department consisted
of the collections by Prof. D. S. Jordan and Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, of
the fishery census. These gentlemen devoted a number of months dur-
ing the year to the systematic investigation of the food-fishes of the
western coast of the United States, and traversed the whole region from
San Diego to Puget Sound in their researches. The results filled 65
large tin cans, of 4 to 6 cubic feet each. About 260 species in all were

‘obtained, many of them new to science. Seventy duplicate sets of
Specimens were secured for distribution to the principal museums, at
home and abroad, and will be promptly transmitted to their respective
destinations.

Mr. Gilbert, after completing his work on the California coast, started
on his homeward journey by way of the Isthmus of Panama, and has
already made very large collections in the Gulf of California.

Mr. James G. Swan, of Neah Bay, Puget Sound, also obtained and
transmitted many specimens of fishes of that*locality. The American
waters farther to the north were thoroughly explored in the interest of
ichthyology by Dr. T. H. Bean. The results amounted to between 80
and 100 species, some of them new to science, and others, long lost spe-
cies, of Pallas, We.

Captain Hooper, of the revenue cutter Corwin, also transmitted some
valuable collections from the Arctic Ocean, among them a species of
Coregonus from Point Barrow.

Commander Beardslee, of the sloop of war Jamestown stationed at
Sitka, secured a number of desirable species. One of the most interest-
ing collections of the year was that made by Captain Bendire in the
interior waters of Washington Territory, in the course of a journey
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

instituted by him, with the permission of the War Department, for the
purpose of solving certain problems connected with the fishes of the
Columbia River and other waters, and especially the red fish of the
Wallowa Lake. His collections are now in the Museum, and will be
duly reported upon at the proper time.

A number of collections of fresh-water fishes from the interior of the
continent, especially from Utah, were furnished by Mr. G. K. Gilbert,
&e. A collection of Mississippi Valley fishes, from Prof. O. P. Hay, is
also highly prized.

The fishes of the Gulf of Mexico were furnished in large numbers dur-
ing the year by Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola, and Mr. 8. T. Walker,
many of them undescribed species.

The South Atlantic coast is represented by some very valuable speci-
mens obtained by Mr. C. C. Leslie, a fish-dealer of Charleston, who has
previously placed the Institution under many similar obligations. He
was also instrumental in securing a number of collections made from the
outer islands or banks of the southern coast.

Mr. hk. E. Earll and Col. M. McDonald, of the fishery census, have
also made and transmitted many extremely interesting collections, all
tending very greatly to complete the east coast species.

The first specimens of the eagle ray, sometimes called the devil fish,
obtained by the Institution were furnished by Lieutenant Sweitzer, U.

S.A. This species sometimes obtains an enormous magnitude, reach-
ing 20 or even 25 feet across the fins.

As a regular contributor, Mr. E. G. Blackford, of Fulton Market, New
York, has continued to furnish some very desirable species, his vigilance
being constantly exercised to obtain whatever he thinks is new, and to
forward it to the Institution.

The collections made by the United States Fish Commission, in its coast
explorations during the year, have been of unusual value, no less than
20 undescribed species of deep-sea fish having been taken during the
summer, with others not previously obtained, but already known.

As usual a large number of rare,tand some new, species were obtained
from the members of the Gloucester fishing fleet, through the instru-
mentality of Mr. A. Howard Clark, of the Fish Commission, stationed
at Gloucester. The most noteworthy additions to the Museum resulted
from the work by the Fish Hack, on the edge of the Gulf Stream, where
four day’s work furnished 20 new fishes and over 150 species of mol-
lusks, of which about 40 were new to science. Other invertebrates of
interest were supplied by the Gloucester fishermen, and a number: of
desirable species were obtained by Professor Jordan, Mr. Swan, Captain
Beardslee, and Messrs. Bean and Dall from the Pacific coast.

Among interesting illustrations of the progress and results of the fish-
cultural operations of the country received during the year have been
several species of salmonide, sent in by Mr. Stone from the McCloud
River. Mr. N. K. Fairbanks has furnished a specimen of California
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

salmon, caught in Geneva Lake during the summer, weighing about 10
pounds, this being undoubtedly one of the young fish introduced into
that lake some years before, hatched from eggs supplied by the United
States Fish Commission from the McCloud River establishment.

Another important specimen was that of a carp, from Mr. G. B. Mob-
ley, of Texas. This fish was one of a sending into Texas by the United
States Fish Commission in April, 1880, at which time it was about 4
inches long and probably weighed but little over an ounce. Hight
months after it was brought back from Texas to Washington, measur-
ing 21 inches and weighing more than four pounds! a very remarkable
illustration of the rapidity of the growth of this fish in America.

The acquisition, through the instrumentality of Mr. E. W. Dennison,
of Boston, of a large brook trout was also a subject of interest, this fish
weighing more than 11 pounds and being one of the largest of the kind
ever taken within the limits of the United States.

Of exotic fishes the most important are several series of European
Species, obtained by Mr. Goode at Berlin and from his colleagues at the
International Fishery Exhibition.

Reference to these will be found on another page.

A collection of fishes made some years since at Beyrout, in Syria, by
Dr. Kidder, of the Navy, was received last year, in good condition.
Professor Poey has continued his contributions of type species from the
Cuban waters.

A valuable miscellaneous series of fishes was supplied by the Museum
of Comparative Zoology of Cambridge, embracing species from both
North and South America.

Mr. Vinal Edwards, of Wood’s Holl, an agent of the United States
Fish Commission, has also continued his services in the constant watch
for rare stragglers.

In the preparation of the exhibit by the United States at the Inter-
national Fishery Exhibit at Beriin in 1880, invitations were sent to many
firms for contributions of specimens. These were quite readily complied
with. Purchases were made from other parties who declined to contrib-
ute, and who consequently lost the opportunity of competition. A
special catalogue will be furnished of this series. The collections, for
the most part, have been brought back to Washington, to form part of
the exhibit of fishery products in the new National Museum.

Shells —One of the most important additions to the collections of the
National Museum during the year has resulted from the presentation by
Mr. W.G. Binney of his entire collection of American Land Shells. The
history of this division of the mollusca, so far as North America is con-
cerned, is closely connected with the name, Mr. Amos Binney, father of
William G. Binney, having devoted especial attention to the air-breath-
ing land shells, and published a very elaborate and costly work on the
subject. The son took up the same group with the material left by Dr.
Binney, and has devoted many years of an active and laborious scien-
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tific career to it. In the collection received from Mr. William G. Binney
are to be found the types of both these series of researches, furnishing
a collection scarcely equalled, certainly not surpassed, by that of any
other museum in the country.

The possession by a public museum of such a type collecean as .
Mr. Binney’s is always considered a matter of very great importance,
especially as the objects are thereby more assured of continued preser-
vation and ready accessibility to students. It is to be hoped that ad-
ditional donations of the same character may be made from time to
time, as no better depository can be found in any other establishment.

Plants.—As the Department of Agriculture has the special charge of
the investigations relating to the vegetable kingdom, and is supposed to
take the necessary steps towards securing representations in its her-
barium, no special effort is made by the Smithsonian Institution to invite
or secure contributions, although whatever is received is immediately
transferred to that establishment. The only accession of importance
during the year is that of a series of plants of Japan, contributed by the
Mombusho or educational department of Tokio.

Fossils —Of fossil remains large collections of invertebrates have been
deposited by Capt. Geo. M. Wheeler, and others have been presented
by Mr. B. H. Lyon and other paleontologists. ;

Minerals.—Many valuable mineral collections have been received from
various sources, for the most part illustrating economical geology rather
than geology proper. The largest collection has been that of eight boxes
collected by Mr. Thomas Donaldson. Mr. Anthony Pirz has furnished
two magnificent stalactites from the Adelsberg cave in Carniola.

Paintings.— Among the collections which will form part of the objects
in the National Museum, a very interesting and instructive exhibit will
consist of the Indian portraits and scenes painted by the late George
Catlin. These pictures, all from living subjects and of great merit as
faithful portraitures of aboriginal life and manners, were presented
to the Institution in 1879, by Mrs. Harrison, of Philadelphia, but
the paintings have necessarily been stored since their receipt, await-
ing the completion of the new Museum. They had also been stored in
ware-rooms in Philadelphia for many years, so that to preserve and
present them in a suitable manner with frames, &c., will require con-
siderable expenditure.

Miscellanea.—The institution is under many obligations to General
Meigs for the presentation of medallion likenesses in plaster, of the size
of life, of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, W. F. Seward, and Sal-
mon P. Chase, which were prepared for use in the extension of the
U. S. Capitol building. As works of art, as well as likenesses of
eminent citizens, they are regarded as of much value and will be care-
fully preserved in the historical and art department of the National
Museum.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5T

Work done in the Museum.—As in previous years, the time of the sev-
eral curators of the Museum and of their assistants has been, toa great
degree, occupied in receiving the collections coming from various sources,
doing to them what is necessary for their permanent preservation, en-
tering them in the record-books, properly labelling them, and then plac-
ing them in their appropriate receptacles.

The magnitude of this labor may be easily understood from what has
been said of the increase of the Museum during the year, no single
establishment in the United States, nor, perhaps, in the world, being in
receipt of so great a number of objects requiring such treatment. In
most establishments where a large amount of material is received
from time to time, this comes, for the most part, by purchase or dona-
tion, the several collections having already passed under the hands of
the taxidermist or specialist, so that all that remains is to properly place

e matter in a position for permanent preservation. The aggressive
campaign, carried on directly or indirectly by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in unoccupied fields of research, involves a greater amount of labor
in treating the spoils of conquest. A statement of the general circum-
stances attendant upon the transmission of a miscellaneous collection of
specimens. may perhaps serve as an illustration of what is here stated.
Thus, an explorer in the field announces that he bas transmitted a cer-
tain collection from a given locality to the Institution. An entry is
made of the fact in what is called the announcement book, which is
ruled in columns to show successively the date of announcement, the
name of the sender, his address, the point from which the sending is
made, the general nature of the transmission, the agent to or through
whom forwarded, and the mode of conveyance. There are then left
two blank columns, one indicating the date of the arrival, the other the
freight and other charges, which are filled up at the proper time. When
the package arrives the date is entered in the announcement book, and
an entry made in another volume (the transportation record). The col-
lection or object is then recorded in still another volume (accessions to
the Museum), and has affixed to it a‘ donation” number. Should there
be any letter or memorandum accompanying the parcel or consignment,
with fuller details than simply the locality and sender, it is transmitted
with the package to the general curator, under whose direction the
latter is opened and the contents assorted. Mammals, birds, reptiles,
&¢., are assigned respectively to the various curators, whose business it
is, if possible without delay of a single day, to enter the specimens
in the respective Museum registers, and to affix a number, as inefface-
able as possible, corresponding to the entry in what is called the Muse-
um Register. |

At this stage it is not necessary that the specimen be accurately
identified and named, as it is supposed that this can at any time be
done by the specialist. Care, however, is exercised to make an entry

‘ of the donor, locality, date, and other facts of the history of the object
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

that a simple inspection or study will not furnish. After this the various
articles are placed where they properly belong. Some, however, require
further treatment by the taxidermist or otherwise.

Should the specimens belong to the ethnological series, and be com-
posed of animal substances, as of woolen material, fur, &c., they are care-
fully treated with a solution of corrosive sublimate in alcohol, so as to pre-
vent danger from insects, and finally placed in the cases where they be-
long, or packed away until they can be properly considered. Of course,
collections well dried, shells, minerals, fossils, &c., require little treat-
ment preliminary to their final disposition.

This Museum work, as already stated, occupies the greater part of the
time of the assistants, although most of them find the occasion and the
leisure to prepare critical monographs in regard to certain species, which
are then, for the most part, published in the Proceedings of the Natiogal
Museum.

The total number of entries in the record books of the Museum dur-
ing the year, as shown by the detailed list appended; embraces 14,586
numbers, averaging probably four or five distinct objects to each entry.
Where a number of articles of the same general character, from the
same locality, are received from the same donor at the same time, the
same number may be affixed to all of them, as in the case of a collection
of shells, of fossils, of stone implements, &c. The total number of en-
tries and dates amounts to over a quarter of a million (actually, 281,511),
and fill over 60 large folio ledgers.

Among the more special investigations conducted by the naturalists
of the Institution, upon which papers have been prepared, are those on
archeology, by Dr. Charles Rau; on fishes, by Mr. G. B. Goode, and Dr.
T. H. Bean; on the birds, by Mr. Robert Ridgway; on the fossils, by
Dr. C. A. White. Dr. F. M. Endlich, before leaving for the West Indies,
and subsequently Dr. F. W. Taylor, made numerous examinations as
well as analyses of minerals.

Among investigations by nitabounde not directly connected with the
Institution have been, those of crustacea, by Profs. 8. J. Smith, Oscar
Harger, and E. B. Wilson, of Yale Collages of mollusks, by Professor
VerriJl and Mr. Sanderson Smith, of New York; of radiates and worms,
by Professor Verrill; of reptiles, by Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia ;
of fishes, by Mr. 8. E. Garman, of Cambridge; of birds, by Mr. George
N. Lawrence, of New York, Dr. Elliot Coues, and Mr. Henshaw; of
mammals, by J. A. Allen, of Cambridge, and Dr. Coues.

The more important investigation in the marine invertebrates, how-
ever, has been made directly by Prof. A. E. Verrill, of Yale College, or
under his supervision. The insects have been transmitted to Prof. C.
V. Riley and Professor Comstock, of the Department of Agriculture;
the plants have been referred to the Department of Agriculture or to
Prof. Asa Gray, of Cambridge.

Work done on collections.—For a number of years past the Smithsonian
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

Institution has been in receipt of soundings taken by vessels of the
United States Navy in various parts of the world, and they have been
held in the hope of being able to make some definite arrangement for
disposing of them. As, however, there were no funds of the Smithson-
ian Institution or of the Navy for meeting the cost of investigating
them and publishing the results, with the necessary illustrations, nothing
was done beyond placing them in charge of Prof. Hamilton L. Smith, of
Geneva, N. Y., one of our best-known microscopists, and particularly
interested in the class of objects referred to.

During the explorations of the Challenger particular attention was
paid to the collecting of samples of the sea bottom, and on her return
to England this branch of research was placed in charge of Mr. J. Mur-
ray, and at the request of this gentleman, indorsed by Professor Smith,
the material in hand was sent to him to be elaborated in the prepara-
tion of the systematic work covering the entire field. This was with the
stipulation that a special report should be prepared upon the material
collected by the vessels of the Navy, to be published, if so desired, by
the Navy Department.

A very desirable arrangement has been made during the year by the
Institution in regard to the large collection of fossil plants brought in to
the National Museum by the explorations of Dr. Hayden, Major Powell,
Lieutenant Wheeler, &c., Prof. L. Lesquereux, of Columbus, Ohio,
having agreed to receive the collection in mass, to pick out a reserve
series for the Museum, and to bring all the duplicates of each species in
separate packages, so that sets can be readily made up for distribution
to the educational establishments and museums of the United States.

The material sent to Professor Lesquereux filled many boxes, and a
portion of the reserve has already been returned to the Institution,
although not yet unpacked for want of a place for its exhibition. The
work will be completed with the publication of a report as soon as cer-
tain memoirs, now in press, are published, and it becomes possible
to state the page and plate where each type specimen is illustrated.

A part of the agreement with Professor Lesquereux is for the prepa-
ration of a complete check-list of the fossil plants of America, to include
Greenland and Alaska, to be used in connection with the proposed dis-
tribution of definite specimens and for the final arrangement of the
reserve series.

Dr. C. A. White has been engaged upon the examination, classifica-
tion, and registering of the paleontological collections, embracing those
which have for many years been in the possession of the Museum, as
well as those which have been more recently received, preparatory to
their final arrangement in the new building. This work of investigation
has embraced a more or less complete study of those forms which have
been found to be new to science or otherwise of especial interest, and ©
their publication and illustration in the Proceedings of the National
_ Museum; and also, incidentally, the separation and labeling of the dupli-
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cate specimens for exchange. All the invertebrate fossils at present in
the possession of the Museum have thus passed under a preliminary |
examination by Dr. White.

Among the results of the investigation of the invertebrate fossils may
be mentioned the recognition of Productus giganteus Martin, in a collec-
tion obtained by the United States Fish Commission at McCloud River,
Cal., which species was not previously known to occur in American strata;
the recognition of Stricklandinia salteri and S. davidsoni Billings, among
some Upper Silurian fossils brought from Northern Georgia by Lieut.
A. W. Vodges, which two species had hitherto been found only in the
island of Anticosti.

As already stated, the fossil plants have been referred to Prof. Leo
Lesquereux for classification, which work is now in progress and in
large part completed, the specimens as fast as they were labeled having
been returned to the Museum. The greater part of the vertebrate fos-
sils have not yet been investigated, but a considerable number of boxes
received from Capt. G. M. Wheeler contain the types of vertebrate forms
which were described and figured by Professor Cope in Volume IV
Explorations and Surveys west of the 100th Meridian.

A large proportion of these paleontological collections, vertebrates
invertebrates, and plants, consists of the type specimens upon which
species and genera have been founded, and many other species and
genera are represented among these collections by authentic examples.
Among them are the types of the greater part of the species which
have been published in the reports of the different explorations and
surveys by authority of the general government, and by the Smithso-
nian Institution and National Museum.

The following is a list of the titles of the articles from the pen of Dr.
White, based on the museum collections, which have been published in
the Proceedings:

Descriptions of new species of invertebrate fossils.

Note on Endothyra ornata.

Note on Criocardium and Ethmocardium.

Descriptions of New Cretaceous Invertebrate Fossils from Kansas and

Texas. ;

Note on the Occurrence of Productus giganteus in California.

Note on Acrothele.

Description of a New Cretaceous Pinna from New Mexico.
Note on Stricklandinia salteri and S. davidsoni in Georgia.
Description of a very large Fossil Gasteropod from the State of Pueblo,

Mexico.

Descriptions of New Invertebrate Fossils from the Mesozoic and Ceno-
zoic rocks of Arkansas, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah.

Distribution of duplicate specimens.—It is a question whether any
museum has ever made so systematic, thorough, and extensive a disposal
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

of its surplus material as has been made by the Smithsonian Institution
within the last twenty-five years. There is scarcely a public museum in
the country, especially if connected with a scientific society, university
or college, that has not received a share. In later years these distribu-
tions have been extensive including, as they have, the surplus stock
gathered by the extensive operations of the United States Fish Com-
mission. ‘

An additional advantage connected with these distributions is the
fact that nothing is ever sent out without being thoroughly identified
and named by competent masters, so that the objects constitute types
of the utmost value.

The extent to which this distribution has been carried during 1880
may be understood from the fact that it embraced over 14,000 specimens,
each accompanied by labels showing name, locality, &c. The total num-
ber of specimens distributed to date is not much short of half a million
(actually 407,255).

Assistants in the Museum.—A large appropriation was made by Con-
gress for the service in the National Museum required by the erection
of the new building, and available first in 1880. This required a reor-
ganization of the entire force and a more specific definition of the duties
and responsibilities to the Institution. All persons who had been em;
ployed received a specific letter of appointment, a condition of which
requiring formal acceptance in writing was that the incumbent, during
his connection with the Institution, should make no private collections
in natural history of any kind whatever. This rule is in force in all the
European museums, and is considered absolutely necessary for their inter-
ests, as the curators have ample opportunities of inducing the diversion
of material from the museum to themselves, if they are so inclined. In
the experience of the Smithsonian Institution there has been no reason
to suppose that this danger is to be guarded against; but it was thought
best to establish a general principle, so that there should be no misun-
derstanding at any time. All the persons appointed have agreed to the
condition, which is now in full force.

Courtesies from Foreign Museums.—The authorities and trustees of
the British Museum have been engaged for several years in the pre-
paration and erection of new buildings at South Kensington, for the
accommodation of the natural history collections, transferred from the
location where they have been housed for so many years; and as it was
presumed that the architects and curators of the museum would make
a very exhaustive study in regard to what was needed for the exhibition
of the specimens in the new building, application was made to Dr. Giin-
ther, the chief of the zoological department, for such information as he
might feel at liberty to render. He kindly and promptly responded by
sending numerous drawings and specifications, whichhave been carefully.
studied and made good use of in connection with the arrangements for
the National Museum building.
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The directors of the science and art branch of the South Kensington
Museum have very kindly supplied a volume containing engraved plans
and elevations of the glass cases of that establishment.

To Prof. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, the Institution is also indebted
for drawings of certain new iron cases lately erected in the Zoological
Museum of that city. He added to the obligation also by having pre-
pared and’ sent to us the elementary parts of the cases, of natural size,
so as to furnish a better idea of the mode of construction and fitting.

THE ETHNOLOGICAL BUREAU.

As in previous years, an appropriation was made by Congress for the
prosecution of researches into American ethnology in 1880, under the di-
rection of the Smithsonian Institution. The superintendence of this work
was continued in charge of Prof. J. W. Powell, the appropriation being
expended partly in keeping up the office organization of the Bureau and
partly in continuing the series of special researches into the ethnology
and linguistics of the Indian tribes. A portion of the appropriation was
also expended in continuing the explorations under the direction of Mr.
James Stevenson into the ethnology of the pueblos of New Mexico. In
1877 a number of villages were visited and complete collections of every-
tlfing illustrating their domestic habits, their weapons of warand the chase,
their religious ceremonies, &c., were obtained. During the present year
other villages were visited by the same parties, and large collections
were made and shipped to Washington. These have not yet been re-
ceived, but when they arrive will constitute a very important addition to
the National Museum.

In addition to the general work prosecuted by Major Powell, he has
been requested by General Walker to superintend the work of taking
the census of the Indians for the census of 1880; and for this purpose
he has appointed a number of agents to visit various portions of the
United States for carrying out this business. Major Powell himself has
spent a number of months in the field in connection with the same work.

RELATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION TO OTHER DEPART-
MENTS AND ESTABLISHMENTS.

As shown by the past history of this Institution, its relations to the
different departments of government and to numerous establishments
in this and other cities have been varied and important.

The Government.—With the Library of Congress, the Institution is
brought into constant intercourse, from the many contributions of valu-
able scientific works and journals continually made from donations, ex-
changes, purchases, and other sources. With the Army Medical Museum
there is the exchange of anatomical objects for ethnological and zoological
specimens. With the Signal Office of the War Department there have
been interchanges of meteorological observations and records. With
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

the Interior Department has naturally arisen a frequent communication
relative to the material and information derived from the various goy-
ernment explorations and geological surveys. The Treasury Depart-
ment has had occasion to institute investigations relative to the precise
identification of manufactured and other articles, and the methods of
detecting substitutions or adulterations, with special reference to cus-
toms duties and the prevention of fraud in the collection of revenue.
‘With the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, interesting rela-
tions have sprung up relative to certain features in physical geography.
The scientific character of the National Observatory has naturaily
brought about an affiliation of the interests and purposes of the two
institutions, and co-operation has been maintained especially with refer-
ence to the international transmission of astronomical discoveries by
telegraph. To the custody of the Agricultural Department, the In-
stitution has transferred from time to time all the entomological and
botanical material coming into its possession from the contributions of
its humerous correspondents.

Gallery of Art.—In conformity with the established policy of the In-
stitution—“ co-operation rather than competition”—it has made the
Corcoran Art Gallery its depository of any works of fine art it may re-
ceive by exchange or otherwise.

A portrait which is claimed to be an original likeness of General
Washington was sent to the Institution by Mr. E. C. Bruce, of Virginia,
to be placed on exhibition in hopes of finding a purchaser at a satisfac-
tory price. This portrait, said to have been painted by Mr. Polk, was,
with the consent of the owner, deposited in the Corcoran Art Gallery,
where it is now on exhibition.

In the early part of the year a letter was received from Mr.
W. W. Evans, of New York, suggesting that communication be ad-
dressed to the Government of Italy for the purpose of obtaining some
of the numerous duplicates secured by the latter in the progress of the
excavations at Pompeii. In pursuance of the suggestion a correspond-
_ ence was entered into, through the American minister in Rome, with the
proper authorities in Italy. This is not yet concluded, but it is thought
that whenever a suitable exchange can be offered on the part of the Na-
tional Museum the desired object may be accomplished.

In connection with the subject of art, a favorable mention should be
made of a life-size bust of Professor Henry, by Mrs. C. 8. Brooks, of
New York, now on exhibition in the Regents’ room of the Smithsonian
building. This bust, of considerable merit as a portraiture, is remark-
able as having been modelled entirely from a photograph.

Polaris Expedition.—The history of the expedition of Capt. C. F’. Hall
in the direction of the North Pole, on the steamer Polaris, and its gen-
eral results, have already been referred to in previous reports. As was
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to be expected, Congress made a liberal provision for the publication of
the results of the expedition. The narrative volume was prepared un-
der the supervision of Admiral Davis, at the time Superintendent of the
Naval Observatory at this city, and the volume of physical results, pre-
pared under the direction of Dr. Emil Bessels, the chief of the scientific
corps of the expedition, and pr:nted by Congress. There still, however,
remains a large amount of material relating to the geology, natural his-
tory, and ethnology of arctic America, and Dr. Bessels has been con-
tinuing the elaboration of this work for publication, having a room in
the building assigned for the purpose.

Congress at the last session made an appropriation of $8,000, and
placed it under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, to be ex-
pended in preparing this material for final publication. The supervi-
sion of the work was placed in Dr. Bessel’s hands, and in order to com-
plete his researches on the history of the Esquimaux, it became necessary
for him to visit Copenhagen and have conference with Dr. Rink in ref-
erence to that branch, as also to study the collections in the Copenhagen
Museum. He has been very sucessful in his mission, and expects to re-
turn in February, and immedtately thereafter to begin the printing of
his final report. By authority of the Secretary. of the Treasury the dis-
bursal of the funds was placed in charge of Mr. Thomas J. Hobbs, one
of the disbursing clerks of the Treasury Department.

The Alaska Commercial Company.—For many years the Alaska Com-
mercial Company has acted to a great degree as the agent of the Smith-
sonian Institution on the Pacific coast, and the heartiest acknowledge-
ments are due for its assistance during the year 1880, as well as in pre-
vious years. It has not simply been the agent for the transmission or
reception of packages between Washington and San Francisco, but has
readily undertaken the purchase of supplies and their transmission to
the agents of the Institution, in many cases making large money ad-
vances. The entire business has necessarily involved the employment
of much official time, and in some cases doubtless considerable annoy-
ance. This, however, has been cheerfully rendered by the company
without any consideration whatever.

The company has also made many contributions to the Museum from
the collections sent toit by its own agents.

Centennial Commission Archives.—In the latter part of 1880 a meeting
of the executive committee of the International Exhibition of 1876 was
held in Philadelphia for the purpose of closing up the business of the
exhibition. It was then decided to deposit all the archives of the com-
mission in the National Museum at Washington, and the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution was notified of this action.

The value and importance of these papers, plans, &c., will increase
with time, and the determination of the commission to secure for them
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

permanent preservation at the national Capital is to be considered as
patriotic and judicious. J have formally assured the commission of the
willingness of the Institution to receive the articles as soon as a suitable
place can be prepared in the new Museum for their reception.

National Academy of Sciences.—The regular meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences was held in Washington on the 20th day of April,
the accommodations being furnished, as in 1879, by the officers of All
Souls’ Church. It is hoped that at no distant day it may be in the power
of the Smithsonian Institution to again offer the necessary facilities of
room, &¢c., to the Academy. Prof. Wm. B. Rogers, president of the
Academy, presided, and the meeting was in every way a successful one,
a very large proportion of the members being in attendance and
many interesting papers communicated. As the early history of the
Academy was closely connected with that of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, by reason of Professor Henry having been the president for many
years, the files, correspondence, and archives were searched for data
illustrating this relationship, and the results transmitted to Professor
Rogers.

Paris International Congress and Exposition relative to Electricity.—
Through the courtesy of the State Department, this Institution received
early copies of circulars and programmes relative to a proposed inter-
national congress of electricians, and also to an international exhibition
of electrical apparatus and applications, to be held at Paris in 1881.
These papers have to some extent been appropriately distributed. By
an ‘official decree of President Grévy, of the French Republi, dated
October 23, 1880, a congress of electricians is invited to meet at Paris
on the 15th of next September (1881), the presiding officer of which
body will be the minister of the postal service and telegraphs, M.
Ad. Cochery. An international exposition of electrical apparatus of
all kinds, designed for the production, propagation, and utilization of
electricity (as well as of ail memoirs and treatises relating to that subject)
is appointed, to be held in the palace of the Champs Elysées, from the
Ist of August to the 15th of November, 1881. M. George Berger has
been appointed the commissioner-general of the congress and of the ex-
hibition. :

Asa token of interest and co-operation in this enterprise, the Insti-
tution has sent to the commission, for deposit in the bibliographical
class, a copy of each of its publications relating to electricity and ter-
restrial'magnetism, to wit, four numbers of its octavo series (of Miscel-
laneous Collections), and thirteen numbers of its quarto series (of Smith-
sonian Contributions).

Recognition by Foreign Governments.—A gratifying testimonial to the
appreciation of the Smithsonian Institution in its labors connected with
the results of international exehanges, &c., was furnished by the action

of the International Exposition in Sydney, Australia, in presenting to it
a bronze medal, although no exhibit of any kind was made by the Institu-
tion on that occasion.

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.

Loss of Employés and Collaborators.—It is seldom that a year passes
without entailing the mournful task of recording the loss by death of
one or more of those who have been either directly employed by the
Institution, or have rendered it assistance in the prosecution of its varied
scientific operations. In the necrology of the past year, several valued
names are to be included.

In the death of Dr. TaomAs M. BREWER, at his residence in Boston,
on the 2d of January last, the Smithsonian Institution loses one of its
best and earliest friends, and one who always rendered important serv-
ice in his capacity as editor of a leading Boston daily journal, and did
much toward keeping the public advised of the true spirit of the opera-
tions of the Institution.

In his death the science of:ornithology loses one of its earliest votaries,
constituting, as he did, a connecting link between the present epoch and
the period of Audubon and Nuttall. Dr. Brewer’s specialty was in his
knowledge of the history and the habits of birds, and especially of their
nidification, and he has always been the highest authority on everything
relating to the eggs of North American species. Many years ago he
planned an exhaustive work on North American Oology, to be illustrated
by the best drawings that could be procured, and an agreement was
made by the Smithsonian Institution to publish this work in successive
parts. The first number of this North American Oology was published
by the Institution, and embraced more particularly the rapacious birds,
the swallows, the goat-suckers, and the king-fishers. This publication
took place at a time when the knowledge of North American birds was
undergoing many changes, resulting from the expansion of the territory
of the United States and the better knowledge of its different portions.

The further publication was deferred for a time, but arrangements
were being made at the time of his death to take up the work again and
carry it to its completion.

Dr. Brewer has done a great deal towards popularizing American
ornithology by his investigations and correspondence with ornithologi-
cal students of all grades of advancement. To no one so much as to Dr.
Brewer is due the love of ornithology that is so prevalent in New Eng-
land. In 1840, he published an American edition of Wilson’s Crnithol-
ogy, which met for a time a much felt want, and he has also published
a large number of papers on ornithological subjects. His most im-
portant work, however, was in connection with the History of North
American Birds, by Baird, Brewer, and Ridgway, printed by Messrs.
Little & Brown, in 1573, of which three volumes have so far appeared,
namely, those on land species. Of these the entire biological text was

—
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

furnished by Dr. Brewer. At the time of his death, he left behind the
manuscript of the water-bird portion of the same history. This is now
in the hands of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, and will probably be published
soon as one of the remaining portions of the work.

Dr. Brewer had been throughout his life one of the chief supporters
of the Boston Society of Natural History, of which, indeed, he was
one of the founders, occupying year by year important posts in con-
nection with the society; and his influence upon it cannot easily be over-
estimated.

After giving up his editorial connection with the Boston Atlas and
Traveller, Dr. Brewer entered into business as a publisher and book-
seller; and retiring from this a few years ago, he spent a year and a
half in travelling in Europe, in the course of which he visited all the
ornithological and oological establishments, and arranged special con-
nections between their owners or the curators. Partly as the result of
this visit, and partly of long-continued and persistent efforts, he became
possessed of one of the finest general collections of eggs in the world,
but especially rich in the North American species. These collections he
caused to be passed over at his death to the Museum of Comparative
Zoology of Cambridge, where they are safely preserved, and constitute
one of the most striking features of that great’ museum.

The death of Mr. JAMES W. MILNER, which occurred at his residence,
Waukegan, Illinois, on the 6th of January, 1880, was a serious loss to
the science of fish-culture. Mr. Milner had been connected with the
United States Fish Commission as assistant commissioner for many
years past, having been in its service indeed, from the first year of its
organization. He commenced his labors, as a collector of statistics in
regard to the fisheries of the great lakes, the results of which appear
in the reports of the commission. In later years he had had charge
more particularly of the division of the propagation of food-fishes, in
the course of which he invented or brought into use many important
practical discoveries. In the course of his visits to different parts of
the country he also took occasion to make extensive collections in
natural history for the National Museum, all of which are recorded in
its catalogues.

Mr. Milner’s illness was induced by a severe cold (taken in the spring
of 1878,) which assumed a malarial tendency, and required his return to
Lake Michigan for recuperation. He again assumed charge of his work
in the autumn of that year, organizing the arrangements for the hatch-
ing of codfish by the United States Fish Commission at Gloucester, in
the months of October and November. His increasing indisposition,
however, made it necessary for him to go to some other locality, and he
returned to Washington, and after spending a short time he went to Flor-
ida, where he remained during the winter.

He returned to Waukegan in the spring of 1879; but this season was
exceptionally raw and trying on the lakes, and by the direction of his
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

physician he visited Colorado for the summer. He, however, failed to
improve, and was brought to Waukegan in the autumn, and after much
suffering died, as stated, on the 6th of January, 1880.

A man of modest and agreeable demeanor, Mr. Milner, by careful obser-
vation and study, had mastered the theory and practice of fish-culture,
and had himself made many important improvements. His loss to the
Fish Commission is one which it will be extremely difficult to replace.

Mr. J. HOMER LANE must be mentioned as a valued collaborator of
the Institution, who died in this city May 3d of the past year. A grad-
uate of Yale College, he commenced his career as a teacher. His high
scientific and mathematical attainments having become known to the
Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, he was. early ap-
pointed to a position in that branch of the public service. About the
year 1847, on the recommendation of Professor Henry, Mr. Lane was
transferred to the United States Patent Office, as opening to him a more
varied and active occupation; and he discharged the responsible duties
of.an Examiner in that institution with a pains-taking fidelity for many
years. On the death of Mr. Saxton, who had charge of the construc-
tion and verification of the national and metric standards (under the
Coast Survey Office), Mr. Lane was recalled to that bureau to fill this
vacaney,—a position held by him till his death.

Mr. Lane had given considerable attention and study to the mathe-
matical theory of electricity, and in 1859 he conducted, at the request
and under the general supervision of Professor Henry, a series of ex-
periments for this Institution, on several points of scientific interest
relating to the Atlantic telegraph, a brief notice of which investiga- -
tion was given in the Smithsonian Report for 1859, p.38. To Mr. Lane
was also occasionally referred, for examination and report, communica-
tions or memoirs requiring for their thorough treatment a special famili-
arity with the higher mathematics. In 1866, he undertook an elaborate
investigation into the conditions of successive expansion or rarefaction
in gases, having particularly in view a more precise determination of
the absolute zero of temperature. In these experiments he was assisted
by apparatus specially constructed for him by the Institution.
His fastidious desire for extreme accuracy led him to postpone the
publication of results until it is feared that the valuable work actually
accomplished by him in this direction will not be available for the pro-
motion of knowledge among men, to which purpose he had so long and
earnestly devoted himself. Mr. Lane was remarkable for the logical
clearness of his mind and the strict conscientiousness of his moral
nature.

When Mr. William H. Dall returned, in 1873, from his labors in
Alaska, under the direction of the United States Coast Survey, he
brought with him a young Aleute, named GEORGE TSAROFF, who com-
mended himself to him by his intelligence. With the aid of some
persons interested in education, Mr. Dall secured for his protégé an ex-

cellent education in Michigan, in the course of which he learned to read,
write, and speak the English language with great readiness. On com-
pleting his course of. educatidn, he was brought to Washington as an
assistant, and placed in charge of the large ethnological hall in the sec-
ond story of the building, his duties being to keep everything in order
and to act as a guide to visitors. These he performed with efficiency,
himself constituting an extremely interesting exhibit —that of a native
Indian, well educated and instructed, and able to explain the special
objects and applications of many articles manufactured and used in his
own country.

I regret to say that this interesting assistant was attacked by con-
sumption, and for greater convenience of careful treatment, he was re-
moved to Providence Hospital on the 2d of March, where he died on the
8th of May.

Among the deaths of those deserving special notice in this report
is that of Mr. WILLIAM Q. Forcr, who for many years had charge of
the meteorological department of the Institution. He was the son of
General Peter Force, of Washington, at one time mayor of the city, and
well known for his devotion to the study of American history. His col-
lection of books in this department was the largest in the country, and

-as purchased by the government for the Library of Congress. Inthe col-
lection of these books and in the preparation of the “American Archives”
Mr. William Q. Force was the principal assistant of his father. He also
edited and published the “Army and Navy Chronicle and Scientific
Repository,” and several works relating to history and statistics. He
graduated at Columbian College in 1839, studied law, and in 1857 took
charge of the meteorological department of the Smithsonian Institution,
discharging the duties of the position for eleven years with marked
fidelity and ability. He resigned on account of an attack of illness,
which caused a permanent derangement of his nervous system, and he
devoted the. remainder of his life to literary pursuits and to quiet and
unobtrusive deeds of charity.

He held several important positions of honor and trust in connection
with religious and educational enterprises and establishments, in all of
which he was noted for his scrupulous honesty, purity, and fidelity. if
all the relations of life he was a noble example of a man wholly actuated
by Christian principle, and whose practice conformed rigidly to his pro-
fessions.

Berendt manuscripts.—The long-continued labors of Dr. CARL HiEr-
MANN BERENDT, in Mexico and Central America, relating to the eth-
nology and ainiglaen of the native tribes, prosecuted to a certain degree
under the auspices of the Institution, have been detailed in its previous
reports at various times within the last twenty years and more; and it
is with great regret that I have to announce the death of that gentleman
in the city of Guatemala on the 12th of April, 1878

He left his valuable manuscripts and rare books mith Mr. B. Wester-
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mann, of New York, and many similar articles were in his own rooms in
Guatemala. These, by an arrangement with his executor, Mr. Wester-
mann, were gathered together by Mr. Francis Sarg, a fellow countryman,
who was also a resident of Guatemala; and by the kind mediation of
Capt. John M. Dow, forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution, filling
five boxes.

An inventory of this property was made by the Institution and trans-
mitted to Mr. Westermann, who also had prepared a catalogue of the
first collection, the whole of which constitutes a very important mass of
historical and scientific matter, both in print and manuscript; and it is
to be hoped that some arrangement may be made by which this can be
added to some public library in the country, and no better depository
could be found, than the Library of Congress.

Although engaged for many years in the researches referred to, Dr.
Berendt had printed but little, so that unless his manuscripts are care-
fully edited and published, his life work will have left but little on record.
With an assurance of long life and an ultimate opportunity of publica-
tion, a feeling not uncommon among literary men, Dr. Berendt allowed
the opportunity of presenting his labors to pass while aiming at further
perfection.

Donations.—A. large fire-proof safe was presented to the Institution
for the National Museum by the Herring Safe Company of New York; a
notice of which was given in the last Report. This safe has just been re-
ceived, and is an admirable specimen of the well-known skill of this enter-
prising company. It stands about seven feet high, and by its fine finish
forms an attractive piece of furniture. It will prove a very useful re-
ceptacle for small objects of special rarity and value belonging to the
Museum.

Mention should be made of several other contributions of interest.
One of such has been a pair of Howe scales, presented by Messrs. F. P.
May & Co., of Washington, the agents of the Howe Company. These
scales have been placed in the entrance hall of the Institution, and are
constantly in use for weighing visitors.

Among the contributions to the Institution of a miscellaneous char-
acter during the year is that of a hydro-pneumatic fire-extinguisher, pre-
sented by the agent of the company in Washington. This is claimed to
possess specially valuable qualities which fit it for practical use in pub-
lic and private establishments, and is kept in order for ready applica-
tion should an emergency requiring it arise.

Of the works published by the United States Government during the
last few years none has had more popularity than the narrative of
the second arctic expedition made by Capt. C. F. Hall, edited by Prof.
J. E. Nourse. Congress has ordered several editions of this work and
placed copies of it for sale at the mere cost of paper and printing. In
this work illustrations are given of Esquimaux life, manners, and cus-

toms, the articles represented being specimens in the National Museum.
During the last year the Secretary of the Navy has offered to the In-
stitution the manuscripts, notes, plates, cuts, &ec., of Captain Hall’s
work to be preserved in its archives.

Loan of books and apparatus.—The Smithsonian Institution has been
proverbial, from its first establishment, for the liberality with which the
use of books, apparatus, and specimens has been allowed whenever re-
quired in the interest of science, the regulations of many institutions
absolutely prohibiting the removal from their halls of such articles, not
being at all enforced. It was found necessary, however, to establish
some restrictions to the indiscriminate borrowing, as it was ascertained
that in many cases the borrower was careless about returning the ob-
jects obtained by him, so that when others required their use they were
not available for the purpose. In some instances rare volumes of trans-
actions of learned societies would be kept for years, and not unfrequently
an entire set would be returned after the death of the borrower; in
other cases, when called for, the report would be that they were not pro-
ducible.

In order to throw upon the borrower the onus of making a proper
return without unnecessary delay, Professor Henry decided to require
a deposit in money, or a certified check, far in advance of the value of
the object itself; in the case of the loan of a volume of transactions the
money security called for representing the value of the entire series.
This condition has given offense in some cases, persons thinking that
the deposit should be simply of a money value equal. to the value of the
article borrowed. ‘This, however, would not answer the purpose, as, in
many cases, individuals would be glad to obtain a rare work at cost;
and as the Institution is not engaged in trade and needs its books and
apparatus for its own research, and that of its collaborators, the propri-
ety of the regulation has, I think, been fully vindicated. The required
deposit for books amounts, generally, to from $25 to $100, and of course
the borrower, whose money is in the hands of the Institution, does not
leave it there longer than is necessary. When the book is returned
the money is sent back and the transaction closed. This same regula-
tion has been extended to the loan to parties of other articles having a
definite money value.

Loan of specimens.—As far as specimens of natural history are con-
cerned the regulations are arranged on a different footing; and as a
further means of preserving the integrity of the Smithsonian collections,
the following form of “receipt” from naturalists who may borrow its
material, has been adopted by the Institution:

[Locality ———Date ]

‘Received from the Smithsonian Institution a collection of ;
corresponding to the accompanying list. I hereby accept them in trust
upon the following conditions: First. That they are to be used for pur-

poses of investigation, and returned in as good condition as they were
received, and as soon as my work upon them is completed. Second.
That no unique specimens constituting part of the reserve series of the
National Museum shall be mutilated. Third. That duplicates when
necessary may be dissected; understanding by ‘duplicate,’ a specimen
which is not necessary to illustrate variations of forms or range of geo-
graphical distribution. Fourth. That the specimens when returned
shall be labeled with the names which I have employed in my publica-
tions upon them. Fifth. That credit shall be given to the Smithsonian
Institution in all publications based upon material furnished by it.”

Restoration of the Declaration of Independence.—Several years ago a
commission was appointed by Congress (under an act approved August
3, 1876), consisting of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, and the Librarian of Congress, for the purpose
of taking into consideration measures for the restoration of the faded
and now nearly illegible Declaration of Independence. Some conferences
were held on this subject and some experiments made in regard to it, but
without result. A meeting of the commission was held at the Depart-
ment of the Interior on the 5th of May last, and, after discussion, it
was decided that it was one of the subjects coming within the province
of the National Academy of Sciences, and the problem was referred to
Professor Rogers, president of the Academy, with the request to appoint
a commission of scientific experts to investigate the whole subject and
report to the Secretary of the Interior. No return has yet been made
by this commission, but it is understood that the matter is receiving
careful consideration.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

GENERAL OBJECTS AND RESULTS.

The relationship which your Secretary has borne for ten years to the
United States Fish Commission as its chief, and the time required for
the discharge of its responsibilities, makes it proper to furnish a brief
statement of the objects and results of the commission, as showing
thereby that its operations are quite in accordance with the purposes of
the Smithsonian Institution.

The inception of the commission, on a very small scale, in 1871, and
the rapid extension of its operations year by year, have all been chron-
icled in the annual reports of the Institution; and now that ten years
have elapsed, the reports of the commission will, I trust, show its
healthy growth and a successful accomplishment of some, at least, of
the objects which have been kept strictly in view from the outset.

As explained in previous reports, the commission was first established,
in 1871, for the purpose of investigating the alleged decrease of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ta

food-fishes of the country, and of inquiring as to the best methods of
remedying the decrease, should this be found to exist. It was not until
the second year, or 1872, that the responsible duty of increasing the
supply was added to the other functions of the commission.

In the preceding report of the Smithsonian Institution, for 1879, I
have stated at length the plans and objects of the commission, and to
this I refer for details. I may simply remark here that the division of
“inquiry” has been held to involve a complete investigation of and re-
port upon all the physical conditions of the waters of the United States,
and the nature, numbers, and general relationships of their inhabitants,
together with an account of the relationships of man to the same, in
the way of methods and appliances of the fisheries, and the history and
statistics of his labors.

The second division, that of propagation, of course includes the pro-
tection of the useful fishes and their multiplication, either by capturing
the fish and transferring them from one point to another, or by the pro-
cess of artificial impregnation of the eggs and the distribution of the
young. —

The work of the inquiry is prosecuted, for the most part, directly un-
der my own supervision, from stations at different points along the sea-
coast, with a suitable number of assistants (volunteers for the most part)
for making the investigations referred to. The specimens collected are
placed in the hands of experts, by whom they are properly investigated
and monographed, and the results published, with suitable illustrations
in the Annual Reports of the Commission. The collections made, usually
in very large numbers, are worked up at the same time; the reserve col-
lection preserved in the National Museum, and the duplicates distributed
to the various educational establishments of the country, or exchanged
for objects desired by the Museum.

The propagation division is conducted either at some permanent sta-
tions, such as those of the salmon, whitefish, and carp, or in temporary
establishments, shifting their ground with the season, as is the case in
large part, with the shad stations.

During the past year two additional subjects have occupied the atten-
tion of the Commission; one, the preparation for the international dis-
play of the fisheries of the United States at Berlin; and the other, the
ontinuation of the census of the fisheries, undertaken in behalf of Gen-
eral Walker, Superintendent of the Census. Special details in regard to
these branches will be found elsewhere.

Newport was the station selected for the prosecution of the work of
inquiry into the fisheries in 1880, as representing a point between
two previous stations, Wood’s Holl and Noank. Since the year 1873 the
Commission has been indebted to the Navy Department for a steamer
with which to carry on its investigations. This year, however, it was
found possible to dispense, in large part, with extraneous aid, the Fish
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Hawk,* the vessel referred to in a previous report, having been com-
pleted and ready for sea.

Her original purpose was that of a floating hatching establishment ;
but she was not completed until some time in July, or after the spring
hatching work was over. Her first service, therefore, was in the inquiry
division of the Commission. She is a vessel of 484 tons, and provided
with all the necessary conveniences for investigation, such as a power-
ful hoisting engine and the necessary dredging and trawling apparatus.
She proved adinirably adapted to the requirements of the occasion.

Her personnel was furnished by the Navy Department, under the law
of Congress that directed that she be placed on the same footing as the
vessels of the Coast Survey, which gave her the officers and a crew, with
their subsistence, leaving to the Commission the running expenses, such
as the cost of coal, oil, water, etc. Lieut. Z. L. Tanner, who had been
in charge of the steamer Speedvcell, at Provincetown, in 1879, was placed
in command by the Navy Department, with Mr. J. S. Smith as mate,
Wn. B. Boggs as engineer, Geo. H. Reed as paymaster, and I’. C. Van
Vliet as surgeon, and a crew of 27 men.

- A large building, formerly used for the manufacture of shot, was
rented from Mr. John H. Griswold; an adjacent wharf, with a number of
buildings upon it, was also obtained for the service of the Commission.

As in previous years, the superintendence of the work connected with
the marine invertebrates was in charge of Professor Verrill, of Yale Col-
lege, assisted by J. H. Emerton as artist, Mr. Sanderson Smith of New
York, and Mr. B. F. Koons and E. A. Andrews. Mr. Richard Rathbun
was an assistant of the Commission in the general work, and Mr. H. L.
Osborn and Frederic Gardiner had charge of the fishes during the ab-
sence in Alaska of Dr. T. H. Bean.

The census branch of the fisheries also had its quarters in the town.

My own oflice, those of the laboratory and of the census, and the res-
idence of Maj. T. B. Ferguson, assistant commissioner, were connected
by telephone, for the more convenient transaction of business.

I arrived in Newport with my party on the 9th of July, and was
joined by Professor Verrill a few days later. The steamer, however, did
not reach Newport until the 2d of August, and, owing to various causes,
did not get fairly at her work until about the 7th. The city wharf was
hired from the city of Newport, where she lay when in port. The work
was carried on with great zeal during the summer, and very important
discoveries, both scientific and practical, were made, especially in the
course of three visits to the Gulf Stream in September and October.
On these occasions, the vessel by starting in the evening at 6 o’clock,
and running out to a distance of about a hundred miles reached the Gulf
Stream, and explored it for a period of 12 to 14 hours, and returned to
port on the succeeding night. The amount of life found along the west-

direction of the Light-House Board, and the immediate supervision of Mr. Copeland and Lieut. Z. L.

ern edge of the Gulf Stream was enormously rich; of mollusca, not less
than 175 different species were taken, forty being new to science.
Twenty new deep sea fishes, some of them of, a remarkable character,
were secured. The most important observations, however, were those
in regard to the Tile fish (Lopholotilus chameleonticeps), to which refer-
ence was made in a previous report. The ascertained range of this fish
was gréatiy extended, showing the possibility of capturing it over a
wide area. ;

For the purpose of determining the ability to take this fish with an
ordinary fishing smack a Noank vessel was chartered for the trial. Ow-
ing to a threatening storm, however, the vessel was compelled to return,
and nothing was done beyond th@capture on a small line of an enor-
mous sword-fish.

Mr. G. Brown Goode, who had represented the United States at the
Berlin Exhibition, returning, joined the party on the 17th of July and
was, for the most part, occupied in connection with the fishery census.

During the summer I visited Wood’s Holl in the Fish Hawk, for the
purpose of inquiring into the possibility of making a station at that
point, for the hatching of codfish.

The work of the Commission at Newport was closed about the begin-
ning of October, and on the 7th of that month the Mish Hawk returned
to Wilmington for some additional apparatus, carrying a portion of the
collection to New Haven, by the way, for the use of Professor Verrill.
After taking on board further hatching apparatus, the steamer came
around to Washington, cruising along the edge of the Gulf Stream on
her route, and making additional collections of importance.

I left Newport with my party on the 8th of October, closing operations
for the season at that place.

The control of so well equipped a steamer as the Fish Hawk and the
severai visits to the Gulf Stream resulted in the acquisition of a large
amount of material, equal almost to the aggregate of all our preceding
seasons. This has been put in hand and will, as rapidly as possible, be
examined, the reserve series added to the collection of the National
Museum, and the remainder distributed as heretofore.

In the Report of the Institution for 1879 reference was made to the
operations of the Fish Commission in connection with the artificial propa-
gation of codfish at Gloucester, Mass. This work was continued into the
beginning of the year 1880 and a large number of fish hatched out and
liberated. These have remained for a considerable time in the harbor of
Gloucester and its vicinity, and by their abundance and unusual ap-
pearance attracted much attention.

The work of cod hatching was again undertaken in the winter of 1881,
in the little harbor at Wood’s Holl, Massachusetts. Facilities were
granted by the Light-House Board at its depot; themachinery was erected
and everything in readiness for the work. The unusual severity of the
winter, however, which froze up the shores, rendered it impossible to
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

keep the fish in their pens, and prevented any measure of success. It
is hoped that during normal seasons the propagation of the cod may be
considered as a perfectly feasible undertaking, and one promising im-
portant economical results.

The operations of the Commission in connection with the hatching of
shad have also been of increasing importance during the year. The
work was commenced in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina, and many
millions of fish were hatched out. <A station was then established on
the Potomac River. By the courtesy of the authorities of the Navy
Department, and especially of the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, a hatching station was extemporized for hatching out the eggs
of the shad obtained by the steamer Lookout from the seines and gilling
stations down the Potomae, especially in the vicinity of Fort Washington.

Another station was made at Havre de Grace, Maryland, and at the
two places about 50,000,000 shad were successfully hatched out. A
large proportion of these were necessarily placed in the rivers whence
the eggs were obtained. Many millions, however, were distributed by
the messengers of the Commission to various localities throughout the
United States, especially to the waters of the Mississippi Valley.

The propagation of the Salmonide has also been conducted with sat-
isfactory results. The McCloud River station, for the cultivation of the
California or Quinnat salmon, was in successful operation, and furnished
many millions of eggs, which were distributed, as usual, to all parts of
the United States. Some of these eggs went to Germany, France, and
Holland, where they arrived in good condition, and were hatched out
very satisfactorily.

After an interval of several years, work was resumed at the station
on the Penobscot River for obtaining the eggs of the Penobscot salmon,
and a distribution of these fish was made to the principal rivers of the
Northern and Eastern States. .

An unusually large gathering of eggs of the land-locked salmon was
made at the station on Grand Lake Stream, this fish promising to be of
great value in the cold, deep lakes of the country.

Work on a large scale in connection with the white-fish of the great
lakes was commenced this year by establishing a station at Northville,
Michigan, under the charge of Mr. rank N. Clark. With the neces-
sary number of assistants, Superintendent Clark obtained a bountiful
supply of eggs in the adjacent lakes, and gathered into the hatching-
house about 13,000,000. Some of these were distributed to different
parts of the country; but by far the greater part were hatched out and
placed partly in Lake Michigan, partly in Lake Huron, and partly in
Detroit River.

An interesting experiment was made in the artificial propagation of
the striped bass or rock-fish of the Southern States—the eggs from a
gravid female having been properly impregnated, a large number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fer

young were hatched out. This experiment, it is hoped, will be contin-
ued in future years on a much larger scale.

Perhaps the most important result of the work of the Commission in
the line of the propagation of fish is that of the multiplication and dis-
tribution of the imported German carp, of which, as already explained,
there are three principal varieties—the scale, leather, and mirror carp.
The distribution of the young of these fish was commenced in the au-
tumn of 187. A very large yield in 1880 permitted them to be sent to
a great many applicants throughout the country, some thousands in
number. The demand, however, is increasing, and is likely, for some
time, to more than keep pace with the supply. It is gratifying to know
that the efforts of the Commission to introduce this fish meet with favor-
able recognition.

An account of the operations of the United States Fish Commission
during the first decade of its existence, detailing somewhat fully its
plan of work, and the scientific and economical results accomplished by
it, was prepared by Mr. G. Brown Goode, and read before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science at its Boston meeting, held
August 28,1880. This paper will be found in full in the appendix to this
report.

FISHERY CENSUS OF 1880.

In July, 1880, an arrangement was made with General Francis A.
Walker, Superintendent of the Tenth Census, by which an investiga-
tion of the fisheries of the United States was undertaken as the joint
enterprise of the United States Fish Commission and of the Census
Bureau. It was decided that this investigation should be as complete
as possible, and that both the United States Fish Commission and the
Census Bureau should participate in its results. The preparation of a
Statistical and historical report upon the fisheries, to form one of the
series to be presented by the Superintendent of the Census as the re-
sult of his investigations in 1880, has been the main object of the work;
but in connection with this statistical work, extensive investigation
into the methods of the fisheries, into the distribution of the fishing-
grounds, and the natural history of useful marine animals, has been
and is being carried on.

The direction of this investigation has been placed in the hands of Mr.
G. Brown Goode, who was appointed agent of the Census Office, and
who has been carrying on this work in addition to the performance of his
duties in connection with the National Museum. The work which was
begun on July 1, 1879, has been vigorously prosecuted since that time,
and the final report will probably be presented as early as July, 1881.

The plan of the investigation was drawn up before the beginning of
the work and has been published in an octavo pamphlet of 54 pages,
entitled “Plan of Inquiry into the History and Present Condition of the
Fisheries of the United States.”. Washington: Government Printing
Office. 1879.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The scheme of investigation divided the work into the following
departments :

I. Natural -history of marine products: Under this head was to be ear-
ried on the study of the useful aquatic animals and plants of the coun-
try, as well as of seals, whales, turtles, fishes, lobsters, crabs, oysters,
clams, &¢., sponges and marine plants and inorganic products of the
sea, with reference to geographical distribution; size; abundance; mi-
grations and movements; food and rate of growth; mode of repro-
duction; economic value and uses.

II. The fishing-grounds : Under this head are studied the geographical
distribution of all animals sought by fishermen and the location of the
fishing-grounds, while with reference to the latter are considered: loca-
tion; topography; depth of water; character of bottom; MELE oie of
waters currents; character of invertclate life, &c.

Til. The fishermen and fishing towns: Here are considered the coast
districts engaged in the fisheries with reference to their relation to the
fisheries, historically and statistically, and the social, vital, and other
statistics relating to the fishermen.

IV. Apparatus and methods of capture: Here are considered all the
forms of apparatus used by fishermen, boats, nets, traps, harpoons, &ce.,
and the methods employed in the various branches of the fishery. Here
each special kind of fishery, of which there are more than fifty in the
United States, is considered separately, with regard to its methods, its
history, and its statistics.

V. Products of fisheries: Under this head are studied the statistics
of the yield of American fisheries, past and present.

VI. Preparation, care of, and manufacture of fishery products: Here
are considered the methods and thev arious devices for utilizing fish
after they are caught, with statistics of capital and men employed, &e.:
preservation of live fish; refrigeration; sun-drying; smoke-drying; pick-
ling; hermetically canning; fur dressing; whalebone preparation; isin-
glass manufacture; ambergris manufacture; fish-guano manufacture;
oil rendering, &e.

VIL. EHeonomy of the fisheries: Here are studied financial organization
and methods; insurance; labor and capital; markets and market prices;
lines of traffic; exports, imports, and duties.

VIII. Protection and culture: This ineludes all kinds of supervision
by the government, such as legislation; bounties and licenses; fishery
treaties; public fish culture.

The various inquiries provided for in this scheme of investigation
have been made in three ways.

First. By correspondence with persons in different parts of the country.

Second. By a systematic overhauling and compilation of past records,
not the least among which are the local newspapers.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

Third. By sending special agents to make personal inquiries in
every part of the United States where the fisheries are of considerable
importance.

The last-named method has of course been by far the most important
‘ and the most successful, and it is unfortunate that the length of time
and the amount of money available have not permitted the employment
of a larger number of assistants in this branch of the work, and have
not ailowed them to devote as much attention to working out specific
questions as has in many cases seemed imperatively necessary.

The fishery industry is of such great importance and is undergoing
such constant changes that a visit of a few days, even by the most com-
petent experts, has invariably proved unsatisfactory. They have been
able to collect only the more important facts, leaving many subjects of
interest untouched.

_ The field work has been carried on by the following special agents:

In addition to the field assistants already mentioned, a staff of assist-
ants from the beginning have been at work in the office of the division,
- carrying on correspondence, searching past records, and preparing the
report for publication. Mr. C. W. Smiley, Mr. Jas. Temple Brown, and
Mr. George S. Hobbs have been connected with the work from its start,
and from a later date Mr. J. E. Rockwell, Mr. C. W. Scudder, Mr. R. I.
Geare, Mr. G. P. Merrill and others have been thus employed. A num-
ber of clerks have also been detailed for this work by the Superintendent
of the Census, at one time as many as eight. A large part of the clerical
force is under the direction of Mr. C. W. Smiley, who has in special
charge the correspondence and the statistical and compiling work.

Mr. William H. Dall, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was detailed by the Superintendent, Captain Patterson, to visit Alaska
and the Arctic Ocean, for the purpose of obtaining information in re-
gard to the Alaska coast, a work upon which Mr. Dall has been engaged
for many years. Permission for Dr. Bean to accompany Mr. Dall was
readily obtained from Captain Patterson, and the voyage from San
Francisco was made in the schooner Yukon, of the Coast Survey, a ves-
sel originally built under Mr. Dall’s direction for service in the Alaskan
waters.

Mr. William J. Fisher, tidal observer at Kodiak, also contributed im-
portant material of the same general character. As the result of these
several explorations, over one hundred boxes and packages of natural
history collections have been received by the Institution, all more or
less incidental to the census inquiries made by the same parties.

One of the most important reports of Dr. Bean’s investigations was
the discovery that cod and halibut of the Alaskan waters were identical
with the same species as those in the North Atlantic, and consequently
all the conditions of pursuit and preservation used in the east could be
employed appropriately in the western seas.

BERLIN INTERNATIONAL FISHERY EXHIBITION.

Among recent organizations in Europe for the purpose of developing
home industries, one of the most important is the Deutsche Fischeret-
Verein, founded in 1871, for the purpose of developing the fisheries
of Germany, both inland and maritime, and of introducing improved
methods of fish culture and new varieties of fishes. The organization
is composed of some of the most eminent naturalists and pisciculturists
of Germany, and also includes many personages of the highest rank in
the empire who are most interested in the welfare of the State.

For the purpose of bringing together a display illustrating the meth-
ods and results of the fisheries and fish culture of the Old World, ar-
rangements were made for holding an international fisheries exhibition
in Berlin in the spring of 1880, and invitations were issued about
eighteen months before, asking the co-operation of governments, asso-
ciations, and persons interested generally. The invitation to the United
States to participate was transmitted to the Secretary of State in the
winter of 1878~79, but no action was taken by Congress. This was a
source of great regret to the German Government, as well as to the
immediate promoters of the enterprise, and urgent appeals were made
through the German and American ministers for action. A second
communication made by the Secretary of State about the beginning of
1880 was more successful, a bill introduced by Mr. Deuster, member of
the House from Michigan, being readily passed, appropriating $20,000
to enable the United States Fish Commission to make the exhibition on
the part of the United States.

I was called to appear before the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations on the 10th of February, and explained the proposed display,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. $1

and gave some reasons why it would be to the interest of the United
States to participate in it. The Senate committee reporting favorably,
the bill became a law, and appropriations were inade to carry out its
provisions.

My duties in connection with the Smithsonian Institution, the Na-
tional Museum, and the Fish Commission made it impossible for me to
attend the exhibition, and Mr. G. Brown Goode, the curator of the
Museum, was appointed as the commissioner in charge, and immediate
preparations were commenced for the occasion.

Of course the time for preparation was very short, as the exhibition
was to be opened on the 20th of April, giving nearly eighteen months
less time than that enjoyed for the purpose by most of the other par-
ticipants. Fortunately, however, the components of the exhibition of
the fishery and fish-cultural interests of the United States made at the
International Exhibition of 1876 at Philadelphia were available for the
purpose, and a selection from these was made by Mr. Goode, with the
assistance of Mr. True, and invitations for contributions of later mate-
rial were promptly responded to. The most important possible addi-
tions to the display of 1876 consisted in the improved apparatus for fish
culture, and in the samples of preparations of prepared fish, both hav-
ing made vast progress during the intervening four years.

The United States Fish Commission proposed to display, either in
original apparatus or in models, the new methods of hatching fish with
the assistance of steam power, as devised by Mr. T. B. Ferguson, of the
Fish Commission, and especially to show the model of the new fish-
hatching steamer Fish Hawk, to be used as a floating hatching estab-
lishment in the propagation of shad and other useful fishes. The model
of the new vessel was on a scale of about half an inch to the foot, and
that of the fish-hatching apparatus on a scale of one-sixth the actual
size. An enormous number and variety of samples of mackerel, cod,
smelts, crabs, oysters, lobsters, and other marine products were sup-
plied in the different forms of dried, powdered, salted, smoked, and
canned, either in oil or in spices. Certain firms were invited to furnish
their special apparatus for the capture of fish, and no time was lost in
making use of the short interval remaining. This work was carried on
so successfully under Mr. Goode’s administration that it became possible
-to ship a first load, of some thousands of cubic feet, on the 28th of Feb-
ruary, the last of the lot being transmitted on the 24th of March. The
total amount of freight thus sent forward consisted of about 12,000
cubic feet.

With most commendable liberality, the North German Lloyd Co., at
the suggestion of its agents in New York, Messrs. Oelrichs & Co., agreed
to transmit and return all the packages of the Commission free; and
not to be behind a foreign corporation in this spirit, the great lines of
roads between Washington and Baltimore and New York, namely, the
Baltimore and Ohio, the Baltimore and Potomac, the Philadelphia, Wil-

S. Mis. 31 6

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mington and Baltimore, and the Pennsylvania, agreed likewise to carry
the packages free. The greater part of the exhibit of the United States
was shipped from Baltimore by the Bremen steamers, although most
of the packages concentrated at New York were embarked from that
city, as also Mr. Goode’s immediate staff, consisting of Mr. F. W. True
and Mr. J. E. Roekwell of his office force, with Mr. Fred Mather, expert
n fish culture, Capt. J. W. Collins, expert in fisheries, and Mr. Joseph Pal-
mer in charge of the models and easts. Mr. Goode left Washington on
the 16th of March and sailed in the Bremen steamer Yeckar on the 20th,
the company granting a concession of one-fourth of the fare.

A large portion of the goods were found in Bremen on the arrival ot
the party, and these were sent forward to Berlin and unpacked in time
for very satisfactory opening of the Exhibition on the 20th of April.
Some smaller collections, sent at a later date, were received subsequently.
A large amount of space had been assigned to the United States, but
this being inadequate a portion of that granted to Great Britain, and
not occupied by her exhibitors, was added. The section of the United
States was ornamented by a large num ber of flags lent for the purpose
by the Navy and War Departments, and the display as a whole was very
effective.

It is now a matter of history that the United States bore off the chief
honors of the occasion, the superlatives of the crities being exhausted
in their praises of its method, richness, and great intrinsic value. Indeed
the entire collection of the remaining portion of the International Ex-
hibit of Fish and Fisheries would not have made a single exhibit of
anything like the importance of that of the United States. In illustratien
of this fact it may be stated that the grand prize given by the Emperor
of Germany to the Exhibition, for the best display, was awarded to the
United States. This consisted of a large vase, three feet high, beauti-
fully worked in silver and gold, and costing over $2,000. In addition
to the grand prize there were numerous other awards in the way of
medals of gold, silver, and bronze to contributors from this country, and
the number of these awards would have been much greater but for the
fact that the greater part of these contributions were made as part of that
of the United States Fish Commission. The same policy was pursued
there as at the Philadelphia exhibition: where objects were presented
to the Institution and to the United States, they were entered for special
consideration as individual exhibits; but where they were purchased for
the exhibition they became the property of the United States, and their
individuality was lost in the general display. Many persons who pre-
ferred to receive the comparatively slight money-value of the objects ob-
tained from them, were greatly disappointed on finding that, however
meritorious, their articles were passed over by the judges and no awards
made for them.

It was originally supposed that the exhibition would close on the Ist
of June, after a six weeks’ display. Very much interest, however, was
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

felt in the display, and it was so much more successful than had been
expected that it was concluded to keep it over until the Ist of July.
This involved an additional four weeks’ detention of the party, and of
course inereased the expense. Thanks, however, to Mr. Goode’s careful
administration, I am happy to say that the work was finished and all
the exhibits returned to Washington within the appropriation, a few
dollars having been paid into the Treasury as the surplus. Owing to
the care with which the articles were packed, everything arrived in per-
fect condition at its destination; indeed, out of the large number of
plaster casts very few required any treatment for their proper exhibition,
This was in marked contrast to the experience of the British portion of
the exhibit, which, although it was much smaller in extent, was almost
utterly destroyed in transit.

Acting under his instructions, Mr. Goode disposed of some of the more
bulky and least costly articles, such as the whale boat and a number of
the dories, &¢., to various governments and other establishments in ex-
change for desired objects belonging to the European divisions. This
somewhat reduced the bulk of the shipment, but not very greatly. The
entire lot of at least 10,000 cubic feet was brought by a single vessel of
the German Lloyds line from Bremen to Baltimore, and thence by the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and placed in the new National Museum
Building. The exhibition will be more fully discussed in a report now
being prepared, which in accordance with the resolutions of Congress
will also treat of the present condition of the fisheries and fish-culture
of Europe.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of Smithsonian Institution.

RULES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF SPECIMENS SUBMITTED
TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

1. Qualitative examinations—that is, for determining the constituents
of the specimens—are made without charge.

2. Quantitative examinations, or the determination of the percentage of
the different components of the specimens, can only be made at the
expense of the applicant; the charge to be in proportion to the time
expended in the work, e. g., from $5 to $50, according to whether it is
partial (determination of silver, lead, or iron, &c., only) or full (deter-
mination of everything).

3. The report of quantitative examinations will be given under the
name of the expert to whom the specimens shall be submitted, and not
under that of the Smithsonian Institution.

4, All applications for the determination of specimens must be made
by letter, addressed ‘‘Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.”

5. The specimens examined, or a part of them, will be retained by the
Institution.

6. All specimens to be delivered to the Institution free of expense.

SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF FRED. W. TAYLOR,
Chemist of the Smithsonian Institution.

The present chemist entered upon his duties the latter part of Janu-
ary, 1880, taking charge of the laboratory and mineralogical department
during the absence of Dr. Endlich, and has continued to perform the
duties of his office since that time. The laboratory was found to be in
comparatively good order, though the stock of apparatus and chemicals
was extremely limited. By slow additions the stock of both has been
largely increased, until now the laboratory may be said to be compara-
tively well supplied for all branches of inorganic work. As yet no pro-
vision has been made for organic work, and no such work has been
attempted, as, in addition to the lack of apparatus, the arrangement
and fitting of the laboratory render such work almost impossible. As
stated in the last annual report, the work of the laboratory consists
in the determination of various minerals sent in to the Institution
for identification, and in the investigation of such questions as may be
referred to it by the departments. No other work is attempted by the
Institution, though the chemist is kindly permitted to undertake other
work on his own account. Since February 1, 1880, the chemist has made
108 ~ APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

about one hundred and twenty qualitative reports to the Institution on
specimens received, identifying nearly three times that number of spe-
cimens; also some fifteen quantitative reports. He regrets, however,
that nearly ninety per cent. of the specimens received by the Institu-
tion are entirely worthless, owing to the small size of specimens, and to
the partiality of senders to the sulphide of iron (Pyrite) and to the sul-
phide of iron and copper (Chaleopyrite). This unfortunate fact has
prevented the chemist from making any considerable addition to the
collection, or to the supply of duplicates. The cases in the mineral hall
have, however, been refitted and put in order without change in the-
system followed by Dr. Endlich, and the few valuable specimens that
have been received, where space would not permit their exhibition, have
been temporarily stored in the drawers under the cases. Among the
specimens of value received may be mentioned specimens of amalgam,
crude bullion, and fine silver from Montana, received from Mr. Thos. Don-
aldson; a small but handsome collection of minerals from Mr. Geo. F.
Kunz, of New York; some fine specimens of native copper, contributed
by Dr. Reynolds; and a large number of specimens of the gold and silver
ores of the West, from the surveyors-general of the Western States. Here
let me enter a respectful protest against the method of collecting these
specimens. I should not say method, however, as my protest is against
the apparent want of any method or system whatever. As received the
specimens are of every size and shape, from a mere chip to a piece of
three inches cube, some labeled or numbered, some not. I would sug-
gest that each contributor of such specimens be requested to send pieces
of something like the same size, say 4” x 6” x 2”; that each specimen
be sent in duplicate, and that in all cases an invoice of specimens be
sent both with the letter of transmittal and also inclosed with the spe-
cimens. We would then have a fair collection of these ores instead of
the present supply of chips, many of them broken from the weathered
outerop of the ledge or vein which they are intended to represent.
Another collection received has been one of the gold, silver, and copper
ores of Alaska, from Com. L. A. Beardslee; a collection of iron, lead,
and copper ores of South Africa, from Mr. Geo. D. Sidman. Mr. F. A.
Lowe has contributed a fine specimen of Ammikite and one of Huntilite,
the two new silver islet minerals, the first containing eighty per cent. of
silver, also a small specimen of Macfarlanite. Though the chemist has
not as yet completed any sets of duplicates for distribution, he has sent
off several sets that were packed by Dr. Endlich, and has under way
some fifteen or twenty more sets for that purpose.

These sets will contain not only minerals, but also a certain number
of lithological and geological specimens, the aim being to furnish a set
of characteristic minerals and ores for class teaching. Among the ques-
tions referred to the Institution by the departments was that of the
utility of the Tichnor process for the extraction of gold from its ores,
referred by the Patent Office. This investigation was a most tedious
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 109

and laborious one, involving many weighings of a deliquescent sub-
stance, which had to be done with the greatest rapidity, and at the
same time with accuracy; also the making of some fifty careful assays,
giving the chemist nearly a month of hard and dirty work. Another
question referred to the chemist through Mr. Rhees, of the Institution,
was the character of the coloring matter used on the small squares of
paper given to the children in the Kindergarten schools of the District
and elsewhere. This paper is a thin paper, colored and glazed on one
side (in most cases), cut into five-inch squares, and is given to the chil-
dren to cut up and fashion into various patterns.

The chemist regrets that he has not been able to find time to make
more than a brief qualitative examination of the subject. Eighteen

samples of paper were tested for arsenic, and out of that number six

samples were found to contain a large amount of arsenic in different
forms, probably the most dangerous being a bright green paper, the
coloring matter being the brilliant but deadly Scheele’s green. The
other colors found to contain arsenic were purple, solferino, navy blue,

- carmine red, and vermillion red. Another investigation undertaken by

the chemist for prominent private parties was a thorough testing of the
so-called Robertson electric process for the reduction of gold ores. This
process, like the Tichnor, is utterly at variance with accepted ideas of
chemists and metallurgists, and the investigation showed similar results
to the Tichnor in proving it of little value. In addition to these inves-

tigations the chemist has undertaken numerous analyses and assays for

private parties of no particular chemical interest. The time of the chem-
ist has of late been entirely occupied in overhauling and recording the
vast amount of reserve material stored in the Institution, the object
being to make a complete record of duplicates and reserves and to elimi-

nate all worthless material and make room for new contributions.

REPORT OF EXPLORATIONS IN NEW MEXICO AND ARI-
ZONA, BY JAMES STEVENSON.

Professor S. F. BAIRD:

DEAR Srr: I have the honor to present you herewith a brief state-
ment of the explorations made by the party under my charge during
last summer; giving, for the present, only an outline of the country
traversed and the aggregate results accomplished.

The party arrived at Santa Fé, New Mexico, about the first of Sep-
tember last, where a few days were Spent in arranging details for the
prosecution of the field work.

From Santa Fé the party traveled direct to the pueblo of Taos, by
way of the Rio Grande. At Taos about a week was spent in making
collections; many sketches were made, representing picture-writing on
the interior of the dwellings and estufas. Quite a number of photo-
graphic illustrations were made, showing the entire outlines of the vil-
lage, including many details of its structure, sufficiently to construct a
model. Portraits were also taken of the principal individuals of the
pueblo.

From Taos the par ty proceeded southward to the pueblo of San Juan.
From San Juan to Santa Clara, from Santa Clara to San Ildefonso,
from there to Nambe, thence back to Santa Fé. A few days more were
spent at the latter place in obtaining supplies for future work. We
again proceeded southward to the pueblo of Cochiti, which is situated
on the west bank of the Rio Grande, about 30 miles from Santa Fé.
The party spent several days at this place making collections, photo-
graphic and other illustrations. From Cochiti we traveled westward
about 30 miles to the pueblo of Jemez, situated near the sources of the
Rio Jemez. At this village some days were spent in making collec-
tions, photographs, &c. From Jemez we followed up the Rio Jemez to
the Hot Springs, near which we found several large ruins, both Indian
and Spanish. Many views were made of the ruins, as wells a collec-
tion of pottery fragments, stone implements, &c. From Jemez our
course was south, following the Jemez River. About ten miles below
Jemez we found the pueblo of Silla, or Sia; here, too, a collection was
made, and some photographs. Continuing down the river some miles,
we reached the pueblo of Sunta Ana. This pueblo we found to be much
larger than any we had visited, except, perhaps, Taos. Our investiga-
tions at this pueblo were as full and complete as those made at the
other pueblos. From Santa Ana we continued south, crossing the
Rio Grande, to the pueblo of Sandia. At this village a full collection
was made and an ample number of photographic illustrations to con-
vey the fullest impression of the pueblo. From Sandia we moved on
to Santo Domingo. This pueblo is located on the east bank of the Rio
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. LS

Grande, and between that and the line of the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fé Railroad. We also made a complete collection of pot-
tery, &c., at this point. From here we continued our journey up the
Rio Grande to the pueblo of San Feélipé. Here we also spent several
days making illustrations and collections. We then returned to Santa Fé,
from where a special trip was made, via the railway, to the pueblo of
Isleta. At each of the pueblos a sufficient time was taken to make
investigations of all kinds in relation to the inhabitants, and to make a
full typical collection of all their utensils, fabrics, &e., illustrating their
industries, We.

There are very many details and specimens of special interest which
can only be presented after an examination of the sketches, photo-
graphs, and specimens.

The object of greatest interest to the party was the discovery of a
class of ruins occupying a large area of country about 45 miles west of
Santa Fé, and lying around the base of the Jemez Mountains, and be-
tween these mountains and the Rio Grande. These ruins extend ina
semicircular manner from near Ildefonso around to the sources of the
Rio Jemez, and are in depth from 3 to 15 miles. The houses are ex-
cavated in the faces of perpendicular bluffs composed of a soft voleanic
tufa, very much resembling pumice stone; each bluff is shaped in its
outlines somewhat like a horseshoe, the whole being situated in series,
facing the river, and receding back from it, one above the other, toward
the Jemez Mountains. The accompanying pencil sketches, by Mr. F.
G. Galbraith, and one of the photographs will convey an impression of
their appearance. From these ruins a large quantity of stone imple-
ments were collected.

One other locality which came within view of the party, but which
was not examined for want of time, will prove of much interest. The
locality referred to is on either side of the Upper Jemez River, which
is bordered by numerous mesas from four to fifteen hundred feet in
height, and much broken or cut up by canons which have in many
instances separated the mesas from each other. Located on the sum-
mits of these mesas we found twenty-seven villages in ruins, which we
could only see with our glasses from the summit of a high mountain.
The mesas on which these ruins are situated are so high and difficult
of access that many days would be required to explore a single one
of them.

In summing up the results of the work for the season, I can do no
more than to give a list of the collections and illustrations made.

Photographs.—Twenty-two 11x14 views representing the pueblos of
Taos, San Juan, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Pojanquiti, Tesuque,
Nambe, Cochiti, Jemez, Jemez Ruins, Silla or Zia, Santa Ana, Sandia,
Isleta, Santo Domingo, San Félipé, and Picoris. Twenty-one 3x10
portraits, embracing the governors and other principal perséns of the
Pueblo tribes visited.
138 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Specimens.—Two thousand eight hundred specimens, embracing pot-
tery, pestles, mortars, baking stones, grinders, polishing stones, drills,
axes, spears, arrow-heads, scrapers, adzes, &c. Fabrics, such as blank-
ets, waistlets, anklets, leggins, dresses, head-dresses, &c. Also, toys,
bird-traps, spindle-whorls, gaming-stones, cart and plow, and many other
objects too numerous to specify.

Hoping this brief statement may serve your purposes for the time
being,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JAMES STEVENSON.

140 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE FIRST DECADE OF THE UNITED STATES FISH COM-
MISSION: ITS PLAN OF WORK AND ACCOMPLISHED RE-
SULTS, SCIENTIFIC AND ECONOMICAL.

By G. BRowN GOODE.*

There are nine departments of the government devoted, in part or
wholly, to researches in pure and applied science—the Geological Sur-
vey; the Coast and Geodetic Survey; the Naval Observatory; the
National Museum; the Department of Agriculture; the Entomological
Commission; the Tenth Census, with its special agencies for the study
of the natural resources of the country; the Smithsonian Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the Commission of Fish and Fisheries. The Smithsonian
Institution, established upon an independent foundation, should also be
mentioned, as well as the Medical Museum of the Army, and the various
laboratories under the control of the Army and Navy Departments.

The Geological Survey is not now carrying on any of the schemes of
zoological and botanical investigation engaged in by its predecessors.

The work of the Entomological Commission and that of the census,
though of extreme importance, are limited in scope and duration, while
that of the Agricultural Department is necessarily, for the most part,
economical. :

The work of the National Museum is chiefly confined to the study of
collections made by government surveys or individual collectors and sent
in to be reported upon.

The work of the Fish Commission, in one of its aspects, may perhaps
be regarded as the most prominent of the present efforts of the govern-
ment in aid of aggressive biological research.

On the 9th of February, 1871, Congress passed a joint resolution which
authorized the appointment of a Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.
The duties of the Commissioner were thus defined: ‘To prosecute investi-
gations on the subject (of the diminution of valuable fishes) with the view
of ascertaining whether any and what diminution in the number of the
food-fishes of the coast and the lakes of the United States has taken
place ; and, if so, to what causes the same is due; and also whether any
and what protective, prohibitory or precautionary measures should be
adopted in the premises, and to report upon the same to Congress.”

The resolution establishing the office of Commissioner of Fisheries
required that the person to be appointed should be a civil officer of the
government, of proved scientific and practical acquaintance with the

* [From the PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, Vol.
xxix, Boston Meeting, August, 1880.]

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Van

fishes of the coast, to-serve without additional salary. The choice was
thus practically limited to a single man for whom, in fact, the office had
been created. Professor Baird, at that time Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, was appointed and entered at once upon his
duties.

The summer of 1880 marks the tenth season of active work since its
inception in 1871. The Fish Commission now fills a place ten-fold more
extensive and useful than at first. The present essay aims to show, in
a general way, what it has done, is doing, and expects to do—its pur-
poses, its methods, its results.

The work is naturally divided into three sections:

1. The systematic investigation of the waters of the United States
and the biological and physical problems which they present. The sci-
entific studies of the Commission are based upon a liberal and philo-
sophical interpretation of the law. In making his original plans the
Commissioner insisted that to study only the food-fishes would be of
little importance, and that useful conclusions must needs rest upon a
broad foundation of investigations purely scientific in character. The
life history of species of economic value should be understood from be-
ginning to end, but no less requisite is it to know the histories of the
animals and plants upon which they feed or upon which their food is
nourished; the histories of their enemies and friends, and the friends
ard foes of their enemies and friends, as well as the currents, tempera-
tures, and other physical phenomena of the waters in relation to migra-
tion, reproduction, and growth. A necessary accompaniment to this
division is the amassing of material for research to be stored in the Na-
tional and other museums for future use.

2. The investigation of the methods of fisheries, past and present,
and the statistics of production and commerce of fishery products. Man
being one of the chief destroyers of fish, his influence upon their abun-
dance must be studied. Fishery methods and apparatus must be exam-
ined and compared with those of other lands, that the use of those which
threaten the destruction of useful fishes may be discouraged, and that
those which are inefficient may be replaced by others more serviceable.
Statistics of industry and trade must be secured for the use of Congress
in making. treaties or imposing tariffs, to show to producers the best
markets, and to consumers where and with what their needs may be
supplied.

3. The introduction and multiplication of useful food-fishes through-
out the country, especially in waters under the jurisdiction of the gen-
eral government, or those common to several States, none of which
might feel willing to make expenditures for the benefit of the others.
This work, which was not contemplated when the Commission was
established, was first undertaken at the instance of the American Fish
Cultural Association, whose representatives induced Congress to make
@ special appropriation for the purpose. This appropriation has since
142 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been renewed every year on a more bountiful scale, and the propagation
of fish is at present by far the most extensive branch of the work of the
Commission, both in respect to number of men employed and quantity
of money expended.

Although activity in this direction may be regarded in the light of:
applied rather than pure scientific work, it is particularly important to
the biologist, since it affords opportunities for investigating many new
problems in physiology and embryology.

The origin of the Commission, its purposes, and methods of organiza-
tion having been described, it now remains to review the accomplished
results of its work. In many departments, especially that of direct
research, most efficient services have been rendered by volunteers; in
fact, a large share of what has been accomplished in biological and
physical exploration is the result of unpaid labor on the part of some of
the most skillful American specialists. Although it would be interest-
ing to review the peculiar features of the work of each investigator, the
limits of this paper will not allow even a mention of them all by name.

Since the important fisheries center in New England, the coast of
this district has been the seat of the most active operations in marine
research. For ten years the Commissioner, with a party of specialists,
has devoted the summer season to work at the shore at various stations
along the coast, from Connecticut to Nova Scotia.

A suitable place having been selected, a temporary laboratory is fitted
up with the necessary appliances for collection and study. In this are
placed from ten to twenty tables, each occupied by an investigator,
either an officer of the Commission or a volunteer. From 1878 to 1879
important aid was rendered by the Secretary of the Navy, who detailed
for this service a steamer to be used in dredging and trawling, and this
year the steamer built expressly for the Commission is employed in the
same manner.*

The regular routine of operations at a summer station includes all the
various forms of activity known to naturalists—collecting along the
shore, seining upon the beaches,t setting traps for animals not otherwise
to be obtained, and scraping with dredge and trawl the bottom of the

days. In the laboratory are carried on the usual structural and system-
atic studies; the preparation of museum specimens and of reports.
Since the organization of the Commission the deep-sea work and the
investigation of invertebrate animals has been under the charge of Pro-
fessor Verrill, who had for many years before the Commission was
established been studying independently the invertebrate fauna of New
England.

In addition to what has been done at the summer station, more or less
exhaustive investigations have been carried on by smaller parties on
many parts of the coast and interior waters. The fauna of the Grand
Banks and other off-shore fishing grounds has been partly explored.
In 1872, 1873, and 1874 dredging was carried on from the Coast Survey
steamer Bache by Professor Packard and Mr. Cooke, Professor Smith,
Mr. Harger, and Mr. Rathbun. In 1879 Mr. H. L. Osborne spent three
months in a cod-schooner collecting material on the Grand Banks, and
Mr. N. P. Scudder as long a time on the halibut grounds of Davis’
Straits.

A most remarkable series of contributions has been received from
the fishermen of Cape Ann. When the Fish Commission had its head-
quarters at Gloucester in 1878 a general interest in the zoological work
sprang up among the crews of the fishing vessels, and since that time
they have been vying with each other in efforts to find new animals.
Their activity has been stimulated by the publication of lists of their
donations in the local papers, and the number of separate lots of speci-
mens received to the present time exceeds eight hundred. Many of
these lots are large, consisting of collecting-tanks full of alcoholic speci-
mens. At least thirty fishing vessels now carry collecting-tanks on
every trip, and many of the fishermen, with characteristic superstition,
have the idea that it insures good luck to have a tank on board, and
will not go to sea withottt one. The number of specimens acquired in
this manner is at least fifty or sixty thousand, most of them belonging
to species unattainable. Each halibut vessel sets, twice daily, lines
from ten to fourteen miles in length, with hooks upon them six feet apart,
in water twelve hundred to eighteen hundred feet in depth; and the
quantity of living forms brought up in this manner, and which had never
hitherto been saved, is very astonishing. Over thirty species of fishes
have thus been added to the fauna of North America, and Professor
Verrill informs me that the number of new and extralimital forms thus
placed upon the list of invertebrates cannot be less than fifty.

A permanent collector, Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, has been employed at
Wood’s Holl and vicinity since 1871, and many remarkable forms have
also been discovered by him.

No dredging has yet been attempted by the Commission south of Long
Island, though much has been done in shore work, especially among the
fishes, by special agents and friends of the Commission, and by parties
stationed here and there in the work of fish-culture. Mr. E. G. Black-
144 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ford, of Fulton Market, New York, by carefully watching the market
Slabs, has added at least ten species of fishes to the fauna of the United
States. Mr. F. Mather is studying the fish of Long Isiand and the
sound. Dr. Yarrow, Mr. -Earll, and others, have collected from Cape
May ‘to Key West. The Gulf States’ coast was explored last winter
by a party conducted by Mr. Silas Stearns, who spent nine months in
studying the subject relative to food and the census. The entire Pacific
coast has been scoured by Professor Jordan for the Commission and
the census, and the ichthyology of that region has been enriched by
the discovery of sixty species new to the fauna, forty of them being
new to science. <A similar investigation on the Great Lakes has been
carried over a period of several years by Mr. Milner and Mr. Kumlien.
The ichthyology of the rivers of the country has received much attention
from the many experts employed by the Commission in fishcultural work.

In addition to these local studies may be mentioned the general explo-
rations, such as are now being carried on for the oyster, by Mr. Ernest
Ingersoll and Mr. John F. Ryder, for the shad by Colonel McDonald, for
the smelt and the Atlantic salmon by Mr. C. G. Atkins, and the Quinnat
salmon by Mr. Livingston Stone.

A partial indication of what has been accomplished may be found in
the number of species added to the various faunal lists. Take, for in-
stance, the cephalopod mollusks of New England. In Professor Ver-
rill’s recently published monographs, twenty species are mentioned, thir-
teen of which are new toscience. Ten years ago only three were known.

I am indebted to Professor Verrill for the following estimate of the
number of species added within the past ten years to the fauna of New
England, mainly by the agency of the Commission :

It is but just to say that many of these species were obtained by Pro-
fessor Verrill in the course of his independent explorations in Maine
and Connecticut previous to 1871.*

~—* A few days after the reading of this paper a new fauna was discovered about one
hundred miles southeast of Newport, and several hundred numbers might now be
added to this enumeration.
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 145

A similar estimate for the fishes indicates the discovery of at least
one hundred species on the eastern Atlantic coast within ten years; half
of these are new to science. Forty species have been added to the
fauna north of Cape Cod; sixteen of these are new and have been found
within three years; seventeen have been described as new from the Gulf
of Mexico; sixty, and more, have been added upon the west coast. The
results of the summers’ campaigns are worked in winter by the special-
ists of the National Museum, and under the direction of Professor Ver-
rill, in New Haven.

One of the important featares of the work is the preparation of life
histories of the useful marine animals of the country, and great quanti-
ties of material have been accumulated relating to almost every species.
A portion of this has been published; more or less complete biographical
monographs having been printed on the bluefish, the scup, the menhaden,
the salmon, and the whitefish, and others are nearly ready.

Another monograph which may be referred to in this connection is
that of Mr. Starbuck on the whale fishery, giving its history from the
earliest settlement of North America.

The temperature of the water in its relation to the movements of fish
has from the first received special attention. Observations are made
regularly during the summer work, and at the various hatching sta-
tions. At the instance of the Commissioner, an extensive series of
observations have for several years been made under the direction of

“the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, at light-houses, light-ships, life-
saving and signal stations, carefully chosen, along the whole coast.
This year thirty or more fishing schooners and steamers are carrying
thermometers to record temperatures upon the fishing grounds, a jour-
nal of the movements of the fish being kept at the same time. One
practical result of the study of these observations has been the demon-
stration of the cause of the failure of the menhaden fisheries on the
coast of Maine in 1879—a failure on account of which nearly 2,000 per-
sons were thrown out of employment.

Another important series of investigations carried on by Commander
Beardslee, of the Navy, shows the error of the ordinary manner of
using the Casella Miller deep-sea thermometer; still another series
made by Dr. Kidder, of the Navy. and to be carried out in future, had
for its object the determination of the temperature of the blood of
marine animals.

Observations have also been made by Mr. Milner upon the influence
of a change from sea water into fresh water, and from fresh water into
sea water, upon the young of different fishes.

Mr. H. J. Rice carried on a series of studies upon the effect of cold in
retarding the development of incubating fish eggs.

A series of analyses has been made by Professor Atwater to deter-
mine the chemical composition and nutritive value of fish as compared
with other articles of food. This investigation is still in progress.

S. Mis. 31——10
146 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

In connection with the work of fish culture, much attention has been
paid to embryology. The breeding times and habits of nearly all of
our fishes have been studied, and their relations to water temperatures.
The embryological history of a number of species, such as the cod, shad,
alewife, salmon, smelt, Spanish mackerel, striped bass, white perch, and
the oyster, have been obtained, under the auspices of the Commission,
by Messrs. Brooks, Ryder, Scheffer, Rice, and others.

The introduction of new species, in water in which they were pre-
viously unknown, is of special interest to the student of geographical
distribution. Through the agency of the Commission the German carp
has already been placed in nearly every State and Territory, although
the work of distribution has only just begun, and the tench (Tinea vul-
garis) and the golden orfe (Idus melanotus) have been acclimated; the
shad has been successfully planted in the Mississippi Valley and on the
coast of California, and the California salmon in the rivers of the
Atlantic slope. The marzna, or lake whitefish, of Europe, has been
introduced into a lake of Wisconsin. It is not my purpose to speak of
the great success in restocking with shad and salmon several rivers in
which the supply was almost exhausted, and in planting the Schoodie
salmon in numerous lakes. By an act of international courtesy, Cali-
fornia salmon have been successfully introduced into New Zealand and
Germany. The propagation work has increased in importance from
year to year, aS may be seen by the constant increase in the amount of
the annual appropriation. A review of the results of the labors of the
Commission, in increasing the food supply of the country, may be found
in the annual reports; the rude appliances of fish culture ten years ago
have given way to scientifically devised apparatus, by which millions
of eggs are hatched where thousands were, and the demonstration of
the possibility of stocking rivers and lakes to any desired extent has
been greatly strengthened. This work was for six years most efficiently
directed by the late Mr. James W. Milner, and is now in charge of
Maj. T. B. Ferguson, also commissioner for the State of Maryland, by
whom has been devised the machinery for propagation on a gigantic
seale, by the aid of steam, which is now so successfully in use, revolu-
tionizing the art of fish culture.

The investigation of the statistics and history of the fisheries has
‘perhaps assumed greater proportions than was at first contemplated.
One of the immediate causes of the establishment of the Commission was
the dissension between the line and net fishermen of Southern New
England with reference to laws for the protection of the deteriorating
fisheries of that region. The first work of Professor Baird, as Commis-
Sioner, was to investigate the causes of this deterioration, and the report
of that year’s work includes much statistical material. In the same
year a zoological and statistical survey of the Great Lakes was accom-
plished, and various circulars were sent out in contemplation of the
preparation of monographic reports upon the special branches of the
fisheries, some of which have already been published.
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 147

In 1877, the Commissioner and his staff were summoned to Halifax to
serve as witnesses and experts before the Halifax Fishery Commission,
then charged with the settlement of the amount of compensation to be
paid by the United States for the privilege of participating in the fish-
eries of the Provinces. The information at that time available concern.
ing the fisheries was found to be so slight and imperfect that a plan for
systematic investigation of the subject was arranged and partially un-
dertaken. The work was carried on for two seasons with some financial
aid from the Department of State. In 1879 an arrangement was made
with the Superintendent of the Tenth Census, who agreed to bear a
part of the expense of carrying out the scheme in full. Some thirty
trained experts are now engaged in the preparation of a statistical report
on the present state and the past history of the fisheries of the United
States. This will be finished next year, but the subject will hereafter
be continued in monographs upon separate branches of the fisheries, such
as the halibut fishery, the mackerel fishery, the shad fishery, the cod
fishery, the herring fishery, the smelt fishery, and various others of less
importance.

Hundreds, and even thousands, of specimens of a single species are
oftenobtained. After those forthe National Museum have been selected,
a great number of duplicates remain. These are identified, labeled,
and made into sets for exchange with other museums for distribution te
schools and small museums. This is in accordance with the time-hon-
ored usage of the Smithsonian Institution, and is regarded as an im-
portant branch of the work. Several specialists are employed solely
in making up these sets and in gathering material required for their
completion. Within three years fifty sets of fishes in alcohol, including
at least ten thousand specimens, have been sent out, and fifty sets of
invertebrates, embracing one hundred and seventy-five species and two
hundred and fifty thousand specimens. One hundred smaller sets of
representative forms intended for educational purposes, to be given to
schools and academies, are now being prepared.

The arrangement of the invertebrate duplicates is in the charge of

‘Mr. Richard Rathbun; of the fishes, in that of Dr. T. H. Bean.

Facilities have also been given to many institutions for making col-
lections on their own behalf.

Six annual reports have been published, with an aggregate of 5,650
pages. These cover the period from 1871 to 1878. Many papers relat-
ing to the work have been published elsewhere—particularly descrip-
tions of new species and results of special faunal exploration.

AN EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF THE COMMISSION.

1871.—The Commissioner, with a party of zoologists, established the
first summer station at Wood’s Holl, Mass., other assistants being en-
gaged ina similar work at Cape Hatteras and the Great Lakes. He
also personally investigated the alleged decrease of the fisheries in
southern New England, taking the testimony of numerous witnesses.
148 APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

1872.—This year the summer station was at Eastport, Me., particular
attention being paid to the herring fisheries. The survey of the Great
Lakes was continued. Dredging, under the direction of Professor Pack-
ard, was begun on the off-shore banks. At the instance of the American
Fish Cultural Association, Congress requested the Commissioner to
take charge of the work of multiplying valuable food fishes throughout
the country. Work was begun on the shad, salmon, and whitefish, and
the eggs of the European salmon were imported.

1875.—The summer headquarters were fixed at Portland, Me. The
opportunities for research were greatly increased by the aid of the See-
retary of the Navy, who granted the use of an eighty-ton steamer.

Explorations in the outer waters between Mount Desert and Cape
Cod were carried on in the United States Coast Survey steamer Bache.
Operations in fish culture were carried on upon an extensive scale.

1874-1875.—In 1874 the zoological work centered at Noank, Conn.
The attempt was made to introduce shad into Europe. In 1875 the
station was for a second time at Wood’s Holl, where a permanent sea-
side laboratory, with aquaria, was now established. The number of
investigations this year was about twenty. The increase in the propa-
gation work was proportionately much larger.

1876.—This year the Commissioner was unable to take the field for
fishery investigations, having been instructed to exhibit, in connection
with the Philadelphia International Exhibition, the methods of fish
culture and the American fisheries. Much, however, was accomplished
by single investigators in various localities. The propagation work
continued. This year the first carp were introduced from Germany.

1877.—The field of investigation was resumed at Salem, Mass., and
later at Halifax, Nova Scotia. A large steamer of 300 tons made deep-
sea research possible. The Commissioner and his staff served as experts
before the Halifax Fishery Commission. The propagating work was
on the increase, and the government carp ponds were established in
Washington.

1878-1879.—In 1878 the summer station was at Gloucester, Mass. ; in
1879 at Provincetown. ‘These centers of the fishing interests were se-
lected that more attention might be devoted to studying the history,
statistics and methods of the sea fisheries; a plan for the systematic
investigation which seems yearly more necessary in view of the dissen-
sions between the governments of the United States and Great Britain.
In 1879 a combination was formed with the Superintendent of the Tenth
Census, by which the Commissioner was enabled to carry more rapidly
forward this branch of the work. Specialists were dispatched to all parts
of the country to study the biological, statistical, and practical aspects of
the fisheries. In 1878 the breeding of cod and haddock was accom-
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 149

plished at Gloucester. In 1879 the propagation of the oyster was
accomplished, by co-operation with the Maryland Commission under the
direction of Major Ferguson, and the distribution of the carp through-
out the country was begun.

1880.—The summer station is at Newport, R. I. The Fish Haak, a
steamer of 484 tons, constructed expressly for the work of the Commis-
sion, lies at the wharf, now equipped for scientific research, later to be
employed in the propagation of sea fish, such as the cod and the mack-
erel. Over fifty investigators are in the field in the service of the Com-
mission. The season was opened by the participation of the Commission
in the International Exhibition at Berlin. ‘The first honor prize, the gift
of the Emperor of Germany, was awarded to Professor Baird, not alone
as an acknowledgment that the display of the United States was the
most perfect and most imposing, but as a personal tribute to one who,
in the words of the President of the Deutscher Fischerei Verein, is re-
garded in Europe as “the first fisheulturist in the world.”
SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,

PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS DECEMBER 8, 1880.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: The Board of Regents has been called to this special
meeting at the request of the Executive Committee to consider two sub-
jects of importance, requiring action before its regular annual session.

At the last session of Congress the following act was passed :

AN ACT for the erection of a bronze statue of Joseph Henry, late Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. )

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution be, and are hereby, authorized to contract with W.
W. Story, sculptor, for a statue in bronze of Joseph Henry, late Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be erected upon the grounds of
said Institution, and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the
foundation and pedestal of the monument, the sum of fifteen thousand
dollars is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated.

Approved June 6, 1880.

(Forty-sixth Congress, second session, chapter 116.)

The Secretary of the Institution immediately informed Mr. Story of.
this action of Congress, and requested his views on the subject and in- |
formation as to his acceptance of the commission.

This correspondence is as follows:

‘¢ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
““ Washington, D. C., June 10, 1880.

‘“Srr: A bill providing for the erection of a statue of Prof. Joseph |
Henry, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, introduced by)
Senator Morrill, has become a law. A copy of this is herewith inclosed. |

‘As you will see, its essential points are the provision for a bronze '
statue of Professor Henry, to be placed in the Smithsonian grounds, »
and that the total cost, including expenses for the pedestal, &c., shall!
not exceed $15,000.
. “IT beg to inquire whether you will accept the commission under’
these conditions; and presuming that you will, I forward herewith as»

full a series of photographs of the illustrious deceased as can be sup-

plied by the Institution. This series includes those which in the opinion
of Professor Henry’s family are most characteristic likenesses.

“T shall be pleased to have from you any communication on this sub-
ject, and, if possible, designs for the proposed statue and pedestal, for
communication to the Board of Regents at their next annual meeting
in January, 1581.

“As this Board is to decide upon the construction of the statue, it
will not be possible to give you final authority in the matter until the
Board shall have taken action thereon.

‘“T am, meanwhile, very truly yours,
“SPENCER F. BAIRD,
“¢ Secretary.

“cw. W. Story, Esq.,

“American Sculptor, Rome, Italy.

Letter of Mr. Story to Professor Baird.

“VENICE, July 15, 1880.

“Sir: I have just received your letter of June 10, informing me of the
pill lately passed by Congress, by which the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution are authorized to contract with me for a statue in bronze of
the late Professor Henry, for the sum of $15,000, including the founda-
tion and pedestal of the monument, and asking me whether I will accept
this commission.

“Mr. Senator Morrill had already communicated to me this entirely
unexpected and agreeable news. Until his communication was made,
Thad no notion that it was intended to erect such a statue, but I most
willingly accept the commission, with hearty thanks to those friends
who, without any knowledge on my part, put forward my name as the
seuiptor.

“« My recollections of Professor Henry are in every way most pleasant.
He was very kind to me when I was last in Washington, and it will
give me pleasure to do all in my power to make a statue of him worthy
of his high distinction and his amiable character.

The photographs which you have had the kindness to send have not
yet arrived, but I have little doubt that they will supply me with the neces-
sary material. As you say nothing of a mask in plaster from the face,
I suppose none was taken. This I greatly regret, as it would furnish
me, in connection with the photographs, the absolute facts of the face,
as well as the character and expression. If such a mask was taken, or
anything was ever made of him containing the exact measures of his face
and features, I should be most glad to have them. If any bust was ever
made, however bad, it would be of use to me in determining points of
size and measurement. I hope, too, there may be among the photo-
graphs some one or more in projile, or at least three-quarters face. Do
not in such case be prevented from sending them merely because they
152 SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

are bad in expression or otherwise. What I want is facts, and themore —
I can have of these the better. They will not lead me astray as to ex-
pression. Small facts and details may be explained in one which are
not clearly determined in another, and enable me to make the head more
living and true.

‘J regret to hear that no absolute action can be taken by the Board
before January 1, 1881. This will greatly delay the execution of the —
statue, to which I was intending to devote myself immediately on my —
return to Rome in October or November, ‘so as to be able to finish the
model this winter. But if all final arrangement is postponed until Jan-
uary before the absolute commission can be given and the contract
made, the winter will have passed, and the execution of the statue will,
I fear, be necessarily postponed for a year, as it is impossible for me to
remain in Rome and exeeute the model during the summer without very
great inconvenience and difficulty.

‘““You wish me to send you, if possible, designs for the proposed statue —
and pedestal, for communication to the Board of Regents at their an- ©
nual meeting in January, 1881. Of course I can do this, if they think it ~
advisable or necessary ; but I must frankly say—I hope they will excuse —
me in so saying, as no kind of disrespect is intended, or want of confi- |
dence in their taste and judgment—that I think, if they have any faith
in my ability, it would be better for them to leave the conception and
execution of the statue entirely tome. There is nothing so dangerous
as to interfere with an artist in his design, or to judgeof it and criticise —
it from a small model. The freer he is, the more responsible he feels, —
and, if he has real ability, the less he is tampered with and directed, the
better his work will be. If he has not the requisite ability to do it by
himself, he should better not do it at all. No suggestions by any com- —
mittee and no directions and alterations will ever make his work good. —
My own experienve has been that this divided responsibility and design-
ing has almost invariably resulted in dissatisfaction on both sides. The —
artist can only do well with what isin his own mind, and not what is in —
the mind of others, and my own judgment is that he does far better iy
when left to himself, always provided he has real capacity for his work. — |
If I may be allowed to allude to my own personal experience, I may add
that in the case of almost the only public portrait statue of mine in
America, the committee, composed of gentlemen of high taste and pre-
tension to artistic culture, after rejecting my own first sketch, and in- —
sisting on my altering the attitude and arrangement to meet their views,
contrary to my notions, were finally persuaded, when the work was
completed and it was too late, that they had been entirely wrong in
dictating these changes, and regretted that they had interfered. Never-
theless they threw upon me the responsibility which belonged solely to
them. I made their statue and not mine, and they were disappointed,
as I foretold that they would be. But Ido not need to speak of my

|

I

t

SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 153

own personal experience; the experience of all artists is the same on
this point.

“ However, if despite this, the Board desires me to send them a sketch
IT can do so; but of course, as I have stated, this will delay the statue
for a year, and I cannot see the advantage.

“Tn fact, I have already made a sketch of the statue since I received
Mr. Morrill’s communication. But I doubt whether it would mean as
much to you and to the Board of Regents as it does to me; whether you
would rightly understand it in its roughness, and whether you would not
look for that finish which no free sketch ought to have, and rather look
to details than to matters and balance of composition, which are the all
in all of a sketch. I say this because I know one case where a sketch
was rejected because the likeness in the face was not striking, as if any
true artist would, in a mere sketch, attempt exact portraiture of the face.
It would be equally good as to composition and design with no face at
all, if it had the just movement.

“You say nothing as to details of the commission, or the size of the
statue, or the place where it is to be erected, or its surroundings. Is it
to be in the open air, or under cover in the buildings? Is its back-
ground trees, sky, or building? All these are very important consider-
ations in view of its effect and of its size.

“take it for granted that the pedestal is to be a simple one, and not
to have illustrative bas-reliefs or figures, inasmuch as the sum appro-
priated for the whole thing is less, or certainly not more, than what is
ordinarily paid for a statue alone without pedestal or foundation. I
also suppose by the reading of the act of Congress that this sum is to
cover the cost of the statue and “the entire expense of the foundation
and pedestal,” and this is all. It does not, as I understand it, include
boxing, transportation, insurance, and placing, as they are distinetly
not mentioned.

“Can you give me an estimate of the cost of making the foundation,
and approximate price of a simple pedestal executed in Washington, in
marble or red granite, or stone of any appropriate kind? This would
guide me in determining where I should make the pedestal, whether
here or in Washington, and of what material.

“As to the sum of $15,000 appropriated by Congress, does interest run
upon it from the date of the enactment? In regard to payment I sup-
pose you are aware that the ordinary rule is to advance to the artist
one-half the sum when the commission is given, or the work commenced,
to enable him to meet the necessary outlay and expenses, without re-
course to his own pocket.

‘1 mention all these particulars in order to avoid all misunderstanding.

“T again recur to the question of time, and I earnestly hope that it will
be possible for the Board of Regents to arrange definitely this whole mat-
ter at a much earlier period than that mentioned in your letter, Viz:
January 1, 1881, as it will involve the loss of a year. If I could have
154 SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

the commission and authorization to commence the work by the 1st of
October or November, I could finish the model by the spring and imme-
diately arrange for its casting in bronze during the summer so as to
have it ready to send to Washington by the 1st of October following
(1881).

‘‘1 suppose that the Board of Regents is equally interested with myself
in desiring the statue to be finished as soon as possible, and if they will
definitely authorize me to begin the model by the ist of November, I
can promise, unless some unforseen accident occurs, to finish it in bronze
by the 1st of January, 1882; otherwise I fear we shall have to put it
forward to January, 1883.

‘If the Board of Regents have faith in my ability and will trust me to ©
follow out my own ideas in this statue, [ will pledge myself to do my
best to satisfy myself and them, and to spare no pains to give them a
statue worthy of the subject, worthy of the place, and satisfactory to
the family, friends, and admirers of Professor Henry.

‘You must not expect too much. The male costume of the present
day is crude, graceless, and thoroughly unsculptural. But I will do
what I can to hide its awkwardness and ugliness without falsifying
truth and fact, and endeavor to render the statue serious and dignified
and natural. Isuppose that Professor Henry had no academic costume,
and that there is no peculiar professional dress in which he could be
represented. If there be, and the Board of Regents is willing that I
should clothe the statue in such a dress, I should most gladly do it.”
Then I should be able to drape him in some way at once dignified and
true to fact. The academic costume could be treated so as to make an
imposing statue. Insuch case, would you have the kindness to forward
to me the dress, that I may use it to model from? The silk academi¢
robes would be admirable and advisable, but I scarcely dare to hope
that he wore one, or that I may use it. What did he wear? If this
academic dress is out of the question, what may I represent him in? ~
Did he wear a cloak ?

“The sketch I have made representshim as in a buttoned frock-coat, |
over which is a loose open sack; it is in the attitude of meditation ; his |
head bent slightly forwards, looking down, one hand resting on a desk ~
or stand at his side, by which to break the horrible uniformity of the two )
legs of pantaloons, and give breadth and dignity to the base, and one °
hand across the breast midway, at the place of the upper button of the »
buttoned coat; on the stand are books on which his left hand is placed. |
On the whole, those who have seen it, think it simple, dignified, and |
thoughtful. If itis to be made in coat and trousers, I doubt if I could |
do better, but I shall think it over and make other sketches.

“¢ Will you be kind enough to send me any memoir that may exist of /
Professor Henry, so that I may have a more thorough knowledge of his *
character and services and labors than I now have. I beg you not to»
SPECIAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. 155

forget this, asit will greatly assist me in determining the exact character
to be given to the statue.

“T have written you avery long letter inthe hope of clearing the way
of all obstacles, and of letting you understand exactly what my views
and wishes are.

“Yours, faithfully,
OW, Wir SLORW:?

During the recess of Congress it was found impracticable to call a
meeting of the Regents, but their views were asked individually by the
Secretary as to the power of the Executive Committee to make a formal
contract with the artist and enable him to go on with the work.

The opinion of the majority was that this power could be exercised
by the Executive Committee. A meeting was therefore called of this
Committee on the 13th of November, 1880, when the subject was fully
considered and the following action taken:

“ Resolved, That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution inform
Mr. Story that the Executive Committee authorize him to proceed in
the execution of the bronze statue ordered by Congress June 1, 1880,
according to his own plan and designs, but that this Committee is not
empowered to make a formal contract for this purpose, although war-
ranted in such action by the individual expressions of Regents as con-
tained in letters received by the Secretary.

“Resolved, That a special meeting of the Regents be called on the 8th
of December, 1880, to consider the subject, and if the action of the Ex-
ecutive Committee is not confirmed, a cable message be immediately
sent to Mr. Story, and, if approved, a contract in due form be made out
and transmitted to him.”

This action of the Committee was communicated to Mr. Story by the
Secretary on the 13th of November.

Another subject demanding the consideration of the Board has been
presented to the Executive Committee.

A committee of citizens of Washington having presented a request
for the use of the new National Museum building for a reception to the
President of the United States elect, on the 4th of March next, after a
full consideration of the subject, in view of the fact that the building is
unfinished and not yet occupied as a Museum, and that such a contin-
gency would not again occur and would not therefore furnish a prece-
dent ; in view also of the fact that the expense of erecting a suitable
building would be very great and unnecessary, and, moreover, that the
President elect is and has been for many years a member of the Board
of Regents, whose aid and influence contributed materially to the erec-
tion of the new Museum, the Committee adopted the following:

‘¢ Whereas an application has been received from a committee of citi-
zens for the use of the unfinished building of the National Museum, for

the purpose of a public reception to the President elect, Hon. James A.
Garfield, on the evening of the 4th of March next; therefore,

“‘ Resolved, That the Executive Committee submit this application to
the Board of Regents at its next meeting, with its approval and with
the recommendation that the request be granted.”

The Committee furthermore make the following statement:

The new National Museum building has been substantially com-
pleted and made ready for occupancy within the appropriations by Con-
gress. A detailed account of the history of operations of its construe-
tion will be presented at the annual meeting of the Board in January
next.

The Building Commission has refrained from completing the floors of
the rotunda and large halls or naves according to the original plans,
which provided only for concrete and cement, on account of the remon-
strances of prominent members of Congress, who urged that such floors
were unsuitable to, and unworthy of, so fine a building, and their assur-
ances that appropriations would doubtless be made at the approaching
session of Congress for marble or tile floors for these halls.

The Committee report that provision has been made so that the floors
of the rotunda and four naves Jeading to the main entrance of the build-
ing may be laid in marble or tile instead of cement, and that if an ap-
propriation of $25,000 be made immediately, the building will be ready
for the reception of the President on the 4th of March next, fully adapted
and provided with heat, light, and all the facilities required for the oe-
casion.

In conclusion, the Committee respectfully submit the following reso-
lutions to the Board for adoption :

““ Resolved, That the Chancellor and Secretary of the Smithsonian In-
stitute execute a contract with Mr. W. W. Story, of Rome, for the statue
in bronze of the late Prof. Joseph Henry, authorized by the act of
Congress of June 1, 1880, with the provision for payment of the sum of
$3,750 to Mr. Story on completion of his design for the statue; the sum
of $3,750 on completion of the model in clay ; the sum of $3,750 on com-
pletion of the statue in bronze; and the sum of $3,750 on delivery and
erection of the statue with its pedestal in the city of Washington, on
the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, and furthermore that Mr.
Story shall cause the said statue to be insured for the amount of the ad-
vance payments to him, against perils by land or by sea, which insur-
ance shail, in case of loss, be paid to the Smithsonian Institution for the
benefit of the United States.

‘Resolved, That for the purpose of substituting a marble or tile floor-
ing, instead of concrete, as originally designed, for the large halls in the
National Museum, an appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars be
requested of Congress, to be expended according to the plans and under
the direction of the building commission of the Board of Regents of the

“Resolved, That the use of the new National Museum building be

REPORT OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING COMMISSION
FOR 1880.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 15, 1881.
To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: At your annual meeting on the 19th of last January,
the National Museum Building Commission submitted a report of opera-
_ tions in connection with the new building for the National Museum, from
their inception to the close of 1879.

In that report attention was called to the necessity for increased
accommodations for the national collections in charge of the Smithsonian
Institution; to the endeavors of your Board if previous years to obtain
from Congress ‘an appropriation for the same, and to their final success
in 1879 in securing an appropriation of $250,000 for the purpose.

Mention was also made that the Executive Committee of the Board of
Regents and the Secretary of the Institution, who are charged by resolu-
tion of the Board of January 17, 1879, with the duty of “ carrying into
effect the provisions of ary act of Congress that might (may) be passed
providing for the erection of a building for the National Museum,” had
organized under the title of “ National Museum Building @hunniseiaa

Also, you were informed of the action of the Commission in early
adopting such measures as appeared to it best calculated to realize with
the least possible delay the intention of Congress in making provision
for a new building; of the employment of Messrs. Cluss & Schulze as
superintending architects; of the acceptance by General Meigs of the
invitation of the Commission to act as its consulting engineer; and of
the opinions of Mr. Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol, and General
Meigs as to the sufficiency of the appropriation for the erection of a
building in accordance with the plans approved by Congress. Reference
’ was also made to the action of the Secretary of the Treasury in detailing
an officer of the Treasury Department to disburse the appropriation, by
_ which action the fund was made immediately available. In addition, a
resumé was presented of the active operations in the construction of the
building whereby you were made aware that ground was broken on the
1ith of April, 1879; that the concrete foundations were begun April 29;
that the brick work of the walls was commenced May 21, and that the
walls were completed on the 1st day of November.

Moreover, mention was made of the good fortune of the Commission
in securing exceedingly favorable contracts, especially for the brick and
iron work, previous to the early subsequent rapid advance in the prices

167
168 REPORT OF BUILDING COMMISSION.

of iron and other building materials; of the fact that the cost of the
heating apparatus was not included in the estimate of $250,000, and that
therefore an appropriation of $25,000 for this item had been asked of
Congress; and, finally, of the then pending efforts of the Commission to
settle the question of material for the cases, whether this should be wood
or iron.

Besides information upon the points above specified, an appended re-
port of the architects presented an interesting technical and descriptive
record of the plan and design of the building and a detailed exhibit of
the expenditures on account of construction to the close of the year 1879.
In the present report, therefore, it is only necessary for the Commis-
sion to review the operations of the year just ended.

The iron work of the roofs was satisfactorily completed by the latter
part of March, and the tin work and slating early in April?

The plastering, which was done partly by day’s work and partly under
contract, was begun early in March and finished by the latter part of
July. The plaster of the slate roofs is laid directly on the slate, and that
of the low, flat roofs on gratings fastened between the iron girders of the
roof and rendered fire-proof by a filling of mortar composed of plaster
of Paris and ashes—a form of ceiling suggested by General Meigs.

The painting and glazing has been satisfactorily done. In the inter-
est of economy in heating, it was decided to put both an inner and an
outer glass in the sash of all outside windows.

The supply-pipes for water and gas were laid by the close of February
and the work duly inspected and approved.

The wood floors have all been put down, excepting in the four square
halls. In the four main halls, or naves, and in the rotunda of the dome
it was originally intended to lay concrete, but owing to urgent remon-
strances against the use of this material as not being in keeping with
the architectural beauty and design of the building, Congress has been
asked for an appropriation of $25,000 to defray the expense of a marble
or tile floor for these halls. The request for this appropriation was in
accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of December 9th,
1880.

The heating apparatus is also in, and, with the exception of bronzing
a number of the radiators, Messrs. Baker, Smith & Co. have completed
their contract for this work. During the recent severe weather the ap-
paratus was subjected to a test more severe than will be likely to occur
again for a number of years, and it is a matter of congratulation to the
Commission, as wellas to the contractors, that the work gives entire
satisfaction.

A most economical arrangement connected with this heating appa-
ratus is that of two automatic traps whereby the condensed steam is
again brought to the boilers. While by this arrangement both time and
fuel for heating fresh water are saved, the fear of a lack of supply of

water to the boilers is eliminated, that originally used sufficing for at
least seven days.

The work of putting in the wires for the burglar-alarm telegraph,
telephone, and electric clocks and call-bells, which was begun in the sum-
mer, is now nearly finished. These wires, which are run through under-
ground trenches, either specially constructed for the purpose or for heat-
ing-pipes, will extend from a room in one of the north towers to each
window, door, and case in the entire building, and also to the police and
fire-alarm telegraphs. This electrical arrangement will constitute a val-
uable feature in the economy of administration of a structure so immense
as, and of the peculiar construction of, the new Museum building, since
it will lessen the necessity for a large corps of watchmen and attendants,
the locality of any attempt on the part of designing persons to open a
window, door, or case being at once automatically indicated in the cen-
tral office, or instrument room, where a watchman will be on duty at all
hours.

As the original estimates upon which the appropriation of $250,000
was based did not include a provision for the expanded system of water
and gas fixtures and electrical apparatus, an appropriation of $12,500
was requested therefor and readily secured.

In addition to the above, an appropriation of $1,000 * was secured for
a sewer to connect with the B street sewer to relieve the building from
water, which, on account of the inadequacy of the Seventh street sewer,
during heavy rains, backs up in the pipes and floods the cellars. This
relieving sewer will be constructed under the supervision of the engi-
neer of the District of Columbia, Lieutenant Hoxie.

For fuller information, however, the Board is respectfully referred to
the appended report of the superintending architects, which also presents
a detailed exhibit of expenditures.

During the year past the Commission has wee as often as was deemed
necessary. General Meigs, as consulting engineer, has generally been
present at the sessions of the Commission, while, as during the previous
year, his visits to the new building have been frequent and his inspec-
tion of the work close and critical.

In closing this report the Commission is happy to state that the build-
ing, with the erection of which it was charged, is substantially finished,
and that it hopes at the next annual session of the Board to be able to
congratulate the Regents on its entire completion and occupation.

Respectfully submitted.

170 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDING ARCHITECTS OF FIRE-
PROOF BUILDING FOR NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1880.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 1, 1881.

To the National Museum Building Commission, Smithsonian dnsbinutiong
Washington, D. C.:

GENTLEMEN: We have the honor to report to you the completion of
the new building under the appropriations available for the purpose,
and simultaneously to submit a report of operations on the construction
of the building since January 1, 1880, the date of our last report.

The progress of the work was such that the plastering of the building
could be commenced as soon as the state of the weather permitted it,
in the early part of the spring. It was completed by the middle of
August, and, after this, miscellaneous work for finishing, such as iron
balconies, railings, and stairways, were put up, all the offices were
floored and put in readiness for occupation, the cellars were laid with
asphaltic concrete, the wooden floors of all the outside halls were laid
upon a solid bed of hydraulic cement-concrete, and a concrete base was
laid for the floors of the main and square halls. All the numerous de-
tails of the steam-heating apparatus were attended to so that steam
could be put on with the advent of the cold weather; and though the
heavy walls and piers were considerably chilled by long-continued ex-
posure during the early fall and the excessive moisture in the unfinished
building, a comfortable heat was obtained within a few days and was
maintained during the coldest days of this unusually severe winter, no
more than a reasonable amount of fuel being used for heating the vast
space of about 3,500,000 cubic feet inclosed within the walls and roofs
of the building.

The asphalt facing of the floors of the main halls and rotunda, as in-
tended under the estimates, has not been put on, since with hardly any
difference of opinion it was held that nothing less than a chaste tiling
would do justice to the building, and provision ought to be made for
this without delay. On the other hand, much more than an equivalent
of the cost of this surfacing has been spent on work not included in the
estimates, but deemed more important for the opening of the building
at as early a date as possible.

The approaches to the building, for which always a separate estimate
is brought before Congress, have been mostly finished under the orig-
inal appropriation. We may be allowed to state a few of the items not
originally contemplated, but included in the construction accounts, to .

The conditions imposed upon us to keep within the appropriations
have been complied with in good faith. A substantial fire-proof build-
ing has been completed at a less cost per square foot. of the inclosed
area than that of the temporary buildings erected for the International
Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876.

The principle adopted to have all the windows in side walls and lan-
terns glazed with two sheets of glass, having an intermediate air-space,
has led to favorable results, and it is desirable to extend the same feature
over the under sides of the roofs in the halls by the introduction of light
‘iron ceilings about 14 inches distant from those plastered undersides ;
the intermediate air-space in this case to be packed with a non-conduct-
ing fire-proof material, such as mineral-wool or its equivalent. This
will secure for the building a very pleasant temperature in summer,
reduce the expense of heating the huge building in winter, and remove
any tendency towards condensation on those exposed undersides during
the rapid changes of temperature and hygrometric condition of the
atmosphere peculiar to this climate and locality.

Having given a technical description of the design and construction
of the new building in our last report, we now report specially on the
theory, practice, and results of warming the building. In consideration
of the great cubic contents of air inclosed in the building, and the com-
paratively very few sources of vitiation of the same, the system of heat-
ing by direct radiation has been adopted. For winter ventilation the
spires of eight towers and the lanterns of halls and dome are made
available whenever necessary, and for summer ventilation a sufficient
number of improved iron sashes pivoting in iron frames have been
added and inserted in the windows of the side walls and the lanterns of
the building.

The heating coils and radiators are placed in the rooms to be warmed
and heat the air by contact with the radiators; the surrounding walls
and solid objects absorbing a certain amount of radiant heat and: again
heating the air by contact. ;
172 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

To ascertain the demands to be made upon the apparatus for heating,
the conditions of the building were studied, in order to arrive at the loss
of heat inside the building for an external temperature of zero and an
internal temperature of 70° Fahrenheit. This loss of heat is caused by
the exposed surfaces of the building, which consistof hollow brick wails
plastered inside, of tin roofs lined with felt and supported by non-con-
ducting fire-proof material plastered inside, and of windows having two
thicknesses of glass with inclosed air-space. It is increased by an
amount due to leakages, absorption of heat by the soil, transfusion of air
by the opening of doors, &c. To allow for contingencies, the required
heating surfaces resulting from above causes were increased by about
fifteen per cent. and the generating power of steam three times.

The necessity for such a disproportionate amount of generating power
‘s explained by the fact that the condensation is enormous when the
steam circulating pipes and radiators are first heated up, because their
specific heat is very high when compared with that of theair. When the
circulation is once established, the demand upon the boilers decreases
to an amount equal to the heat radiated and carried off by the air from
the heating surfaces, provided that the main circulating (or flow) pipes,
which are not to act as radiators, but rather as vehicles to carry the
heat to the most extreme points of the building, are protected by a suffi-
cient coating of non-conducting material, which should be provided for,
the sooner the better.

It is evident that for such nice adjustments there were no funds .
available so far.

Continued satisfactory heating by the direct radiating system de-
mands, with such an extensive apparatus, constant and close attention ;
otherwise there will be a great waste of fuel in mild weather, and well-
founded complaint of overheating.

As the building is heated up, radiators must be shut off until no more
heating surface is left than is required to balance the loss of heat, which
in this climate is very variable. The offices require more heat, rela-
tively, than the halls; and if, after the building is warm throughout,
steam were shut down entirely to prevent overheating the halls, as
would happen in mild weather, the offices could not be occupied for
want of heat long before the first sensation of coolness appeared in the
halls. The cause of this is that the ratio of cooling surface to space (or
cubic contents) is much greater in the case of the small rooms than in
the halls, which form a huge reservoir of heat, contained in the inside
walls and objects as well as in the air.

It is necessary to put the whole force on once a day in order to get
circulation of steam throughout. In mild weather shut down as soon
as overheating begins. In extremely cold weather the full force is to
be kept up continuously.

It being established by experiment that about 25 per cent. of the entire
heat absorbed in evaporating the water in the boilers will be restored by
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. 173

returning the water of condensation in the coils to the boilers, at a tem-
perature of about 175 degrees, instead of heating new supplies of water
from an average winter temperature of 56° to the boiling point, special
efforts were made in this direction. In order to prevent clattering and
noise the steam-pipes have a fall from the boilers, so that any condensed
water flows in the same direction with the steam and not against it, until
points are reached where the steam-pipes are tapped and discharge the
condensed water into the return pipes, which are started at the extreme
end or lowest point of the flow-pipes with an adequate fall towards the
boilers.

The extreme length of each of two lines of steam-conducting and re-
turn water-pipes is about an eighth of a mile.

To promote the usefulness of the building, these “Hie systems of
pipes were buried in large-sized underground ducts. The grade of the
public sewers does not allow the boilers to be set deep enough for re-
turning the condensed water to them exclusively by gravitation, as is
most desirable, hence it is conducted into a receiver located on the floor
of the boiler-room, from which it is raised by automatic steam-traps lo-
cated above the boilers. These traps are, firstly, supplied with steam
from the boilers. They are so constructed that by the movement of a
lever connected with a float the steam is shut off, when it condenses
in the traps, causes a partial vacuum, and lifts the water from the re-
ceiver into the traps by suction. As the ascending water fills the traps

it lifts the float, the lever of which gradually opens the steam-valve,
permits the steam to enter the traps, and at the same time causes an
equalization of pressure in the boilers and traps whereby the water, by
gravitation, flows back into the boilers. To operate these traps no more
pressure is required than sufficient to raise the water from the receiver
to the trap.

Since immediately after starting the fires the pressure in the boilers
may be too small, a steam-pump is at hand by which the water is forced
direct from the receiver into the boilers. This pump works with less than
two pounds pressure per square inch, and forces either hot or cold water.
When a fresh supply of water should be desired and the steam-pressure
is greater than that in the main water-pipes, the pump is connected with
these mains and the boilers supplied therefrom. Ordinarily the boilers
are fed direct from the water mains.

The steam for warming the building is generated in four tubular boil-
ers of 56 inches diameter and 15 feet length, containing each 72 tubes of
3 inches diameter. The heat of the fire passes first under the whole
length of the boilers, then back through the tubes and finally over the
top of the boiler, giving the greatest possible exposure of surface and
resulting in the greatest attainable economy of fuel.

The boilers are connected overhead by steam-pipes of 5 inches diame-
ter from each, with stop-valves ; these lead into a drum of 12 inches di-
ameter to which two 8-inch main steam-pipes are attached, each of which
we; REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

supplies a pipe system warming one-half of the building. Valves are
placed in those 8-inch pipes, and the whole apparatus is arranged so
that one, or all, or any number of the four boilers can be used at pleas-
ure and steam shut off from either half of the building, or from any de-
sired number of the radiators. The steam-conducting pipes are gradu-
ally reduced in size, as the several branches for the supply of the radia-
tors are taken off until at the ends of the lines at the northeast corner of
the building, which is most remote from the boiler-room, the pipes have
but 2 inches diameter.

The return water-pipes begin at this remote corner with 14 inch diam- ~*
eter and are gradually enlarged as they receive the water of condensa-
tion from radiators and mains until they ber minate in the receiver in the
boiler-room as above described.

Rising lines of pipes for warming the offices of the second and third
stories are attached to the horizontal piping, with suitable return-and-
relief and air-valve pipes.

The best provision is made in all lines of pipes for expansion and con-
traction by offsets, angles, or expansion joints, as the case requires.

The horizontal pipes are mainly supported on rollers. All joints of
pipes and fittings are made without the use of red lead or cement, the
threads being all tapered and exactly fitted so as to be tight when
simply screwed together, iron into iron.

Branch pipes extend out from the main pipes, and to these the valves
and pipes of 204 upright radiators are screwed. These are all finished
in bronze, and contain in the aggregate 13,600 square feet of radiating
surface, which give out the heat generated in the boilers.

The efficiency of the heating apparatus, though evident, was tested
by a series of observations made during the coldest weather of Christmas
week.

During the daytime, with the outside temperature at an average of
5° below zero, the interior temperature did not fall below 624° above
zero when but three of the four boilers were in use, the pressure of
steam being not above 12 pounds, and the consumption of coal 7,500
pounds, for twenty-four hours.

Observations were also made during the night-time, after all heat had
been purposely cut off from the building and the fires banked, with the
mean external temperature at 114° below zero, the temperature within
the building did not fall below 48° above zero. This is a creditable
result for the yet incomplete provisions taken against losses of heat by
the exposed surfaces.

The observation is also most gratifying that there is teealy any dif-
ference between the temperature on the main floor and that of the gal-
leries and occupied higher parts of the building abutting on the halls.

Thanks to the prompt and efficient co-operation of Col. Thos. L. Casey,
the engineer in charge of public grounds, the roads and lawns leading
to and surrounding the building were speedily adapted to new grades
and verdure restored.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1880.

179
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX is to furnish summaries of
scientific discovery in particular directions; occasional reports of the
investigations made by collaborators of the institution; memoirs of a
general character or on special topics, whether original and prepared
expressly for the purpose, or selected from foreign journals and proceed-
ings; and briefly to present (as fully as space will permit) such papers
not published in the “Smithsonian Contributions” or in the * Miscella-
neous Collections” which may be supposed to be of interest or value to
the numerous correspondents of the Institution.

180
RECORD OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.

INTRODUCTION.

While it has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date in its history to enrich
the annual report required of them with scientific memoirs illustrating
the more remarkable and important developments in physical and bio-
logical discovery as well as the general character of the operations of
the Institution, this purpose has not hitherto been carried out on any
very systematic plan. Believing, however, that an annual report or
summary of the recent advances made in the leading departments of
scientific inquiry would supply a want very generally felt, and would
be favorably received by all those interested in the diffusion of knowl-
edge, the Secretary has had prepared by competent collaborators a
series of abstracts showing concisely the prominent features of recent
scientific progress in astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry, miner-
alogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthropology. Other subjects which might
properly have been included, such as those of terrestrial physics and
meteorology, geography and hydrography, microscopy, &e., as well as
the more practical topics of agricultural and horticultural economy, engi-
neering, technology, and industrial statistics have, for the present, been
omitted, both for want of time in which to have them properly digested
and for want of space to allow them any sufficient presentation. With
every effort to secure prompt attention to all the more important details
of such a work, various unexpected delays frequently render it imprac-
ticable to obtain all the desired reports in each department within the
time prescribed. In such cases it is designed, if possible, to bring up
such deficiencies and supply them in subsequent reports.

A similar digest, having the title of “Annual Record of Science and
Industry,” prepared under the general editorship of the present Secre-
tary of the Institution, was commenced in 1871, and published in a duo-
decimo form by the Messrs. Harper, of New York.* This work was con-

*The “Annual Record of Science and Industry” was itself a successor to a similar
year-book entitled ‘‘The Annual of Scientific ISiscovery ”, commenced in the year 1850
under the editorship of Mr. David A. Wells, and published by Messrs. Gould and Lin-
coln, of Boston. The last-mentioned work was satisfactorily continued for sixteen
years, from 1850 to 1865, inclusive, when it was suspended by the appointment of its edi-
tor, Mr. Wells, tothe commissionership of internal revenue under the United States Treas-
ury Department. The work was, however, resumed in 1867, under the editorship of

tinued through eight annual volumes; but was discontinued with the
volume for 1878. The present undertaking may, therefore, be considered
as in some sense a continuation of the work published by the Messrs.
Harper. |

It is scarcely necessary to remark thatin a résumé of the annual pro-
gress of scientific discovery so condensed as the present, the wants of the
specialist in any branch can be but imperfectly supplied; and very many
items and details of great value to him must beentirely omitted. While
the student in a special field of knowledge may occasionally receive hints
that will be found of interest, he will naturally be led to consult for,
fuller information the original journals and special periodicals from
which these brief notices or abstracts have been compiled.

The contemplated plan of devoting some 250 pages of the annual re-
port to such a compilation is not designed to preclude the introduction
into the {*General Appendix,” as heretofore, of special monographs or
discussions that may prove interesting to the scientific student.

INTRODUCTION.

As the space available for the record of astronomical progress is com-
paratively small, the accounts here given must necessarily be the barest
summaries, whose chief end is to call attention to work which has been ©
done, in order that a reference may be made to more extended papers if
desired. . At the same time it is clearly impossible to give a specific ref-
erence to each of the papers consulted.

For such bibliographic information the réader is once for all referred
to DARBOUX et HOUEL’S Bulletin des Sciences Mathématiques et Astrono-
miques (monthly, Paris), to Nature (weekly, London), to Science (weekly,
New York), to the Observatory (monthly, London), and to other standard
journals. Free use has been made of reviews by writers in these and
other periodicals, particularly of the Record of Astronomy, published by
Dr. J. L. E. DREYER in the Scientific Proceedings of the Royal Dublin
Society.

NEBULZ AND CLUSTERS.

The Earl of Rossz has published Parts 1 and 2 (0° to 14% R.A.) of
the “ Observations of Nebulz and Clusters of Stars made with the six-
foot and three-foot reflectors at Birr Castle from the year 1848 up to
about the year 1878” (Trans. R. Dublin Soc., Vol. II). This publication
(of which the third part, comprising the last ten hours of R.A., is in
the press) embodies all the work done on nebulz since the erection of
the six-foot telescope in 1845. In 1850 and 1861 abstracts of the observ-
ations on more interesting objects appeared in the Philosophical Trans-
actions, but all these abstracts are given over again in the new publica-
tion, with the sole exception of the copperplate engravings, to which,
however, in all cases references are made in the text. Though even now
not every single note in the observing ledgers is published, nothing has
been suppressed which can be of the slightest value or importance.
The observations are given in the observer’s own words, and the notes
which were added by Mr. DREYER while arranging the work for pub-
- lieation are easily distinguished by being inclosed in brackets. These
notes deal especially with questions of identification, and nearly all the new

nebulz which were found at Birr Castle in the course of years and which

formed the weak point of HERSCHEL’s General Catalogue, have now by
re-examination and comparison with D’ARREST’S observations been iden-
tified and their positions determined. The work done during the last
five or six years (1872-78) differs in many particulars from the obser-
vations taken in earlier years, with which the paper of 1561 made the
scientific world acquainted. Most of the more important nebulie having
been frequently drawn, there was latterly not much to be done in this
direction, but another important field was opened up by taking micro-
metric measures of groups of nebule, or of nebule and neighboring stars.
Into the text have been introduced diagrams of such groups orof a nebula
and the stars near it, while four plates contain lithographic reproduc-
tions of more elaborate sketches, which had not already been published
among the engravings in the former papers. How much more detail is
given in the new publication than in the paper of 1861 may be seen from
the circumstance that while the fourteen hours of R.A. in the latter only
cover 34 pages, in the new paper they extend over 129 pages.

A series of measurements of all the planetary nebul has been com-
menced with the 15-inch refractor of the Harvard College Observatory.

Dr. C. H. F. PETERS has lately published in Urania an important
list of nebule found on his ecliptic charts.

Photogra rat of the Nebula of Orion.—Prof. HENRY Daiecn distributed
in 1880 a large number of photographs of the nebula in Orion, taken by
means of his 11-inch Clark refractor with an exposure of 51 minutes.

Stars down to the 10th magnitude were shown and the details of the —

more prominent masses of the central and brightest regions were for

the first-tiine permanently and automatically registered. The work so _~

well begun has been brilliantly prosecuted, and in March, 1881, Dr.
DRAPER succeeded in obtaining fine photographs with an exposure of

140 minutes! These give a much greater extent to the nebulous por- —

tions registered and bring out many details, and what is astonishing —

they show stars whose magnitudes Prof. PICKERING has photometri-
cally determined to be from 14.0 to 14.7 of Pogson’s scale. The mini-
mum visibile of an 11-inch telescope is about 14.2, so that it really ap-
pears that Dr. DRAPER has photographed stars which are very near

the limit of naked eye vision if not actually below it. The mechanical —

perfection of the appliances which render such feats possible can only

be appreciated by those used to the apparatus furnished by the best —
makers, which is far inferior to that made by Dr. DRAPER for his own —

use.
FIXED STARS.

Fixed stars, catalogues of stars, star charts, double stars, binary stars,
variable stars, etc.—Decidedly the most important recent contribution of

observing astronomy is the ‘‘ Uranometria Argentina*” of Dr. GOULD.

* “Resultados del Observatorio Nacional Argentina.” Vol. I, ‘‘ Uranometria Ar-
gentina,” Buenos Aires, 1879, 4to, with atlas.
ASTRONOMY. 185

This is the first astronomical publication of the national observatory of
the Argentine Republic.

One of the first objects of Dr. GOULD, on the establishment of the
new observatory in 1870, was the making of a uranometry of the southern
sky, which should contain the position and magnitude of every star
visible to the naked eye at his station.

The model on which it is made is the celebrated “ Uranometria nova,”
of ARGELANDER, of Bonn, which was published in 1843. The latter
contains 3,256 stars from the first to the sixth magnitude, which are to
be seen above the horizon of Bonn. Its magnitudes are expressed in
thirds of « whole magnitude, and ARGELANDER’s scale, so established,
has served for a standard in all the observations in the northern hemi-
sphere. Dr. GOULD’S problem was to extend this enumeration over the
whole southern sky, keeping accurately to the standard set by ARGE-
LANDER. This is by no means an easy task, as the minimum visibile at
Cordoba was found to be not the 6.0 magnitude, but 7.1; that is, stars
can still be seen at Cordoba which have less than four-tenths of the
light of the faintest of ARGELANDER’S stars. This extraordinary trans-
parency of the atmosphere required the extension of ARGELANDER’S
seale downward, and that this was accomplished successfully is shown
by a comparison of the magnitudes of all the stars which are common
to the two uranometries. The mean difference is rather less than one-
tenth of a magnitude. The method of settling the standard was to
select: from the “ Uranometria nova” a belt of stars which had the same
altitude at Bonn and at Cordoba. The 722 stars of this belt were ob-
served by the four assistants at the southern observatory (Messrs. Rock
THOME, DAviS, and HATHAWAY), and those stars for which their esti-
mated magnitudes were precisely the same were chosen for standards.
Thus, a number of stars of each magnitude, as 3.00, 3.33, 3.66, 4.00, 4.33,
etc., became types to be constantly referred to. From these types a
number of others in a zone near the south pole (and hence constantly
visible) were constructed. The process of observation consisted in re-
ferring each star in the heavens to this set of types, so that its magni-
tude could be finally determined upon. This was done by the four
observers independently, but often in duplicate, and so well were the
standards fixed that each observer’s comparisons differed from the mean
of all four by quantities very much less than a tenth of a magnitude.
It should be said that the magnitudes in the southern uranometry are
given to tenths.

In all there are 10,649 stars visible to the naked eye at Cordoba. Of
these, 8,198 are as bright or brighter than the 7.0 magnitude, and these
alone are given in the cavalogue and in the maps. Of these 10,000 stars
more than 46,000 observations were made. In the progress of the work
quite a number of variable stars were detected, of each of which a full

history is given in the notes. Indeed Dr. GouLD’s firm conviction is
186 ASTRONOMY

that “stellar variability is by no means an exceptional phenomenon,
but that at least one-half of the stars above the 7.0 magnitude vary
by amounts which careful observation cannot fail to detect.”

An atlas of fourteen charts accompanies the catalogue, and gives an
exact pictorial representation of the state of the sky at the epoch of the
work. Besides giving a representation of the isolated stars, the shad-
ings and gradations of the milky way are given with the greatest detail
from repeated observations and revisions. By no means the least valu-
abie part of the work is the discussion of the course of the milky way
throughout the whole sky. The course of the galaxy is now, and only
now, known with precision. The data of this and preceding uranome-
tries are discussed by Dr. GOULD with reference to the question of the
distribution of the stars in space, starting from the assumption that, on
the whole, stars are equally scattered. Dr. GOULD finds that there is a
marked excess of the stars from the first to the fourth magnitude
Furthermore, he finds that there is in the sky a zone or belt of bright
stars as marked as the milky way, and that all the bright stars are dis-
tributed more symmetrically with respect to this belt than with regard
to the milky way itself. From these facts Dr. GOULD concludes that
‘Cour own solar system forms a part of a Small cluster distinct from the
vast organization of that which forms the milky way.” This cluster may
perhaps be comparable with that of the Pleiades, since by a rough esti-
mate it would seem to consist of about 500 stars. It is situated nearly
in the plane of the belt of bright stars.

No more valuable work than this has been given to astronomy within
the decade; and it will be a source of pride to Americans to find such
important contributions coming from one of their countrymen in the
southern hemisphere, with which the name of GILLISS was already in-
dissolubly associated.

There are no marks about the work itself which would show that it
was done in a community in about the state of Europe during the dark
ages, and it will add, not to the value of the work, but to the credit of
the workers, if one remembers that this is strictly the case.

Dr. AUWERS has published, for the zone committee of the Astronom-
ische Gesellschaft, an important work, ‘‘ Fundamental Catalog fiir die
Zonen-Beobachtungen am nérdlichen Himmel.” (Leipzig, Engelmann,
4to.) This catalogue of 539 stars, on which the places of all the stars
between —2° and +80° Decl. down to the 9th mag. inclusive will de-
pend, is founded on the following systems of standard places: Pulkova,
1845 and 1865; MS. of Pulkova Observations, 186974; MS. of Bradley’s
Stars from Greenwich Observations 1836-72 on the system of the first
7-year Catalogue; Greenwich 9-year Catalogue; Harvard College Ob-

servatory, vol. x; Engelmann’s Declinations, 1866-70; Leiden Declina- _

tions, 1864~70.
At the Berlin meeting of the Astronomische Gesellschaft reports on
ASTRONOMY. 187

the zone observations were read. The following account is taken from

Dr. DREYER’S report. Much progress has been made since then.

80-75. Kasan. , Observations finished, except a few; reductions far
progressed; printing commenced.

75-70. Dorpat. Only 920 observations yet to be made; more than half
the reductions to 1875.0 finished.

70-65. Christiania. Zones finished; about 90 per cent. reduced.

65-55. Gotha (formerly Helsingfors). Zones finished; reductions far
advanced.

55-50. Cambridge, U.S. Observations finished; reductions progress-
ing well.

50-40. Bonn. About 5,000 single observations remain to be made; re-
ductions far deme!

40-35. Lund. Observations commenced in September, 1878; the re-
ductions are progressing with the zones.

30-30. Leiden. Finished:

30-25. Cambridge (England). About 4,000 single observations to be
made yet. The mean places are calculated up to the end of
1874, apparent places to the end of 1876.

25-20. Berlin. Not yet commenced.

20-15. Berlin. Finished, but not yet reduced.

15-10. Leipzig. Zones finished; R. A.’s almost all reduced to 1875.0
zeros for declinations partly computed.

10-5. Leipzig. Has been commenced.

h+-1. Albany. Observations were commenced in een 1878.
+ 1to-2. Nicolajeff. Much interrupted by the Russo-Turkish war.

A second edition of the Washington Catalogue of Stars has been
jssued. Since the first edition was published in 1873, Professor YAR-

- NALL had accumulated many observations, which he, before retiring

from the Observatory, embodied in a second edition. Many stars which
had only been observed once or twice, either in right ascension or de-
clination, were thus re-examined. The author died suddenly, on Feb-
ruary 27, 1879, the complete volume only reaching him a few moments
before his death.

Dr. ROBINSON has published “Places of 1,000 Stars, observed at the
Armagh Observatory.” The stars are those of the fainter ones in the
“ Histoire Céleste” (nearly all between 6th and 7.5 mag.), which have
not been recently observed at other observatories. The instruments at
Armagh not being optically powerful enough for this work, the mural
circle was furnished with a new telescope having an object-glass of seven
inches aperture. The observations were all made by the Rev. Cu. Faris,
in the years 186876, each star being observed four or five times. Only
the mean results are given. j B

The first volume of the second series of the ‘ Annales de V’Observa-
toire de Bruxelles” contains an ‘“‘ Uranométrie Générale,” by M. Hovu-
188 ASTRONOMY. u

ZEAU. During a stay in Jamaica the author resolved to form a new
Uranometry, which should possess the advantage above all others hith-
erto published, that it was to be the work of asingle individual, obsery-
ing all the stars in both hemispheres visible to the naked eye within a
short space of time. He accordingly commenced working on January
28, 1875, and the work was finished on February 28, 1876. He had first
prepared maps, on which all the stars were plotted down without regard
to magnitude; then every region was gone over two or three times, and
the magnitudes carefully estimated, the six usual classes being used,
but each class only divided into two halves. The atlas thus formed
consists of five plates, on which the stars, their letters, the names and
limits of the constellations (but not their figures), and the milky way
are depicted. The latter has “been attended to with great care, the
deeper or paler hue of the light-green color representing greater cr lesser
brightness. The catalogue of stars for 1880 contains 5,719 stars. M.
HovuzEauv has examined the distribution of the stars in four ways: 1,
with respect to the solar equator; 2, with respect to the direction of the
sun’s proper motion; 3, perpendicular to this direction ; 4, with respect
to the milky way. No law whatever was found in the first three ways,
while the fourth mode of proceeding confirmed W. STRUVE’S conclusion
that the density of stellar layers parallel to the plane of the milky way
decreases very regularly and gradually towards the poles of the latter.

JULIUS SCHMIDT has, in continuation of his researches on the colors of
stars, published an extensive series of color estimations, made chiefly
with the finder of the Athens refractor, from 1872~78. Only for Are-
turus has he been able, with any certainty, to find a variation of color.
It is mostly very bright stars he has observed, and he investigates the
difference in the estimation, according to whetber the finder or the re-
fractor was used, and finds a greater difference the nearer the color is to
white.

A “new star” of 8.8 mag. was found in November by Mr. BAXEN-
DELL, according to two Dun Eecht observations in 7" 54™ 458.67 + 8° 39!
39.6 (1879.0). According to VOGEL, the spectrum is very remarkable.
with many dark bands, especially in the more refrangible part.

PARALLAX OF STARS.

Nearly the whole of Part III of the “ Astronomical Observations and
Researches made at Dunsink” is devoted to annual parallax. The first
paper contains a discussion of observations ot the planetary nebula H.
IV. 37 from August, 1871, to August, 1872, by Dr. BRUNNow. The
nebula has in the center a well-defined point resembling a star of the
eleventh magnitude. This was compared in declination with a star
of the tenth magnitude, and the parallax was found to be perfectly in-
sensible, a result which agrees well with that of a similar series of ob-
servations by Professor BREDICHIN, of Moscow.

A notice of an elaborate paper by Dr. ELKIN on the parallax of Alpha

pile. sie
ASTRONOMY. 189

Centauri must be deferred till the next year, as the paper is not now
before the writer.

A new determination of the parallax of 61 Cygni, by Dr. BALL, forms
the subject of the next paper. This determination differs from others
on the same object in one particular, viz, that the preceding star instead
of the following one has been observed. The method of observation
used is that of differences of declination, and the observations were
made on thirty-five different nights between July 3, 1877, and June 1,
1878. The resulting parallax is 0.465, in pretty good accordance with
the results of BESSEL (last three months 0.54), SrRUVE (0.51), and
AUWERS (0/56).

A third paper, also by Dr. BALL, describes the first results of a series
of reconnoitering observations in search of stars with a large annual par-
allax. These observations are only intended to reveal large parallaxes
(0.7) or more, and each object is only observed twice a year with six
months’ interval, when it is 90° from the sun, and at the two extremities
_ of the major axis of the parallactic ellipse. |The paper contains the dis-
cussion of the observations of forty-two objects, chiefly red and variable
stars. The result is that in almost every case the parallax is certainly
less than 1’, and most probably does not exceed 0.5. These objects will
therefore not be observed any further, but it is Dr. BALL’s intention to
continue this kind of observations. His working list contains red and
variable stars, stars with a large proper motion, and others chosen for
various reasons, nearly all north of the 30° parallel.

According to Herr GEELMUYDEN, of Christiania, the star Arg. Oeltzen,
11677, has a perceptible parallax (A. N. 2237). This star of the ninth
magnitude has a proper motion of —0°.507 and + 0/.21. The resulting
parallax, 0/’.27 from measures of Aa and 0/’.24 from measures of Ad with
a Star preceding, is only considered provisional, but the subject seems
worth following up.

DOUBLE STARS.

Tn 1841 and 1842 the Pulkova refractor was used for an examination of
the northern hemisphere in search of double stars. The second part of
the catalogue thus formed embraces systems, the components of which
are of or above the eighth mag., and the distance between which are
from 32” to 2’. Most of these objects have never been observed micro-
metrically, and the series of heliometer measures of some of them, which
Dr. Scour, of Strassburg, publishes in the A. N. 2255-56, will there-
fore be of interest, though only comprising a small number of objects.
Systems closer than 40’ were measured by quadruple distances, wider
pairs by double distances. By means of an artificial pair of stars it was
found that the position angle had no appreciable influence on the meas-
ures of distance, and that the two methods of measuring the distances
showed no constant difference. _

Volume XLIV of the Memoirs of R. A. S. contains a very extensive
work by Mr. BURNHAM: “ Double-star observations made in 1877~78,
190 ASTRONOMY. ;
at Chicago, with the 184-inch refractor of the Dearborn Observatory,
comprising: I. A Catalogue of 251 New Double Stars with Measures;
II. Micrometrical Measures of 500 Double Stars.”

Up to afew years ago the Dearborn refractor, with which CLARK
discovered the companion of Sirius in 1862, was idle. ft has, however,
since, in the hands of Mr. BuRNHAM, done excellent work. Confining
himself to the subject of double stars this distinguished observer has,
in the course of six or seven years, first working with a 6-inch, after-
wards using the 184 inch refractor, made this subject his own to an ex-
tent that is truly surprising. Though many observations are yearly
being taken of double stars by a good many observers, the study of
these important objects is by no means being furthered to the extent
one should have expected from the vast amount of time and labor ex-
pended. As Mr. BURNHAM justly remarks, in the preface to the paper
we are here considering, many observers have gone on from year to
year observing over and over again the same familiar stars, of which
Castor, 7 Virginis, « Lyre may be cited as examples. Couples which
small instruments of three or four inches aperture would show suffi-
ciently well are thus again and again being observed with fine refrac-
tors of six or seven inches aperture or upwards, while a very great
number of stars are hardly ever if at aH looked for. “Omit the observa- —
tions of DEMBOWSKI and O. STRUVE and our knowledge of nine-tenths
of the double stars would not be materially advanced in the last thirty
years.” Mr. BURNHAM has from the beginning shown that he does not
follow the ordinary beaten track, and his numerous discoveries of close
and difficult pairs have proved him to be an unusually sharp-sighted
and attentive observer. In nine previous lists he had given the places
of 482 new double stars, mostly rather difficult pairs, which few would
have discovered with a 6-inch refractor. The present (tenth) list of 251
new objects raises the total number of new double stars discovered by
Mr. BURNHAM to 733; of these 251 stars, 75 pairs are less than 1” apart.
His observations of old double stars embrace chiefly such ones which —
require a large aperture to be brought out well, or which have not been
recently observed by others. Particular attention has also been paid to
certain difficult pairs discovered by Mr. ALVAN G. CLARK.

No. 5 of the publications of the Cincinnati Observatory contains “ Mi-
crometrical Measurements of 1,054 Double Stars from January 1, 1878,
to September 1, 1879.” Though the discovery of new double stars has
only been considered a secondary object, nearly 200 new pairs have been
detected during the progress of the work at Cincinnati. The measures
are all given in full detail and occupy 151 pages; the mean results are
given separately.

The systematic errors in measures of double stars have been investi-
gated by Professor THIELE in a paper: “Castor, Calcul du mouvement
relatif et Critique des observations de cette étoile double.” (Copen-
hagen, 1879.) The author has chosen Castor partly because the orbital
ASTRONOMY. 191

motion is slow and can be represented by a simple formula of interpola-
tion, partly because it has been very frequently measured by almost all
observers of double stars. First, three normal places were formed which
represented the distances and position angles observed since 1815, and
an angle of position from BRADLEY’S and W. HERSCHEL’S measures.
From these and the ratio of the sector to the time, formule for computing
distance and position angle as functions of time by means of the eccen-
tric anomaly were derived and an ephemeris computed from 1718 to
1900. With this ephemeris all individual observations by every obser-
ver were compared and the mean error determined for every observer
within a period during which he might be supposed not to have changed
his way of measuring. Every observer is now followed from one period
to another and the changes in the mean error determined, whereby vari-
ations in his systematic error reveal themselves.

Dr. SEELIGER has made an elaborate examination of MADLER’S
measures (A. N. 2288). MADLER’s distances appear to be considerably
less accurate than O. STRUVE’S, while his position angles do not appear
to have larger mean errors than those of O. STRUVE.

The most important series of double-star measures published since
Mensure micrometrice is that given in Volume LX of the Pulkova Ob-
servations, comprising the work of OTTo STRUVE with the 15-inch
refractor since about 1840. An elaborate introduction details the
observations of artificial double stars and the method of applying the
corrections thus obtained to the measures of real stars. Section I is
devoted to the re-measurement of a large number of the most interest-
ing of the stars forming the catalogue of the elder SrRuvE. Section
II contains the measures of nearly all the stars of the revised edition
of the Pulkova catalogue of 1850, and about thirty additional pairs dis-
covered subsequently (0 515 to 547). The only other systematic observa-
tions of these stars were made by the late Baron DEMBOWSKI about
1860. As many of these pairs are rapid binary systems, and nearly all
of them interesting from the closeness and inequality of the components,
the Pulkova measures, giving earlier epochs, are specially valuable.

A valuable contribution to the literature of this department, and sec-
ond to none in practical value to the observer, is FLAMMARION’S “Cata-
logue des Etoiles doubles et multiples en mouvement relatif certain.”
This work contains a complete list of all double stars the components of
which have shown any decided change either from orbital or proper
motion, with all the published micrometrical measures down to 1878,
arranged in chronological order, and notes as to the character and extent
of the motion, the most recently computed orbits of binaries, ete. As a
working list for the practical observer it is specially valuable, since the
Stars which most need observing can be at once selected.

The ‘‘Hand-Book of Double Stars,” by Messrs. CROSSLEY, GLED-
HILL, and WILSON, published in 1879, in addition to an extensive cata-
192 ASTRONOMY.

logue of binary and other interesting stars by Mr. GLEDHILL, compris-
ing altogether some fifteen hundred objects, contains chapters on the
equatorial and the observatory by Mr. CROSSLEY; on methods of obsery-
ing and the instruments which have been used in this work by Mr. GLED-
HILL; on micrometers by Mr. CROSSLEY; on the methods of computing ~
double-star orbits, analytically and graphically, by Mr. WILSON and Dr.
DoBERCK, and the bibliography of the subject by Mr. GLEDHILL. The
catalogue is conveniently arranged in order of R. A., but the measures
of each star are placed opposite the names of the respective observers,
an arrangement far less convenient than a simple chronological one.
On the whole the work is an excellent one, and contains many valuable
suggestions to amateurs, not ordinarily found in astronomical books.
Professor HOLDEN has tabulated the magnitudes and Colors of 162
stars which are certainly binary, according to a list furnished by Mr.
BuRNHAM, and finds that of these the components of 122 binary stars of -
the same color differ in magnitude on the average only 0™ 5, whilst those
of 40 of different colors differ 2™4. The colors and magnitudes are for
the most part taken from M. STRUVE’s estimations. Professor HOLDEN
quotes a conclusion by Dr. HuGGINS and Professor MILLER that the
characteristic colors of stars are due to the absorptive action of their
atmospheres, and compares it with the two following facts: (1) The color
of a solid body cooling would as it cooled pass through the shades white,
yellow, orange, red, but not through green, blue, or purple. (2) Wedo not
find isolated stars of decided green, blue, or purple colors. A few such
have been recorded, but in most cases erroneously. In general such

stars are small, and apparently invariably associated with larger stars.
