REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1879.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution ;

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith, the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
1879:

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

INTRODUCTORY.

The year just passed his been marked by a number of interesting and
important incidents in the history of the Institution, which will be de-
tailed in their proper places; the most noteworthy being the memorial
services, held in the United States Capitol, in honor of Professor Henry,
and the commencement of work upon the new fire-proof building for the
National Museum.

The usual routine of business has been prosecuted by the Institution
during the year, the various departments receiving their share of atten-
tion and expenditure.

HENRY MEMORIAL SERVICES AND VOLUME.

In conformity with the action of the Board of Regents in reference to
the holding of a public commemoration of Prof. Joseph Henry, a joint
resolution of Congress was passed appointing January 16, 1879, as the
time, and the Hall of the House of Representatives as the place, of such
memorial services. These proceedings took place at the time announced,
in the presence of a very large and distinguished auditory. Dr. Asa
Gray was appointed by the Board of Regents to “prepare a sketch of
the life, character, and public services of Professor Henry,” which it was
ordered should form part of the exercises at the Capitol.

The Vice-President of the United States, supported by the Speaker
of the House, presided on the occasion. After prayer by the Rev. Dr.
James McCosh, president of Princeton College, addresses were deliv-
ered by Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, Senator and Regent (the address being
read by Vice-President W. A. Wheeler); Hon. R. E. Withers, Senator
and Regent; Prof. Asa Gray, of Harvard University, Regent; after
which Hon. Hiester Clymer, Member of the House and Regent, read
the telegrams received on the occasion. The remaining addresses were
delivered by Prof. William B. Rogers, of Boston; Hon. James A. Gar-
field, Member and Regent; Hon. S. S. Cox, Member, and formerly a

a |
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Regent, and by General William T. Sherman, a Regent. The exercises
were concluded with prayer by the chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Dr.
Byron Sunderland.

In addition to the Senators and Members of the House assembled,
the President of the United States, members of the Cabinet, justices of
the Supreme Court, and other dignitaries, were present; and the pro-
ceedings were solemn and impressive, as befitted the occasion.

By joint resolution of Congress, these memorial addresses were
ordered to be printed in the ‘‘ Congressional Record,” which was accord-
ingly done on the 4th of March following. The same resolution also
directed the printing of fifteen thousand copies of the said proceedings
in a “*Memorial Volume,” which volume should include also “such arti-
cles as may be furnished by the Board of Regents.” <A selection has ae-
cordingly been made by the special committee of the Regents appointed
January 17, 1879 (consisting of Messrs. Gray, Parker, and Baird), em-
bracing a few commemorative discourses delivered elsewhere, to form a
concluding portion of the memorial volume. This material is now in
the hands of the Publie Printer, and it is hoped will soon be published.

Among other gratifying illustrations of the respect in which the mem-
ory of Professor Henry is held by the community, we may mention the
efforts made to perpetuate it by means of works of art. Reference has
been made in previous reports to the life-size portrait, painted, at the
request of the Board of Regents, by Mr. Le Clear, of New York; and,
also, to a similar portrait as to size and general character, by Mr. Henry
Ulke, of Washington. <A copy of the latter has been ordered by gen-
tlemen in Philadelphia for the American Philosophical Society. A
crayon portrait, also by Mr. Ulke, and considered an excellent likeness,
has been furnished by him to Princeton College and other institutions.

Mr. Clark Mills, the well-known sculptor, has modeled a bust of Pro-
fessor Henry partly from a cast taken after his death. A copy of this
in plaster has been placed in the Smithsonian Institution.

Mr. C. V. Burton spent some time during the year at the Institution
in modeling a small-sized bust, of which he has disposed a large number
of copies.

A medallion likeness was made by Mr. Barber, the engraver of the
Philadelphia mint, and a medal has been struck with this as the obverse
side.

A likeness has also been engraved on steel at the Treasury Depart:
ment, to accompany the Memorial Volume, an appropriation of five hun-
dred dollars having been made by Congress for the purpose.

Another steel portrait has been engraved and published by the Messrs.
Appleton, of New York, in their Annual Cyclopedia for the year 1878.

The Institution is also in possession of an oil painting of Professor
Henry, painted from one or two sittings only, and presented by the
artist, Mr. Ingalls. Excellent photographs have been taken of him by
Gutekunst, of Philadelphia, and by Messrs. Smillie, Gardner, Brady,
and Fassett, of Washington.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

A statue of Professor Henry.—A few weeks ago (December 16, 1879)
the Hon. Mr. Booth introduced in the Senate the following bill provid-
ing for a statue of Professor Henry in the grounds of the Smithsonian
Institution :

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of twenty thou-
sand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appro-
priated, out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not
otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of erecting a statue of Joseph
Henry on the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution.

Sec. 2. The money herein appropriated shall be expended under the
direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.*

APPOINTMENT AND ELECTION OF REGENTS.

By the terms of the act of Congress, the three members of the Board
of Regents selected by the Speaker of the House to act in that capacity
are appointed for a single Congress, or for two years; their term of
service expiring on the fourth Wednesday of December, on which day,
according to law, the appointment of new members is to be made.

These appointments were made by the Speaker. on the 4th of April,
1879, by renewing the terms of service of Hon. Hiester Clymer, of Penn-
sylvania, and Hon. J. A. Garfield, of Ohio, and by appointing Hon. Joseph
E. Johnston, of Virginia, in the place of Hon. Alexander H. Stephens,
of Georgia. It is for the Board of Regents to say whether this apparent
informality will in any way vitiate the appointments, and render it desi-
rable that they be renewed at the present session.

The vacancy in the Senatorial Regents, caused by the expiration of the
term of Hon. A. A. Sargent, was filled by the appointment, by the Presi-
dent of the Senate, on the 21st of March, of Hon. Newton Booth, of Cali-
fornia.

The terms of four of the six citizens at large, namely, of Dr. John
Maclean, of Princeton, Hon. Peter Parker, of Washington, Prof. Henry
Coppée, of Pennsylvania, and Prof. Asa Gray, of Cambridge, having
also expired, a joint resolution reappointing them, introduced in the
Senate by Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, was passed, and approved by the
President on the 17th of December.

*It is gratifying to be able to state here that since the date of the above, a modifica-
tion of this bill (introduced into the Senate by the Hon. Justin S. Morrill, of Vermont,
and into the House of Representatives by the Hon. Hiester Clymer, of Pennsylvania)
passed Congress unanimously and was signed by the President on the Istof June, 1880.
The act is entitled ‘‘Aw Act for the erection of a bronze statue of JoserpH HENRY, late
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,” and is in the following terms: ‘Be it
enacted, §c., That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution be, and are hereby
authorized to contract with W. W. Story, sculptor, for a statue in bronze of JosSEPH
HENRY, late Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be erected upon the grounds
of the said Institution; and for this purpose, and for the entire expense of the founda-
tion and pedestal of the monument, the sum of $15,000 is hereby appropriated out of
any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.”
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In this connection I would also call the attention of the Board of Re-
gents to the fact that the law of Congress, in establishing six years as
the term of service of the six Regents elected as citizens at large, pro-
vides, at the same time, that two vacancies shall occur at the beginning
of each new Congress and be filled by election. I am unable to say in
what manner there happened to be four vacancies at a time; but in this,
as in the case previously mentioned, it is for the Board of Regents to
determine what action, if any, shall be taken in the premises.

MEETING OF THE ESTABLISHMENT.

The act of Congress organizing the Smithsonian Institution provides
for an annual meeting of the establishment, although there is no special
business to be prosecuted by that body, with the exception of a general
inspection of the condition of the Institution. The meetings, although
proposed by the Secretary, have, by the direction of the President,
mostly been omitted. The following table shows the number of meetings
held since the commencement of active operations by the Institution :

August 1, 1849. June 6, 1853. July 15, 1854.
May © 3, 1853. May 2, 1854. June 4, 1873.
May 17, 1853. June 6, 1854. May 5, 1877.

The usual notice of a meeting on the 6th of May, 1879, was made to
the President; but, in the absence of any special necessity, it was, by
his authority, indefinitely postponed.

FINANCES.

In the report of the Executive Committee will be found a detailed
statement of the finances of the Institution, which are believed to be in
better condition than at any previous time, all arrearages having been
paid and a larger balance than usual being on hand.

The following is a statement of the condition of the Smithsonian fund
at the beginning of the year 1880:

Smithson, of England, deposited in the Treasury of the

United States, in accordance with the act of Congress of

THE HABEL BEQUEST.

Previous reports of the Institution contain allusions to the explora-
tions and researches of Dr. Simeon Habel. This gentleman was of
Austrian birth; graduated in 1846 at the Vienna University, and for
several years had been the resident-physician in charge of a public hos-
pital. In consequence of his liberal views, he was obliged to leave
Europe and seek a home in America. His love of nature and the
desire to advance science led him to undertake an extended tour
through Central and South America. Before doing this, however, he
spent several months at the Smithsonian Institution, in making himself
familiar, under the direction of Professor Egleston, then in charge of the
Geological Department, with the most important species of minerals and
rocks. Subsequently, during seven years, he made collections in natural
history and observations in meteorology, geography, geology, and ar-
cheology.

Among the regions of South America to which Dr. Habel devoted
special attention were those of the guano deposits of Peru and of the
remarkable group known as the Galapagos Islands. Of the peculiar
bird fauna of these islands, Dr. Habel made large collections, which
were fully described by Messrs. Sclater and Salvin in the proceedings
of the Zoological Society of London.

Returning to New York about the year 1877, he devoted himself
to the elaboration of his researches and, in time, prepared for the In-
stitution, a memoir entitled “The Sculptures of Santa Lucia Cosumal
whuapa, with an account of travels in Central America and on the North-
western coast of South America.” This work was published by the In-
stitution in 1878, and contains a brief account of Dr. Habel’s ethnologi-
cal and archeological researches, and a minute descripticn of a group of
sculptures discovered by him at Santa Lucia Cosumalwhuapa, a small
town in Guatemala. The variety of ornamentation, the skill in execu-
tion, and the grade of refinement exhibited in the designs upon these
bas-reliefs, as well as the almost total absence of sculptures hitherto re-

; .
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ported on the southern side of the Sierras, induced the Institution, on
the recommendation of Profs. W. D. Whitney and J. H. Trumbull, to
include Dr. Habel’s paper among its publications.

The author was invited to visit Washington, where a room was pro-
vided for him at the Institution, and the drawings of these sculptures
were reproduced by an artist, under his personal supervision. Dr. Ha-
bel highly appreciated the aid thus rendered him, and informed Profes-
sor Henry of his intention to leave a part of his estate to the Institution,
to repay, at least in part, the cost of the’publication of his memoir.

The Institution having learned of the death of Dr. Habel on the 1st
of January, 1879, steps were taken to secure the legacy which he had
promised as indicated in the following letter, deposited by him in the
Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, New York:

“Davip LEDWITH, Esq.,
‘* Comptroller of the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank :

“ DEAR Sir: I have left with the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank,
for safe-keeping, three account-books in my name, with the order that
the money deposited in the bank on each respective book should be paid
after my death to the following persons and institution, namely :

‘1. One thousand dollars of the account on book No. 122426 to Ernest
Haeckel, of Jena, in Germany, and the remainder of said account to the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington.

‘¢2. All the amount in my favor on book No. 125437 should be paid to
Stephen Pearl Andrews.

“3. The money in trust for Lizzie Fleischman on book No. 125436
should be paid to said person.

“* Requesting the bank will comply with said order,

“J am, respectfully, yours,
‘DR. HABEL.”

Mr. Ledwith, the comptroller of the bank, on the 26th of February,
1879, presented a statement to the Institution of the amount to the credit
of Dr. Habel on the account-book No. 122426, above referred to, showing
a balance of $1,402.59. Of this $1,000 was paid to Professor Haeckel in
accordance with the instructions of Dr. Habel, and the remainder,
$402.59, paid to the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

It is proper to state that every facility was rendered by the officers of
the bank in turning over to the Institution the bequest of Dr. Habel.

As it is the policy of the Institution to fund all moneys that may be
received other than as income, I would suggest that the amount received
from Dr. Habel be increased from the income of the Institution to $500,
and that this sum be added to the Smithson fund as the Habel be-
quest. It will be remembered that, by a law of Congress, the Institution
is authorized to increase its principal in the United States Treasury to a
million dollars. In a somewhat similar case, that of Mr. James Hamil-
ton, of Carlisle, Pa., the amount of $1,000 was deposited in the Treasury
as the Hamilton fund.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

RESEARCHES.

In the last report an account was given of an investigation of the
ancient solar eclipses by Mr. Todd, of the Nautical Almanac Office.
Among a number of eclipses added to the list then given are three ob-
served in China in 709 B. C., 601 B. C., and 549 LB. C., being the eclipses
which have formed the subject of a paper by Schjellerup, of Copenhe-
gen. During the past year the work of this investigation has consisted
mainly in the collection of data and their preparation for discussion.
As the research progresses, there seems reason for extending the scope
of the research to include a large number of ancient ecliptic dates.

Apparatus for Testing Stone.—Many years ago a series of experiments
were conducted at the Smithsonian Institution, under the direction of
Professor Henry, in regard to the strength and durability of building
mnaterials, primarily for the purpose of determining what varieties of
marble and other stones were best adapted for the construction of the
extension of the United States Capitol. The apparatus used in these
experiments has since been lying idle in the Smithsonian building, and
as it occupied valuable space it has been returned to the arsenal, from
which it was originally borrowed. It has there been put in order, and
is how again in use by the Ordnance Bureau of the Army.

LABORATORY.

As stated in the last report, after a partial suspension of active opera-
tions in that direction, the laboratory of the Institution was put in order,
and again made available for scientific research. This has always. been
an important feature in the operations of the Institution, and is one of
those especially required by the act of Congress.

A thorough overhauling of the old instruments, and equipment was
_ made under the direction of Dr. Endlich, the chemist in charge, and all
obsolete apparatus and unserviceable material was eliminated. The
chemical and physical departments of the colleges in the District, such
as the Columbian, Georgetown, and Howard University, were invited
to select from this unserviceable matter what they could use for pur-
poses of instruction, the remainder being suitably disposed of. The
apartments were then altered to meet the requirements of the present
day, and a sufficient amount of apparatus and equipment obtained to
make a fairly efficient working establishment.

The work of the laboratory consists partly in determining the charac-
ter of various minerals belonging to collections in the National Museum,
and partly in carrying on researches asked for by the various depart-
ments of the government. No private work of this kind is undertaken
by the Institution; but whenever a chemical investigation of any sub-
ject is required by the proper authorities it is carried out, if the time of
the chemist will permit.

Under the first head, the identification of large numbers of specimens,
previously undetermined, has been completed, the series placed in the

S. Mis. 54-——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mineralogical department, and the duplicates made up into sets for dis-
tribution to various educational establishments throughout the country,
or to be held for exchange for other minerals. Turther reference to this
subject, however, will be found under the head of the National Museum.

Among the investigations carried on by the Institution for the benefit
of the government may be mentioned the following:

An examination of the character and chemical composition of the
Appolinaris water, at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, a
controversy having arisen between the custom-house authorities in New
York and the importers of Appolinaris water, as to whether the article
imported under that name really came unchanged from the springs or
was artificially charged with other substances, especially carbonic acid.
To solve this problem the services of several chemists were invoked, but
these furnished contradictory results, and the Smithsonian Institution
was therefore asked by the Treasury Department to give the subject
proper attention, specimens of the water being duly supplied. This was
among the most laborious researches ever intrusted to the Institution
for prosecution, requiring the constant labor of the chemist for several
weeks for its accomplishment. A report was finally made and trans-
mitted to the Secretary.

Another investigation was as to the comparative percentages of carbon
in different brands of steel, made at the request of Chief Engineer Shock,
of the Bureau of Steam Engineering of the Navy Department.

In addition to the chemical work actually performed in its laboratory
for the government, the Institution has also acted as adviser to the de-
partments in securing specialists for investigations too extensive for
the time and apparatus of its chemist, or which, for other reasons, could
not be undertaken by him. Among these may be mentioned an ex-
amination of crude opium, for the amount of morphine it contained,
made for the Treasury Department by Dr. Theodore G. Wormley, of
the University of Pennsylvania, and by Dr. W. M. Mew, U.S. A., of
Washington, We.

The attention of the inspector of marine products for the city of
Washington having been attracted by the occurrence of green oysters
among those offered for sale, the health department, under Dr. Smith
Townshend, requested of the Smithsonian Institution an investiga-
tion as to the cause of this color, the popular impression being that it
was due to the presence of copper in the water, and denoted a poisonous
condition of the oysters. Although this phenomenon is quite well known
im Hurope, and green oysters are considered in France an especial delicacy,
the examination desired was made by Dr. Endlich with very perfect tests
and without detecting any copper. In this connection it may be stated
that recent investigations in Europe have shown that the green color is
due to the presence of minute alge on which the oyster feeds voraciously.
In France the oysters are kept in pits along the seashore, where the
highly-prized tinge is very soon acquired.

By a resolution of Congress the Secretary of the Institution was ap-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

pointed a member of a commission to investigate the merits of signal
apparatus to give warning of the accidental occurrence of fire, and dur-
ing 1879 Mr. Watkins made experiments in the laboratory of the Insti-
tution to test his invention for this purpose.

In this connection it may be stated that the Secretary of the Institu-
tion has, by resolution of Congress, been appointed a member of the
commission on improving the ventilation of the hall of the House of
Representatives at the Capitol, and that he has attended the meetings
of this commission and rendered it such service as his time and oppor-
tunity permitted bim.

TELEGRAPHIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES.

There are many astronomical discoveries, which, for the purpose of
co-operative observation, require immediate announcement to observers
in distant localities. Among such discoveries are those of planets and
comets, or of bodies which are generally so faint as not to be seen except
through the telescope, and which being in motion require that their place
in the heavens be made known to the distant observer before they so far
change their position as not to be readily found. For this purpose the or-
dinary mail conveyance requiring at least ten days, is too slow, since in
that time the body will have so far changed its position as not to be found,
except with great difficulty; and this change will become the greater if
the body is a very faint one, for in that case it could only be discovered
on a night free from moonlight, which of necessity, in ten or twelve
days, must be followed by nights on which the sky is iJuminated by the
moon, and all attempts to discover the object would have to be post-
poned until the recurrence of a dark night. Indeed, even then the
search would often prove in vain; and it would not be, in some cases,
until after a set of approximate elements had been calculated and trans-
mitted, that the astronomers on the two sides of the Atlantic would be
able fully to co-operate with each other.

These difficulties were discussed by some of the principal astronomers
of America and Europe, and an application was made to the Smithsonian
Institution, through Dr. C. H. F. Peters, of Clinton, N. Y., to remove them
by transmitting intelligence immediately through the Atlantic telegraph
cable. For this purpose the Institution, in 1873, applied to the New York,
Newtoundland and London Telegraph Company and to the Western Union
Telegraph Company to be allowed free transmission of this kind of in-
telligence, and received through Cyrus W. Field, esq., and William Or-
ton, esq., with that liberality which has always attended applications of
a similar character by the Institution, the free use of all the lines of
these companies for the object in question.

Similar privileges were granted in Europe for transmitting the intel-
ligence between some of the principal centers of astronomical research
in Europe and the eastern ends of the Atlantic cables.

The transmission of intelligence is not restricted to the discovery of
planets and comets, but includes that of any remarkable solar phenom-
enon which may suddenly present itself in Kurope, and of which obser-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vation in America may be practicable for several hours after the sun
has set to the European observer; also the sudden outburst of a star
like that in the “Crown” in 1866, together with unexpected showers of
shooting stars, &c.

To carry out the proposition the following arrangements have been
adopted, which are essentially those published in 1873, but with such
additions and modifications as subsequent experience has proved nec-
essary.

I.—Center of communication in the United States.

2. PARIS OBSERVATORY. Admiral Mouchez, director.

3. BERLIN OBSERVATORY. Prof. W. Foerster, director.

4, VIENNA OBSERVATORY, Academy of Sciences. Prof. Edmund
Weiss, director.

5. PULKOVA OBSERVATORY. Otto von Struve, director.

IIl.—Telegrams received at the Smithsonian Institution from observ-
ers in the United States will be forwarded immediately by Atlantic
cable to Greenwich, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Pulkova, and thence by
telegraph to other observatories in Europe.

Jil.—Discoveries made in Europe of new comets, planets, &e., will
be announced without delay from Greenwich, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and
Pulkova, by Atlantic cable, to the Smithsonian Institution, and thence
by telegraph to American observatories * and the Associated Press.

IV.—The telegraphic dispatch announcing a discovery should be as
brief as possible, and, after conference with astronomers, the following
form has been agreed upon:

After the single word “planet” (or “ comet”), is given—

1. Its right ascension in time, hours, minutes, and seconds (the latter
only to the nearest round tenth, ¢.e., ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty);
next, separated by the word—

2. North or south, is given its—

3. Declination, to the nearest minute.

4, Then, in the case of a planet, the magnitude expressed by the
nearest ordinal number.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. PA

In the case of a comet, the word bright or faint should be added.

5. Next, the daily motion, as near as the first observations allow it to
be estimated.

For a minor planet in opposition, the motion in right ascension is ap-
proximately evident, and it is therefore sufficient to indicate the motion
in declination, in minutes of are, preceded by the word north or south.

For a comet, the direction of motion should be indicated by south,
west, north, east, or by a combination of two of these words, which must
be understood always (also below the pole) in reference to the equator,
not in reference to the horizon. If the comet has a rapid motion, the
number of degrees per day, as estimated, may follow.

6. Finally, the date of the position (having regard to Art. V) indicated
by the day of the week.

The day of sending (civil reckoning, of course) is always written
at the head of the dispatch by the telegraph operator (the United
States law requires also the hour), and it may be presumed that the com-
munications only exceptionally fail to reach the center stations (Art. I),
even those on the other side of the Atlantic, on the same day. In
order, however, to be independent of any delay of the operator, and
agreeably to the wishes expressed by high astronomical authority, the
date is now embodied in the dispatch by naming the week day, whereby
at the same time all ambiguity is removed as to whether astronomical or
civil date be meant.

7. Should it be deemed desirable to communicate the authority for the
discovery, the shortest way would be to insert the name as the second
word in the dispatch (after “ planet” or ‘‘comet”). For example, the
following dispatch, “‘ Planet N. N. twenty-three thirty-five forty north
twenty-one forty-six eleventh south three Wednesday,” would be inter-
preted thus: A new planet is discovered by N. N. At midnight (see
Art. V) between Wednesday and Thursday it will be in right ascension
25 35™ 408, and declination +21° 46’; it is of the 11th magnitude, and
has a daily motion of 3’ towards the south.

Or a dispatch like the following, ‘Comet N. N. twenty-two forty-
three ten north sixty-five thirty-one bright southeast two Monday,”
would announce the discovery made by N. N. of a bright comet, that at
midnight Monday—Tuesday will be in right ascension 22" 43™ 108 and
declination + 65° 31’, the declination decreasing, the right ascension in-
creasing, moving daily about two degrees.

The preceding examples contain the greatest number of words (16)
required for any dispatch, if composed according to the rules adopted
above. Usually the number will be less. Sometimes, however, the dis-
patch thus composed would become equivocal, and it has, therefore,
been established as an additional rule that the number expressing the
minutes of right ascension or declination shall always be expressed in
words, even when zero occurs. Therefore 23" 0™ 408 should be written
“twenty three nought forty,” while “ twenty three forty” will be under-
22

stood to mean 205 3™ 408, Again, “north thirty six” would be +280°
6’, but “north thirty six nought” is +36° 0’. In a similar way 0" of
right ascension, or 0° of declination are to be distinctly expressed by the
word “ nought.” Only for the seconds of right ascension when they are
zero, that word for brevity’s sake is omitted as unnecessary.

V.—The right ascension and declination in the dispatch will be under-
stood to give the position (by proper motion approximately reduced) for
THE MIDNIGHT FOLLOWING the date of the dispatch: Washington time
for American discoveries ; Greenwich time for European.

Usually the discoverer himself has more complete data on hand
than others for bringing the position up in advance, and for this
reason the following midnight is given preference to any preceding time,
as, for example, that of the discovery.

ViI.—Since in conformity with the preceding article, only an approx-
imate estimate of a later position, and not that of the first observation
itself, is given, the dispatch is not to be considered as a document for
deciding the question of priority of discovery.

On the other hand, it is expected that observers, in communicating
their discoveries, will adhere to the form of the programme explained
in the foregoing articles, and thus save much time and labor to those
that wish to co-operate.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 23°
PUBLICATIONS.

The publications of the Institution consist of three classes: The first,
the “Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge”; the second, the “‘Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections”; and the third, the “Annual Reports
of the Regents” of the Institution. The works of the first class, the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, are published in quarto form,
and are intended to embrace original memoirs, either the result of special
investigations authorized and directed by the Institution, or prosecuted
under other auspices and presented to it. The works of the second
class, the Miscellaneous Collections, are similar in plan and construc-
tion to the “ Contributions,” but are in octavo form, and embrace more
particularly monographic and descriptive papers in natural history, for-
mal or systematic lists of species of animals or plants, physical tables,
reports on the present state of knowledge in some department of physi-
eal or biologic science, &c. As with the “ Contributions,” each volume
is composed of several distinct and independent papers, having no nee-
essary connection with each other, the combination being determined
chiefly by the aggregate number of pages suitable for a volume of average
size. The average number of pages in the quarto volume is about 600;
in the octavo volume, about 800. Each paper or memoir in either class
is separately paged and indexed, with its own title-page, so as to be
complete in itself, and separately distributed according to its subject.
Of the quarto “ Contributions,” twenty-one volumes, and of the octavo
‘‘ Collections,” fifteen volumes have been published.

The Smithsonian annual reports, commenced in 1847, being made
to Congress, are published by that authority, and not at the expense of
the Smithson fund. The earlier reports of the Secretary were printed
in small pamphlet editions, but were collected and reprinted with the
report for 1853, and with this the series of bound volumes may be said
to have begun. The number, or edition, ordered by Congress has varied
from year to year, but the proportion of copies placed at the disposal of
the Institution has been distributed to its correspondents as fully and
liberally as possible.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge—The Institution has now
enough material ready for two volumes of the quarto series of Contribu-
tions, the twenty-second volume of which will be issued early in the
year 1880, and will consist of the following memoirs:

1. Antiquities in Tennessee. Joseph Jones.

2. Sculptures of Santa Lucia. S. Habel.

3. Archaclogical Collections of the National Museum. Charles Rau.
4. The Palenque Trblet. Charles Rau.

5. Remains of Man in the Aleutian Islands. W. H. Dall.

These papers have all been described in previous reports with the
exception of the one on the Palenque tablet, by Charles Rau. This
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

publication relates to a stone tablet covered with glyphic designs which
was formerly in the possession of the National Institute for tie Promo-
tion of Science (established at Washington about forty years ago) and
became afterward the property of the Smithsonian Institution. The
records state that the fragments constituting this tablet were presented.
to the National Institute by Mr. Charles Russell, consul of the United
States at Laguna, island of Carmen, Mexico. They had been obtained
at Palenque in a manner not explained, and arrived in Washington in
1842, and were deposited in the Patent Office with the collections of the
National Institute. The transfer of these collections to the Smithsonian
Institution took place in 1858.

The archeological importance of this tablet was first pointed out in
1863 by Dr. George A. Matile. While engaged in making a cast of it,
at the request of the late Professor Henry, he recognized it as one of tie
three stone slabs which, placed together, bore on their surface the sculpt-
ure of the famous group of the cross, forming the chief ornament of one
of the temples at Palenque. The earliest explorers of the ancient city,
Del Rio and Dupaix, still saw the Smithsonian tablet in its proper place
in the “Temple of the Cross,” and figured it, though in a very defective
manner, as a part of the group; but it probably was already broken in
1832, when Waldeck explored the ruins of Palenque. Stephens, who
was there eight years afterward, noticed its scattered pieces. As a Gon-
sequence, neither of the last-named explorers has left a representation
of this valuable complement of the celebrated sculpture.

Impressed with the importance of the subject, the author undertook
to prepare this monograph, which is not merely confined to a description
of the tablet but embraces also a number of cognate topics. Of the two
accompanying plates, which were specially executed for the work, one
represents the Smithsonian tablet in juxtaposition with Catherwood’s
well-known delineation of the Tablet of the Cross in Volume II of Ste-
phens’s “Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yuca-
tan”; the other is an artotype showing the Smithsonian tablet as it
appears after its restoration. Most of the illustrations in the text were
kindly lent by Mr. H. H. Bancroft, of San Francisco; the others were
expressly engraved for the publication.

The work comprises five chapters, to which an appendix is added.

In the first chapter the author gives the history of the Smithsonian
tablet as far as he could trace it by an examination of the existing re-
cords. ‘The second chapter treats in chronological order of the expedi-
tions undertaken for the purpose of exploring the ruins of Palenque,
and of the works and minor publications resulting from these explora-
tions. It is a curious circumstance that the existence of the ancient
city remained unknown until the second half of the eighteenth century,
when accident led to the discovery of these remarkable ruins, hidden
for centuries in the shadows of a Guatemalan forest. Cortez, on his
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

famous expedition to Honduras (in 1524), doubtless passed at no great
distance from the locality now called Palenque, and if it had been an
inhabited city at that time the daring conquistador probably would have
turned aside from his march for the purpose of conquering and plunder-
ing it. Moreover, no mention of the city is made in the Spanish records
of that period, and it may be assumed that it was deserted and in a
ruinous condition at the time of the conquest.’

The principal explorations of Palenque were undertaken by Del Rio,
Dupaix, Waldeck, and Stephens, between the years 1787 and 1839, thus
extending over a period of more than half a century; but while the
reports of the three first named explorers remained unpublished for
many years, Mr. Stephens’s account appeared in print within a year or
two after his visit to the ruins, which thus became known to a large
body of readers, both in this country and abroad.

In the third chapter the author describes, according to the accounts
of the different explorers, the Temple of the Cross and the celebrated
bas relief from which it derives its name. These accounts, though not
absolutely harmonious, coincide in the main points and give a pretty
good idea of the edifice and its appurtenances.

The fourth chapter is devoted to a consideration of the Group of the
Cross, including the Smithsonian tablet. It will be seen that the earlier
representations of this interesting piece of ancient American sculpture
are incorrect and fanciful, more particularly with regard to the design
and arrangements of the glyphs surrounding the cross, and the human
figures standing at its sides. In speaking of the significance of the
bas-relief, the author combats the theory that the adoration of the cross
among the aborigines of certain parts of America was due to the influence
of Christian missionaries, said to have gone to the New World long
before its discovery in the fifteenth century. He adduces facts showing
that the cross had a symbolic meaning in America in times long ante-
dating the Columbian era.

The fifth chapter treats of aboriginal writing in Mexico, Yucatan, and
Central America. The Mexicans, it is well known, had already made
some steps toward phonetization, being able, as Humboldt says, ‘to write
names by writing some signs which recalled sounds.” The Yucatecs
and Central Americans, however, used signs of a different character,
denominated calculiform by M. Aubin, the distinguished French savant.
The question of their significance has been revived of late years by Bras-
seur de Bourbourg’s discovery and publication of Bishop Landa’s manu-
script of the sixteenth century, which had lain for many years unnoti-
ced in the archives of the Royal Academy of History at Madrid. The
celebrity of the bishop’s work is chiefly due to the circumstance that it
contains delineations of what he calls the alphabetic signs of the Yucatees.
The discovery of this supposed key was hailed with great enthusiasm by
scholars interested in the decipherment of the glyphs sculptured on the
walls of ancient edifices in Central America and Yucatan, and of the few
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

manuscripts in similar characters which have escaped the destructive
fanaticism of Spanish priests, namely, the Dresden Codex, the Codex
Peresianus and the Codex Troano, yet the results have thus far not
justified the high expectations at first entertained.

The author endeavors to show, by an analytical process, the affinity
between Bishop Landa’s characters and the glyphs on the Palenquean
tablets, to which he consequently ascribes a Maya origin. He thinks
it probable that the Yucatecs employed in their writing certain charac-
ters as equivalents for sounds, perhaps syllabic and at the same time,
possibly to a great extent, conventional figures imparting a definite
meaning. On the other hand, he strongly doubts whether the Mayas
and kindred tribes ever went so far as to express the elementary signs
of their speech by corresponding signs; in short, whether they possessed
a written language in the modern sense. He hardly believes that the
meaning of Central American and Yueatec glyphs will ever be revealed
through Landa’s key, which, if it really was what the bishop claims,
would apply to the Maya as spoken at the time of the conquest, but,
owing to the mutability of languages, not to the earlier kindred vernae-
ular of the builders of Palenque and other now ruined cities of the
same regions.

The appendix relates to the ruins of Yucatan and Central America
and forms a complement to the chief topics of the publication.

The twenty-third volume of Contributions will probably contain :

. Lucernarie. H. J. Clark.

Geology of Louisiana. KE. W. Hilgard.

. Internal Structure of the Earth. J. G. Barnard.

. Monograph of the Trochilide. D. G. Elliot.

. Fever, a Study in Morbid and Normal Physiology. H.C. Wood, jr.

1. Documents relative to the Origin and History of the Smithsonian
Institution. W. J. Rhees.

Volume XVIII of the Miscellaneous Collections will be composed of—

1. The Scientific Writings of James Smithson.

2. An Account of James Smithson and his Bequest. W. J. Rhees.

&e., from 1846 to 1877.

Volume XIX of Miscellaneous Collections will consist of—

1. Proceedings of the National Museum for 1878.
2. Proceedings of the National Museum for 1879.

Writings of James Smithson.—The scientific writings of James Smith-
son, the distinguished founder of the Smithsonian Institution, have
been collected and are published in accordance with the instructions of
the Board of Regents. These memoirs were originally contributed to
the “ Transactions of the Royal Society of London,” of which Smithson
was a member between the years 1791 and 1817, and to Thomson’s
‘Annals of Philosophy,” between 1819 and 1825. They are twenty-
seven in number and embrace a wide range of subjects, from the origin
of the earth, the nature of the colors of vegetables and insects, the anal-
yses of minerals and chemicals, to an improved method of constructing
lamps, and of making coffee. Some of these papers were translated into
French by the author and others, and published in the “Journal de
Physique, de Chimie, et @ Histoire Naturelle” They prove conclusively the
scientific character of Smithson and his title to distinction as a contrib-
utor to knowledge.

Among the personal effects of the founder of the Institution were
several hundred manuscripts, besides a large collection of scraps and
notes on a great diversity of subjects, including history, the arts, lan-
guage, rural economy, construction of buildings, &e., which, unfortu-
nately, were destroyed by the fire in the Smithsonian building in 1865.
It is probable that Smithson also contributed articles to scientifie and
literary journals other than those mentioned, but none have been found,
though the leading English periodicals of the day have been carefully
examined.

Appended to the writings of Smithson are reviews of their scientific
character, by Prof. Walter Rk. Johnson, communicated to the National
Institute of Washington in 1844, and by J. R. McD. Irby prepared for
the Institution in September, 1878. The material for this work has
been collected and the volume edited by Win. J. Rhees, chief clerk of
the Institution.

History of the Institution.—The work mentioned in the last report rel-
ative to the origin and history of the Institution, as ordered by the
Board of Regents, has been completed under the efficient editorship of
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. William J. Rhees, chief clerk of the Institution, and has been pub-
lished. This history forms an octavo volume of 1,027 pages. It con-
tains the will of Smithson, a republication of all the debates and legis-
lation of Congress relative to the bequest, the correspondence and
official papers of Mr. Rush, the agent of the United States in procuring
the legacy, the history of the investment of the fund, the opinions of
learned men as to the best disposition of the bequest, and many other
documents of value in connection with the history of the establishment.
The work has a full index.

Journals of the Board of Regents.—Another volume of the history of
the Institution has been compiled by Mr. Rhees, containing the journal
of proceedings of the Board of Regents from its first meeting, Septem-
ber 12, 1846, to January 26, 1876, together with the reports of the execu-
tive, building, and special committees for the same period. The eulo-
gies on deceased members of the Board and distinguished collaborators
of the Institution are given, and also a full account of the Bache scien-
tifie fund, the Tyndall trust, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Toner lectures,
Hamilton bequest, the report of the committee of the board on the in-
vention of the electro-magnetic telegraph, the report of the examination
of Professor Henry by the English scientific commission, statistical
tables, and valuable information relative to the history and operations
of the Institution. .

Toner lectures.—The seventh Toner lecture has been published by the
Institution, and is a concise and interesting presentation of “ The nature
of reparatory inflammation in arteries after ligature, compressure and
torsion,” by Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare, of Philadelphia, delivered in
Washington, June 27, 1878. The bleeding of wounds afresh has formed
a favorite theme of study from time immemorial; its nature and the most
efficient means for its arrest have drawn to it the attention of physicians
in all ages. Dr. Shakespeare gives an epitome of the successive efforts
made by skilled hands to stay the subsequent bleeding of wounds and
amputations, from the first recorded authority, Jean Louis Petit, in
173132, to date; this valuable summary is followed by one of the prev-
alent opinions in regard to the question, and he then sketches,in minute,
succinet detail, his own personal observations. This concluding chapter
is illustrated by four carefully prepared plates.

Monograph of Chitonide.—Reference has been made in previous re-
ports toa monograph of the Chitonide prepared by Dr. Philip P. Car-
penter, of Montreal, with a view to publication by the Institution.

At Dr. Carpenter’s death, this manuscript, in a still unfinished condi-
tion, was discovered to consist largely of notes and memoranda, written
in a peculiar and antiquated short-hand, with which no one in this coun-
try was familiar. The skeleton of classification was almost completed,
but the details in regard to particular species were often deficient or
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

existed only in the form of these short-hand notes. As the usefulness of
the work and especially its completeness depended largely on the com-
prehension of these notes, search was made, for a long time unsuccess-
fully, for some one able to decipher them. At last an old classmate and
personal friend of Dr. Carpenter, Mv. R. D. Darbishire, of Manchester,
England, undertook the task, with the assistance of the Rev. W. H. Her-
ford. To the knowledge of the short-hand possessed by Mr. Darbishire
(one of the few living persons who can read it) and to his generous willing-
ness to devote his time to the wearisome duty for the benefit of science
and out of regard for Dr. Carpenter’s memory we are very greatly in-
debted and owe the translation of the above-mentioned notes. Mr.
Darbishire declined any remuneration for his services, and the labor be-
stowed by Mr. Herford was quite beyond the value of any honorarium
which the Institution was able to make him. The thanks of the Institu-
tion and of men of science generally are therefore due to these gentle-
men. The illustrations for the monograph, which are quite numerous, are
yet to be engraved, though they have already been beautifully drawn by
Mr. Emerton, under Dr. Carpenter’s direction, at the cost of the Institu-
tion. This and a not inconsiderable amount of editing, which has been in-
trusted to Mr. W. H. Dall, remain to be accomplished before the mono-
graph will be ready for publication, a task which cannot be wholly com-
pleted under a year or two.

List of zoological genera.—Among the works offered to the Smithsonian
Institution for publication is a list of the zoological genera, giving the
time of publication and the class of the animal kingdom referred to.
Such works, if properly executed, are of great value to the investigator,
since, although imposing an immense labor upon the compiler, they ena-
ble the student to at once determine points of synonymy and priority of
date; also whether a name proposed for a new genus has already been
used, thus sparing an enormous aggregate of individual effort. This
work, by Mr. Samuel H. Scudder, of Cambridge, will probably be com-
pleted and published in the course of the year 1880.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—In the Secretary’s Report for 1875
it was stated that another series of publications, which would form a
part of the Miscellaneous Collections, had been commenced under the
above title. This series is intended to illustrate the collections of natural
history and ethnology belonging to the United States, and constituting
the stock of the National Museum, of which the Smithsonian Institution
is the custodian. These bulletins, prepared at the request and mainly
by the attachés of the Institution, have been printed under the authority
of the Secretary of the Interior. They form an independent series,
which has proved very acceptable to naturalists, as enabling them to
obtain prompt information as to the additions to and the components
of the National Museum.

The following is a list of the titles and contents of the bulletins already
published:

Bulletin 16.—Synopsis of the Fishes of the United States. By David
S. Jordan. (In Press.)

The fifteenth number of the Bulletin of the National Museum is wholly
made up of the interesting and novel notes of Mr. Ludwig Kumnlien, who,
under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, in 1877~78, accom-
panied the Howgate polar expedition as naturalist. He passed the long
arctic winter of 1877~78 in the little harbor of Annanactook, Cumber-
land Gulf, latitude 67° north, longitude 68° 50’ west. This sound, gulf,
or inlet of Cumberland extends from about latitude 65° north to latitude
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

67°+ north. It is the “Cumberland Straits” of Baffin, who was its orig-
inal discoverer at the end of the sixteenth century; again rediscovered
by Captain Penny in 1839, who named it Hogarth Sound; and still again
it was visited by Captain Wareham in 1841, who, unconscious of his
predecessors, hamed it once more anew as Northumberland Inlet. It
has become latterly a frequented place of resort for Scotch and American
whalemen, whose ships frequently winter on the southwest shores of its
boundaries.

Here Mr. Kumlien passed seven or eight months in close intercourse
with the Eskimo, and neglected no opportunity for study of this people.
His detailed account of the curious habits and mental characteristics of
the Innuit is one of the most complete and finished descriptions ever
given of them; clear, succinct, and comprehensive, it is a valuable
ethnological pen picture.

Mr. Kumlien paid attention to the various subdivisions of naturat
history, and made as full notes as possible, under the circumstances, upon
the mammals, birds, and fishes of the region. His limited means for
action, his scant accommodations on the little schooner, and the forced,
hasty departure from winter quarters gave no opportunity for exhaustive
collections of any kind whatever; but the insects, the plants, the mol-
lusks, and the alge secured have been carefully examined by experts in
these branches, and reported on in this bulletin, thus rendering it a
most valuable contribution to our knowledge of cireumpolar life.

Proceedings of the National Musewm.—It had frequently been sug-
gested as desirable that the National Museum should have some medium
of prompt publication for announcing descriptions of specimens received
(many of which are new species), as well as presenting other interesting
facts relative to natural history, &c., as furnished by the correspondents
of the institution. The publication of the ‘ Proceedings of the National
Museum” was accordingly commenced, the work comprising short de-
scriptions of the additions to the museum, accounts of new species, faunal,
and other lists, &c. It is printed in successive signatures, as fast as
copy sufficient for sixteen pages is prepared, each signature having
printed at the bottom of its first page the date of actual issue, for decid-
ing questions as to priority of publication. It is at once distributed to
scientific societies and leading naturalists in this country and in Europe.
The list of important articles of greater or less length already printed,
and forming the volume for 1878, is as follows:

nah bank; on the occurrence of Sticheus punctatus, at Saint Michaels,

The above collection constitutes Vol. I of the Proceedings of the
United States National Museum, comprising 524 pages, octavo, and em-
bellished with 8 plates and 10 wood-cuts.

Chief among these interesting papers is the digest of Mr. F. A. Ober’s
researches in the Lesser Antilles, as given by Mr. Geo. N. Lawrence.
The labors of Mr. Ober were principally devoted during two years to
ornithological observation and collection on the island of Dominica,
which is about midway in the group known as the Lesser Antilles, being
in latitude 15° 20 to 15° 45’, north; longitude 61° 13/ to 61° 30/ west.
The island is mountainous, possessing a range of high peaks and hills
from two to three thousand feet in height. It is only in these mount-
ainous sections that land birds of any moment are found, for, in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

fact, along the coast and in the low valleys very few species other than
ordinary sparrows, humming-birds, &e., can be obtained. Owing to the
bold, precipitous character of the island coast and the absence of small
outlying islands or detached rocky islets, Mr. Ober found that only a
few sea birds were resident.

As far as known, the most significant result of Mr. Ober’s collection
and investigation of the avifauna of the Lesser Antilles is embodied in
the statement that each one of these several little islands constituting
that group has one or more species peculiar to itself alone.

Mr. W. H. Dall has contributed several papers to the Proceedings, de-
scribing new forms of mollusks, both recent and belonging to the Ter-
tiary formation, nearly all of which are from the western coast of the
United States, several being particularly interesting. One of these
ferms was brought up on a sounding. line by Capt. Geo. E. Belknap, of the
U.58.5. Tuscarora, on his celebrated sounding expedition from Japan to
California via the Aleutian Islands, in 1874. This mollusk, a species of
Chiton, came from a depth of 6,066 feet below the surface, a much greater
depth than that in which any other species of the genus has yet been
known to exist. Many of the other shells and fossils described were due
to the exertions of Mr. Henry Hemphill, of California, whose ability as
a collector stands unrivalled, and who kindly presented those objects,
which he believed to be new, to the National Museum.

Small but interesting collections of shells from “ Kitchen Middens,”
on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, were also identified by Mr. Dall.
These species, collected by Drs. Flint and Bransford, are still found liv-
ing in adjacent waters, and are now used for food by the natives.

Mr. Dall also contributed a paper on the Limpets and Chitons of the
Alaskan region, with descriptions of genera and species believed to be
new. This was illustrated by five plates, representing chiefly the teeth
of these animals, worked out by microscopical investigations of his own.
Some forty-two forms were figured, only three or four having previously
been known. The paper contains a review of the general classification
of the Chitonida, based on the researches of P. P. Carpenter and the
author, together with a summary of the known facts in regard to the
anatomy and development of these animals, some of which are here
stated for the first time. A number of genera and subgenera, proposed
by Dr. Carpenter in his unpublished monograph of the Chitonide, to-
gether with others heretofore only partially characterized, are here fully
described for the first time.

Mr. R. Ridgway has contributed the following:

(1) On a new humming-bird (Atthis ellioti) from Guatemala (pp. 8-10).—
Certain constant differences, previously overlooked by authors, between
specimens of Atthis heloisw (Less. & Delattr.) from Mexico and the
birds from Guatemala referred to that species are pointed out and illus-
trated by outline figures. The Guatemalan bird is characterized as a
new species, and named in honor of Mr. Daniel Giraud Elliot, the well
known ornithologist, and a special authority on this family of birds.
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

(2) A review of the American species of the genus Scops Savigny (pp. 84-
117).—This article is an elaborate monograph of the American Scops
owls (species allied to the common sereech-owl of the United States),
embracing the full synonymy and descriptions of the known species,
two of which, S. brasilianus cassini, from HKastern Mexico, and S. cooperi,
from Costa Rica, are new to science. The owls of this genus have been
particularly perplexing to ornithologists on account of remarkable vari-
ations of plumage, some species being “dichromatic,” while all vary to
an unusual degree, according to locality, the amount of individual vari-
ation also being extraordinary. The present paper is an attempt, based
upon ample material contained chiefly in the National Museum, to clear
away the confusion which has hitherto existed in regard to the relation-
ships and nomenclature of certain forms.

(3) Notes on the ornithology of Southern Texas, being a list of birds ob-
served in the vicinity of Fort Brown, Texas, from February, 1876, to June,
1878. By James C. Merrill, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. Army (pp. 118-
173).—The critical remarks and synonymy relating to the species
noticed in this article were prepared by Mr. Ridgway, although in sev-
eral instances, through an oversight of his own, his initials do not
appear in connection with his portion of the work. The species thus
treated by Mr. Ridgway, are: Thryomanes bewicki leucogaster (p. 121),
Vireosylvia flavo-viridis (p. 125), Molothrus eneus (pp. 130-131), Sturnella
magna neglecta (p. 134), Myiarchus erythrocereus cooperi (pp. 138-141),
Nyctidromus albicollis (pp. 142-145), Amazilia fuscicaudata (pp. 147-148),
A. yucatanensis (pp. 148-149), Buteo albicaudatus (pp. 154-156), dichmop-
tila albifrons (p. 158), and Parra gymnostoma (pp. 166-168). Mr. Ridgway
is also responsible for the nomenclature adopted in the catalogue.

(4) Descriptions of several new species and geographical races of birds
contained in the collection of the United States National Museum (pp. 247-
252).—The new forms described in this article are the following: Ihod-
inocichla rosea schistacea, from Mazatlan, Western Mexico; Hmbernagra
rufivirgata crassirostris, from Eastern Mexico, and the /. r. verticalis,
from Yucatan ; Lowigilla violacea bahamensis, from the Bahamas; and
Anas aberti, from Mazatlan. A description is appended (p. 253) of the
adult female of Anas wyvilliana, Sclater, a recently discovered Sandwich
Island duck, the female of which was previously unknown.

(5) Description of two new species of birds from Costa Rica, and notes
on other rare species from that country (pp. 252-255).—The new species
here described are Thryophilus zeledoni and Pseudocolaptes lacrencii.
The others noticed are the very rare Carpodectes nitidus, the young male
of which is here for the first time described, and the “ Zonotrichia”,
vulecani, of Boueard, which is referred to the genus Junco, as the most
southern form of that genus, of which the common snowbird (J. hye-
malis) is the representative in Eastern North America. The Costa Rican
bird inhabits the almost alpine summit of the voleano of Irazu.

(6) A partial list of the birds of Central California. By L. Belding, of ,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot

Stockton. Edited by R. Ridgway (pp. 388-449). Mr. Ridgway is to be
credited merely with the editing of this paper and the nomenclature
adopted. The list is the most complete catalogue extant of Central Cal-
ifornian birds, being based upon the observations of Mr. Belding, made
during a residence of about twenty years in the State, and includes 22
species, which, with very few exceptions, are represented in the collection
of the National Museum by specimens (upwards of 600 in number) sent
by Mr. Belding.

(7) Descriptions of new species and races of American birds, including
a synopsis of the genus Tyrannus, Cuvier (pp. 466-486).—The new species
here described are Tyrannus luggeri, from Demerara and Cayenne;
LTichenops perspicillatus andinus, from Western South America (Chili to
Colombia); Dacnis pulcherrima aureinucha, from Ecuador; Parus rufes-
cens neglectus, from the coast of California.

Smithsonian Annual Report.—The report of the Institution for the
year 1878 was presented to Congress on the 8th of February, 1879, and
10,590 copies were ordered to be printed, 1,000 being for the use of the
Senate, 3,000 for that of the House of Representatives, and 6,500 for
the Smithsonian Institution.

For almost the first time in the history of the Institution, this report
has failed to make its appearance, and to be distributed before the close
of the following year. Under ordinary circumstances it should have
been printed by the Ist of July, but the year has come to an end, and
not more than half the number of pages have been set up. This is due
to the fact that the extra session of Congress held in March last found .
the Public Printer without any special appropriation to meet the cost of
printing; and instead of going on with the work ordered at the previous
session, he was obliged to postpone it. Work was, however, resumed
upon the report late in the autumn, and it will probably be finished in
the course of a few months. It is earnestly to be hoped that a similar
delay will not oceur again. The same cause has prevented the printing
of the Henry.Memorial volume authorized by Congress last winter, but
the work on this will soon be begun.

Reports of the United States Fish Comnission.—A series of publications
which may be considered as in some respects connected with the work
of the Institution, not only in the personnel, but in the subjects of natu-
ral history discussed and in the resulting contributions to our knowledge,
may properly be here noticed. The present Secretary being at the head
of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, and the work
accomplished by this agency in increasing and diffusing scientific as
well as practical information being quite within the objects and prov-
ince of the Institution, much of the material would legitimately form a
portion of the Smithsonian Contributions or Miscellaneous Collections.
These reports are, however, published by the government, and are dis-
tributed by Congress.

38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
ANTHROPOLOGY.

It is well known to the Board that the natural history of primitive
man, especially in North America, has always been a special object of
the attention of the Smithsonian Institution. The first volume of its
series of publications consisted of a work by Messrs. Squier and Davis,
entitled “The ancient monuments of the Mississippi Valley,” which,
appearing in 1848, gave a stimulus to archeological research in America,
and added greatly in exciting that high degree of interest in the sub-
ject, which now pervades the whole country. The work, although thirty
years old, is still a standard publication, and greatly sought after. It
had been in contemplation to reprint this work, to meet the great de-
mand; but the destruction of all the wood-cuts by the disastrous fire of
1865 involved so great a cost in their reproduction that nothing has
yet been done in the matter. ;

For the purpose of a more definite inquiry into the subject of mounds,
earth-works, and other remains of early man in America, a large edition
has been distributed, within a few years past, of a circular prepared at
the request of the Smithsonian Institution by Prof. O. T. Mason, and
a great many returns have been received, containing more or less valu-
able information on the subject in question. Some of these responses
will appear in the reports of the Institution. The entire material is in
Professor Mason’s hands for elaboration and the preparation of part of
a new and systematic account of the whole subject, taking the memoir
of Squier and Davis as a basis.

In view of the fact that some of the most interesting localities of
archeological remains in the United States are now being systematically
explored and the “finds” removed by foreign governments, it is very
desirable that Congress should make the necessary appropriation to en-
able this work to be done for the benefit of the National Museum. The
remains of prehistoric man, as well as illustrations of the life and man-
ners of living savage races, have of late years been considered the most
interesting objects of exhibition in all civilized nations, and especially
within the last twenty or thirty years, and the greatest efforts are now
made everywhere not only to complete the material for each country
itself, but to obtain supplementary matter from elsewhere; indeed, so
greatly are these aboriginal objects valued in many countries that posi-
tive laws prohibiting their exportation are in vogue, as in Denmark,
Mexico, &c. The English, German, and French Governments have of
late years been particularly active in archeological research in America,
Central and South America being until recently the chief field of inves-
tigation. Within a short time, however, the French Government,
through its agents, has been diligently oceupied in collecting prehistoric
remains along the coast of California, and is about extending its work
into New Mexico and Arizona, Oregon and Alaska, and many tons ot
the choicest objects have already been removed to Paris. Whatever the
feelings of regret on the part of Americans at seeing the removal of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

articles of such value from our country, and which can never be re-
placed, there is no redress in the way of prohibiting their collection
and its exportation. We may, however, prevent it in the future by our
pre-occupying the ground. It is, therefore, to be hoped that Congress
will make suitable appropriations for the purpose in question. Ten or
twenty thousand dollars expended annually would enable us in a man-
ner to defy foreign competition.

In the sundry civil appropriation bill of March 3, 1879, the following
item was included:

“ For completing and preparing for publication the contributions to
North American ethnology, under the Smithsonian Institution, twenty
thousand dollars: Provided, That all the archives, records, and mate-
rials relating to the Indians of North America, collected by the geo-
graphical and geological survey of the Rocky Mountain region, shall be
turned over to the Smithsonian Institution, that the work may be com-
pleted and prepared for publication under its direction: Provided, That
it shall meet the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and of the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.”

Under the authority of this enactment, Major Powell sent out a party
to make a renewed examination of the pueblo villages of New Mexico,
tor the purpose of obtaining more accurate information for publication
in the final report, as authorized. Accordingly, Mr. James Stevenson
was placed by Major Powell at the head of an expedition, and was ac-
companied by Mr. Frank H. Cushing, one of the assistants in charge of
the ethnological department of the National Museum. With Santa Fé
as a Starting-point, they explored several localities in that vicinity and
elsewhere, and succeeded in obtaining a large collection of everything
illustrating the manners and customs of the pueblo towns. ‘The collec-
tions made have all been shipped by the Quartermaster’s Department,
under the order already referred to, and are expected to arrive in a few
weeks. ‘The whole mass occupies nearly one hundred boxes.

The operations of Messrs. Stevenson and Cushing have been much
facilitated by means of letters furnished by the Secretary of War and
‘Generals Sherman and Meigs to the officers of the military posts.* Gen-
eral Hatch took a special interest in the subject, and issued a circular
calling attention to the mission of the party, and inviting cooperation

Sir: You are respectfully informed that your communication of the 12th instant, re-
questing that a circular be issued authorizing the Quartermaster’s Departinent to receive
from parties living at or near military posts and to forward to Washington any articles

oftice for report, and this day returned with the following remarks:

Museum the collections of United States surveys and exploring expeditions, organized
under the War Department.

from all quarters. The effect of this was seen in the ready assistance
rendered, and in the numerous contributions by both the military and
civil residents of the district. The material result of this expedition
will perhaps be thrown in the shade by the information obtained by Mr,
Cushing in regard to the manners and customs of the Indians. Secur-
ing their confidence to a greater degree than any preceding traveller,
his presence has been permitted at the performance of their most sacred
rites; and the publication of his report by Major Powell may be looked
for as promising to be of intense interest.

A very important addition made during the year to the ethnological
department of the National Museum is the collection of Indian por-
traits and scenes painted by Mr. George Catlin, and presented by
Mrs. Harrison, widow of Thomas Harrison, of Philadelphia.

There have been two of the so-called Catlin collections. The first is
that which was exhibited by Mr. Catlin many years ago, in the United
States, and afterwards taken to Europe and shown in the principal
capitals. It made Mr. Catlin’s reputation as an artist and ethnologist,
and furnished the material for his great work on the North American
Indians.

Several years ago, Mr. Harrison, being in Belgium, found Mr. Catlin
there very much embarrassed financially, and in danger of having his
entire gallery sold for a trifle. He advanced the money to relieve Mr.
Catlin’s embarrassment, and took the collection as security, with the
understanding that at any time within a certain period of years it could
be redeemed. This was out of Mr. Catlin’s power, and the collection
was transferred to Philadelphia, where it was stored for many years,
and, as stated, has just been presented by Mrs. Harrison.

After parting with his first gallery, Mr. Catlin traveled extensively
in Western North America and through South America, and obtained
many additional sketches of much interest. This second collection was
brought some years ago by him to Washington in the hope of seiling
it to the government, and was exhibited in the upper hall of the Smith-

tions.

“Tt, under the laws and orders relating to the Centennial Exhibition, transported
to Philadelphia various and extensive collections for that exhibition; many, if not
most, of which were finally brought to Washington, for deposit in the National
Museum.

‘TJ recommend that the request of the director of the National Museum and Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution be granted.”

lin himself. He, however, died before anything was accomplished, |
and the pictures were packed up and stored in the Smithsonian base-
ment until 1876, when the heirs had them transferred, for the purpose
of exhibition at the Centennial. They are still displayed in Philadel-
phia as a part of the collections of the permanent exhibition.

Among particularly noteworthy contributions to the Museum during
the year is a series of specimens of North African pottery, furnished by
Mr. George Maw, of England, to whom the National Museum is indebted
for the donation of his display of ceramic wares made at Philadelphia
and which is now in the permanent exhibition building.

The National Museum of Mexico has furnished a cast of the calendar
stone of the city of Mexico, and the originals of many rare and remark-
able articles.

A collection of Brazilian pottery by Mr. Steere has already been men-
tioned, as also a fine collection of New Mexican objects by Mr. Metealfe.
An extremely interesting collection of prehistoric articles of France and
other localities in Europe was presented by Mr. Gaston L. Feuardent, of
New York. The great archeological knowledge of this gentleman ren-
ders this collection particularly valuable in the authentic indication of
the character of the different pieces.

Under the general head of “ Explorations” will be found mentioned a
considerable number of researches, having in view the collecting of

mnilitary posts, and to forward to Washington, by the usual military channels, any ar-
ticles intended for the National Museum, I have the honor to inform you that instruc-

archeological and anthropological material, and the list of donations
gives an account of those of less moment. The most important explora-
tions are those of Major Powell and Mr. E. W. Nelson.

Considering the subject geographically, we may refer, for Alaska, to
the labors of Messrs. Nelson and Turner; for New Mexico, to those of
Messrs. Metealfe, Stevenson, and Cushing. From the interior of the
United States the archological collections have been very many, and
will be found detailed in the list of donations.

From Mexico the most important material has been furnished by the
National Museum of Mexico and by Professor Dugés. From the former
have been received a very excellent model of the famous calendar-stone,
and numerous articles of obsidian, stone, pottery, &c. Professor Dugeés
has contributed a diminutive human face carved in iron pyrites, with
small opals for eyes. The collections of Professor Steere, from Brazil,
have already been referred to. From Europe we have a very interest-
ing collection of prehistoric remains, especially from France, presented
by Mr. Gaston L. Feuardent; and pottery from Persia, Morocco, and
other countries, by Mr. George Maw, of London.

Casts of Indian heads.—Reference was made in the report for 1877 to a
Series of casts, made by Mr. Clark Mills, at the joint expense of the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, of the faces
of sixty-five Indians held as prisoners of war at Saint Augustine, in
Florida, these representing quite a number of different tribes and fur-
nishing a very rare opportunity of securing life-like reproductions of the
Indian physiognomy. ‘The Indians, as arule, are averse to such an opera-
tion, and but few such casts are extant in any anthropological museum.
The few series distributed of duplicates of these representations have
been much appreciated.

After the discharge of the Saint Augustine prisoners, or their trans-

cers serving therein are solicited to contribute any Indian relics, specimens of natural
history, curiosities, &c., that may be obtainable in their neighborhood, and address
them to Mr. Stevenson, care of chief quartermaster, district of New Mexico, sending
the same by any government transportation leaving their posts for Santa Fé.

‘(SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, JPashington, July 7, 1879.

“Mr. James Stevenson, the bearer of this letter, has been instructed by the Smith-
sonian Institution to visit New Mexico, Arizona, and other portions of the Southwest
for the purpose of prosecuting investigations in ethnology and natural history.

“TY therefore commend him to the kind attention of officers of the United States
Army, civilian officers of the United States Government, correspondents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and the friends of science generally. All aid rendered him in his
work or contributions of specimens through him to the National Museum of the United
States, will be duly acknowledged by the Smithsonian Institution.

‘* Mr. Stevenson is authorized to make use of all facilities granted to the Smithsonian
Institution by railroad companies and the War Department in the transportation of
collections made or otherwise obtained by him.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

fer to other stations, Capt. R. H. Pratt, United States Infantry, who had
them in command, and who had become greatly interested in all meas-
ures looking towards the education of the Indians, was authorized by the
government to bring a number of young Indians of both sexes to the
school for colored youth so successfully conducted by General Armstrong
at Hampton, Va. This having been accompiished, an opportunity was
furnished of extending the series of casts, and Mr. Clark Mills again
volunteered his services to do the work, simply for his expenses. Cap-
tain Pratt accordingly made the arrangements for its execution. This
second series makes the entire number of representations of Indians in
the museum about one hundred. These casts are valuable to us, both as
anthropologie representations in themselves and as furnishing the means
of producing lay figures in great number and variety to display the many
sets of Indian clothing and equipment now forming part of the general
collection.

In this connection it may be mentioned that Captain Pratt has more
recently established a special school for the education of Indian youth,
of both sexes, at Carlisle, Pa., using the government barracks for its ac-
commodation. Here he expects to bring together between three and
four hundred individuals and has every assurance of a successful experi-
ment.

EXPLORATIONS.

Among the operations of the Smithsonian Institution, especially fos-
tered from the beginning by my predecessor, and looked upon by him as
one of its most important functions, is that of exploration in little-known
regions of North America. It was his policy not to use the funds of the
Institution in purchasing collections already made, but rather, by means
of occasiona! grants of money in small sums, either to fit out small parties
starting from Washington, or to assist correspondents of the Institution,
wherever they might be resident, in making researches in their own
vicinity. These labors generally included more than one branch of sci-
ence, and in their aggregate have tended very largely to give the Na-
tional Museum its remarkable number of type specimens. Thus grants
of money were made, of various sums, from $5 to $250, very rarely ex-
ceeding the latter amount in any one year to any one agent.

The results of the explorations condensed in whole or in part by the
Smithsopvian Institution, in 1879, have not been inferior in importance
to those of any previous year; in fact they have seldom been exceeded; re-
sulting not only in bringing together many new facts in natural history
and ethnology, but also in adding large collections to those already in
hand. The prospect of having a new building capacious enough to ac-
commodate whatever may be received in this direction was an encour-
agement to utilize opportunities of obtaining objects, from which we
were formerly deterred by want of space.

Among the more important explorations made under the auspices of
the Smithsonian Institution in 1879, may be mentioned that of Mr. B. W.
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Nelson in Northwestern Alaska. As explained in previous reports, Mr.
Nelson was nominated by the Smithsonian Institution to General Myex
as a Signal observer at Saint Michael’s, a station on Norton Sound, south
of Behring Strait—a district of very great interest in both an ethnologi-
eal and natural-history point of view; and although numerous collec-
tions had previously been received from that region, as made by Messrs.
Dall, Kennicott, Pease, Bannister, and Turner, there was still enough
unaccomplished to make it important that the work should be con-
tinued. The institution was fortunate in being able to secure the aid of
Mr. Nelson, as being a most excellent naturalist and particularly well
acquainted with the vertebrate animals of North America.

Mr. Nelson proceeded to his station at Saint Michael’s, and has re-
mained there ever since, of course devoting the principal portion of his
time to his duties as signal observer, and, it is understood, to the satis-
faction of his superiors, while his leisure has been employed in making
observations and collections of natural history. Previous reports have
noted the additions already made by him. The collection of 1879 is
especially important in an ethnological point of view; not less than three
thousand specimens of Indian and Esquimaux work in the way of earv-
ings, implements, clothing, domestic and household utensils, games, &e.,
have been received. These filled fourteen large boxes, the remainder of
the collection consisting chiefly of birds, eggs, and fishes. The total
number of pieces furnished by Mr. Nelson amounts to 2,935.

Mr. Nelson is preparing an elaborate report on the natural history
and ethnology of Northwestern Alaska for publication after his return.

The labors of Mr. Lucien M. Turner in the Aleutian Islands have also
been prosecuted during the year, and have furnished, as heretofore, a
large amount of interesting material for the National Museum.

Mr. Turner, as mentioned in previous reports, like Mr. Nelson, is one
of the observers of the United States Signal Service, and has under his
charge a number of temporary stations along the entire extent of the
Aleutian Islands. The supervision of these stations makes it necessary
for him to go from point to point as an opportunity is furnished, thus
allowing a chance to study the natural history and ethnology of a
widely-extended region. The greater part of the season of 1879 was
passed at Sitka, his principal station, however, being Unalaska.
Among the collections sent down by him, besides some very finely-
prepared specimens of birds (among them species of great rarity), was
a series of very elaborate and delicate carvings in bone made by the
Aleutian Islanders.

Capt. L. A. Beardslee, of the Navy, who for several years had been
detailed by the Navy Department to take charge of the steamers fur-
nished to the United States Fish Commission, especially the “Blue
Light” and the “Speedwell,” was sent out during the early part of the
year in command of the sloop-of-war Jamestown to look after the
interest of the citizens of the United States in Alaskan waters. With
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

Sitka as his headquarters he was enabled to exercise a supervision over
the Indians of the adjacent parts of the country.

The experience which Captain Beardslee acquired during his service
with the Fish Commission, in making observations on the natural and
physical conditions of the water, prepared him more fully for his re-
searches in this new field, and the Institution gladly accepted his offer
of service and supplied him with necessary apparatus. No specimens
have so far been received from Captain Beardslee, but a consignment is
expected in the early part of 1880.

An extensive exploration of the islands and waters of the North
Pacific, indeed even through Behring Strait, was made during the
last summer by the “Richard Rush,” Captain Bailey, commander.
Before starting, her surgeon, Dr. White, of the Marine Hospital Serv-
ice, offered his services to the Institution in making such collections as
might be designated; and as a trained naturalist, experienced in re-
search, having prosecuted his studies in Edinburgh under the direction
of Sir Wyville Thompson and others, his proposition was gladly ae-
cepted. Many collections of much interest were made by Dr. White
and duly received by the Smithsonian Institution. They consist for
the most part of embryonic or foetal seals, porpoises, &c., various fishes,
and many marine invertebrates. Skins and skeletons of several spe-
cies of seals were also included.

The “Jeannette.,—Much interest was excited during the past year by
the announcement that the “Pandora,” an English vessel, which had
already been engaged in Arctic research in the hands of Capt. Allen
Young was to be employed in a similar service, entirely at the expense
of Mr. James Gordon Bennett, of New York, as the “Jeannette,”
under the command of Lieutenant De Long, an officer of the United

States Navy, who had already had a Northern experience in the Green-
land Seas while in search of the “ Pelaris.”. The “ Jeannette” was taken
by Lieutenant De Long to San Francisco, by way of Cape Horn; her
commander returning overland to the East, and spending some time in
Washington in obtaining his outfit and instructions. The Smithsonian
Institution was requested by Mr. Bennett to nominate a competent
naturalist for the expedition, and selected Mr. Raymond L. Newcombe,
of Salem, Mass., who joined the steamer in San Francisco, and with her
left for the North. Letters received, both from him and Captain De
Long, and written at Saint Michael’s, Alaska, show that a large amount
of work has been accomplished in the way of natural history researei ;
and it is hoped that the results of the expedition will be commensurate
with the expectations of all interested. At the last advices from the
‘“‘ Jeannette” she was seen by a whaling captain in the vicinity of Wran-
gel Land, this being her main objective point.

Professor Jordan, who has been detailed by Mr. Goode to work up
the fisheries of the Pacific coast of the United States, reported at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, in December, 1879, and there
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

received the necessary instructions for his work. At the latest advices
he had reached San Diego and commenced his investigations of the
fisheries, with the promise of exhaustive results there and at other
points on the coast. He is provided by the National Museum with the
necessary apparatus for making collections on a liberal scale, to serve
as illustrations of the fishery statistics.

The collecting and exhibition of what may be considered vouchers of
his labors are very necessary, since the names of our Eastern species
are largely applied to Western forms in every respect different from
them; and without the means of examination and comparison much
confusion would result. Thus, what is called cod in San Francisco has
no relation to the cod of the Eastern coast, belonging to an entirely
different group. :

Among the explorations of the year, and especially rich in ethno-
logical results, is that prosecuted by Mr. 8. T. Walker, on the west
coast of Florida. With this gentlemen the Institution has been in com-
munication for several years, and has received from him many valuable
archeological objects. During the past year he has been engaged in
a systematic survey of the mounds in the vicinity of Clear Water, Fla.,
and has found evidence to show that at the time of their construction
white men were in the vicinity, from whom were obtained numerous
articles of ornament, &c. Conspicuous among these are gold and silver
beads, portions of bronze fittings of gun locks, Venetian beads, frag-
ments of Spanish pottery, Wc. From all the indications, it is possible
that these were obtained from some of the early Spanish invaders, or
other whites, at no distant period from the time of De Soto’s conquest.

Many collections of reptiles, living and in alcohol, fishes, mammals,
and birds have also been furnished by Mr. Walker.

Mr. James W. Milner, the. Assistant Fish Commissioner of the United
States, was obliged by ill health to spend the winter of 1878-79 in
Florida, making his home at Homosassa, on the west coast. Here,
although greatly enfeebled by disease which in a great measure crippled
his efforts, he obtained, with the help of those about him, very valuable
collections of prehistoric remains, birds, fishes, and other natural-history
objects.

Mexico.—Mr. Silas Stearns, formerly of Pensacola, and for several
years a valued correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution, in the early
part of last summer was detailed by Mr. Goode to collect the statistics
of fish and the fisheries on the Gulf of Mexico in the interest of the fish-
eries branch of the census. For this purpose he chartered a small sloop
for use in prosecuting his work. From time to time, without interfering
with his regular duty, he has succeeded in securing numerous objects of
natural history for the National Museum, among them quite a number
of fish, some of these, probably, new to science.

Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator of ornithology in the National Museum,
accompanied by a friend, Mr. H. W. Henshaw, made an expedition to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

Cobb’s Island, off the Eastern Shore of Virginia, during the past sum-
mer, for the purpose of collecting skins of the adult and young water
birds abounding in that vicinity. Although rather late in their under-
taking (July 29) they were quite successful, obtaining a number of in-
teresting species during their stay of ten days.

For several years past Mr. F. A. Ober has been engaged, under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, in making observations and
collections in natural history and archeology in the West India Islands ;
this group, strange as it may appear, furnishing almost a virgin field of
research. In the course of his labors, beginning in 1877, Mr. Ober
visited a number of the islands and collected many specimens; of these
the birds have already been worked up, fully catalogued, and described
by Mr. Lawrence in the proceedings of the National Museum. No less
than twenty new species of birds have been added to science, and a great
deal of information obtained in regard to their geographical distribu-
tion. The National Museum is now in possession of what is believed to
be the most complete collection of West Indian birds extant; a very
important corollary to its North and Central American series. The other
collections made by Mr. Ober were mainly of archeological objects and
reptiles.

Mr. Ober has lately published an interesting account of his travels,
entitled ‘‘ Camps in the Caribees.”

Prof. J.B. Steere, of the University of Michigan, at Ann-Arbor, who
has an excellent record as an explorer in China, Formosa, and else-
where, invited the Smithsonian Institution to a co-operation in a pro-
posed exploration of the Amazon River during the past summer. He
was accordingly provided with certain apparatus and material for col-
lecting, and made excellent use of his opportunities. Since his return
he has contributed to the National Museum a collection of the ancient
pottery from the island of Maranon, and other localities in the Amazon
River, thus filling a very serious gap in our archeological museum.
During Professor Steere’s previous explorations in the East, the Smith-
sonian Institution was the consignee of his collections, and rendered
much service in securing their safe and inexpensive transmission to
America.

Dr. Charles J. Hering, of Paramaribo, Surinam, still maintains his
interest in the Smithsonian Institution, by sending to it collections in
natural history and archeology. Several parcels have been forwarded
by him during the past year, the contents of which will be mentioned
under his name in the list of acquisitions.

Dr. Otto Finsch, the eminent. ornithologist and naturalist, and for
many years director of the Natural History Museum at Bremen, in
Germany, after completing his recent explorations in Siberia, under-
took to visit the islands of the Pacific Ocean, partly in the interest of
the Berlin Museum, partly at the expense of the Humboldt Exploration
Fund, and partly at his own.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Having offered his services to the United States Fish Commission in
any way connected with his labors, he was requested to bring over a
consignment of German carp, a fish which promises to be of great value
in American pisciculture. This was done by him, and he delivered to
the United States carp ponds, in Washington, a number of these fishes
in a healthy condition, which, it is hoped, will, in a few years, be the
progenitors of a large number of that species of fish.

In order to enable Dr. Finsch to carry on his polynesian researches to
better advantage and at less-expense to himself, free passes and reduced
passage tickets for himself and party were obtained from several ef the
transcontinental railroad companies. The Smithsonian Institution pro-
vided Dr. Finsch with a partial outfit for marine exploration, including a
supply of alcohol for the preservation of reptiles and fishes. Dr. Finsch
proceeded first to the Sandwich Islands, and then to the Fijis, and at
the latest advices he had reached one of the groups of the Marshall
Islands.

EXCHANGES.

As was explained in the report for 1878, the system of international
exchanges organized by the Smithsonian Institution nearly thirty years
ago has long been considered one of its most important functions, and
no greater obstruction to the intercourse between the scientific institu-
tions of the Old World and New can be imagined than that of an inter-
ruption of this work. As already stated, an organization intended pri-
marily to aid in the prompt transmission of the publications of the Insti-
tution to its correspondents, at home and abroad, was extended so as to
include the corresponding exchanges of other institutions; this has now
resulted in furnishing by far the most extensive system of exchanges in
existence, the benefits of which are experienced and appreciated all over
the world.

The foreign agencies employed in the Smithsonian exchanges are of
three classes.

First. Individuals or firms, some of them salaried by the Institution
and devoting more or less of their time to its work.

Second. Learned societies or universities, which do on a small scale in
their respective countries what the Smithsonian Institution does on a
larger scale for the world in general.

Third. Special government bureaus of international exchange, organ-
ized for the purpose. It is quite probable that the number of this class,
now restricted to four, namely, the Commission Belge des échanges
internationaux, the Commission Frangaise des échanges internationaux,
the Bureau central scientifique of Haarlem, and the Bundes Canzlei
for Switzerland, will be increased until, possibly, in time, the greater part
of the ser vice in Europe in connection with the Smithsonian Institution,
may be performed by them. This will, of course, constitute a very de-
sirable aid to the Smithsonian Institution and to the second class men-
tioned, especially as to the expenses of the work.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AS

The operations of the Commission Francaise des échanges interna-
tionaux, inaugurated in 1878, have constantly improved in extent and
efficiency through 1879, a large number of boxes having been exchanged
between it and the Smithsonian Institution to the entire satisfaction of
both parties. Numerous applications have been made by the Freneh
bureau to the Smithsonian Institution for special works, public or private,
required by the governmental bureaus, especially for the national library,
the ministry of public instruction, etc. On receipt of these applications
circulars were sent to various parties interested, and a large number of
acceptable returns promptly received and duly forwarded by the Insti-
tution. On the other hand applications by the Institution in behalf of
American bodies have been satisfactorily answered. This feature of the
system of international exchanges is one of great importance.

In addition to the official applications fer special publications of the
United States, made through the system of international exchanges, one
was presented by the French minister to the Smithsonian Institution
for the reports of the United States Fish Commission, those of the sev-
eral State fish commissions, and any other-documents serving to illustrate
the steps taken for the propagation and utilization of fishes in the
United States. This request was in behalf of the Senate of France,
which recently appointed a commission to investigate the relations
between citizens and the State in respect to the rights and conditions
of fishing in both fresh and salt waters. A circular was accordingly
addressed to the parties indicated, and quite a complete series of doc-
uments was obtained and transmitted to Mousicur Outrey, the minister.
He has acknowledged with thanks the receipt of the package, and
given assurance of his appreciation of the courtesy.

It has already been explained that the Smithsonian Institution not
only serves as a medium of exchange to institutions and individuals in
the United States, but also to these of Canada, Central America,
Mexico, the West Indies, and Sonth America. An extra amount of labor
has been imposed upon the Institution, during the past year, owing, in
large part, to the interruption of operations in 1878, caused by the death
of Professor Henry. The accumulated material of that year has, how-
ever, all been disposed of, together with the receipts of 1879; the aggre-
gate being shown in the accompanying schedule. It is quite likely that
operations in this line during 1880 will, be but little behind those of 1879,
as, for years, there has been a steady increase in the bulk of the ex-
changes; and this is not likely to be interrupted.

In the preceding report reference was made to the adoption of a rule,
under authority granted by the Board of Regents, by which packages
received from the government bureaus were charged a uniform rate of
five cents per pound for packing, boxing, and shipping to destination.
This has been carried into effect, but has only secured the return of
about a hundred dollars, evidently not a sufficient sum to affeet ma.
terially the expense of the exchange system—a very onerous burden

S. Mis. 544
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

upon the funds of the Institution, and greatly affecting its operations.
Formerly, when the cost of the exchanges amounted to only two or
three thousand dollars a year, the publications of the Institution were
of much greater extent than they are now; and it is to be hoped that
some provision may be made by which the expenses of exchange may
be materially lessened, and the former very desirable prominence of
the publication department be restored. It is a question whether the
assistance of Congress might not be invoked to make an appropriation
to bear at least a part of the cost. Ifa few thousand dollars were fur-
nished by the Government, it would be of very material aid and tend
greatly to relieve the Institution of a burden which is fast becoming
oppressive. One special argument in favor of such Congressional
action is found in the fact that, while this system of exchanges benefits
equally all the libraries and societies of the country, the benefit of the
returns inuring to the Smithsonian Institution is experienced directly
by Congress; the expenditures for both publications and exchanges
being actually in the interest of the Congressional Library, in which
all the Smithsonian books are now deposited. It may safely be said
that if the amount of money used in carrying on the exchanges was
expended directly in the purchase of books for the Library of Congress,
it would not produce the same yield, in view of the fact that these re-
turns to the Smithsonian Institution consist largely of the publications of
societies interested in the prosecution of theoretical and applied science,
which, while embracing the earliest announcement of important discov-
eries, are for the most part not on sale, and only to be obtained by a
system of exchange.

As in previous years, the following transportation companies have
favored the Institution by a remission of charges upon its packages, and
thus enabled it to carry on its system of international exchanges with a
fr action of the expense which would otherwise have been required.

Anchor Steamship Company. New York and Brazil Steamship Company.
Atlas Steamship Company. New York and Mexico Steamship Company.
Companie Générale Transatlantique. North German Lloyd Steamship Company.
Cunard Steamship Company. Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
Hamburg American Packet Company. Pacific Steam Navigation Company.
Inman Steamship Company. Panama Railroad Company.
Merchants’ Line of Steamers. White Cross Line of Antwerp.
Netherland-American Steam Navigation

Company.

The special thanks of the Institution are again tendered to the above-
mentioned companies for their enlightened liberality.

In addition to this, through the mediation of Mr. Isaac Hinckley,
president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad
Company, the four roads forming the connection between New York and
Washington, namely, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Philadelphia, Wil-
mington and Baltimore, the Baltimore and Potomac, and Baltimore and
Ohio, have agreed to areduction to one-half of the usual charges on first-
class freight. The saving from this concession, although not quite
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

equal to that of free freights by the ocean steamers, is a matter of
very great importance, and is deserving of special acknowledgment.

Messrs. Murray, Ferris & Co., of 62 South street, New York, have
granted free freight to the Bahamas.

Eachange of Government documents.—It will be remembered that some
years avo Congress directed that fifty sets of all government publica-
tions, whether printed by order of Congress or of the departments,
should be placed at the command or the Joint Library Committee for
the purpose of exchange for corresponding publications of other nations.
This work was intrusted toe the Smithsonian Institution, by which it
was carried on for a number of years.

An appropriation of one thousand dollars is made by Congress for
“purposes connected with this exchange, of which a portion is paid for
freight and expenses on boxes of books received by the library through
the Institution. The returns received are increasing rapidly in value,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and in a few years may be expected to nearly or quite equal the trans-
missions.

In accordance with the law relative to the exchange of the official pub
lications of the United States Government for those of foreign nations,
sixty boxes of documents were forwarded during the past year, as shown
by the following list of distribution :

LIBRARY.

A steady increase in the number of additions to thé library of the
Institution has, as usual, characterized the year just past, the aggre-
gate, amounting to 10,203 books, pamphlets, and charts, as compared
with 8,729 in the previous year. The greater portion of these works
have already been transferred to the library of Congress, in accordance
with the arrangements of previous years, where, however, owing to the
very crowded condition of the shelves, they are not very serviceable.
It is much to be hoped, in the interest of the Institution, that some
measures may soon be adopted by Congress for increasing the accom-
modations of the library, and consequent accessibility to its volumes on
the part of students.

As heretofore, the great mass of additions to the library consists of
the transactions of learned societies, which, indeed, constitute its most
important feature. Books published in the regular way ean be pur-
chased without any difficulty through established agencies. Transac-
tions of societies, however, are for the most part, only to be had by an
exchange, and it would be almost impossible to secure the works ob-
tained by the Institution through its exchanges, with any reasonable
amount of money and to any degree of completeness. Livery year new
scientific associations are being formed, and these, for the most part,
take the initiative in seeking an exchange with this establishment.

Of course the older societies are seldom able to furnish volumes of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

their series which date very far back; but the Smithsonian Institution
has succeeded in completing its sets, partly by purchase of such as have
drifted into the second hand or antiquarian book trade, and partly by
exchange with public libraries possessing duplicates. It is confidently
believed that the library of the Institution, and consequently that of Con-
gress, 1S in possession of a larger and more perfect series of such transae-
tions, as also, of scientific periodicals than any other library extant.

The accompanying memorandum gives an indication of some of the
more important additions to the library.

The receipts from the system of Congressional exchanges already re-
ferred to, by which fifty sets of the publications of the government are
available for exchanges with foreign governments have also been very
great; but as these are not catalogued, but transferred directly to the
library of Congress, it is, of course, to the report of Mr. Spofford that
reference must be had for details.

CORRESPONDENCE.

In the report of 1878, under this head, an explanation was given as
to the causes of the large increase in the correspondence during that
year. This statement will apply also to the period of 1879, with the
exception that, while letters of condolence on account of the death of
Professor Henry have necessarily been fewer, the number of communi-
cations relative to exchanges has exceeded that of any previous year,
the increase in this direction being largely due to renewed activity in
that department of the Institution, and especially in the international
branch of the system.

CO-OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.

Very important service has been rendered to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and to the National Museum under its charge, by an order from
the Secretary of War authorizing the use of the Quartermaster’s Depart-
ment in the transportation of collections, &c. As many of these come
from regions where there is no estabiished mode of transportation, the
benefit of this arrangement promises to be very great, and under it quite
a number of boxes have been already transferred to Washington.

CO-OPERATION OF THE INSTITUTION IN THE WORK OF OTHERS.

In previous years requests have frequently been received from foreign
governments, especially those of Japan and China, and of Central and
South America, for the selection of persons to carry on certain opera-
tions, particularly those relating to engineering and mining geology,
nearly every year bringing at least one call of this character. To this
the year 1879 furnished no exception, the Government of Salvador,
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

through the American minister, Mr. George Williamson, having asked
to be supplied with an experienced geologist to explore the recently dis-
covered gold fields of the state. Of course in such cases the advice of
experts is always solicited, and several of these uniting on the name of
Mr. Goodyear, a resident of California, and formerly connected with the
geological survey of that State, he was selected for the mission in ques-
tion, and has already entered upon his duties.

Communication from the Belgian Government in regard to a prize for the
improvement of Belgian harbors.—On the 27th of December, 1879, the
following communication was received from the chargé d’affaires of Bel-

gium :
[Translation.]

“BELGIAN LEGATION,
“ Washington, December 27, 1879.

‘Sire: Inclosed in a communication dated Mareh 29, 1875, Mr. Del-
fosse, the Belgian minister at Washington, transmitted to Prof. Joseph
Henry a copy of a royal decree of December 14, 1574, instituting an
annual prize of 25,000 franes for the purpose of encouraging intellectual
labors in Belgium, and to induce foreigners to take part in this move-
ment.

“According to the terms of article 12 of this decree, the prize to be
contested for in an international competition will be awarded in 1881 for
the best paper on the means of improving harbors situated on low and sandy
coasts like those of Belgium.

“The government desires again to call the attention of foreigners to
this subject, inviting them to compete with Belgian authors. To this
end I shall be obliged to you if you will have a translation of the in-
closed notice published in the annual report of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, or in any other manner you may see fit, to insure it the greatest
possible publicity in the United States.

“Accept, sir, the assurance of my most distinguished considerations,

“Gro. NEYT,
“Chargé W@W Affaires of Belgium.

“Prof. SPENCER F. BAIRD,

“Secretary Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.”

‘“ NoTice.—By a decree of December 14, 1874, His Majesty the King
of the Belgians has instituted an annual prize of 25,000 frances ($5,000)
for the purpose of encouraging intellectual labors.

“The prize to be contested for in an international competition will be
awarded in 1881 for the best paper on the means of improving harbors situ-
ated on low and sandy coasts like those of Belgium.

“ Foreigners desiring to take part in the competition should send their
papers, printed or manuscript, before the Ist of January, 1531, to the
minister of the interior at Brussels.

“The manuscript which will receive the prize will be published in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

course of the year following that in which the award will have been
made.

‘‘The latter is to be made by a jury appointed by the King of the Bel
gians. This jury will be composed of seven members, three Belgians
and four foreigners of different nationalities.”

In reply Mr. Neyt was informed that his letter would be published in
the current report of the Institution, as being the place most likely to at-
tract the attention of persons interested in the offer of a prize, and the
fact that it was open to international competition.

Centennial Commission.—An application was received during the year
from the executive council of the International Exhibition of 1876 to take
charge of the archives of the exhibition, believed to be of great historical
importance and value, and the permanent preservation of which is con-
sidered a matter of much importance. It is accordingly proposed to
devote one of the fire-proof rooms in the new National Museum to that
purpose; this being especially appropriate, since the building itself was
erected to receive the exhibition of the United States made at Philadel-
phia, as also the large mass of donations of objects of art, industry, and
economy presented to the United States by foreign nations.

Armenian History.—The Institution has received from the Archbishop
of Trajanof, and general abbot of the Armenian Mekitrarian Institution
of Venice, the following letter, dated November 11, 1879:

‘¢ Knowing the interest taken by your Institution in the diffusion of
knowledge throughout the world, of which we have continued proofs in
the gifts of books with which we are honored by you, I have the honor
to submit to your kindness the following request:

“Considering the want of education of the eastern nations, who
now, by new political conditions, awake to a new life of progress, and
considering also their scanty means of partaking of all those benefits
which are the enjoyment of civilized nations, especially in these years
of great poverty, we have undertaken to procure means by which we
might publish and distribute gratuitously useful books of general and
popular knowledge. As this, our object, involves great expense, we
hope that the societies of the Old and New Worlds will hasten to our
assistance. We have already prepared in our monastery, in the Ar-
menian language, a large work on Armenia, comprising a description
connected with ancient and modern history of its towns, villages, public
establishments, monuments, churches, monasteries, &c., a complete work
which we hope will be very interesting, not only to Armenian scholars,
but also to such orientalists as make a particular study of the old history
of eastern nations. We are about to begin its publication, which wil:
be with many maps and illustrations. This will be a difficult task,
especially at this time; wherefore we hope that your Institution will fee’
the interest of such work and generously help us to publish it worthily.~
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Manitoba Library.—The Institution has been informed of the organiza-
tion of the *‘ Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba,” at Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada, for the purpose of collecting a library of books, a
cabinet and museum, &¢., generally illustrative of the civil, religious,
literary, and natural history of the lands and territories lying to the west
and north of Lake Superior. Aid has been solicited in carrying out these
objects by the donation of books and specimens, and the attention of the
correspondents of the Institution is especially called to this request.

Zoological Society of London.—The services of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution were invoked by this Society to assist it in procuring some speci-
mens of American mule deer (Cervus macrotis) two males and three fe-
males being desired. The commission was intrusted to the Hon. J. D.
Caton, of Ottawa, IIL, a gentleman who is better acquainted with the
American ruminants, deer, antelope, &c., than any other person, and
who has written an admirable treatise upon them. Judge Caton was
able to secure a fine specimen in his neighborhood, which was trans-
mitted to the Central Park Menagerie, New York, for safe keeping, Mr.
W. A. Conklin, the superintendent, very kindly agreeing to receive and
ship anything of the kind which might be sent to him for the purpose.
Messrs. Henderson & Co., the agents of the Anchor Line of steamers to
Great Britain, with their usual liberality, offered to forward this animal
free of charge; and it was consequently shipped per steamer Victoria on
the 26th of February.

GALLERY OF ART.

It was not deemed desirable by my predecessor that there should be
any antagonism of interests by the duplication of collections in the dif-
ferent departments in Washington, and an arrangement was made, many
years ago, by which all specimens of plants and matters derived from
the vegetable kingdom, as well as all insects, were to be placed in charge
of the Department of Agriculture, and everything relating to the human
subject, such as crania, pathological preparations, &c., in that of the
Army Medical Museum. These establishments, in return, were to de-
liver to the Institution all animals, minerals, and articles of ethnology or
archeology received by them. This arrangement has been maintained,
to mutual advantage. In a similar manner it was proposed to deposi5s
acceptable works of art in the Corcoran Art Gallery, and quite a number
of articles have already been placed there. During the past year the
following deposits have been made. It is, of course, understood that
these are not gifts but simply loans, to be returned whenever occasion
requires.

BUILDINGS.

Smithsonian Building—Many of the original plans of this building
were either lost or greatly defaced in the fire of 1865, and it was thought
desirable to have new drawings made to exhibit the details of the edifice,
especially as the interior contruction had been considerably altered:
first, in consequence of the falling down of the central part while in
process of erection; and, second, as a consequence of the repairs re-
quired by the fire of 1865. These drawings have been carefully executed
by Mr. Gorham, and, after being photographed, the originals have been
deposited in a fire-proof safe. Upon these drawings have been plotted
all the pipes connected with the water, gas, and steam apparatus, with
the various stops and connections.

New Yale locks have been applied to all the rooms throughout the
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

building, and so arranged that while persons occupying a room, or suite
of rooms, are provided with keys that will open them only, a single
pass-key opens every door in the building; this, of course, being held
only by the proper authority.

Other alterations have been made in the building for the purpose of
increasing to the utmost its efficiency and reducing the expense of super-
intendence and maintenance. The document room has been enlarged,
by the removal of numerous obstructions, and refitted. The eastern
wing of the building, formerly occupied by Professor Henry as a dwell-
ing-house, has been converted into a series of offices, and a door cut from
the old document room to an adjacent apartment, which is now used for
the reception and classification of a portion of the exchanges.

Eleven large fire-proof doors have been placed in the building to iso-
late the different wings and floors.

The laboratory has been rearranged and many other improvements
have been made. These were commenced late in the autumn of 1878
and finished in the spring of 1879. It is believed that the building is
now in a condition of thorough efficiency and adaptation to its scientific
purposes.

Art building and laboratory.—The provision by Congress for an exhibi-
tion by the United States Government at the Centennial Exposition, at
Philadelphia, in 1876, made it necessary for the Smithsonian Institution
to construct a special building for the purpose of preparing its share of
the display, and a small edifice was accordingly erected on the grounds
for the purpose of giving increased accommodation to the modelers,
artists, and photographer. This building has been in use for nearly five
years, and has rendered excellent service by the facilities if has afforded.
It is, however, now inadequate to its object, and in the new museum
building, provision has been made for the various departments referred
to. Some suitable occupation will be found for the old building.

Armory building.— Another building in charge of the Smithsonian
Institution is that formerly occupied as an armory by the militia of the
District of Columbia, but which, ceasing to discharge that function, was
placed by Congress in the care of tue Institution for the storage of its
material which could not be received in the present edifice. This armory
building, the dimensions of which are one hundred feet by fifty, is very
massive in construction and contains four floors, at present entirely filled
with boxes containing the Centennial collections which are to constitute
the material for exhibition in the new National Museum building.

The surveys of Professors Hayden and Powell having been discon-
tinued by order of Congress, a portion of the public property belonging
to them has been stored in the Armory building and Smithsonian
Institution during the past year, Mr. King, the director of the new
geological survey, making use of such of these materials as he requires.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63
SPECIAL DONATIONS.

Among the contributions or donations to the Institution, during the
year, are several that do net belong directly under the head of natural
history, but of which mention should be made.

Mr. F. B. Sanborn, agent of the Hydropneumatie Fire Extinguishing
Company, presented to the Institution a specimen of his apparatus in
working order. This has been placed where it will be most available
in the very undesirable contingency of a fire in the building.

The Herring Fire-proof Safe Company, of New York, some months ago
intimated its willingness to present to the Institution a first-class speci-
men of its work, and, as among the specimens in the National Museum
are some masses of native gold, precious stones, and other valuable
property, it was thought best to request that the offer be supplied in
the form of a safe suitable for exhibiting such objects.’

A plan of asafe was accordingly prepared with doors on opposite sides
and when opened revealing series of glass shelves, inclosed and secured
by plate glass fronts; the whole apparatus to be seven feet high, four
feet wide, and two feet deep. This was put under construction by the
company, has been completed, and is now ready for transmission to
Washington whenever called for. It is proposed to use this as part of
the fixtures of the new National Museum.

Another contribution of a somewhat similar character was made to the
Institution by the Yale Lock Company, who constructed and presented
a post-office box for the use of the employés. In addition to the clerks
and assistants of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum,
there are a number of gentlemen having rooms in the building, who,
although receiving no salary, render important service in the supervision
of collections and identification of specimens. Nearly all these persons
receive their mail at the Institution, and it has heretofore been difficult
to properly subdivide and place such matter in the hands of those for
whom it was destined. Under the new arrangement each individual now
has his own box, with a key which alone will open it, and the mail as
received is properly assorted in the boxes. -This post-office box consti-
tutes quite an ornamental piece of furniture, and supplies the desired
accommodations.

MEETINGS, ETC.

National Academy of Sciences.—For several years after its organization
the annual meetings of the National Academy of Sciences were held at
the Smithsonian Institution, although, even with the limited number
usually attending, it was difficult to furnish the necessary accommoda-
tions. In view of the increasing number of members of the academy,
and of the visitors attending the reading of papers, it was concluded to
make other arrangements for 1879, and, accordingly, the pastor and
vestry of All Souls’ Church having kindly consented to grant the use
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of their new and very convenient edifice for the purpose, the meeting
was held therein on the 14th-I8th of April, 1879, the accommodations
being entirely satisfactory. A similar favor will probably be asked of
the church for 1880; but it is thought that with the completion of the
new National Museum building a suitable room can be furnished in it
by 1881, so that the academy will again have its headquarters under
the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.

Anthropological Society of Washington—An Anthropological Society
has lately been organized in the District of Columbia for the purpose of
bringing together those especially interested in the study of man, and
the use of a room in the Institution was cheerfully accorded, on its appli-
cation. Here meetings are regularly held every other week throughout
the year, and the large and increasing attendance shows the appreciation
of the subject in Washington. No similar American society appears to
be in a more flourishing condition or more earnest in its investigations.

Lectures.—The Regents’ room was also accorded to Prof. C.S. Hastings,
of the Johns Hopkins University, for a special course of lectures on
astronomical physics. This was attended by the gentlemen connected
with the Observatory, Nautical Almanac, Coast Survey, and other scien-
tific establishments in the city.

LOSS OF EMPLOYEES AND COLLABORATORS.

It is proper to mention the sudden death, by apoplexy, of Mr. Tobias
N. Woltz, on the 9th day of March. He had been connected with the
Institution, as master mechanic and superintendent of the building
for twenty-two years; was always ciligent, industrious, and faithful,
and, as he left nothing to his family, I would recommend that, on
account of his long and useful services to the Institution, an allowance
be made for his funeral expenses.

The report for 1877 contained a notice of the death of Mr. Fielding
B. Meek, a gentleman who, although not salaried by the Institution,
made the building his home for many years, while engaged in his spe-
cialty, as a paleontologist, with the government surveys. Mr. Meek died
intestate, and letters of administration were granted to Professor Henry
upon his property. Diligent search was made in various directions for
several years for heirs, but without success. Lately, however, a distant
relative has appeared to claim the estate, and the matter is now before
the coarts.

The library and notes of Mr. Meek were purchased by the Institution
to sezare them for the use of paleontological students.

Among the col.aborators of the Institution whose death has occurred
during the past year is Dr. JAMmS AITKEN MEIGS, of Philadelphia. He

>

was born in Philadelphia on the 31st of July, 1829, received his educa-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

tion in the public schools of that city, graduated at the Jefferson Medi-
cal College in 1851, and devoted himself with zeal and energy to the
practice of his profession. He was professor of climatology and physi-
ology at the Franklin Institute for eight years, and during this period
lectured frequently on physiological and ethnological subjects before
various associations in our prominent cities.

In 1857 he accepted the chair of institutes of medicine in the Phila-
delphia College of Medicine; and was, after a few years, transferred to the
Pennsylvania College. His lectures on physiology attracted much at-
tention, as no sustained systematic attempt to teach physiology experi-
mentally had been made before in either of the four medical schools then
existing in Philadelphia. In 1868 he was elected to the Jefferson Medi-
cal College to succeed the late Prof. Robley Dunglison, on the recom-
mendation of the highést medical authorities in this country and Hu-
rope. He was an active member of the leading scientific societies ; con-
tributed numerous and valuable papers to medical and other journals.
He arranged and classified the extensive collection of human crania in
the Academy of Natural Sciences, and prepared a systematic catalogue
of the collection. He also devoted much time to physiological and ethno-
logical researches, and in all his relations in life was eminent for purity
of character, clearness and vigor of intellect, and ardor alike in the pur-
suit of knowledge and imparting instruction to others. He died in
Philadelphia on the 9th of November, 1879.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The act of Congress of 1846, establishing the Smithsonian Institution,
placed under its charge, in proportion as suitable arrangements could
be made for their reception, all objects of natural history, mineralogy,
and geology, antiquities, &c., belonging to the United States. At the
time of the passage of the act the government collections consisted es-
sentially of the objects gathered by the celebrated exploring expedition
of Capt. Charles Wilkes, which even to the present time has been by
far the most extensive and exhaustive enterprise of its kind conducted
by any government. Its results would have been very much larger but
for the loss of one of the vessels, the ‘‘ Peacock,” off the mouth of the
Columbia River. In this were contained an immense number of articles
from the islands of the Pacific Ocean and from the coast of Oregon and
California.

The objects brought back to Washington were placed in charge of the
Commissioner of Patents, and an appropriation was made regularly by
Congress for their maintenance and superintendence.

In 1856 the completion of the central part of the Smithsonian build-
ing and the need by the Patent Office of the space in its building occupied
by the collections of the Wilkes’ expedition, brought about an arrangement

S. Mis. 54-———5
66 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

between the Committee on Patents in the House of Representatives and
the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, by which the latter agreed
to accept the custody of the collections, on condition that the necessary
appropriations for their maintenance in the Smithsonian building should
be continued by Congress, to include also the expense of the construc-
tion of cases and other requirements. This was carried into effect, and
in 1857 the government collections were transferred ; since which time
they have been in the custody of the Institution. Prior to that date,
however, large numbers of government and other specimens had been
received and cared for at the Smithsonian Institution, but not displayed.
These, with the Wilkes’ collection and a few others received with them,
may be considered as marking the beginning of the National Museum.

The institution now points with great satisfaction to the progress that
has been accomplished in about twenty-two years, at the end of which
time one of the largest and best appointed collections of natural history
and ethnology extant has been developed.

INCREASE OF THE MUSEUM.

Coming now to the consideration of the condition and history of the
National Museum for the year 1879, and beginning with its increase,
the general nature of the additions to the Museum during the year will
be readily gathered by reference to the alphabetical list of donations
and the memoranda in regard to explorations. It may be noted that
the donations in 1879 very greatly exceeded those of any previous
year, amounting to 1,173 separate entries, while those of 1878 were
1,075. A large portion of the number consists of contributions made
by the fishing vessels of Gloucester, Mass., as referred to more par-
ticularly under the head of operations of the United States Fish Com-
mission. The additions to the Museum are derived from four princi-
pal sources, viz: 1. Government exploring and surveying parties. 2.
Explorations and researches of the Smithsonian Institution. 3. Miscel-
laneous contributions. 4. By exchanges of specimens. A fifth element
of increase in most museums is by purchase. This, however, amounts
to very little in the case of the National Museum, and is for the most
part confined to an occasional specimen of archeology needed to fill a gap.

As the Institution has not been hitherto prepared to undertake the
gathering of universal collections, but has confined its efforts more par-
ticularly to the representation of the animal and mineral kingdom of
the New World, there has been less opportunity to increase its display
by exchanges, while its own collections from government expeditions
and by contributions of its correspondents covered the greater part of
what is absolutely desired. The opportunity of extensive exchanges is
still open, however, and may possibly be resorted to hereafter.

Among the more important collaborators in the way of exchanges
may be mentioned the educational authorities of Japan, who have
placed the National Museum under direct obligations by the transmission
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

of well-arranged and preserved collections of the natural history of that
country. The most important of these is a series of the fishes, partly
preserved in alcohol and partly dried. These came in excellent condi-
tion and has been accurately identified by Japanese naturalists attached
tothe Museum. Already over two hundred species have been furnished,
constituting an extremely valuable means of investigating the fishes of
. the North Pacific coast. Their particular importance is in their relation-
ship in illustration of the ichthyology of the waters of the western coast
of the United States.

These specimens were furnished by the Mombusho or Educational
Museum of Tokio, which has also supplied a large series of minerals and
rocks of the country.

A very valuable collection of the fishes of Norway was presented to
the Institution by the University of Christiania, as prepared by Profes-
sor Esimark, at the request of Mr. Robert Collett, a correspondent of the
Institution. These are particularly acceptable as furnishing the means
of comparison with the many species obtained from the off-shore fishing-
grounds by American fishermen.

From the National Museum of the City of Mexico some very interest-
ing articles have been received in exchange, principally of an archo-
logical character.

An important exchange of birds with the American Museum of Natu-
ral History in New York will be found mentioned further on.

The additions to the museum from the operations of government
parties, or those fitted out in whole or in part by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, will be found ina brief mention under the head of Explorations,
The details, as also those of the miscellaneous contributions, are given
in the alphabetical list of donors and their donations.

Mammals.—The collections of mammals sent by Mr. Turner and Mr.
Nelson, from Alaska, and by Lieutenant Wheeler, of the Engineers,
from Colorado, &c., are most important.

Birds.—Of birds, an extremely valuable donation of 295 species and
318 specimens was made by the American Museum of Natural History
in New York; these being for the most part either specimens not rep-
resented in the National Museum or in better condition than any it had
been able to procure. <A suitable return will be made in duplicate birds
and other objects.

The collections of birds made by Mr. Nelson and Mr. Turner, already
referred to under the head of Explorations, are of very great interest,
embracing, as they do, large numbers of excelient specimens.

Lieutenant Wheeler is also to be mentioned in this series for his
deposit of many valuable skins beautifully prepared by Mr. Henshaw,
constituting part of the collections of the United States Gvographical
Survey of the One-hundreth Meridian.

The birds collected by Mr. Ridgway at Cobb’s Island, mentioned
under the head of explorations, were also of much value.
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Some specimens were collected on the Grand Banks by the fishermen,
and by Messrs. Osborne and Scudder, which are also noteworthy.

Several rare specimens of Texas birds were obtained by Mr. Ragsdale.

Reptiles—A miscellaneous collection of reptiles was received from
various sources, more especially of living serpents, salamanders, turtles,
and lizards, from many different contributors. These came in part from
Mr. Frank W. Hayward, of South Carolina, Mr. 8. T. Walker, of Florida,
Dr. Lightburne, of Fort Mohave, and many others, and have served a
. most admirable purpose for making the series of plaster casts of Ameri-
can reptiles, which is superior in interest and extent to anything extant
in public museums at home or abroad.

To Mr. Edward Newton, colonial secretary of Jamaica, we owe a living
specimen of the yellow boa, a rare serpent of great size, of which admi-
rable copies have been made.

Fishes.—The collections in this department, as might be expected,
from the relations of the United States Fish Commission to the Smith-
sonian Institution, have included many new and rare species from the
Atlanticand Pacifie Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the lakes, and the interior
waters. The amount of the collections is entirely too great to attempt
a specification, although among the most important may be mentioned
a series furnished by the Museum of the University of Christiania of
seventy-one species of Norwegian fishes, and the collection from Japan,
from the Mombusho Museum, already referred to under the head of
Exchanges.

To Mr. E. G. Blackford, the enterprising fish-dealer of Fulton Market,
New York, the Institution has for years been under many obligations
for his zeal in collecting all the rare fishes that came to the New York
market, and forwarding such of them to the Institution as he had reason
to believe were desirable. Many new species, and others of great rarity
have been thus selected by Mr. Blackford, who has also rendered most
important service in receiving various consignments of fish packed in
ice from various parts of the country and even from Europe, and in
repacking and forwarding them to Washington.

To the masters and crews of the Gloucester fishing-fleet most special
acknowledgments are due for their earnest desire to place at the com-
mand of the government the means of information in regard to the fields
of labor traversed by them. A full statement of these contributions
will be found in the list of donations to the United States Fish Com-
mission.

The United States Fish Commission itself was stationed at Province-
town, Mass., during the last summer, and secured great numbers of fishes.

Marine invertebrates—Of marine invertebrates, by far the most im-
portant collections are those furnished by the Gloucester fishing-fleet, re-
ferred to under the head of Fishes,and by the United States Fish
Commission at Provincetown.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

The labors of Dr. White in the Northern Pacific also resulted in an
important contribution.

Insects.—No extensive collections of insects came to hand during the
year; perhaps the most important being that from Central Mexico,
furnished by Professor Dugés. These, as before, have been sent to the
United States Agricultural Department.

Plants.—Various packages of plants, of no great importance, have
been received during the year, and, like the insects, have been trans-
ferred to the Department of Agriculture.

Minerals—Many important collections of minerals, geological speci-
mens, &e., have been received during the vear; a valuable contribution
being that already referred to, as sent by the Mombusho Museum of
Japan, consisting of what professes to be a complete series of the
minerals and rocks of that country.

Mr. Thomas Donaldson, a member of the United States Land Commis-
sion, while visiting the West in connection with his duties, made a large
collection of minerals and ores from Leadville, Deadwood, and other
parts of the country; the whole filling some fifteen large boxes. This
colleetion constitutes a very desirable supplement to the immense series
of asimilar character gathered by him at the request of the Smithsonian
Institution in 1874, 1875, and 1876, constituting the larger part of the
great display of the mineral wealth of the country made under the
auspices of the Institution in the government building at the Inter-
national Exhibition of 1876.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE MUSEUM.”

The administration of the Museum by the various assistants employed
during the year has been entirely satisfactory. The work has been under
the special charge of Mr. G. Brown Goode, having as collaborators: Dr.
Charles Rau, Dr. E. Foreman, and Mr. I. H. Cushing, for the department
of anthropology; Dr. F. M. Endlich, curator of mineralogy; Mr. Robert
Ridgway, curator of ornithology; Dr. T. H. Bean, curator of ichthyology ;
Dr. H. C. Yarrow, assisted by Mr. 8. C. Brown, curator of herpetology;
Dr. Elliott Coues, curator of mammalogy; Mr. William H. Dall, curator
of marine and aquatic invertebrates. Mr. Dall, Dr. Coues, and Dr. Yar-
row performed their services without any compensation.

All the collections, as received, have been properly treated for preserva-
tion from destruction by insects or otherwise, and entered in the several
record books; the total number of entries for the year 1879 being 11,552.

The distribution of duplicate specimens, already referred to, has also
been carried on on a large scale. The details will be found in the ap-
pended tables.

As usual, the material of the institution has been made use of by ex-
perts and specialists for the prosecution of their researches. Although it
is most convenient to have this done at the institution, yet wherever the
interest of science requires it, collections are sent to any part of the world,
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Among the more important of these researches are those of Mr.
George N. Lawrence, Mr. Ridgway, and Dr. Coues, upon American
birds; of Mr. J. A. Allen, of Cambridge, upon the mammals; of Pro-
fessor Gill, Mr. Goode, Dr. Bean, and Professor Jordan, upon the fishes;
and Prof. Edward D. Cope, upon the reptiles.

The marine invertebrates collected by the United States Fish Com-
mission are in process of investigation by Prof. A. E. Verrill, assistegl
by Mr. Oscar Harger, Mr. Sanderson Smith, Prof. 8. J. Smith, and Mr.
Rh. Rathbun.

A series of skulls and skeletons of the Central American tapir was
sent to Mr. Edward Alston, of London, for a critical examination. By
such assignments, facts of more or less importance can be obtained ;
and it is in this way that the Institution best carries out the will of its
founder for “ the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

An immense mass of duplicate material belonging to the National
Museum has been used in the way of a distribution of an educational
series of objects to various colleges, academies, and learned societies of
the United States, special provision having been made for the same by
act of Congress.

NEW MUSEUM BUILDING.

For a detailed account of the measures taken to secure additional ac-
commodations for the collections belonging to the National Museum,
especially those gathered for the Philadelphia Exhibition and obtained
from other panties at its close, reference is made to the reports of 1876,
1877, and 1878. It will here be sufficient to say that after several fruit-
less efforts, Congress, in the sundry civil bill of March 3, 1879, made an
appropriation for a National Museum, in the following terms:

‘Tor a fire-proof building for the use of the National Museum, three
hundred feet square, .o be erected under the direction and supervision
of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, in accordance with the
plans now on file with the Joint Committee of Public Buildings and
Grounds, on the southeastern portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian
Institution, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars; said building to
be placed east of the Smithsonian Institution, leaving a roadway be-
tween it and the latter of not less than fifty feet, with its north front on
a line with the south face of the buildings of the Agricultural Depart-
ment and of the Smithsonian Institution; and all expenditures for the
purposes herein mentioned, not including anything for architectural
plans, shall be audited by the proper officers of the Treasury Depart-
ment.” :

The estimates had been furnished by Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, con-
sulting architects, as to the cost of such a building, and upon their rep-
resentations the sum of $250,000 was asked for and granted, with the
understanding that it would be sufficient for its purpose, although no
limitation to that effect was made by Congress. As soon as possible
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. yal

after the passage of the act, the whole subject was carefully reviewed,
and the accuracy of the estimates confirmed by Mr. Edward Clark,
Architect of the Capitol, and General M. C. Meigs, of the Army. Con-
tracts were then entered into, and as labor and material were at the
time at the very lowest figures, several of the estimates were found to be
greater than the amount of the contract entered into. Owing to the excep-
tionally moderate winter and the freedom from rain and storms, only four-
teen days were lost during the year by non-preventable causes. For a
full report of the details connected with the construction of the building
reference may be made to the report of the National Museum Building
Commission, herewith communicated. There is every reason to believe
that the whole work will be accomplished within the appropriation, by
June next.

No provision was made in the appropriation by Congress for the con-
struction of the necessary cases, but an estimate has been presented,
which it is hoped will be granted, so that this work may be started with
the beginning of the next fiscal year. The period of complete installa-
tion of collections on hand, and the opening of the building to the public,
will depend upon the amount of the appropriation and the rapidity with
which the contractors may complete their work. The new building will
be devoted more particularly to industrial exhibits, intended to show
the animal and mineral resources of the United States and their prac-
tical applications to the wants or luxuries of man. The department of
anthropology will also be largely represented. How far natural history
can find a place in the building will depend upon the space required
for the collections mentioned. It is confidently expected that this build-
ing when finished will be one of the most attractive objects of the kind
extant, and but little inferior to the celebrated museums of foreign
countries.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

Reference has been made in many previous reports to the part taken
by the United States Fish Commission in the investigation of the condi-
tion of the sea fisheries and in the propagation of food-fishes in the
United States, your Secretary having been appointed by the President,
in 1871, to the duty of carrying out the objects designated by a law of
Congress in the same year. Serving without any compensation and re-
ceiving simply his own board and necessary personal expenses while
actually engaged in the work, he has been obliged, in the increasing
extent of his Fish Commission work, to devote to it more and more of
the hours that would be usually allowed for leisure and recreation, his
prime duty being, of course, to the Smithsonian Institution.

The work of the Commission is divided into two branches: First, an
inquiry into the condition of the fisheries on the Atlantic and Pacific
and Great Lake coasts ; and second, the propagation of useful food-tishes
72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Under the head of “inquiry” the summers of successive years have been
spent at various stations from the Bay of Fundy to Long Island Sound,
and the information obtained has been published in the annual reports
of the Fish Commission. The information obtained by this commission
was of great importance to the United States Government at the Halifax
convention.

For the work of 1879, Provincetown, at the extreme end of Cape Cod,
was selected as the central station, and with the assistance of the steamer
“Speedwell,” under the command of Capt. Z. L. Tanner, a successful
investigation was prosecuted in regard to the natural history and
physies of the adjacentseas. The steamer, with its crew, were furnished
by Hon. R. W. Thompson, Secretary of the Navy, in accordance with
the law of Congress to that effect. It may not be out of place to men-
tion in this connection that of the departments of the government that
of the Navy has been especially liberal in its construction of the law, and
has rendered the greatest possible aid in the work of the Commission.

The labors of the commission in 1879 were made directly conducive
to the success of the efforts in connection with the census, as already
referred to.

An incident of the summer’s work was, as before, the collection of
vast numbers of specimens of marine animals, a full series of which will
be reserved for the National Museum, and the duplicates arranged for
distribution to various educational establishments throughout the coun-
try. At the present time, of all the means of instruction in geueral
natural history—a subject attracting much attention in schools and
colleges—there are none more difficult to obtain than objects illustrating
the botany and zoology of the ocean. The expense of the apparatus
for securing such specimens is far beyond anything but what the most
favored persons can command. On this account it was thought proper
to do the work as far as possible for the whole country as well as for
the National Museum, and numerous objects of this kind have been
obtained and are now being properly arranged and packed under com-
petent direction for distribution. Many sets of these will be in this way
scattered throughout the country, to the very great advantage of science.

One material result of the work of the past summer has been the
discovery of an entirely new food-fish off the coast, both genus and
species being previously unknown to science. This is the Lepholatilus
chameleonticeps, or tile-fish. A bank where this fish is found was dis-
covered near Noman’s Land, where it can be taken in any desired quan-
tity; some specimens obtained weighing as much as ninety pounds.
As the fish has very much the same general food characteristics as the
cod, there is reason to believe that in time it will become an imporant
article of trade. F

A great extension was also established in the distribution of the new
fish discovered in June, 1877, off the coast of Gloucester, namely, the
pole flounder, or Glyptocephalus cynoglossus. This is a species of flat-fish,
REPORT OF THE- SECRETARY. 73

the occurrence of which along our shores was entirely unknown at the
time, not being taken on the trawls of the fishermen, while at the same
time it is possibly the most abundant species of its family on the coast.
In the smallness of its mouth, which prevents its being captured 3y the
hook, and the lack of use of the beam-trawl as a fisherman’s engine,
are to be found the explanation of the ignorance of the fishermen in
regard to the species.

The second division of the work of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, that of the multiplication and distribution of useful food-fishes,
has also been carried on during the year on a greatly enlarged scale.

Special work was done at Avoca, in Albemarle Sound, in connection
with the shad and fresh-water herring, many millions being hatched out,
of which the greater part were distributed to the interior waters of
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and other States. A very
important extension of the work consisted in the successful experiment
of the artificial propagation of the striped bass or rockfish, a species of
great economical importance, but which had hitherto eluded all our
search during its spawning season.

The second station for the hatching of shad was established as in pre-
vious years at a point a short distance below Havre de Grace, on the
Susquehanna River, where also many millions were produced. About
half of the number were planted in the Susquehanna itself, for the pur-
pose of keeping up the supply. The remainder were distributed to.
numerous States throughout the Union.

The station on the McCloud River, California, for procuring the eggs
of the California salmon, was efficiently worked by Mr. Livingston
Stone, the superintendent. About eight millions of eggs were obtained
and distributed, for the most part, to the commissioners of the different
States. One hundred thousand eggs were presented to each of the
governments of France, Holland, and Germany, where the California
salmon is greatly appreciated from its promise of furnishing a very
important addition to the food resources of Europe.

Arrangements are now being made on the McCloud River for the
hatching of the California trout, which has some peculiarities whick
render it desirable for introduction to the Eastern States.

Other stations were at Bucksport, Me., for the propagation of the sea-
salmon, and at Grand Lake Stream for land-locked salmon, both being
in charge of Mr. Charles G. Atkins, and furnishing their quota of mate-
rial for the multiplication of food-fishes.

After several years of effort, the commission has been able to obtain
a stock of German carp for distribution. This fish promises to be of
great economical value, and the demand for it is very great, numerous
applications being received every day from all parts of the country.
About ten thousand have already been distributed, at the rate of about
eight pairs to each applicant, meeting but a small part of the demand.
The stock for the year 1880, it is hoped, will supply this in a measur-
able degree.
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The experiments initiated at Gloucester in 1878, looking towards the
artificial propagation of the cod, were carried to completion in February,
1879, about one and a half millions of fish having been hatched out and
placed in Gloucester Harbor. The experiment was in every way satis-
factory, and the experience gained will be of the utmost benefit in the
future. The harbor of Gloucester, during the past summer, was full of
young codfish hatched out in this way, presenting a palpable feature of
the work, which was appreciated by all the inhabitants of that city.

For the purpose of more efficiently conducting the work of the com-
mission in connection with the shad, herring, striped bass, codfish, and
other species, an appropriation of $45,000 was made in March last by
Congress for the construction of a suitable steamer, which should serve
as a floating: hatching establishment. This vessel is nearly completed,
and will, it is hoped, be ready for the work of 1880.

Mr. Newton P. Scudder was sent, during the summer of 1879, to study
the halibut fisheries on the coast of Greenland. For a cnet of years
the Holsteinburg Banks, a short distance south of Disco, Greenland,
were visited by from one to seven vessels from Gloucester, annually.
These vessels remained three or four months on the fishing-ground, and
salted down in their holds the halibut which they caught, and which
were brought home to be prepared in the smoke-houses.

Mr. Scudder sailed from Gloucester on the schooner Bunker Hill, June
10, 1879, and on his return arrived in Gloucester September 17. He
secured a fine collection of Arctie marine birds, also, an interesting series
of Arctic fishes and invertebrates, and some valuable ethnological speci-
mens.

Mr. H. L. Osborne was sent to the Grand Banks to study the methods
of the deep-sea cod fishery of that region. He left Gloucester on the
schooner Victor, July 10, and returned home in the latter part of Oc-
tober. His natural history collections were quite extensive, especially of
the different species of mollusks; and he has in preparation an elaborate
report upon the methods of this fishery and the characteristics of the
fishermen and the results of his natural history exploration.

Mr. J. P. Gordy made a short cruise on a Gloucester mackerel schooner,
and has presented a report upon the mental and moral characteristics
of the fishermen and upon the methods of this fishery. He returned to
Gloucester August 3, after an absence of three weeks.

CO-OPERATION OF THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION AND OF THE
CENSUS OF 1580.

In the previous reports of the Census Department, the almost ludi-
crous incompleteness of that portion relating to the fisheries has been
a matter of notoriety; and it was with much pleasure that I received
an invitation, as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and United
States Fish Commissioner, from General Walker, Superintendent of the
Census, to suggest a plan by which this defect ais be remedied. At
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

General Walker’s request, I undertook the work of organizing that
department, and of employing all the machinery of the United States
Fish Commission in its behalf.

Mr. G. Brown Goode, the curator of the National Museum, was assigned
to the special work of direction, and with the assistance of the regular
force of the commission and persons especially employed at the expense
of the census appropriation, a systematic plan of operations was laid
out and is now being carried into effect. Experienced and trained
observers have been sent to different portions of the coast as canvassers
afl investigators, it being the intention that every fishing village on
the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Great Lake coasts shall be properly
canvassed. Numerous circulars have been sent out to the interior, ask-
ing for information.

For the purpose of better supervising the collation of data and the
tabulation of results, accommodations have been furnished in the east
wing of the Smithsonian building, where the parties have been at work,
under the direction of Mr. Goode. Mr. Charles W. Smiley is in charge
of the office, with a number of clerks detailed by General Walker for
his assistance. The principal canvassers at work in the field are Mr.
R. E. Earll, for the New England coast generally; Mr. CharlesG. Atkins,
having special charge of the statistics of the salmon, herring, alewife,
and smelt fisheries in Maine; Mr. Silas Stearns, assisted by Mr. 8. T.
Walker, for the Gulf of Mexico; Col. Marshall McDonald, for the shad
fisheries of Virginia and the southern coast; Mr. R. T. Edmunds, the
oyster and fresh-fish trade of the Chesapeake Bay and Baltimore; Mr.
B. Phillips, for the fish manufacturing industry of New York; Mr. L.
Kunnlien, for the fisheries of the Great Lakes; and Prof. D. S. Jordan,
for the fisheries of the Pacifie Coast. In addition to these, Mr. Ernest
Ingersoll has general charge of the statistics of the oyster trade of the
whole eastern coast. All these gentlemen have been at work for a
greater or less time, some of them since July last, and have transmitted
to the office in Washington an immense amount of information.

It is confidently expected that the report of General Walker on the
subject of the fisheries will be not inferior in any respect to other special
reports for which he has made arrangements.

In addition to the collecting of statistics, the employés of this division
have been instructed to obtain illustrations of the fisheries, such as
specimens or models of fishing-gear, nets, boats, traps, &c.; samples of
prepared fish and the like; they are also gathering a great deal of infor-
mation relating to the natural history of the marine and fresh-water
animals.

A very important corollary of this work is the information it will
furnish for use in any future arbitration between the United States and
the British Provinces in regard to the value of its coast fisheries. It
is well known that the cause of the United States, at the meeting in
Halifax in 1877, went almost by default in consequence of the absence
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of this information. While the Canadians possessed the fullest data on
the subject of the fisheries, as the result of many years inquiry, the
United States had nothing whatever but what was gathered with spee-
ial reference to the emergency. The results gathered in connection
with the census of 1880 will, it is hoped, be tabulated and published by
the time this is needed for diplomatic use, and it will be of inestimable
advantage in strengtheniug any position that the American Government
may take in reference to the nature of the American fisheries,

Respectfully submitted.

Among the receipts for the year is a bequest of $402.59 by Dr. Sim-
eon Habel, of New York, the author of one of the Smithsonian Conttri-
butions to Knowledge, published in 1878, entitled “The Sculptures of
Santa Lucia Cosumalwhuapa in Guatemala.” The author was an Aus-
trian physician who relinquished his medical practice to make at his
own expense a tour of exploration through Central America. The re-
sults of his researches were presented to the Smithsonian Institution
for publication. Professor Henry afforded every facility to Dr. Habel
for the preparation of his work, by furnishing him a room for several
months at the Institution where he could have his drawings copied by
a skillful artist, and the doctor in appreciation of this courtesy informed
the Secretary that on his death he would leave a part of his property to
the Smithsonian Institution.
120 REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

Notice of his death on the 1st of January, 1879, at New York, having
beefi received, steps were taken to secure the promised legacy, and the
sum actually received from the Emigrant Savings Bank of New York,
in accordance with Dr. Habel’s instructions, was $402.59. To this sum
it is proposed that $97.41 should be added, so that the amount of $500
may be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as a part of the
permanent fund.

Repayments.—The Institution has made temporary advances during
the year for freight, &c., the repayment of which, with the amount
received from sales of the publications of the Institution, &e., have
been deducted from the expenditures for the year.

SUMMARY.

The Executive Committee have examined 687 vouchers for payments
made from the Smithson income during the year 1879, and 690 vouchers
for payments made from appropriations by Cones for the National
Museum, making a total of 1,577 vouchers. <All these bear the approval
of the Secretary of the Institution, and a certificate that the materials
and services charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee bave examined the account books of the National Mu-
seum and find the balances as before statéd—preservation, $11,492.19 ;
armory, $1,037.54; security against fire, $1,307.42— to correspond with the
certificates of the disbursing clerk of the Department of the Interior.
They also find the balance of $106,853.62 of the National Museum build-
ing appropriation corresponds with the certificate of the disbursing
ofiicer of the Treasury Department January 5, 1880.

NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING CoMMISSION,
OFFICE OF SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., January 19, 1880.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: For several years past the attention of the Board of
Itegents has been called to the rapid growth of the collections in the
National Museum and the need of increased accommodations for the
same. This necessity, however, was not deemed sufficiently impera-
tive to authorize a request for special Congressional legislation until
the close of the Centennial Exhibition, when it became evident that
the articles gathered by the Smithsonian Institution for the exhibition
in Philadelphia, under the act of Congress, added to the numerous cen-
tennial exhibits presented to the United States and taken charge of by
the Smithsonian Institution, constituted a mass of material for which
no provision could possibly be made in the present Smithsonian build-
ing. Under these circumstances, the Board of Regents on the, 5th of
February, 1877, memorialized Congress for an appropriation of $250,000
for the “immediate erection of a spacious building,” and a few weeks sub-
sequently a bill for the purpose passed the Senate, but too late in the
Session to secure consideration in the House of Representatives. The
effort was renewed during the winter of 187778, but likewise without
action. On the 3d of March, 1879, however, the desired appropriation
was made through a provision in the sundry civil bill, as follows:

“For a fire-proof building for the use of the National Museum, 300
feet square, to be erected under the direction of the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, in accordance with the plans now on file with the
Joint Committee of Publie Buildings and Grounds, on the southeastern
portion of the grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, two hundred and
fitty thousand dollars: Said building to be placed east of the Smithso-
nian Institution, leaving a roadway between it and the latter of not less
than fifty feet, with the north front on a line with the south face of the
buildings of the Agricultural Department and of the Smithsonian Insti-
tion; and all expenditures for the purposes herein mentioned, not includ-
ing anything for architectural plans, shall be audited by the proper of-
ficers of the Treasury Department.”

Anticipating the early action of Congress in the premises, the Board of
Kegents, on the 17th of January, 1879, adopted the following resolu-
thon:

“Resolved, That the Executive Committee of the Board, or a majority
thereof, and the Secretary be, and they are hereby, authorized and em-
powered to act for and in the name of the Board of Regents in carrying
into effect the provisions of any act of Congress that may be passed pro-
viding for the erection of a building for the National Museum.”

Accordingly, on the 7th of March, 1879, Hon. Peter Parker and Gen-
eral W. IT’. Sherman, the resident members of the executive committee,
126 REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMISSION.

with the Secretary, met in the office of the Institution, and after organiz-
ing under the title of “ National Museum Building Commission,” of which
General W. T. Sherman was chosen chairman, proceeded to adopt such
measures as in their opinion appeared best calculated to realize, with the
least possible delay, the intention of Congress.

The committee at the outset invited General M. C. Meigs, Quarter-
master-General U. 8. A., to act in the capacity of consulting engi-
neer to the commission, and also selected Messrs. Cluss and Schulze,
whose plans for the new building were those approved by Congress, as
superintending architects. Mr. Daniel Leech was appointed secretary
of the commission. .

To remove as far as possible any doubt as to the sufficiency of the ap-
propriation for a building m accordance with the plans approved by Con-
gress, Mr. Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol, and General Meigs,
after carefully considering the provisional estimates of the architects,
informed the commission that in their opinion the amount was suflicient
for the purpose.

To obtain a clear understanding of the intent of Congress in making the
appropriation, as well as to ascertain how far, if desirable, the commission
might be authorized to depart from the plans before the Committees of
Public Buildings and Grounds when the act was passed, the chairmen
of the respective committees (Hon. H. L. Dawes and Hon. Philip Cook)
were consulted ; whereupon these gentlemen officially informed the com-
mission ‘that, provided the general design be retained, it was not their
intention, nor that of their committees, to confine the Board of Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution to the minor details of the aforesaid plans,
but to authorize any modifications that might appear to them desirable
in the interest of economy or for the better adaptation of the building to
its object.”

On ascertaining that the appropriation could be made immediately
available under the clause directing that the account should be audited
by the proper ofiicers of the Treasury Department, the Secretary of the
Treasury was, on the 27th of March, requested to designate some one of
his force to act as disbursing officer. Accordingly Maj. T. J. Hobbs,
disbursing clerk of the department, was selected, and payments were
authorized to be made by him on vouchers approved by the Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution as provided for in the following resolution :

“Resolved, That the commission appointed by the Board of Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution to superintend the construction of a new
fire-proof building for the National Museum hereby authorize Prof. 8.
F. Baird, Secretary of the Institution, to act as their agent to approve
for payment by Thomas J. Hobbs, all bills for services and supplies from
such funds as are placed in the hands of the latter by said commisssion
for such purposes, and the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby respect-
fully requested toimstruct Thomas J. Hobbs, disbursing agent, to pay any
bills when thus certified and found to be otherwise technically correct.”
REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMISSION. L2G

Having thus prepared the way to a commencement of active opera-
tions, specifications were at once prepared and proposals invited for car-
rying on the work. Ground was broken on the 17th of April, 1879.

The concrete foundations were begun on the 29th of April, and the
prick-work of the walls on the 21st of May, the main walls being com-
pleted on the 1st day of November.

In consequence of the low prices of the more important building
materials, very favorable contracts were made, especially for the brick
required and for the iron-work, since the price of iron advanced very
materially within a few months from the date referred to. The same is
true with regard to glass, bricks, and, in fact, almost all building mate-
rials.

For details of construction, as well as for a statement of expenditures
to date, the board is referred to the appended report of the superintend-
ing architects.

The estimate «f $250,000 for the construction of a museum building
did not include the heating apparatus. As the work progressed, how-
ever, it became evident that all the underground piping for water, gas,
and steam, at least, could be obtained from the fund.

In anticipation of an appropriation for the purpose, it was deemed
best to obtain provisional bids for a steam-heating apparatus. Accord-
ingly proposals were invited: first, for the underground pipes; second,
for the boilers; third, for the radiators. The aggregate of the estimates
for the three items varied from $13,940 to $55,680.

The lowest bid was rejected on account of inadequacy of the supply of
heat. The next to the lowest was that of Messrs. Baker, Smith & Co.,
for $19,768, which was accepted, and a contract made for the under-
ground pipes for $5,770.

An appropriation of $30,000 has been asked of Congress for the com-
pletion of the heating apparatus throughout, for the gas and water fix-
tures and the electric apparatus required for clocks in the building, for
signals, alarms, &e.

Before the building can be occupied it must, of course, be furnished
and fitted up with cases, of which, as might be expected, a large provis-
ion isrequired. According toa calculation, the cases that will be needed,
if placed end to end, will extend to a distance of more than 8,000 feet,
with a total of shelving surface of about 75,600 square feet. The front-
age of the cases will be over 14,000 feet, so that, allowing for the cross-
ing from one case to another a journey of at least three miles will be
required even to take a cursory glance at all the objects in the collection.

The question of the best material for the cases has not been definitely
settled, the choice lying between iron and hard wood. In order to assist
in determining this question satisfactorily, arrangements have been
made to obtain working plans of the cases used not only in a number of
museums in the United States, especially in Cambridge, Boston, and
New York, but also in Europe. The new building now being erected for
128 REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMISSION.

the collections of the British Museum is one where it is supposed the
best experience has been made use of in the plans of the cases, and ar-
rangements have been made to obtain copies of the same. The new iron
eases of the National Museum at Dresden are also under investigation.
Tron is more expensive than wood, but involves less danger of decay, and
there is also an especial advantage in the fact that the material may be
so much thinner as to increase the interior space, while the objects in the
cases are less obscured. Of course, it must not be forgotten that the
National Museum is expected to discharge its functions for an indefinite
period of years.

The provision of Congress directed that the-new building should be
placed to the east of the present Smithsonian edifice, at least fifty feet
from its southeastern corner. The question was considered of having
the interval greater than this minimum, but it was found that this would
involve the extension of the building beyond the boundary of the Smith-
sonian reservation and carry it to the unassigned portion of the square.
Although there was nothing in the act to prevent this encroachment,
yet in view of the possibility that the southeastern portion of the public
land between Seventh and Twelfth streets would be required for some
other purposes, perhaps for a Congressional Library, it was thought
best to encroach upon it as little as possible.

In addition to its answering the purpose for which it was primarily
intended, it is confidently believed that the new National Museum build-
ing will exercise an important function in serving as a model for similar
establishments elsewhere.

Of course, in a city where the cost of land is a matter of important
consideration, the one-story plan cannot always be carried out, the usual
position of story above story being necessary to secure the desired space.
Most colleges and universities, however, have ample grounds belonging
to them, the occupation of which by large buildings is allowable. Under
such circumstances, the same amount of fire-proof space can be had for
from two-thirds to one-half the usual cost.

The office of member of the Building Commission has been by no means
a sinecure, weekly meetings having been held, with scarcely an inter-
ruption, from the first organization, as shown by the full reports kept
of the proceedings. General Meigs, as consulting engineer, until his
recent departure on a tour of duty, was present at every meeting and
continually aided the Commission by his advice, rendered so valuable by
his long familiarity with building operations on a large scale, and with
the whole question of the proper construction of contracts. He visited
the grounds nearly every day and closely inspected the progress of the
work. To him are also due valuable suggestions on the methods of cov-
ering the roofs and on other details.

The duties of the secretary of the commission have consisted in keep-
ing the record of the proceedings of the meetings, in assisting in the
preparation of contracts for execution, in engrossing the bills for settle-

ment, and in many other points. These services Mr. Leech has zealously
performed, and to the entire satisfaction of the commission.
Mr. William J. Rhees, chief clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, has
also rendered valuable services.

130 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

ARCHITECTS’ OFFICE, NATIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING,
Washington, D. C., January 1, 1880.
To the Hon. National Museum Building Commission, Washington, D. C.:

GENTLEMEN: We have the honor to submit the following report of
the work done upon the erection of the fire-proof building for the Na-
tional Museum from March 25, the date when the work was, by you,
placed in our charge, to December 31, 1879.

It is due to the importance of this national and extensive enterprise
to preface the report by a technical and descriptive record of its plan,
design, and construction.

The building starts on the ground in the form of a square, with sides
of 327 feet extreme length. This is surmounted by a cross and a dome.
Within its facades a net area of 102,200 square feet, or 2.35 acres, is
covered in by roofs.

It contains under ground a coal-cellar of a storage capacity of nearly
300 tons. Besides, there are two cellars, containing 3,200 square feet
floor space, for storage purposes. T'rom one of these cellars a subter-
ranean communication with the adjacent Smithsonian building is estab-
lished, by an arched passage, which, besides ordinary uses, will serve in
cases of panic, fire, tumult, robbery, Xe.

A basement containing 1,600 square feet of floor space is fitted up for
the boiler-room of a steam heating apparatus.

On the main floor there are available, in 17 halls which freely commu-
nicate with one another by wide and lofty archways, 59,300 square feet
of floor space and a proportionate amount of wall space for exhibition
purposes.

Further, there are available on the main floor and two upper stories
27,400 square feet of floor space, divided off into 135 rooms for admin-
istrative functions, offices, working-rooms, photographer, necessary ac-
commodations, &e.

And finally there are about 4,000 square feet of floor space on galleries,
formed on a level with the second floor of the offices ; these are intended
in part for special exhibits and in part to afford an unobstructed view
of the ensemble of the exhibits.

On the whole, the one-story plan which has prevailed among experts
ever since the Paris exhibition of 1867 has been adopted. But by the
jutroduction of upper stories on those outlying sections reserved for
offices, ample office-room has been secured without encroaching materi-
ally upon the floor space within the square of 300 feet, to which the
building was primarily limited.

The center of the building is octagonal on the ground floor, and is
surmounted by a 16-sided polygon of 67 feet diameter, which contains a
tier of large windows and constitutes a domical structure with a slate
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS, : ey |

roof and a lantern, crowned by a decorated finial. This room is 77 feet
high on the side walls, or 108 feet to the top of the finial.

Four naves, of 65 feet in width and 117 feet in length, radiate from
the dome and extend to the outside walls of the building; the naves
form in this manner a Greek cross, over the center of which the dome
rises, and part of the spaces in the exterior angles of the cross are fitted
up with halls of 65 feet square and of same height as the naves.

The side walls of both naves and annexes are 42 feet high, while the
height to the ridge of the slate roofs is 56 feet. These roofs are in part
constructed double, for the purpose of so perfecting the drainage of the
roofs that accumulations of ice and snow can nowhere obstruct it.

The spaces between the high walls of the Greek cross and the exte-
rior walls of the building are allotted mainly to eight halls of reduced
height, covered by lean-to metal roofs; the extreme height of which is 32
feet.

By this treatment wall spaces are obtained for the introduction of
clerestory windows, which light the square halls and assist in lighting
the naves.

The four symmetrical exterior walls of the building are broken by
projections in the center and at the corners, and these have been amply
utilized for miscellaneous administrative purposes as stated above.

A modernized Romanesque style of architecture was adopted for the
new building in order to keep up a relationship with the Smithsonian
building, which is designed in Norman, a variety of this style. To mod-
ernize this style was found necessary on account of the different build-
ing material, and to do justice to the purposes of the building with its
modern demands of perfect safety and elegance of construction, of great-
est possible available floor space, of easy communications, efficient
drainage, a well calculated and pleasing admission of light, free circu-
lation of air, and all other hygienic dicta.

The external architecture is based upon the general arrangement of
the interior, and shows plainly the prominence of the four naves and
the careful management of the light for the central portion of the build-
ing. The main entrances are in the centers of each facade between
two lofty towers of 86 feet height, which act as buttresses for the naves.
Between the towers, and receding from the doorways, there are large
arched windows set with ornamented glass, and above those the gables
of the naves are formed; they contain inscription-plates and are. crowned
by allegorical groups of statuary. The group over the northern gable,
designed by C. Buberl, of New York, already in position, introduces
Columbia as the protectress of science and industry.

To both sides of these prominent central features there are curtain-
walls, 27 feet in height, which have the effect of arcades.

Pavilions are placed at the corners; they are of less height than the
towers, but sufficiently raised above the curtain-walls to overcome the
132 . REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

unfavorable effect which these comparatively low walls would otherwise
produce.

In the rear of the curtain-walls, the clerestory rises to the full height
of the naves, the roofs of which terminate against the side walls of the
dome. The dome is treated in a similar way and strictly in the same
character as the curtain-walls above alluded to.

In addition to the windows in the solid masonry of exterior walls,
clerestory, and dome, lofty lanterns have been provided above the
naves and square halls so as to afford perfect light for this enormous
space without resorting to flat skylights, which for various reasons it
was well to avoid.

These lanterns, square and oblong, together with those of the kindred
features of the pavilions, have been so arranged, in combination with
towers, groups, clerestory, and the rising dome in the background, as to
produce a picturesque effect in the sky-lines of the building.

All the masonry above ground is composed of brick-work, built with
air spaces for outside walls, ornamented and laid in black mortar for
the facing of exterior walls. To neutralize the monotony and common-
place appearance which could not have been avoided with red brick
fronts of such extent, a sufficient quantity of buff bricks, interspersed
with a small number of blue bricks, in the cornices have been introduced.

A base-course of granite extends all around the building.

The wrought work of the main entrance, window-sills, inscription-
plates, copings, &e., are of gray Ohio freestone. Anything else in the
line of decoration is in strict keeping with the principal designs, and
executed in substantial metal work.

The floor beams, girders, and roofs consist or are constructed of rolled
and shaped iron. The floors are fire-proofed by brick arches and con-
erete. Of roofs there are no less than thirty seven; many of them areof
most complicated construction. The lanterns of the ridges of the naves
are large enough to cover moderate-sized dwellings.

The light but solid frame-work of all the roofs will be left in full view,
painted in light neutral tints.

The covering of the metal roofs is laid upon fire-proofed gratings, sug-
gested by General M. C. Meigs.

The slates are hung to iron purlines.

The sashes all through the building are each glazed with two panes of
glass, with an intermediate air-space. ‘This is done to facilitate the heat-
ing of the building.

The floors of the exhibition halls will consist of concrete, but the
rooms and smaller halls will, for convenience sake, be floored with Florida
pine, laid on concrete.

The interior is to be plastered in sand finish, washed in tints. Its lofty
proportions do not require any elaborate decoration, and will thus rather
heighten than interfere with the objects on exhibition.
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. 133

The heating of the building is to be done by low-pressure steam, on
the system of direct radiation.

The wide main entrance doors of walnut and oak open outward on
spacious tiled vestibules, with sides and arched ceilings of ornamental
brick-work. These vestibules are closed at night and on Sundays by
wide double gates, the solid frames of which consist of wrought iron,
and the ornaments of cast iron; thus combining the utmost strength
with great economy.

The northern entrance has been selected for general use, and hence it
was necessary and proper to give it due prominence from the others for
the guidance of strangers. The configuration of the surrounding ground
helped in this connection. A spacious tiled platform bounded by granite
side blocks is constructed in front of this entrance. It is approached by
four low and wide granite steps of 37 feet in length, which are flanked
by molded base-blocks, carrying stately candelabras.

It should be remembered that in all our steps we were guided by the
absolute necessity not to overreach the appropriation at disposal; and
hence, to produce the best effect with utmost economy, the exterior
decoration was confined to and concentrated on the centers of the fronts.

The erection of this building requires about 5,250,000 bricks, 3,000 bar-
rels cement, 5,600 barrels lime, 4,000 cubic yards of sand, 2,000 cubic
yards of rubble-stone, 1,250 cubic yards of concrete, 470 tons of wrought
iron, 31,000 square feet of glass, 60,000 plates of slate, of 2 square feet
each, 375 boxes of tin, &e.

As soon as we received the required instructions our work was con-
centrated on the preparation of working drawings, schedules, and speci-
fications, so as to take best advantage of the low prices of material and
labor then prevailing, and in this we were successful to a great extent.

We now proceed to give a history of the progress of the work during
the past season, operations being classed under a few general heads.

During the whole season we were favored by the weather. Irom the
1st of May to 3lst of December but twelve and one-quarter working
days were lost by inclement weather; of these, nine and three-quarter
days were rainy, one was stormy, one severely cold, and a half a day
was lost on account of sleet and ice.

1. Huacavation.—The excavation for the foundations was commenced
on the 17th of April and finished on the 28th of May. It was carried to
solid ground, but nowhere less than 3 feet below surface, that the build-
ing should rest on earth below the disintegrating effects of frost and
drought. Under the topsoil a thick stratum of hard clay was met, and
under this a bed of clean, dry gravel, which was struck wherever cellars
were dug; this porous layer drained the site by absorbing the rain-water
as fast as it fell.

2. Foundations.—The foundations were, under date of April 29, com-
menced with a heavy bed of hydraulic cement conerete and.were com-

pleted on the 30th of May. Upon the concrete bed they were continued
14 REPORT OF THE ARCHITEUTS.

u» to the surface with rubble-stone work of gneiss, laid in cement mortar ;
this work was commenced on the 5th of May and was completed on June 9.

3. Brick-work.—The brick-laying commenced on May 21, and the prin-
cipal walls were completed on November 1, after 4,740,000 bricks had
been laid under contract. The specifications call for a superior class of
brick-work, laid in black mortar on the fagades without resorting to the
expensive “tucked” or “ruled” joints commonly used in first-class
pressed brick-work, and this has been duly enforced. In this we were
aided by the commendable ambition of the Washington Brick Machine
Company, who have furnished a superior quality of brick for the fa-
cades. We, on the other hand, have spent a large amount of money
in bringing out the beauty of the material by cleaning down and oiling
the facades. Ever since the contract for laying bricks has been declared
as satisfactorily completed a large force of brick-layers has been kept
at work by the day, under proper superintendence, in finishing the fa-
cades, piecing out the walls, building the steam-chimney, walling in the
iron-work of the roofs as they progressed, doing plumbers’ jobbing, turn-
ing and concreting floor-arches, laying foundations for platforms and
steps, forming gutters with due grade, &e., &e. This work is all well
advanced, but still in progress, and will be finished by the building of
ducts for the lines of pipes which will conduct the steam and return the
condensed water of the heating apparatus.

4. Cut-stone work.—The cutting and laying of the granite base course
was commenced on May 19. The cut-stone work has been going on dur-
ing the whole season as the work of the other mechanics progressed and
is now completed, with the exception of part of the outside steps. At
intervals of about 5 feet in height, bond-stones of North River grey
wacke-bluestone have been introduced in the high piers of the interior
archways in order to increase their stability.

5. Iron-work.—The floor-beams arrived in good time and were put in
place by the contractors as they got ready for them. On August 22,
the first ‘‘Warren girder” of the lean-to roofs was set in place; on Oc-
tober 9 the roofs of the naves were commenced to be put up; on Decem-
ber 19 those of the square halls were commenced. At this writing all
the material for the roofs is on hand ; it simply remains for the contractor
to display energy and have all the roofs ready for covering.

6. Galvanized iron-rork.—This consists of a heavy amount of small
cornice-moldings, of acroteria, chimney-heads, finials, facings and cas-
ings. It is well advanced at the shops and being put up in due time.

7. Slates and slating.—Under date of August 19 last, the blue slates
have been ordered from Ore Banks, Va., and the red and green slates
fromthe quarries in Vermont. They are virtually ali on hand, and
the slater avails himself at all times of the first opportunity which
offers for laying the slates. The slates are 24 inches in length and ex-
pose 10 inches to the weather, thus giving what is termed double cover
and 4 inches lap.
REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS. 135

8. Covering of the flat roofs—These metal roofs are supported prima-
rily by the wrought-iron trusses laid 13 feet between centers; these
again are subdivided and cross-laid by wrought beams of lighter sec-
tions so as to cut up the ceilings into spaces of 4 by 13 feet in size. At
the suggestion of General Meigs these spaces were bridged by gratings
formed in two thicknesses of light tapered wooden strips and fire-proofed
by being filled in and inclosed with a non-conducting mixture composed
of plaster of Paris, lime, coal-ashes, and cinders. Before actual use we
have made ample tests in.order to reduce the weight of the gratings and
of the composition to a minimum, and on the other hand to increase its
non-conductibility. The greater part of this work is done and the metal
laid upon it in sheets of 14 by 20 inches in size, having flat joints. Each
sheet is clamped down to the gratings by eight clamps of sheet metal,
two on each side, in such a manner that each sheet, independent of all
others, can expand and contract, which in such large roofs is an im-
portant consideration.

9. Wooden floors —AIl the flooring required has been secured of
Florida yellow pine, by contract, at very reasonable terms.

10. Plastering —No scaffolding material being kept on hand by the
tradesmen for reaching high walls or ceilings of buildings like this, the
poles and lumber of the seaffolds for the brick-work were purchased at a
reasonable rate from the contractors for that branch and are now ou hand.

11. Glass, glazing, and painting—With the sudden stimulus which the
industries of this country received last fall, home-made glass came to
bea scarce article, as the proposals received under extensively published
advertisements show ; the lowest bids were for Belgian glass, imported
free of duty, with the approval of the Treasury Department. This glass
is shortly expected to arrive, after which the sash will be glazed at an
early date. The painting has so far been mostly confined te the metal
cornices and piping, the iron-work and window-frames having been fur-

‘nished, by the respective contractors, all primed.

12. Carpenter’s work.—This has so far been mostly directed to the
making of roof-gratings, described under another head. But, besides,
a large amount of centers has been made and put up for turning arches
in the brick-work and floor-arches. In the concrete above the floor-
arches the thin sleepers have been laid to which the flooring is to be
nailed. The setting of door-jambs is about to be commenced and to be
followed by all the minor details required for getting the building in
‘readiness for the plasterer,

13. Sewerage, drainage, and plumbing.—In the early part of the spring

‘the main sewer on B street was cut out and a 12-inch glazed terra
cotta sewer connected with it for the drainage of the new building
The numerous branch sewers within the building leading to some sixty
conductors from the roofs, and to soil-pipes of closets and basins, were
under a decision of the commission delayed until the completion of the
walls, but have lately been completed, as also most of the extra heavy
136 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECTS.

cast-iron piping which forms the conductors of rain-water, and the ver-
tical soil-pipes. All these heavy pipes have air and water tight joints
formed of gasket and lead, and are firmly supported by brick piers at
their juncture with the sewer-pipes under ground.

During the progress of the brick-work temporary supplies have been
taken by tapping the pipes supplying the hose-cocks in the Smithsonian
grounds, but in the fall a 12-inch main pipe was tapped outside of the
building and near its southeastern corner. Three parallel lines of 3-inch
water-pipe running due north through the building were put in with
supply for 16 fire-plugs, numerous street-washers, outlets for closets,
basins, and bath-tubs, stop-cocks, &e.

Simultaneously with the water supply the supply-pipes for gas were
attended to. The gas main was tapped on B street, outside of the
southwest corner of the building, and two 4-inch supply-pipes were put
in, one running due north and the other due east through the building,
at an equal distance of about 20 feet from the outside walls of the build-
ing. Both pipes are continued, of reduced sizes, in a similar way until
they meet at the northeast corner of the building. They have a regular
fall back to the main, the permanence of which is secured by two sup-
porting brick piers under each length of pipe, so that no flickering of
gas can ever occur in consequence of the formation of traps by irregu
lar settlements of the pipes. Outlets have been provided for lighting
all the rooms and passages, and also for the light required to supervise
all the parts of the building at night. Unusually large gas-pipes were
found necessary on account of the great lengths on which they are’
run, and this feature will afford facilities hereafter, in case it should be de-
cided to fit up any of the halls with brilliant light for public use at night.

14. Underground piping for heating apparatus.—To avoid the unsightly
appearance of exposed large-sized steam and water return-pipes required
for the successful heating of the vast building, it was decided to build
the necessary ducts and introduce the pipes under ground before the’
floors were laid, though this part of the work was not included in the
estimates on which the appropriation for the building proper was based.

The heating apparatus intended under the estimates, now before the
Appropriation Committee of the House, provides for four steam-boilers
of 256 nominal horse-power in the aggregate. The generated steam is
to be conducted by two separate main pipes of eight inches diameter
to about 200 steam-heaters, containing in the aggregate 13,680 square
feet of radiating surface. The hot water condensed in these heaters is
to be returned and reused in the boiler.

JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

By WILLIAM J. RHEES.

JAMES SMITHSON was born in England about the year 1754, the pre-
cise date and place of his nativity being unknown.* He was a natural
son of Hugh Smithson, first Duke of Northumberland, his mother being
a Mrs. Elizabeth Macie, of an old family in Wiltshire of the name of
Hungerford. Nothing has been learned of her history.

Hugh Smithson, his father, was distinguished as a member of one of
the most illustrious houses of Great Britain, and also because of his
alliance with the renowned family of Percy.

The Smithson baronetcy arose with an earlier Hugh Smithson, the
second son of Anthony Smithson, esq., of Newscome or Newsham, in the
parish of Kirby-on-the-Mount, Yorkshire, who was thus rewarded by
Charles II in 1660, for his services in the royalist cause during the civil
wars. His grandson, Sir Hugh Smithson, married Elizabeth, danghter
of the second Lord Langdale, and had two sons. Hugh, the eldest, died
unmarried, before his father; Langdale, the second son, married Miss
Revely, by whom he left one son, Hugh. This son succeeded his grand-
father as Sir Hugh Smithson, of Stanwick, in 1750, and was the father
of the subject of the present sketch. He married Lady Percy on the 16th
July, 1740. Her father inherited the Dukedom of Somerset in 1741,
and was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749. On his death, in
1750, Sir Hugh Smithson succeeded to these honors and on the 22d of
October, 1766, was created first Duke of Northumberlandt and Earl
Percy, with succession to his heirs male ; and finally in 1784 the barony
of Lovaine of Alnwick was added to his accumulated dignities,

The Duchess died in 1776. The Duke survived till 1786,t and was
succeeded by his son Hugh (half brother of James Smithson), as the
second Duke of Northumberland.§

Hugh Smithson, the first Duke of Northumberland, had (besides James
Smithson) another natural son, who was known as Henry Louis Dickin-
son. He received a good education, entered the military service, was
commissioned lieutenant-colonel on the 1st of January, 1800, and on the
4th of August, 1808, took command of the Eighty-fourth Regiment of
Foot. He saw active service on the Continent and in Asia and Africa.
His estate was left to the care of his half-brother, Mr. James Smithson,
in trust for the benefit of his son, and this was probably the source of a
large part of the fund which eventually came to the United States.

*See Appendix. Note 3.
t There was a previous Duke of Northumberland who died without issue in 1716,
and the title became extinct. {See Appendix. Note 2.

§ See Appendix. Note 3.
143
144 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

The possession by the first Duke of Northumberland of titles and dig-
nities only inferior to those of royalty was of little consequence to his
son James Smithson. Deprived by the bar sinister on his escutcheon
from claiming the family name and honors, he nevertheless aspired to win
a fame more universal and lasting than these could have bestowed upon
him. He devoted himself to original research in the field of science, and
sought to be known and honored by his fellow-men as a discoverer of
new truths. Moreover, he resolved to attach his name to an institution
unique in its character, noble in its object, and universal in its benefi-
cence, of which John Quincy Adams has well said, ‘Of all the founda-
tions of establishments for pious or charitable uses which ever signalized
the spirit of the age or the comprehensive beneficence of the founder,
none can be named more deserving of the approbation of mankind.”

Smithson’s feeling in regard to posthumous fame was strikingly ex-
pressed in the following sentence found in one of his manuscripts.

“The best blood of England flows in my veins; on my father’s side I
am a Northumberland, on my mother’s Iam related to kings, but this
avails me not. My nameshall live in the memory of man when the titles
of the Northumberlands and the Percys are extinct and forgotten.”

As Prof. W. R. Johnson has well observed in speaking of Smithson:
‘The man of science is willing to rest on the basis of his own labors
alone for his credit with mankind, and his fame with future generations.
In the view of such a man, the accidents of birth, of fortune, of local
habitation, and conventional rank in the artificial organization of society,
all sink into insignificance by the side of a single truth of nature. If
he have contributed his mite to the increase of knowledge; if he have
diffused that knowledge for the benefit of man, and above all, if he have
applied it to the useful, or even to the ornamental purposes of life, he
has laid not his family, not his country, but the world of mankind under
a lasting obligation.”

The eloquent words of John Quincy Adams in reference to the fame
to be conferred on Smithson by the suecessful accomplishment of the
great design he had in view by his bequest are appropriate in this con-
nection.

‘The father of the testator upon forming his alliance with the heiress
of the family of the Percys, assumed, by an act of the British Parliament,
that name, and, under it, became Duke of Northumberland. But re-
nowned as is the name of Perey in the historical annals of England ;
resounding as it does from the summit of the Cheviot Hills to the ears
of our children in the ballad of Chevy Chace, with the classical com-
mentary of Addison; freshened and renovated in our memory as it bas
recently been from the purest fountain of poetical inspiration in the loft-
ier strain of Alnwick Castle, tuned by a bard from our own native land
(Fitz Greene Halleck); doubly immortalized as it is in the deathless
dramas of Shakspeare ; ‘confident against the world in arms,’ as it may
have been in ages long past and may still be in the virtues of its present
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 145

possessors by inheritance, let the trust of James Smithson to the United
States of America be faithfully executed by their representatives in Con-
gress, let the result accomplish his object, ‘the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men,’ and a wreath of more unfading verdure shall
entwine itself in the lapse of future ages around the name of SMITHSON,
than the united hands of tradition, history, and poetry have braided
around the name of Percy through the long perspective in ages past of
a thousand years.”

The Duke of Northumberland provided a liberal education for his son
James, who pursued his studies at Oxford University, where he became
attached to Pembroke College, distinguished for having among its
fellows the learned Blackstone, the eloquent Whitfield, and the cele-
brated Dr. Samuel Johnson. Here the young student was noted for
diligence, application, and good scholarship, and attracted marked at-
tention by his proficiency in chemistry. His vacations were passed in
excursions to collect minerals and ores which it was his favorite oceu-
pation to analyze. At Oxford he received the impulse for scientific
research which characterized all his future life, and the ardent desire not
only to advance knowledge himself but to devote in after years his whole
fortune to provide means by which others could prosecute this high and
noble pursuit.

He was graduated at Pembroke College on the 26th of May, 1786, as
JAMES Lewis MACTIE,* by which name he seems at that time to have
been known, and which he retained for about fourteen years, when he
adopted that of JAMES SMITHSON.t

Smithson never married, and as a man of wealth had ample op-
portunity for leisure or the indulgence of mere personal gratification.
But idleness and pleasure were not compatible with the spirit and ardor
of the young student of chemistry. He diligently pursued his investi-
gations, and his ambition to become associated with the votaries of
science induced him to seek membership in the Royal Society of London.

“The Royal Society of London,” says Arago, “ enjoys throughout the
whole kingdom a vast and deserved consideration. The philosophical
transactions which it publishes have been for more than a century and
a half the glorious archives in which British genius holds it an honor to
deposit its titles to the recognition of posterity. The wish to see his
name inscribed in the list of fellow-laborers in this truly national col-
lection beside the names of Newton, Bradley, Priestley, and Cavendish,
has always been among the students of the celebrated universities of
Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, and Dublin, the most anxious as well
as legitimate object of emulation. Here is always the highest point of
ambition of the man of science.”

*So given in the Oxford Catalogue. In the Philosophical Transactions and the
Gentleman’s Magazine the name is given as James Louis Macie.

+ His second paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 1602, is by James Smithson.
Sir Davies Gilbert, in his eulogy of him in 1830, calls him James Lewis Smnithson.

146 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

The following is the official reeommendation of his application to the
society, bearing the signatures of some of its most illustrious members :

‘‘ James Lewis Macie, Esq., M. A., late of Pembroke College, Oxford,

and now of John Street, Golden Square—a gentleman well versed in
various branches of Natural Philosophy, and particularly in Chymistry
and Mineralogy, being desirous of becoming a Fellow of the Royal So-
ciety, we whose names are hereto subscribed do, from our personal
knowledge of his merit, judge him highly worthy of that honour and
likely to become a very useful and valuable Member.” ‘

C. BLAGDEN.

H. CAVENDISH.

DAVID PITCAIRN

He was admitted a fellow on the 26th of aaa My 1787, in less than one
year after leaving the university.*

Smithson’s lodgings for some time were in Bentinck street, a locality
famous as the place where Gibbon wrote much of his ‘ Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire.” Here, with authors, artists, and savans, Smith-
son found congenial fellowship. His mind was filled with a craving for
intellectual development, and for the advancement of human knowi-
edge. To enlarge the domain of thought, to discover new truths, and
to make practical application of these for the promotion of civilization,
were the great ends he had constantly in view.

For purposes of scientific inquiry he engaged in extensive tours in
various parts of Europe; making minute observations wherever he went
on the climate, the physical features and geological structure of the
locality visited, the characteristics of its minerals, the methods employed
in mining or smelting ores, and in all kinds of manufactures.

These numerous journeys and sojourns abroad gave him a cosmopoli-
tan character, and illustrated one of his own sayings: “the man of

trymen.” This fact is exemplified by the life of Smithson—born in Eng-
land, spending most of his time in France and Germany, buried in Italy,
and leaving his name and fortune to the United States of America.

Desiring to bring to the practical test of actual experiment every
ching that came to his notice, he fitted up and carried with him a porta-
ble laboratory. He collected also a cabinet of minerals composed of
thousands of minute specimens, including all the rarest gems, so that
immediate comparison could be made of a novel or undetermined speci-
men, with an accurately arranged and labeled collection. With minute
balances, his weights scarcely exceeding a gram, and with articles so
delicate as to be scarcely visible, he made the most accurate and satis-
factory determinations. With a few pieces, not exceeding half a cubic
inch in size, of tabasheer, a substance found in the hollow of bambco
canes, he made over two hundred and fifty different experiments. *

The value which Smithson placed on such minute researches is inci-
dentally shown by a remark in his paper on ‘ fluorine.” He says,
“there may be persons who, measuring the importance of the subject
by the magnitude of the object, will cast a supercilious look on this dis-
cussion; but the particle and the planet are subject to the same laws, and
what is learned of the one will be known of the other.”

Smithson’s ardor for knowledge and his zeal as a collector of new and
rare minerals exposed him sometimes to hardship and privation. An
interesting account of one of his journeysis given in his private journal.

In 1784, in company with Mr. Thornton, Mons. Faujas de St. Fond,
the celebrated geologist of France, the Italian Count Andrioni, and
others, he made a tour through New Castle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dum-
barton, Tarbet, Inverary, Oban, Arran, and the island of Staffa.

As stated in Mr. Smithson’s journal, the party had arrived at a house
on the coast of Mull, opposite the island, and the journal continues:

“Mr. Turtusk got me a separate boat; set off about half-past eleven
o’clock in the morning, on Friday, the 24th of September, for Staffa.
Some wind, the sea a little rough; wind increased, sea ran very high ;
rowed round some part of the island, but found it impossible to go be-
fore Fingal’s cave; was obliged to return; landed on Staffa with diffi-
culty ; sailors press to go off again immediately; am unwilling to de-
part without having thoroughly examined the island. Resolve to stay
all night. Mr. Maclaire stays with me; the other party which was
there had already come to the very same determination; all crammed
into one bad hut, though nine of ourselves besides the family; supped
upon eggs, potatoes, and milk; lay upon hay, in a kind of barn.” (The
party, be it remembered, embraced two English gentlemen, one French
savant, one Italian count.)

25th. Got up early, sea ran very high, wind extremely strong—no
boat could put off. Breakfasted on boiled potatoes and milk; dined
upon the same; only got a few very bad fish; supped on potatoes and

milk; lay in the barn, firmly expecting to stay there for a week, without
even bread.”

“Sunday the 26th.—The man of the island came at five or six o’clock
in the morning to tell us that the wind was dropped, and that it was a
good day. Set off in the small boat, which took water so fast that my
servant was obliged to bail constantly—the sail, an old plaid—the ropes,
old garters.”

On the 29th, the tourists are at Oban, where a little cireumstance is
noted, which significantly marks the zeal and activity of the collector
of minerals and fossils, and the light in which devotion to geology is
sometimes viewed. :

“September 29.—This day packed up my fossils in a barrel, and paid 2s,
6d. for their going by water to Edinburgh. Mr. Stevenson charged half
a crown a night for my rooms, because I had brought ‘stones and dirt,
as he said into it.”

A month later he visited Northwich.

“October 28.—Went to visit one of the salt mines, in which they told
me there were two kinds of salt. They let me down in a bucket, in which
I only put one foot, and I had a miner with me. I think the first shaft
was about thirty yards, at the bottom of which was a pool of water, but
on one side there was a horizontal opening, from which sunk a second
shaft, which went to the bottom of the pit, and the man let us down in
a bucket smaller than the first.” *

These incidents indicate the character of Smithson as a scientific en-
thusiast, not easily deterred by the fear of personal inconvenience from
the pursuit of his favorite object.

Much of his life was passed on the Continent, in Berlin, Paris, Rome,
Florence, and Geneva, enjoying everywhere the friendship and respect
of the leading men of science,t and always devoting himself to the study
of physical phenomena. Distinguished authors, as Gay-Lussac, Marcet,
Haiiy, Berzelius, and Cordier, presented him with their scientific paperst
as soon as published, and he enjoyed intimate association and corre-
spondence with Davy, Gilbert, Arago, Biot, Klaproth, Black, and
others. §

As a chemist, Sir Davies Gilbert, President of the Royal Society, pro-
nounced Smithson to be the rival of Wollaston, of whom Magendie said,
‘his hearing was so fine he might have been thought to be blind, and his
sight so piercing he might have been supposed to be deaf.” It is related
of him that he made a galvanic battery in a thimble, and a platinum wire
much finer than any hair.

+Galton, in speaking of Erasmus Darwin, remarks: “ He was held in very high
esteem by his scientifie friends, including such celebrities as Priestley and James Watt,
and it is by a man’s position among his contemporaries and competitors that his work
may most justly be appraised.” Francis Galton, Hnglish Men of Science.

JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 149

Prof. Walter R. Johnson has made the following remarks respecting
Smithson:

‘¢ It appears from his published works that his was not the character of
a mere amateur of science. He was an active and industrious laborer
in the most interesting and important branch of research—mineral
chemistry. A contemporary of Davy and of Wollaston, and a corre-
spondent of Black, Banks, Thomson, and a host of other names re-
nowned in the annals of science, it is evident that his labors had to un-
dergo the scrutiny of those who could easily have detected errors, had
any of a serious character been committed. His was a capacity by no
means contemptible for the operations and expedients of the laboratory.
He felt the importance of every help afforded by a simplification of meth-
ods and means of research, and the use of minute quantities and accu-
rate determinations in conducting his inquiries.”

Smithson says in one of his papers, “chemistry is yet so new a science,”
what we know of it bears so small a proportion to what we are igno-
rant of; our knowledge in every department of it is so incomplete, con-
sisting so entirely of isolated points, thinly scattered, like lurid specks on
a vast field of darkness, that no researches can be undertaken without
producing some facts leading to consequences which extend beyond the
boundaries of their immediate object.”* |

Many of these “lurid specks ” in the vast field of darkness of which
Smithson spoke so feelingly, have, Prof. Johnson observes, ‘“ since his
days of activity expanded into broad sheets of light. Chemistry has
assumed its rank among the exact sciences. Methods and instruments
of analysis unknown to the age of Smithson have come into familiar
use among chemists. ‘hese may have rendered less available for the
present purposes of science than they otherwise might have been, a por-
tion of the analysis and other researches of our author. The same may,
however, be said of nearly every other writer of his day.”

Although his principal labors were in analytical chemistry, he distin-
guished himself by his researches in mineralogy and crystallography, in
all his work exhibiting the most careful and minute attention to accu-
racy.t In his second published paper, he observes: “It may be proper
to say that the experiments have been stated precisely as they turned
out, and have not been in the least degree bent to the system.”

That he pursued his investigations in a philosophic spirit, and with
proper methods, is evident from the favor with which his contributions
to the scientific societies and transactions of the day were received by
his contemporaries, and the fact that the results he reached are still
accepted as scientific truths.¢

+ He carefully noted on the margins of his books mistakes in grammar or orthography,
and frequently corrected erroneous statements or improper references in the indexes.

{ An account of some of Smithson’s experiments and copies of his notes on minerals
and rocks are given in a paper on the works and character of James Smithson, by Dr.
J. R. McD. Irby. Smithsonian Miscell. Collections, No. 327, 1879, p. 143.
150 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

In one of his essays, he divides the sources of knowledge into, 1st,
observation; 2d, reasoning; 3d, information; 4th, conjecture. In all
his researches he began the process of acquisition by observing.

One of his sentiments has been adopted as the motto on the publica-
tions of the Smithsonian Institution; viz: “ Hvery man is a valuable
member of society, who, by his observations, researches, and experiments,
procures knowledge for men.”

In a critical notice of Davy’s Elements of Chemical Philosophy in the
Quarterly Review for 1812, the writer speaking of recent advances in
chemistry, and especially in the establishment and extension of the law
of definite proportions, remarks: “ For these facts the science is princi-
pally indebted, after Mr. Higgins, to Dalton, Gay-Lussaec, Smithson, and
W ollaston.”*

The mineral species “Smithsonite,” a carbonate of zinc, was discovered
and analyzed by him, among some ores from Somersetshire and Der-
byshire, England. The name, Simithsonite, appears to have been con-
ferred on it by the great French mineralogist Beudant.

It is interesting to notice the number and variety of specimens from
the vegetable kingdom that Smithson subjected to analysis. They in-
clude the violet, red rose, red clover, daisy, blue hyacinth, hollyhock,
lavender, artichoke, scarlet geranium, red cabbage, radish, poppy, plum,
pomegranate, mulberry, cherry, currant, buckthorn berries, elder and
privet berries. He also examined the coloring matter of animal greens.

It is perhaps worthy of note that his first paper related to an article
of importance in the materia medica, and his last to a matter of prac-
tical value to artists. He by no means confined his attention to abstract
science, but contributed knowledge of improved methods of constructing
lamps, and of making tea and coffee. That such practical questions
might be considered of little importance by men of science he seems to
acknowledge by the remarks he makes in one of his papers.

“It is to be regretted,” he observes, ‘that those who cultivate
science frequently withhold improvements in their apparatus and pro-
cesses, from which they themselves derive advantage, owing to their not
deeming them of sufficient magnitude for publication. When the sole
view is to further a pursuit of whose importance to mankind a convie-
tion exists, all that can should be imparted, however small may appear
the merit which attaches to it.” t

A secretary of the French Academy deemed it his duty to offer an
excuse for having given a detailed account of certain researches ot
Leibnitz, which had not required great efforts of the intellect. ‘“ We
ought,” says he, “to be very much obliged to a man such as he is, when

he condescends, for the public good, to do something which does not.
partake of genius.” Arago remarked in his eulogy on Fourier, ‘ I can-

not conceive the ground of such scruples; in the present day the sciences

are regarded from too high a point of view to allow us to hesitate in
placing in the first rank of the labors with which they are adorned
those which diffuse comfort, health, and happiness amidst the working
population.”

In another of his papers Smithson says, referring to practical inves-
tigations :

“In all cases means of economy tend to augment and diffuse comfort
and happiness. They bring within the reach of the many what waste-
ful proceeding confines to the few. By diminishing expenditure on one
article they allow of some other enjoyment which was before unattaina-
ble. A reduction in quantity permits an indulgence in superior quality.
In the present instance the importance of economy is particularly great
since it is applied to matters of high price, which constitute one of the
daily meals of a large portion of the population of the earth.”

“ That in cookery also the power of subjecting for an indefinite dura-
tion to a boiling heat, without the slightest dependiture of volatile mat-
ter, will admit of a beneficial application, is unquestionable.” *

In the books of his library are found numerous marginal notes, indi-
eating his special attention to subjects relating to the health, comfort,
resources, and happiness of the people.

Among his effeets were several hundred manuscripts and a great
number of notes or scraps ona variety of subjects, including history, the
arts, language, rural pursuits, &c. On the subject of ‘ habitations”
were articles classified under the several heads of situation, exposure,
exterior and interior arrangements, building materials, contents and
adornment of rooms, furniture, pictures, statuary, &c. It is not im-
probable that he contemplated the preparation of a cyclopedia or phil-
osophical dictionary.

Smithson’s contributions to scientific literature consist of twenty-seven
papers, eight published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, in the years 1791, 1802, 1806, 1808, 1811, 1812, 1813, and 1817, and
nineteen in Thomson’s Annals of Philosophy, a journal of the highest
scientific character, in 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823, 1824, and 1525. ‘These
papers have recently been collected and reprinted by the Smithsonian
Institution.+ Several of them were previously republished in foreign
scientific journals translated by himself.

It is highly probable that Smithson contributed articles to scientific
and literary journals other than those mentioned, but they have not
yet been discovered.

Smithson’s writings all exhibit clearness of perception, terseness of
language and accuracy of expression.*

A trait of Smithson’s character is exhibited in the allusions he makes
in his writings to other scientific men. His expressions are always
kind or complimentary, evidently not for the sake of flattery, but from
a sense of justice and truthful recognition of merit. He speaks of Mr.
Tennant as one ‘whose many and highly important discoveries have
so greatly contributed to the progress of chemical science.” Abbe Haiiy
he refers to as one “so justly celebrated for his great knowledge in
crystallography, mineralogy,” &c. ‘The analysis we possess of na-
trolite by the illustrious chemist of Berlin,” &e.

Of Baron Cronstedt he says, “ the eet mineralogist who has yet
appeared.”

‘““A query from the celebrated Mr. Vauquelin.”

“The celebrated Mr. Klaproth, to whom nearly every department of
chemistry is under numerous and great obligations.”

“M. Berzelius’ elegant method of detecting phosphorie acid,” &e.

““M. Werner, its principal and most distinguished professor,” Se.

%

Smithson died on the 27th of June, 1829, at Genoa, Italy. He was
buried in the Protestant cemetery, about a mile west of Genoa, on the
high elevation which forms the west side of the harbor and overlooks
the town of Sampierdarena. His grave is marked by a handsome monu-
ment. The base is of pale gray marble, 6 feet and a half long, 3 feet
wide, and 3? feet high. On the top of this is a white marble urn suit-
ably proportioned to the base. The lot is inclosed by an iron fence, with
gray marble corner posts. On one side of the monument the inscription
is as follows:

“ Sacred to the memory of ratiek Smithson, esq., Fellow of the Royal
Society, London, who died at Genoa the 26th June, 1829, aged 75 years.”

On the other side is the following:

“This monument is erected, and the ground on which it stands pur-
chased in perpetuity, by Henry Hungerford, esq., the deceased’s nephew,
in token of gratitude to a generous benefactor and as a tribute to de-
parted worth.”

The announcement of his departure called forth expressions of regret
from prominent men of science, and as he had been an honored Fellow of
the Royal Society, its president, Sir Davies Gilbert, alluded to it on two
occasions. At the meeting of the Royal Society ae 30, 1829, he
remarked, “In no previous interval of twelve months has the society

*A few extracts from his published writings are given in the Appendix, Note 7.
154 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

collectively, or have its individual members, experienced losses so
severe, or so much in every respect to be deplored.” Among the names
then referred to were those of Dr. W. H. Wollaston, Dr. Thomas Young,
and Sir Humphrey Davy. To these illustrious savans he adds that of
James Smithson, who, he says, ‘‘has added eight communications to our
Transactions. He was distinguished by the intimate friendship of Mr.
Cavendish, and rivalled our most expert chemists in elegant analyses.”*

At the following anniversary meeting of the Royal Society, November
30, 1830, the president, Sir Davies Gilbert, delivered an address in
which, after speaking of the death of Major Kennele and Mr. Chevenix,
he says:

* * * (The only remaining individual who has taken a direct and
active part in our labours, by contributing to the Transactions, is Mr.
James Lewis Smithson, and of this gentleman I must be allowed to
speak with affection. We were at Oxford together, of the same college,
and our acquaintance continued to the time of his decease.

“Mr. Smithson, then called Macie, and an undergraduate, had the
reputation of excelling all other resident members of the University in
the knowledge of chemistry. He was early honored by an intimate
acquaintance with Mr. Cavendish; he was admitted into the Royal
Society, and soon after presented a paper on the very curious concretion
frequently found in the hollow of bambi canes, named Tabasheer. This
he found to consist almost entirely of silex, existing in a manner similar
to what Davy long afterwards discovered in the epidermis of reeds and
grasses.

‘‘Mr. Smithson enriched our Transactions with seven other communi-
cations: A chemical analysis of some calamines. Account of a discov-
ery of native minium. On the composition and crystallization of certain
sulphurets from Huel Boys in Cornwall. On the composition of zeolite.
On a substance procured from the elm tree, called Ulmin. On a saline
substance from Mount Vesuvius. Facts relative to the colouring matter
of vegetables.

‘‘ He was the friend of Dr. Wollaston, aaa at the same time his rival
in the manipulation and analysis of small quantities. dAya0y_ 0 eps
402 Bpototst. Mr. Smithson frequently repeated an occurrence with
much pleasure and exultation, as exceeding anything that could be
brought into competition with it; and this must apologize for my in-
troducing what might otherwise be deemed an anecdote too light and
trifling on such an occasion as the present.

‘Mr. Smithson declared that happening to observe a tear gliding
down a lady’s cheek, he endeavored to catch it on a erystal vessel; that
one-half of the drop escaped, but having preserved the other half he
submitted it to reagents, and detected what was then called microcosimic

salt, with muriate of soda, and, I think, three or four more saline sub-
stances, held in solution.

*Philosophical Magazine, 1830, vol. vii, p. 42.
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 155

“For many years past Mr. Smithson has resided abroad, principally,
I believe, on account of his health; but he carried with him the esteem
and regard of various private friends, and of a still larger number of
persons who appreciated and admired his acquirements.” *

This tribute to his memory and worth shows the high standing Smith-
son had attained in the estimation of his compeers, and that he secured
the fidelity and affection of his dependants is evinced by the care with
which, in his will, he provides a reward for their attachment and services.

“It has been the lot of the greatest part of those who have excelled in
science,” says Dr. Johnson, ‘‘to be known only by their own writings, and
to have left behind them no remembrance of their domestic life or pri-
vate transactions, or only such memorials of particular passages as are
on certain occasions necessarily recorded in public registers.”

To the same efiect, Wilson, in his life of Cavendish (the warm friend of
Smithson), remarks: ‘‘So careless has his own country been of his mem-
ory that although he was for some fifty years a well-known and very dis-
tinguished Fellow of the Royal Society, a member for a lengthened period
of the French Institute, and an object of Kuropean interest to men of
science, yet scarcely anything can be learned concerning his early history.
This, no doubt, is owing in great part to his own dishike of publicity, and
to the reserve and love of retirement which strongly characterized him.
Long before his death however, he was so conspicuous a person in the
scientific circles of London that the incidents of his early life might
readily have been ascertained. They were not, it should seem, inquired
into by any biographer.”t

This is eminently true of Smithson. We are unfortunately debarred
from acquiring an intimate knowledge of his personal traits and peculi-
arities by the absence of an autobiography, or even of any sketch of his
life by his friends. For this reason we are more ready to avail ourselves
of every fact in regard to him that can be ascertained, however triviai or
insignificant any one of these might otherwise be cnsidered. Even an
inventory of his wardrobe and a schedule of his personal property pos-
sesses an Interest and serves at least to gratify a natural curiosity. Such
a list has recently been found as certified by the English consul at Genoa,
after the death of Smithson, witha valuation of the different articles:

JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. L57

Very few of these articles were transferred to Mr. Rush, the agent of
the United States Government, who received the bequest. His enumer-
ation of the personal effects of Smithson is as follows:

“A large trunk; a box containing sundry specimens of minerals; a
beass instrament ; a box of minerals; a box of chemical glasses; a packet
of minerals; a glass vinegar-cruet; a stone mortar; a pair of silver-plated
candlesticks and branches ; a pair of silver-plated candlesticks without
branches; a hone, in a mahogany case; a plated-wire flower-basket ; a
plated coffee-pot; a small plated coffee-pot; a pair of wine-coolers; a
pair of small candlesticks; two pair salt-cellars ; a bread-basket; two
pair vegetable dishes and covers; a large round waiter; a large oval
waiter; two small oval waiters ; two plate-warmers; a reading shade ;
a gun; a mahogany cabinet; two portraits in oval frames; a china tea-
Service, consisting of twelve cups and saucers; six coffee-cups; a tea-
pot; a slop-basin; a sugar-basin and lid; two plates; a milk-jug; a tea-
canister; two dishes; a landscape in a gilt frame; a Derby-spar vase;
a China tub; apiece of fluor-spar; a pairof glass candlesticks ; a marble
bust; sundry books and pamphlets; two large boxes filled with speci-
mens of minerals and manuscript treatises, apparently in the testator’s
handwriting, on various philosophical subjects, particularly chemistry
and mineralogy. Eight cases and one trunk filled with the like.”

With reference to a gun, pieces of china, and articles of a miscella-
neous nature belonging to Smithson, Mr. Rush was informed by bis at-
torneys that they were taken in possession by his nephew, Henry James
Hungerford.

Mr. Rush, in one of his dispatches to the State Department (July 14,
1838), says: ‘*The boxes and trunk are to go on shipboard to-day. Be-
fore knowing anything of their contents, I thought proper to have them
opened and examined in the presence of our consul and two other per-
sons. A large portion of the contents proved to be unimportant; never-
theless, all will be delivered over on my arrival as I received them, ex-
cept to have them better packed for a sea voyage, and so as to prevent
further injury to that which time and bad packing have already done to
them.”

These articles remained in the New York custom house from the 29th
of August, 1858, until June, 1841, when, at the earnest solicitation of
the National Institute of Washington, they were sent to the latter city.

The trunk contained manuscripts and clothing, the latter consisting of
the following articles, according to a list found among the papers of the
National Institute: “1 net shirt, 4 sheets, 11 napkins, 5 light vests, 1
bag, 4 roundabouts, 5 light pants and short breeches, 1 bib, 3 drawers,
3 pair garters, 2 light coats, 1 cloth overcoat, 1 cloth military coat, 1
cloth hunting coat, 1 cloth cloak, 1 cloth surtout, 1 cloth pair of pants,
2 cloth vests, 4 pair stockings, 1 chapeau.”

The clothing was nearly ruined by moths, and was presented to an
158 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

orphan asylum. An examination of the effects was made by a committee
of the National Institute, who made the following report as to part of
them: ‘ A cabinet, consisting of a choice and beautiful collection of
minerals, comprising probably eight or ten thousand specimens. These,
though generally small, are exceedingly perfect, and constitute a very
complete geological and mineralogical series, embracing the finest varie-
ties of crystallization, rendered more valuable by accompanying figures
and descriptions by Mr. Smithson, and in his own handwriting. The cab-
inet also contains a valuable suite of meteoric stones, which appear to be
specimens of most of the meteorites which had fallen in Europe during
several centuries.”

Mr. Francis Markoe, jr., himself an expert mineralogist, in a letter to
the American Philosophical Society, 4th August, 1841, says “that
among the valuable things contained in the Smithson boxes were found
a superb collection, and very large, of precious stones and exquisite erys-
tallized minerals, forming, as far as I can judge, decidedly the richest
and rarest collection in this country.”

A medallion was found among his effects to which were attached the
words ‘‘my likeness,” written in Smithson’s own hand. From this has
been engraved the portrait published by the Institution, the great seal

rdered by the first Board of Regents, and the vignette which appears
on all the Smithsonian publications. The original steel-plate portrait,
engraved by J. W. Paradise, of New York, in 1847, was destroyed by
fire, but it was finely reproduced for the Institution by Charles Burt, of
New York, in 1879.

A full-length portrait (about one-fourth size) in oil, of Smithson, rep-
resenting him in the costume of an Oxford student, was purchased by
the Institution in 1850, for thirty guineas, from the widow of John Fitall,
a former servant, to whom Smithson granted an annuity in his will.

Still later, in 1878, the Institution purchased from Mr. George Henry
De la Batut, of France, a beautiful miniature in oil, on ivory, painted by
Johns, on the 11th of May, 1816, at Aix-la-Chapelle.

The effects of Smithson were exhibited in the Patent Office building,
Washington, until 1858, when they were transferred to the Smithsonian
Institute, where they were unfortunately destroyed by fire on the 24th
of January, 1865, with the exception of his books, a very few manu-
script notes on minerals, and an oil painting of a landscape. A list of
these books now in the Institution will be found in the appendix.*

The following articles are enumerated as the contents of case 23 in
Alfred Hunter’s “ Popular Catalogue of the Extraordinary Curiosities in
the National Institute, arranged in the building belonging to the Patent
Office,” 1855:

“Silver plate with coat of arms of the Northumberland family ;

Smithson’s father, scales, umbrella-case, and riding-whip, sword-belt and
plume, silver spoons and butter-knife, ornamented spools for winding
gold wire, copper plate with his name engraved on it ; minerals of Smith-
son, a very superb collection, though small; silver candlestick ; an ele-
gant service of silver, containing a great many pieces. These are all
very much discolored by sulphurous gas. A marble head of Saint Ce-
cilia, by Thorwaldsen, presented to Mr. Smithson at Copenhagen by
Dr. Brandis, physician to the King of Denmark. A fine old original
painting by Bergham, cattle piece, peasants, &c.; an old building in the
distance. Its subject is rustic and familiar life. The treatment is
chaste and mellow. The depth of the foreground is really surprising,
and appears to be produced without an effort ; the background is trans-
parent and aerial; the middle distance sober and clear; the atmosphere
and vapors pellucid and tremulous; the quiet and docile animals, the
groups of peasantry, and the strongholds of power are equal to any
other great effort of the celebrated Bergham. Many specimens of pet-
rified wood. Notice several beautiful specimens of marble, which it
would be difficult to distinguish from a fine landscape painting. Glass
model of the great Russian diamond, valued at about 600,000 pounds
sterling.”

In an “Account of the Smithsonian Institution, &c.,” by Wm. J. Rhees,
published in Washington in 1859, the following statement is made:

“In the room used by the ‘ Regents’ and the ‘ Establishment’ as a
hall for their meetings, are now deposited the personal effects of James
Smithson. Here may be seen his. trunks, umbrella, walking-cane, sword,
plume, riding-whip; a set of silver-plate; a miniature chemical laboratory,
which he used when travelling; thermometers, snuff-box, scales, candle-
sticks, &c. Hanging in this room is an original painting by Bergham,
a rural scene, the property of Smithson, a marble head of St. Cecilia, by
Thorwalsden, &c.”

The will of Smithson was prepared by him on the 25d October, 1826,
while residing in Bentinck street, Cavendish Square, London, three years
before his death, showing that it was made with deliberation and con-
firmed by mature reflection. Its provisions are in some respects so re-
markable that they have been attributed to a mere whim or eccentricity
of character; but knowledge of the man as a scientific investigator,
accustomed to the use of precise language, fond of the most minute de-
tails, and yet of broad and comprehensive views, precludes this infer-
ence. An interesting circumstance has come to light from a recent care-
ful examination of the books in Smithson’s library. A volume has been
found entitled “ Plain advice to the public, to facilitate the making of
their own wills, with forms of wills, simple and elaborate, containing
almost every description of bequest, especially the various modes of set-
tling property for the sole use and benefit of married women for their
lives, with powers of appointment to them by deed or will; tables of the
stamp duties on probates and letters of administration; special rules
160 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

and tables regarding the wills and letters of administration of petty
officers, seamen, and marines, and a chapter of useful hints to persons
about to make their own wills; the whole illustrated with explanatory
notes and remarks, being an intelligible and complete, though summary,
explanation of the law of wills and testaments.” By the author of
‘Plain instructions to executors and administrators.’” London, 1826,
Svo., 94 pages.

It is noticeable that this book was published in the same year in which
Smithson made his will, and that it was carefully studied is evident
from his marginal notes, and the fact that he adopted its phraseology
in providing an annuity to his faithful servant. His words were not
only chosen to accord with the forms of law, but with strict regard to
the meaning and scope of the language used. ‘The will, moreover, is in
the testator’s own handwriting.

It is an interesting subject of speculation to consider the motives
which actuated Smithson in bequeathing his fortune to the United
States of America to found an institution in the city of Washington.

He is not known to have had a single correspondent in America,
and in none of his papers is found any reference to it or to its distin-
guished men.* It has been alleged that he was more friendly to mon-
archical than to republican institutions, but there appears to be no foun-
dation for this opinion. It is more probable that, living at a time when
all Europe was convulsed with war, when the energies of nations, the
thoughts of rulers, and the lives of millions were devoted to efforts for
conquest or to perpetuate despotism, he turned to the free American
tepublic, where he could discern the germs of rising grandeur, the ele-
ments of enduring prosperity, and the aspirations of coming generations.
He undoubtedly felt that in the United States there would be wider scope
for the promotion of knowledge, and that in this new country there
would always be free thought and indefinite progress. By selecting
the nation itself as the depository of his trust he paid the highest com-
pliment to its intelligence and integrity, and testified his confidence in
republican institutions and his faith in their perpetuity.

The period in which Smithson lived was not less marked by the
gloom occasioned by long-protracted and almost universal war, and
the extent and rapidity of its social changes, than by the luster of
its brilliant discoveries in science and its useful inventions in the arts.
The leaders of contending nations, who had long absorbed the atten-
tion of Europe by their struggles for dominion, were at last forced to
relinquish some of their honors to the great philosophers whose achieve-
ments then illuminated the page of history, and which have not since
been surpassed. It was pre-eminently a period of activity of thought,

States. Extracts from these relative to the city of Washington are given in the Ap-—

of fertility of invention and of original research. Pure abstract science
had many illustrious votaries, and the practical application of its traths
gave to the world many of the great inventions by means of which civiliza-
tion has made such immense and rapid progress.

Not only were individual efiorts for the welfare of humanity made,
but a spirit of association was developed and numevous organizations
formed, having for their object the promotion of science, education, and
philanthropy. The few existing societies also became inspired with
new life and vigor. The ‘Royal Society of London” entered upon its
most brilliant epoch and became the fountain and center of intellectual
progress. “The Royal Institution of Great Britain,” chiefly indebted
for its origin to an American, was founded in 1800, “for diffusing the
knowledge and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical
inventions and improvements and for teaching by courses of philosoph-
ical lectures and experiments the application of science to the common
purposes of life.” A glance at the names of a few of the great organi-
zations instituted in different parts of the world at the close of the last
and beginning of the present century will show the remarkable scien-
tific activity of that pericd and the direction of thought towards the
establishment of permanent institutions :

The remarkable advances made in science at this epoch were thus
alluded to by Arago in his eulogy cn Thomas Young:

“In a short space of time the Academy has lost from the list of its
members, Herschel, whose bold ideas on the structure of the universe
have acquired every year more of probability; Piazzi, who, on the first
day of the present century, presented our solar system with a new planet;
Watt, who, if not the inventor of the steam-engine, was at least the
creator of so many admirable contrivances by the aid of which the little
instrument of Papin has become the most ingenious, the most useful, the
most powerful means of applying industry ; Volta, who has been immor-

talized by his electric pile; Davy, equally celebrated for the decomposi-
tion of the alkalies, and for the invaluable safety-lamp of the miner; Wol-
laston, whom the English called “the Pope,” because he never proved
fallible in any of his numerous experiments or of his subtle theoretical
speculations ; Jenner, lastly, whose discovery I have no need to extol in
the presence of pier of families.”

Cuvier also made the following imposing Peimeeaeee of the scientific
achievements of this era in his eulogy on Haiiy:

“The laws of a geometry, as concise as comprehensive, extended over
the entire heavens; the boundaries of the universe enlarged and its
spaces peopled with unknown stars; the courses of celestial bodies deter-
mined more rigorously than ever, both in time and space; the earth
weighed as in a balance; man soaring to the clouds or traversing the
seas without the aid of winds; the intricate mysteries of chemistry re-
ferred to certain clear and Sale facts; the list of natural existences
increased tenfold in every species, and lew relations irrevocably fixed
by a survey as well of their interna as external structure; the history
of the earth, even in ages the most remote, explored by means of its own
si eT and shown to be not less wonderful in fact than it might
have appeared to the wildest faney: such is the grand and unparalleled
spectacle which it has been our privilege to contemplate.”

While scientific thought and discovery were thus being advanced,
attention was directed to the great ignorance of the masses. The idea
of universal diffusion of knowledge had been unknown in England, and
many of the upper classes of society cherished and avowed a deeply
rooted dislike to the education of the poor, as “tending to discontent
and an overthrow of that orderly subordination without which society
vannot exist.” The principle was held by many, and considered indis-
putable, that “the ignorance of the people was necessary to their obe-
dience to law.” *

The period, however, was one in which revolution was commencing in
all directions. Many of the old landmarks of thought, opinion, and fact
were in process of removal and new ones were rapidly becoming estab-
lished. The progress and results of mechanical invention were pro-
ducing great social changes. Lord Broughaim’s “ Treatise on Popular
Education,” first published in January, 1825, had reached its twentieth
edition in the following year. His vigorous, eloquent, and practical
appeals to his countrymen were exciting universal attention, and through
his efforts the first of the useful and popular Mechanics’ Institutes was
established, the University of London was founded, and book clubs, read-
ing societies, and scientific lectures were organized.

At the opening of the session of Parliament in 1828, he proclaimed
that it was unconstitutional that almost the whole patronage of the
State should be placed in the hands of a military premier. The con-
eluding passage of his speech ran through the country, and dwelt for-

* Lord Cockburn.

ever in men’s minds in its axiomatic power. ‘There had been periods
when the country heard with dismay that the soldier was abroad. That
is not the case now. Let the soldier be ever so much abroad, in the
present age he could do nothing. There is another person abroad—a
less important person, in the eyes of some an insignificant person, whose
labours have tended to produce this state of things—the schoolmaster is
abroad.”*

Lord Brougham had declared that “to instruct the people in the rudi-
ments of philosophy would of itself be an object sufficiently brilliant
to allure the noblest ambition. To promote these ends and to obtain
for the great body of his fellow-creatures that high improvement which
both their understanding and their morals fitted them to receive,” he
urged upon the consideration of the men of wealth of Britain. ‘Such
a one, however averse by taste or habit to the turmoil of publi¢ affairs,
or the more ordinary strifes of the world, may in all quiet and inno-
cence enjoy the noblest gratification of which the most aspiring nature
is susceptible; he may influence by his single exertions the cha: acter and
the fortunes of a whole generation, and thus wield a power to be envied
even by vulgar ainbition, for the extent of its dominion; to be cherished
by virtue itself, for the unalloyed blessings it bestows.” He pressed the
subject on the attention “of all men of enlightened views, who value the
real improvement of their fellow-creatures and the best interests of their
country.” He appealed to public-spirited individuals to promote the dif-
fusion of knowledge and the cultivation of intellectual pursuits by devot-
ing some of their means to these objects, and showed how much money
had been misapplied by benevolent persons in sustaining certain charita-
ble institutions which only tended to increase the number of the poor and
dependent classes.

The ‘“ Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge” was established
in April, 1825, and at onee entered upon a career alike brilliant and suc-
cessful. ‘Its publications,” says the Edinburgh Review, ¢ “ undoubtedly
form by far the most important of the contributions from men of science
and letters to the instruction and improvement of mankind.” “Its efforts
were to be extended until knowledge had become as plentiful and as
universally diffused as the air we breathe.”

It cannot be doubted that Mr. Smithson became impressed with the
prevailing and new spirit of his age, and, recognizing as a man of science
the inestimable value of knowledge and the importance of its universal
diffusion, wrote the words of his will bequeathing his whole fortune ‘for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

. <Atone period of his life, and when an active member of the Royal
Society, he purposed leaving his fortune to that body for the promotion

of science,* but it is said that a disagreement with the council of the so-
ciety on account of the non-acceptance of one of his papers probably led
him to abandon the idea. This circumstance is of importance as indicat-
ing the bent of his mind and the mode in which he proposed to benefit
mankind. The difficulty referred to, however, undoubtedly led him to
vive broader scope to his plan, and to choose a trustee for his endow-
ment who would be hampered by no conventional or traditional restrie-
tions, and who would understand and carry out his purposes in the most
liberal and practical manner.t

It is peculiarly gratifying to Americans to remember that the jirst
award made by the Council of the Royal Society of the Copley medal, the
most honorable within its gift, was to our own countryman, Benjamin
Franklin, who was adjudged to be the author of the most important
scientific discovery. On this occasion the president of the society stated
that the council, ‘keeping steadily in view the advancement of science
and useful knowledge, and the honor of the society, had never thought
of confining the benefaction within the narrow limits of any particular
country, much less of the society itself.”

As this was the spirit of the leading scientific organization in existence,
of which Smithson himself was an active and honored member, he well
exemplified its liberal principles by transferring his foundation of a great
establishment for the ‘‘increase and diffusion of knowledge among men”
from London to the city of Washington.

Smithson received a large estate from his half brother, Colonel Henry
Louis Dickinson, in trust for the benefit of the son of this brother as
well as of his mother. To this nephew, to whom he was probably
attached, or because he had derived a large part of his fortune from his
father, he left his whole fortune. Contingent on the death of this young
man, he made the remarkable provision of an establishment in the United
States which has secured for him the distinction of being a benefactor of
mankind.

*The charter states that the Royal Society was founded for the improvement of
natural knowledge. This epithet natural, Dr. Paris remarks, “was intended to imply
a meaning of which very few persons are aware. At the period of the establishment
of the society the arts of witchcraft and divinations were very extensively encouraged,
and the word natural was therefore introduced in contradistinction to supernatural.”
Hooke, the president, declared, in 1663, that ‘‘the business and design of the Royal
Society was to improve the knowledge of natural things, and all useful arts, manufac-
tures, mechanick practises, engynes and inventions by experiments—(not meddling
with divinity, metaphysics, moralls, politicks, grammar, rhetorick, or logick. )”

Dr. Wollaston had made a gift of £1,000 to the Royal Society, the interest of which
was to be annually applied towards the encouragement of experiments.

t‘*Our countrymen do not believe that America is more advanced in knowledge and
refinement than Europe; but they know that, with slight divergencies, both hemi-
spheres are in this respect nearly abreast of each other. And they know that, both
being yet far from the goal, their generous transatlantic rivals start unencumbered by
many old prejudices and social trammels which we cannot here escape from.”—(Tait’s
Edinburgh Magazine, 1832, p. 234.)
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 165

It has been shown with what zeal and pleasure Smithson himself en-
gaged in the advancement of knowledge, and what general interest had
been awakened in England in the cause of scientific organization and
popular education at the very time he wrote his will, and it is not unrea-
sonable, therefore, to believe that he contemplated this contingency as
a very probable event.

The will of Smithson, dated October 23, 1826, was proved in the Pre-
rogative Court of Canterbury by his executor, Mr. Charles Drummond,
a London banker, on the 4th of November, 1829. The value of the effects
was sworn to be under £120,000.*

In 1878, a copy of a will also in Smithson’s handwriting was procured
by the Institution from Mr. de la Batut, almost identical with the one
recorded in the courts of London.

It appears from this that the word heretofore printed Audley in copies
of the will should be “Studley,” and that the name of the former servant
who kept the Hungerford Hotel at Paris should be Sailly, and not Jailly.
In the record of the will at London, the word Smithsonian as the name
of the Institution to be established is ‘‘ Smithsonean,” but as it is very
plainly written ‘‘ian” in what we must consider his original draft, the
misspelling referred to is undoubtedly due to an error of the transcriber.
In all the proceedings in the court of chancery, and all the negotiations
of Mr. Rush, the name ‘Smithsonian ” has uniformly been used.

The first article of the will refers to an old and trusted servant, John
Fitall, to whom, in consideration of his attachment and fidelity, Smith-
son bequeaths an annuity of a hundred pounds sterling. This Fitall
died in June, 1834, having enjoyed the benefit of his legacy for five
years.

Mr. Smithson next directs that various sums of money he had lent to
another of his servants, Henri Honori Sailly, should be allowed to re-
main uncalled for at five per cent. interest for five years.

He then mentions the fact that all the money in the French five per
cents. (livres de rentes) then standing in his own name and in that of
Colonel Dickinson was the property of his nephew, being what he in-
herited from the colonel, who died on the 22d May, 1820, with what he
had added himself to it from savings made out of the income. To this
nephew, Henry James Hungerford, who was also known as Henry James
Dickinson, and still later as Baron Eunice de la Batut, he leaves the
rest of the income arising from his property during his life. The whole
of his fortune is by the next clause of the will left absolutely and for-
ever to any child or children, legitimate or illegitimate, of the said
nepnew Hungerford. But in case of the death of his nephew without
leaving a child or children, or of the death of the child or children he
may have had under the age of twenty-one years or intestate, he then

“T bequeath the whole of my property to the United States of America,
to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an
establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The nephew, Mr. Hungerford (alias H. J. Dickinson), to whom was
bequeathed a life interest in Smithson’s estate, brought an amicable suit
in chancery against the executors for the purpose of having the assets
administered under the direction of the lord chancellor, and these were
ascertained to be about £100,000 sterling. The income from this prop-
erty, which consisted mainly of stock in the public funds of England,
was promptly paid to young Hungertord, who led a roving life in Europe,
without settled habits or occupation, and died under the name of Baron

Junice de la Batut, at the Royal Hotel in Pisa, Italy, on the 5th of June,
1835, under thirty years of age, never having married, and leaving no
heirs who could, even under the broad provisions of his uncle’s will, make
a claim to his bounty.

The mother of Hungerford, a Mrs. Mary Ann Coates, had married a
Frenchman named Theodore de la Batut, and was still living at Port
Louis in France. She now made a claim for part of the estate, on the
ground that her son had given her an ample allowance while he lived, and
that under the will of his father, Col. Henry Louis Dickinson, made in
Paris in July 1819, by which he left all his property to wis brother, James
Smithson, half the income was to be for her benefit during her life. It
was shown that young Hungerford lived up to his income, and had left
nothing even to pay debts or funeral expenses. It was also urged
that if Smithson’s will had come into operation then, instead of seven
years before, Hungerford would, in consequence of an alteration of the
jaw, have been entitled to a portion of the accruing half-year’s income
up to his death; and that, in consequence of the change in the law, he
- could not be said to have enjoyed the income of the property during his
whole life. It was also urged as a “moral claim,” that as the Smith-
son bequest was to be applied “to increase and diffuse knowledge
among men,” the children of Mrs. de la Batut were entitled to an
allowance from it until the age of twenty-two for their education.

The claim made was for an annuity of £240; but after long nego-
tiation the decree was made by the court of chancery to allow Mrs. de
la Batut £1590 9s. during her life, with a payment of £526 11s. 6d. for
arrears from the 22d September, 1834, to the 22d March, 1838. To se-
cure this annuity, the sum of £5,015 in three per cent. consols was re-
tained in trust by the court, the interest to be paid on the 22d September
and 22d March annually. By the law of France, the life income is ap-
portionable and payable up to the time of death ; and Colonel Dickin-
son having been domiciled in France, this rule applied in his case.

Mrs. de la Batut lived to the year 1861, and the amount retained in
England as the principal of the annuity was paid over to the Institu-
tion on the 11th June, 1864. This is known as the “ residuary legacy”
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 167

of Smithson, and the sum realized from it by the Institution, by the
premium on gold, &¢., was $54,165.38.

The first announcement made to the American Government of the
fact that the United States had become entitled to the bequest of Smithson

oO

was a dispatch, dated 28th July, 1835, from Hon. Aaron Vail, chargé
Waffaires of the United States at London, to Hon John Forsyth, Secre-
tary of State, transmitting a letter from Messrs. Clarke, Fynmore and
Fladgate, attorneys in that city. This communicated the intelligence
that the nephew of Smithson had died, and that the United States was
entitled to the estate, valued at £100,000.

These facts were laid before Congress by President Jackson on the
17th December, 1835, who stated in his message that he had no author-
ity to take any steps toward accepting the trust.

In the Senate of the United States the message of the President was
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, which, by its chairman, Mr.
Benj. Watkins Leigh, of Virginia, reported, on the 5th of January, 1836,
that they considered the bequest of Mr. Smithson a valid one, and they
believed “that the United States would be entertained in the court of
chancery of England to assert their claim to the fund as trustees for
the purpose of founding the charitable institution at Washington to
which it is destined by the donor.” The question whether it was within
the competency of the Government to appropriate any part of the gen-
eral revenue from the nation at large to the foundation of a literary or
any other institution in the District of Columbia was answered by Mr.
Leigh by stating that—

‘The fund given by Mr. Smithsow’s will is nowise, and never can be-
come, part of the revenue of the United States; they cannot claim or
take it for their own benefit; they can only take it as trustee.”

“The United States were to be regarded as the parens patrie of the
District of Columbia, and in that character they had a right and were
in duty bound to assert a claim to any property given to them for the
purpose of founding an institution within the District, and to provide
for the due application and administration of such a fund when they
obtained possession of it.”

Resolutions were reported by the committee providing for the prose-
cution of the claim. The report was considered in the Senate on the
30th April, 1836, and it was urged by Mr. W. C. Preston, of South Car-
olina, that the Government of the United States had no power to receive
the money. He thought the donation had been made partly with a view
to immortalize the donor, and it was ‘‘teo cheap a way of conferring im-
mortality.” He had no idea of the District of Columbia being used as
a fulcrum to raise foreigners to immortality by getting Congress as the
parens patric to accept donations from them. He expressed the opinion
that Smithson’s intention was to found a university.

Mr. Leigh, in reply, maintained that the legacy was not for the benefit
168 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

of the United States, but only for one of the. cities of the District of
Columbia, and with this belief he had no difficulty in voting for the bill.

Mr. John M. Clayton, of Delaware, also thought a university was in-
tended by Smithson.

Mr. John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, was of opinion that the dona-
tion was made expressly to the United States, and that “it was beneath
their dignity to receive presents of this kind from any one.”

Mr. Samuel L. Southard, of New Jersey, advocated the measure, as
he thought Congress had the unquestionable right to establish a national
university.

Mr. James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, believed that Congress had
the power to receive and apply this money to the purposes intended by
the testator, without involving the question whether it was for a univer-
sity or not. L

Mr. Robert J. Walker, of Mississippi, advocated the bill as a measure
of justice to the city of Washington.

Mr. John Davis, of Massachusetts, argued that the Senators were mis-
taken who assumed that Smithson intended his bequest to establish a
university. This word was not to be found in the will, and there were
other means for diffusing knowledge besides the one referred to. He
deemed the establishment of institutions for the promotion of knowl-
edge a vital principle of republican government.

After a somewhat protracted debate the resolutions were finally passed
on the 2d of May, 1836, by a vote of 31 to 7, and on. the 25th of June
they were again passed in the shape of a bill as it had come from the
House of Representatives.

The message of the President was referred in the House, on the 21st of
December, 1835, to a special committee, consisting of Mr. John Quiney
Adams, of Massachusetts, Mr. Francis Thomas, of Maryland, Mr. James
Garland, of Virginia, Mr. D. J. Pearce, of Rhode Island, Mr. Jesse
Speight, of North Carolina, Mr. Thomas M. T. McKennan, of Pennsyl-
vania, Mr. BE. A. Hannegan, of Indiana, Mr. Rice Garland, of Louisiana,
and Mr. G. H. Chapin, of New York. In this committee great opposi-
tion was manifested at first to the acceptance of the bequest, but this
vielded to the arguments and persuasion of the distinguished chairman,
Mr. John Q. Adams. <A bill was accordingly reported, directing the Pres-
ident to appoint an agent to assert and prosecute for and in behalf of
the United States in the court of chancery, England, the legacy be-
queathed by James Smithson. The agent was to give bonds in $500,000
for the faithful performance of the duties imposed upon him. The Treas-
urer of the United States was to take charge of and keep safely all the
money received on account of the bequest, and “the faith of the United
States was solemnly pledged that the fund should be applied for the
purpose of founding and endowing at Washington, under the name of
the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 169

sion of knowledge among men.” Yor the cost of prosecuting the claim
an appropriation of $10,000 was made.

On the 19th of January, 1836, Mr. Adams made an elaborate report,
containing all the facts he had been able to collect relative to Sinithson,
and expressing in the most glowing and refined language his apprecia-
tion of the value of the gift to America and its importance to mankind.
Mr. Leigh had convinced the Senate that it was the duty of Congress
to accept the bequest, and Mr. Adams brought before the House an ac-
count of the life of the testator, the nature of the trust, the character of
the trustees, the practical influence of our political institutions upon
Kurope, and the vast benefits to the world which might grow out of the
legacy. The report was unanimously agreed to in the committee, but
Mr. Adams had great misgivings whether anything would ever be real-
ized from the bequest. The delays of the English court of chancery
were well known, and the opinion had even been expressed that the
whole affair was an imposture. Mr. Adams never wavered, however,
in his faith in the power of the government to procure the money and
its ability to administer it properly. He refers in his diary to it as the
favorite and almost absorbing subject of his thoughts, and for many
years he devoted untiring activity and personal efforts to its successful
accomplishment.

No action was taken by the House on Mr. Adams’s report until the
Senate had passed Mr. Leigh’s resolution; when that was taken up,
changed in form to that of a bill, passed on the 25th of June, 1836, and
was approved by the President on the Ist of July, 1836.

In accordance with this act the President appointed, on the 11th of
July, Hon. Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania, as the agent to assert and
prosecute the claim of the United States to the legacy. His salary was
fixed at $3,000 per annum, and $2,600 were allowed for contingencies,
not including legat expenses. Mr. Rush gave the necessary bond for
$500,000, Messrs. J. Mason, jr., and Benjamin C. Howard being his sure-
ties, who were accepted by Mr. Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury.
This appointment was one eminently fit to be made, and its wisdom was
proved by the successful accomplishment of the mission. Mr. Rush had
been Comptroller of the United States Treasury at a time when the fiscal
affairs of the government were in disorder; he was next Attornéy-Gen-
eral; then minister to England for a period of eight years; Secretary
of the Treasury; and minister to France. “ To these great and varied
employments,” Hon. J. A. Pearce has remarked, “he brought integrity,
ability, intelligence, firmness, courtesy, and a directness of purpose
which scorned all finesse and which served his country to the full extent
of all that could have been demanded or hoped.”

Mr. Kush immediately proceeded to London, placed himself in com-
munication with the attorneys of the executor of Smithson, and entered
with vigor into the measures necessary to assert the claim of the United
170 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

States. It was soon ascertained, on consultation with eminent counsel,
Messrs. Thomas Pemberton and Edward Jacob, then at the head of the
chancery bar, that it was necessary that a suit should be brought in
the name of the President of the United States against the testatov’s
executors, and that the Attorney-General must be made a party to the
proceedings in order that he might represent before the court any claim
which the Crown might have to the bequest on account of its extension
to illegitimate children, or by reason of any part of the property con-
sisting of interests inland. Mr. Rush, in addition to Messrs. Pember-
ton and Jacob, employed Messrs. Clarke, Fynmore, and Fladgate as his
legal advisers, and a suit was commenced in the court of chancery in
November, 1836. The first hearing, however, did not take place until the
1st of February, 1837, before Lord Langdale, master of the rolls, this
court and that of the vice-chancellor being the two branches of the
English chancery system before which suits are brought in the first
instance.

The case was fully opened on behalf of the United States by Mr. Pem-
berton. The King’s counsel abandoned at once ail opposition on the
part of the Crown, and no question was raised under the doctrine of es-
cheats or any other by the representatives of the British Government.
The court then decreed that the case be referred to one of the masters
- In chancery, Mr. Nassau William, Sen., tomake the requisite inquiries as
to the facts on the happening of which the United States became enti-
tled to the fund left by Mr. Smithson, and also as to the claim of Madame
De la Batut.

The United States had never before sued in an English court, but
there were precedents of other nations having done so by their execu-
tive heads, as, for example, the King of France and the King of Den-
mark. The United States were therefore allowed to enter the courts in
the name of the President. '

Advertisements were immediately inserted in the London Times, Her-
ald, and Standard, and in French and Italian newspapers in Paris and
Port Louis, in France, and Leghorn, in Italy, asking for information re-
specting Henry James Hungerford; whether he married, whether he
left any child, &e.

Mr. Rush, in August, 1837, wrote to the Secretary of State that there
were more than eight hundred eases in arrears in the court of chancery,
and he felt much discouraged as to a speedy termination of the suit.
While the population of England had increased in a definite period six-
fold and her wealth twentyfold, the judicial establishment had remained
nearly the same. There were only eleven masters in chancery, while
double the number would not be sufficient. The subject of a reform in
this court, Mr, Rush stated, had been specially recommended by the
Throne to Parliament. It had been said, with truth, that ‘‘a chancery
suit was a thing that might begin with a man’s life and its termination
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 171

be his epitaph.” Still later it will be remembered that Mr. Dickens
stated in 13853 that there was then “a suit before the court of chancery
which had been commenced twenty years before in which from thirty to
Yorty counsel had been known to appear at one time, in which costs had
been incurred to the amount of £70,000, which was a friendly suit, and
which was no nearer its termination than when it was begun.”

Mr. Rush refers in terms of high compliment to the solicitors he had
employed on behalf of the United States. He says:

“That more attention, diligence, discretion, and integrity could not
have been exerted by any persons than they have shown throughout the
whole suit from first to last. Could they ever have forgotten what was
due to the United States and to themselves, in the desire to eke out a
job, nothing is plainer to me, from what has been passing under my
observation of the entanglements and delays natural to a heavy suit in
the English court of chancery, than that they might have found oppor-
tunities in abundance of making the suit last for years yet to come.”

It is therefore to be regarded as one of the most remarkable events
in the history of the bequest that the suit of the United States, com-
menced in November, 1836, should have been brought to a successful
issue, in less than two years, on the 12th of May, 1538, which, it may be
interesting to note, was the first year of the reign of Her Majesty Queen
Victoria.

Mr. Rush was therefore placed in possession of the legacy with the
exception of the part reserved as the principal of an annuity to Madame
De la Batut. Mr. Rush thus expresses his satisfaction at the result:

“A suit of higher interest and dignity has rarely perhaps been before
the tribunals of a nation. If the trust created by the testator’s will be
successfully carried into effect by the enlightened legislation of Con-
gress benefits may flow to the United States and to the human family
not easy to be estimated, because operating silently and  radually
throughout time, yet operating not the less effectually.”

Searcely had the decision of the court been made and the amount of
the award published in the newspapers, when two claimants for the
estate of Smithson appeared, neither having any connection with the
other; and they desired, rather importunately, to know if the case could
not be reopened. They were much chagrined to find that they were a
little too late in their application, and nothing more was heard of them.

The American minister to England, My. Stevenson, and our consul at
London, Mr. Aspinwall, united in testifying to the great tact and abil-
ity of Mr. Rush, and in affirming—

“That no litigant ever displayed a more ardent zeal or a more saga-
cious, devoted, and unremitting diligence in the prosecution of his pri-’
vate suit than he did in urging on this public one to a prompt and sue-
cessful conclusion. The dispatch with which in consequence this purpose
was finally accomplished is almost without example in the annals of
chancery. His solicitors will long remember his adroit and unsparing
172 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

application of the spur. Had he not urged them to the top of their
speed, he would have had a lighter weight of gold to earry home with
him.”

The estate of Smithson which was transferred to Mr. Richard Rush
consisted of the following securities:

£64,535 18s. 9d. in consolidated three per cent. annuities, called con-
sols, sold at an average of 953 per cent., yielded £56,175.

£12,000 in reduced three per cent. annuities, sold at 94 per cent.,
yielded £11,280.

£16,100 in Bank of England stock, sold at about 205 per cent., yield-
ing £32,996 10s.

xood-fortune again attended Mr. Rush, for the day when he sold the
consols their value was higher than at any previous time for any years
or than at any later period. The bank stock also commanded the
remarkably high premium of about 205 per cent.

The estate, therefore, independent of the accumulations of interest and
notwithstanding the delays in the court of chancery, was worth more
than in the summer of 1835, when the right of the United States first
attached to it by the death of Henry James Hungerford, and the entire
amount of sales yielded an aggregate of more than one hundred and six
thousand pounds sterling.

Mr. Rush’s next.concern was how to transfer these funds to the United
States, and he decided to convert the whole into gold coin and send it
in this form. This was not only the most judicious course, but it secured
an increase of the fund to upwards of a thousand pounds sterling on
account of saving the cost of exchange. This sum was enough to cover
commissions, insurance, freight, and other charges on the transfer of the
gold.

The costs of the suit and expenses connected with the shipment of
the proceeds of the bequest were as follows:

Costs of the chancery suit, £490 4s. 10d.; selling the stock, commission
to Thomas Aspinwall, £797 15s. 6d.; charges for shipping, £6 19s. 44.;
premium of insurance, £605 3s. 10d.; brokerage, stamps, &e., £120 4s. 6d. ;
freight from London to New York, £393 12s.; primage, £19 13s. 8d.

The proceeds of the sales of the stocks, &c., were converted into gold
sovereigns, and these were packed at the Bank of England in bags con-
taining £1,000 each and shipped in eleven boxes by the packet Mediator,
of New York, on the 17th July, 1838. Three other boxes sent at the
same time contained the personal effects of Smithson.

The ship Mediator arrived in New York on the 29th of August, 1838,
and the gold, amounting to £104,960 8s. 6d., was deposited in the Bank
of America until the 1st of September, when it was delivered to the
Treasurer of the United States Mint in Philadelphia, and immediately
recoined into American money, producing $508,318.46 as the bequest of
Smithson.
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 173

LEGISLATION OF CONGRESS

IN RELATION TO

THE DISPOSITION OF THE BEQUEST.

On the 6th of December, 1838, President Van Buren had the satis-
faction of announcing to Congress that the claim of the United States
to the legacy bequeathed to them by James Smithson had been fully
established, and that the fund had been received by the government.
He now urged the prompt adoption of a plan by which the intentions
of the testator might be fully realized. For the purpose of obtaining
information which might facilitate the attainment of this object, he
applied, through the Secretary of State, to a number of persons “ versed
in science and familiar with the subject of public education, for their
views as to the mode of disposing of the fund best calculated to meet
the intentions of Smithson, and be most beneficial to mankind.”

He communicated to Congress the replies received, of which the fol-
lowing is a brief abstract.

President Francis Wayland, of Brown University, proposed a univer-
sity of high grade to teach Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Oriental languages,
and a long list of other branches, including rhetoric, poetry, intellect-
ual philosophy, the law of nations, &e.

Dr. Thomas Cooper, of South Carolina, also proposed a university, to
be opened only to graduates of other colleges, where the higher branches
of mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, We., should be taught, but Latin
and Greek, literature, medicine, and law excluded.

Mr. Richard Rush proposed a building, with grounds attached, suffi-
cient to reproduce seeds and plants for distribution ; a press to print
lectures, &c.; courses of lectures on the leading branches of physical
and moral science, and on government and public law; the salaries to be
ample enough to command the best men, and admit of the exclusive
devotion of their time to the studies and investigations of their posts ;
the lectures, when delivered, to be the property of the institution for
publication. Mr. Rush also made the excellent suggestion that consuls
and other United States officers might greatly aid the institution by col-
lecting and sending home useful information and valuable specimens
from abroad.

Hon. John Quiney Adams expressed, in his reply, the opinion that no
part of the fund should be devoted “to the endowment of any school,
college, university, or ecclesiastical establishment”; and he proposed
to employ seven years’ income of the fund in the establishment of an
astronomical observatory, with instruments and a small library.

The subject of the Smithson bequest was referred in the House of
Representatives on the 10th December, 1838, to a special committee of
174 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

nine members, of which Hon. John Quincy Adams was chairman. Be-
sides the letters transmitted to Congress by President Van Buren, other
plans were brought before the committee.

A memorial from Prof. Walter R. Johnson suggested the establish-
ment of an institution for experiment and research in physical science
especially pertaining to the useful arts, and the discovery, description,
application, and improvement of the natural resources of our country.
Another scheme was presented by Mr. Charles L. Fleischtian for the
establishment of an agricultural school and farm, and he entered into
the most minute detail as to the buildings and estimates for all the parts
of the plan. There were also propositions to use the fund “for the in-
struction of females,” for the establishment of ‘ professorships,” for
‘courses of lectures,” for “improved methods of rearing sheep, horses,
and silkworms,” for founding a great library, &e.

Mr. Adams very earnestly opposed the appropriation of any part of
the fund to educational purposes, believing that it was the duty of the
country itself to provide the means for this important object. His own
favorite scheme was the establishment of an astronomical observatory,
and this he advocated in the most ardent, able, and persistent manner.

The chairman of the Senate committee, Hon. Asher Robbins, of Rhode
Island, proposed the creation of “an institution of which there is no
model either in this country or in Europe, to provide such a course of
education and discipline as would give to the faculties of the human
mind an improvement far beyond what they obtain by the ordinary
systems of education and far beyond what they afterwards attain in any
of the professional pursuits.” His speech in the Senate on the 10th of
January, 1839, in presenting his views on this subject is remarkable for
its beauty of diction, elevation of sentiment, and classical erudition.

Mr. Robbins’s resolutions provided for a scientific and literary in-
stitution, and stated that to apply the fund to the erection and support
of an observatory ‘‘ would not be to fulfil bona fide the intention of the
testator, nor would it comport with the dignity of the United States to
owe such an establishment to foreign eleemosynary means.”

The plan of Mr. Robbins was not received with sufficient favor in the
Senate to secure its passage, and it was laid on the table by a vote of
20 to 15, on the 25th of February, 1839. Among those who favored the
bill were Senators Clay, Davis, Prentiss, Preston, Rives, and Walker,
and among those opposed to it were Senators Allen, Bayard, Benton, and
Caihoun.

Mr. Adams remarks in his diary, October 26, 1839, that his mind was
“filled with anxiety and apprehension lest the fund should be squan-
dered upon cormorants or wasted in electioneering bribery.” He adds:

“Tt is hard to toil through life for a great purpose with a conviction
that it will bein vain, but possibly seed now sown may bring forth some
good fruit hereafter. If I cannot prevent the disgrace of the country by
the failure of the testator’s intention, I can leave a record of what I
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 175

have done and what I would have done to accomplish the great design
if executed well.”

At the beginning of the Twenty-sixth Congress, December, 1839, Mr.
Adams again brought up the subject of the Smithson bequest and had
it referred to a committee of nine, consisting of Messrs. Adams, Ogle,
Shepard, Garland of Virginia, Lewis, Albert Smith, Barnard, Corwin,
and Campbell of South Carolina.

A memorial was presented to Congress from the Corporation of the
city of Washington, expressing great anxiety ‘“‘to see the instructions of
Smithson carried into effect, believing it impossible to calculate the
good which an institution properly founded is susceptible of promoting
in the improvement of the intellect, taste, and morals of the country.”
It was deemed presumptuous, however, to express an opinion as to what
should be the character of the institution.

Mr. Hassler, then in charge of the Coast Survey, urged on Mr. Adams
the establishment of an astronomical school.

On the 5th of March, 1840, Mr. Adams presented an elaborate and
extended report to the House of Representatives, reviewing all that had
been done relative to the bequest, and presenting the establishment of
an astronomical observatory as the best means of carrying out the pur-
poses of Smithson. He gave in detail the arguments in favor of this
plan, with estimates for carrying it into effect, and an interesting letter
from Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal of England, relative to the origin,
history, uses, and expenses of the famous Greenwich Observatory. Mr.
Adams also gave a masterly summary of the progress of astronomical
discovery, painted in the most brilliant colors the achievements of men
of science, and portrayed in glowing language the future glory and
renown of our country to be derived from the application of the Smith-
son fund in the manner he proposed.

The impropriety of devoting any portion of the fund to establish a
school or college was strongly urged, and he said, “We should in no
case avail ourselves of a stranger’s munificence to rear our children.”
It is not clear how the learned and distinguished gentleman reconciled
his apparent inconsistency in advocating the use of the fund for the
establishment of ‘a national observatory to be superior to any other
devoted to the same science in any part of the world,” and which would
“make an impression upon the reputation of the United States through-
out the learned and scientific world.” The desire of increasing the
brightness of our name in the eyes of other nations, and of effacing a
stain he detected upon the national escutcheon on account of our lack
of an observatory, rendered him insensible or indifferent to the merits
of any other plan for the increase and diffusion of knowledge. He
seems to have been wedded to his favorite scheme, and his whole course
in Congress in relation to the bequest was governed by it. After
provision had been made for astronomical observations by the general
government he still advocated no other plan, and even went so far as to
176 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

declare that he would rather see the money of Smithson thrown into the
Potomae than to have it devoted to the advance of education.

It appears that, without debate or explanation, a section was added
to the regular appropriation bill, passed 7th July, 1838, for the support
of the United States Military Academy at West Point, by which it was
enacted that all the money arising from the bequest of Smithson should
be invested, when received, by the Secretary of the Treasury, with the
approbation of the President of the United States, in stocks of States
bearing not less than five per cent. interest, and that the annual income
accruing on the stock should also be reinvested in the same way for the
increase of the fund.

In accordance with this law, Mr. Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the
Treasury, inserted an advertisement in the Washington Globe of August
6, 1538, asking for proposals from those having State stocks to dispose -
of. A large number of offers were received. Five per cents. of Indiana
were offered at par, 98, and 99; of Louisiana, at 98; New York, 102;
Maine, 983 and par; Massachusetts, 104; Kentucky, par; of five and a
quarter per cents., Tennessee, at 995; of five and a half per cents., Mis-
souri, at 102 and par; and of six per cents., Michigan, at par; Virginia,
par; Llinois, 104, and Arkansas, 99. Mr. Woodbury accepted the
otter of Mr. W. W. Corcoran, of the Arkansas bonds, and purchased
$500,000 of them for the sum of $499,500. Subsequentiy he procured
$38,000 more bonds of Arkansas, $8,000 Michigan, $56,000 Illinois, and
$18,000 Ohio bonds.

The two bills of Mr. Robbins and Mr. Adams, representing the univer-
sity and the observatory plans, were reported together to Congress. The
former Was laid on the table, but the latter not acted on, on account of
the pressure of other business at the close of the session.

In 1841, Mr. Lewis IF’. Linn, of Missouri, introduced a bill in the Senate
to appoint trustees for the investment of the Smithson fund, and for the
organization of an institution with a superintendent and six professors,
to be nominated by the “ National Institute,” a society which had been
formed in Washington for the promotion of science, and many of whose
members were anxious to obtain control of the bequest. Mr. Linn pro-
posed that all the collections of art and of natural history owned by the
United States should be given to the Smithsonian Institution, but all
the buildings, collections, &c., should be under the supervision of the
National Institute. This bill was referred to the Library Committee,
and a substitute was reported by Mr. Preston on the 17th February, 1841,
providing for the incorporation of the National Institute, and the estab-
lishment of a Smithsonian Institution, with a superintendent and six pro-
fessors, to be elected by the board of managers of the former, the offi-
cers of the institute and the superintendent of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to constitute a board of management of the Smithson fund, to plan
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. Lei

and erect buildings, procure books, apparatus, collections, &c. It was
provided that all works of art, and all books relating thereto, and all col-
lections and curiosities belonging to the United States were to be trans-
ferred to the Smithsonian Institution. The ground known as the Mall
Was appropriated for the buildings and use of the establishment. Noth-
ing resulted however from this proposition.

Through the efforts of Mr. Adams, the act of 7th July, 1838, requir-
ing the investment of the Smithson fund in State stocks, was repealed,
and by an act of September 11, 1841, the Secretary of the Treasury was
directed to invest the accruing interest thereafter only in United States
stock.

President Tyler, in his message at the opening of the Twenty-seventh
Congress, urged the propriety of making a specific application of the
funds derived from the will of Smithson, and said he felt confident that
“no abatement of the principal would be made should it turn out that
the stocks in which the fund had been invested had undergone depre-
ciation.”

The Senate referred the message to the Library Committee, Mr. Pres-
ton, chairman, and the House to a select committee of nine, of which
Mr. Adams was again chairman. Mr. Preston soon after reported the
bill he had offered at the previous session for combining the National
Institute and the Smithsonian Institution, but this was laid upon the table
on the 18th July, 1842. Mr. Adams presented a report and bill in the
House on the 12th April, 1842, providing for the incorporation of the
Smithsonian Institution; that all the money received from the bequest
should be placed to the credit of a fund to be denominated the Smith-
sonian fund, to be preserved undiminished and unimpaired, and to bear
interest at 6 per cent. per annum. The interest of this fund was to be
appropriated for the erection and establishment of an astronomical ob-
servatory, the publication of the observations, and of a nautical almanac.

About this period memorials were presented to Congress in favor of
appropriating the fund for the purpose of awarding annual prizes for
the best original essays on the various subjects of the physical sciences,
for the establishment of an agricultural school and farm, for organizing
a system of simultaneous meteorological observations throughout the
Union under the direction of Professor Espy, &e.

No definite action was had on any of these propositions, and President
Tyler again called the attention of Congress in his message of December 5,
1843, to their neglect of an important duty. The subject was referred to
the Joint Library Committee, of which Hon. Rufus Choate was chairman.

Mr. Tappan, from this committee, reported a bill on the 6th June, 1844,
providing that the original amount received as the bequest of Smithson,
$508,318.46, be considered as a permanent loan to the United States, at 6
per cent. interest, from the 3d December, 1838, when the same was
received into the Treasury; that the interest which accrued to the Ist

July, 1844, viz, $178,604, be appropriated to the erection of buildings and
inclosure of grounds for the Smithsonian Institution ; that the business
of the institution should be conducted by a board of twelve managers from
different States or Territories ; that a plain and substantial building be
erected, with rooms for a museum, library, chemical laboratory, lectures,
arboretum; all the objects of natural history belonging to the United
States to be transferred to said institution, exchanges of duplicate speci-
mens to be made, a superintendent to be appointed to be professor also
of agriculture and horticulture, additional professors of natural history,
chemistry, astronomy, and such other branches as the wants of science
may require, “excluding law, physic, or divinity,” experiments to be
made to determine the utility of new fruits, plants, and vegetables, and
finally students to be admitted to the institution gratuitously.

Mr. Adams in February, 1844, succeeded in having a select committee
of nine appointed to consider the proper disposition of the fund, and in
behalf of this committee made a third elaborate and comprehensive re-
port, together with a bill providing for the appropriation of $800,000 as
the Smithson fund, to be permanently invested in stock of the United
States at 6 per cent. interest, and the income to be devoted, as he had
before recommended, for an observatory and nautical almanac.

On the 12th December, 1844, Mr. Tappan introduced a bill in the Sen-
ate of a similar character to the one he had offered before, but in addi-
tion specified that the books to be purchased for a library should con-
sist of works on science and the arts, especially such as relate to the
ordinary business of life and to various mechanical and other improve-
ments and discoveries. In prescribing the duties of professors and lee-
turers, special reference was to be had tothe productive and liberal arts,
improvements in agriculture, horticulfure, and rural economy. Seeds
and plants were to be distributed throughout the country, soils were to be
analyzed ; the professor of natural history was to refer in his lectures to the
history and habits of useful and injurious animals; the professor of geol-
ogy was to give practical instruction in the exploration and working of
mines; the professor of architecture was to give instruction as to the
best materials and plans for building; the professor of astronomy was
to give a course of lectures on navigation and the use of nautical in-
struments. It was also provided that works in popular form on the
sciences and the aid they bring to labor should be published and dis-
tributed. .

In the discussion to which this bill gave rise in the Senate on the 8th
of January, 1845, Mr. Choate made the brilliant speech which is referred
to in the North American Review as “a splendid offering on the shrine
of literature by one of her most gifted votaries, and one which, in fu-
ture times, will render more memorable the day on which it was deliv-
ered than that gallant military achievement of which it is the anniver-
sary. No prouder monument than this would be needed for his fame.” *

* North American Review, vol. 79, p. 459.
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 179

In this famous speech, Mr. Choate remarked that “ our sense of duty
to the dead, the living, and the unborn who shall live; our justice, our
patriotism, our policy, common honesty, common decorum, urge us, are
enough to urge us, to go on without the delay of an hour, to appropri-
ate the bounty according to the form of the gift.” He opposed any-
thing like the school or college proposed by Mr. Tappan on the ground
of its narrow utilitarianism, as being wholly unnecessary and in a great
degree useless. It would injure the universities already in existence ;
it would be exceedingly difficult to secure students; the expense of pro-
fessors, books, apparatus, and buildings would secure a pretty energetic
diffusing of the fund but not much diffusion of knowledge. He ap-
proved of the suggestion that lectures should be delivered, especially
during the sessions of Congress, not by professors permanently fixed on
annual salaries, but by gentlemen eminent in science and literature, to
be invited to Washington under the stimulus and with the ambition of
a special and conspicuous retainer. He preferred however that the one
simple object of the Institution should be to accumulate a grand and
noble public library, one which for variety, extent, and wealth should
be equal to any in the world. He claimed that this scheme was the
only one that “would prevent the waste of money in jobs, salaries, sine-
cures and quackeries, and would embody Smithson’s idea in some tangi-
ble form, some exponent of civilization, permanent, palpable, conspicu-
ous, useful, and than which nothing was safer, surer, or more unexcep-
tionable.”

Mr. Choate presented many interesting facts in regard to the public
libraries of the world, and argued in his peculiarly forcible and eloquent
manner that such a plan as he proposed was within the terms and spirit
of the trust.

“That directs us to ‘increase and diffuse knowledge among men.
And do not the judgments of all the wise; does not the experience of
all enlightened states ; does not the whole history of civilization concur
to declare that a various and ample library is one of the surest, most
constant, most permanent and most economical instrumentalities to in-
crease and diffuse knowledge? There it would be, durable as liberty,
durable as the Union; a vast storehouse, a vast treasury of all the facts
which make up the history of man and of nature, so far as that history
has been written; of all the truths which the inquiries and experiences
of all the races and ages have found out; of all the opinions that. have
been promulgated; of all the emotions, images, sentiments, examples,
of all the richest and most instructive literatures; the whole past speak-
ing to the present and the future—a silent, yet wise and eloquent
neacher, * * *

“Tf the terms of the trust then authorize this expenditure, why not
make it?) Not among the principal, nor yet the least of reasons for
doing so, is, that all the while that you are laying out your money, and
when you have laid it out, you have the money’s worth, the value re-

180 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

ceived, the property purchased on hand to show for itself and to speak
for itself. Suppose the professors provided for in the bill should gather
a little circle of pupils, each of whom should carry off with him some
small quotient of navigation, or horticulture, or rural economy, and the
fund should thus glide away and evaporate in such insensible, inappre-
ciable appropriations, how little there would be to testify of it!, Whereas
here all the while are the books; here is the value; here is the visible
property ; here is the oil and here is the light. There is something to
point to, if you should be asked to account for it unexpectedly, and
something to point to if a traveler should taunt you with the collections
which he has seen abroad, and which gild and recommend the absolut-
isms of Vienna or St. Petersburgh. * * *

“But the decisive argument is, after all, that it is an application the
most exactly adapted to the actual literary and scientific wants of the
States and the country. I have said that another college is not needed
here because there are enough now, and another might do harm as much
as good. But that which is wanted for every college, for the whole
country, for every studious person, is a well-chosen library, somewhere
among us, of three or four hundred thousand books.”

Mr. Tappan, in reply, urged that Smithson’s own habits and pursuits
should be considered ; that it must be remembered that he was an emi-
nently practical philosopher, intimately acquainted with chemistry, min-
eralogy, geology, and natural history, to the minute study of which he
devoted his life. His favorable resort had been the Jardin des Plantes,
at Paris, and there could be but little doubt that in making his bequest.
he had in view the establishment of a similar institution. He depre-
cated the outlay of a large amount in the purchase of books, and as-
serted that they not only did not promote knowledge, but that one-half
of those then in the Library of Congress were to be considered as trash.

Mr. Levi Woodbury, of New Hampshire, favored the employment of
lecturers, and the purchase of a moderate-sized library, but preferred
that the management of the bequest should be intrusted to the National
Institute, a society already in active operation, created by Congress, and
the objects of which were appropriate to the trust.

Mr. John J. Crittenden, of Kentucky, thought the purchase of books
should be confined to works on science and the arts. Mr. James A.
Pearce, of Maryland, concurred in the views of Mr. Choate. Mr. Wm.

}. Rives, of Virginia, believed that by knowledge was not merely meant
the natural sciences, astronomy, mathematics, &c.; he considered the
most important of all the branches of human knowledge that which re-
lated to the moral and political relations of man. The field of moral
science also embraced a much larger portion of knowledge than the
physical sciences. He suggested the “ Faculty of letters and sciences”
under the auspices of the University of France, as a much better model
for the Smithsonian than the Jardin des Plantes. Te remarked that it
was his “firm and solemn conviction that we now haye it in our power
JAMES SMITHSON AND HUIS BEQUEST. 181

to do more good to this nation in our day and generation, by a judicious
and wise application of this $500,000 which has been put into our hands,
than by the application of the twenty-five or thirty millions we are in the
habit of annually appropriating.”

Mr. Choate’s amendments were adopted by the Senate and the bill
recommitted to be more fully matured. It was again reported to the
Senate on the 2d of January, including Mr. Choate’s plan of a great
library. Mr. Woodbury endeavored again to place the Institution under
the management of the National Institute, but was opposed by Senators
Buchanan, Choate, and Tappan, on the ground that it was anti-republi-
can and anti-democratic to surrender all control by the people’s repre-
sentatives in respect to a trust committed to their custody for the people’s
benefit, and to place it in the hands of a close body wholly irresponsible
to either Congress or the people.

Mr. Woodbury replied with warmth that his plan, instead of being
antagonistic to Congress, made it more in subordination to it, and placed
stronger safeguards against any possible departure from its commands
or wishes. He also believed that it would be placing a burden on the
Institute rather than conferring a favor upon it.

Mr. Buchanan “could imagine no other mode of using the fund” to
advantage, than “the purchase of a great library,” and strongly op-
posed any connection with the National Institute.

Mr. William Allen, of Ohio, expressed his opposition to “any plan
whatever for connecting anything called an institution with the public
treasury.” He had never known a single instance of a fund of money,
charitable or otherwise, being intrusted to the care of an incorporated
body of men “that was not squandered and made to fall short of the
object of the donor.” He wished to see no institution established in the
capital of the United States to teach the American people how to think,
and read, and speak, and he therefore opposed the whole project.

Mr. Robert J. Walker, of Mississippi, defended the National Institute
against the attacks made upon it; showed that it was worthy of and
had received the greatest encouragement and most general favor, and
claimed that an institution bearing the name of a foreigner never could
concentrate in the same degree the affections and confidence of the
American people.

After some further debate the bill was laid over for several days, but
was taken up and passed on the 23d of January, 1845. When it reached
the House, a substitute was offered for it by Mr. Robert Dale Owen, of
Indiana; but in the hurry of a short session of Congress the whole
matter was left undisposed of.

On the opening of the'Twenty-ninth Congress, Mr. Owen again
offered his bill to establish the Smithsonian Institution, and it was
referred to a select committee of seven members, viz, Messrs. Owen, of
Indiana, John Q. Adams, of Massachusetts, Timothy Jenkins, of New
182 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

York, George P. Marsh, of Vermont, Alexander D. Sims, of South Car-
olina, Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, and David Wilmot, of Pennsyl-
Vania.

On the 28th of February, 1846, Mr. Owen, from this select committee,
reported an elaborate bill embracing the principal features of Mr. Tap-
pan’s bill of the last session, but adding a section providing for a normal
branch to give such a thorough scientific and liberal course of instruc-
tion as may be adapted to qualify young persons as teachers of our
common schools and to qualify students as teachers or professors of the
more important branches of natural science. A library was to be pro-
cured composed of valuable works pertaining to all departments of
human knowledge. Special reference was to be made by the professors
to the increase and extension of scientific knowledge generally, by ex-
periment and research. Essays, pamphlets, magazines, manuals, tracts
on science, history, chemistry, school-books, apparatus, &c., were au-
thorized.

In advocating this bill Mr. Owen made a very able and impressive
speech, and one of the most memorable occurring in the discussion of
the subject of the disposition of the bequest. He condemned the dila-
toriness of Congress in waiting for ten years, after solemnly accepting
the trust, without doing anything whatever to carry out the intention
of the donor.

“Small encouragement,” he remarked, ‘is there, in such tardiness as
this, to others, as wealthy and as liberalas Smithson and Girard, to follow
their noble example! Small encouragement to such men to entrust to
our care bequests for human improvement! Due diligence is one of the
duties of a faithful trustee. Has Congress, in its conduct of this sacred
trusteeship, used due diligence? Have its members realized, in the
depths of their hearts, its duties and their urgent importance? Or has
not the language of our legislative action rather been but this: ‘The
Smithsonian fund! Ah, true! That’s well thought of. One forgets
these small matters.’”

Mr. Owen reviewed all the legislative proceedings in relation to the
subject, the various plans brought forward from time to time for adop-
tion by Congress, and called attention to the fact that the object for which
Mr. Adams had labored with so much zeal and perseverance—an astro-
nomical observatory—had already been established in Washington. He
then made an elaborate reply to Mr. Choate’s arguments in favor of a
ereat library. He admitted that “in books exists the bygone world. By
books we come in contact with the mankind of former ages. By books
we travel among ancient nations, visit tribes long since extinct, and are
made familiar with manners that have yielded, centuries ago, to the
innovating influences of time.” He would go as far as the farthest in
his estimate of the blessings which the art of printing had conferred
upon man; but such reasoning had no relation to the proposal eim-
braced in Mr. Choate’s scheme.
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 183

“Tt substantiates not at all the propriety ofspending half a million, or
two or three half millions of dollars to rival the bibliomaniacs of Paris
and of Munich.

‘* Books are like wealth. An income we must have to live; a certain
amount of income to live in comfort. Beyond a certain income the
power of wealth to purchase comfort, or even wholesome luxury, ceases
altogether. How much more of true comfort is there in a fortune of a
million of dollars than in one of fifty, or say a hundred thousand? If
more there be, the excess is hardly appreciable; the burden and cares
of a millionaire outweigh it tenfold. And _ so, also, of these vast and
bloated book-gatherings that sleep in dust and cobwebs on the library
shelves of European monarchies. Up to a judicious selection of thirty,
fitty, a hundred thousand volumes, if you will, how vast, yea, how
priceless, is the intellectual wealth! From one to five hundred thou-
sand, what do we gain? Nothing? That would not be true. A goblet
emptied into the Pacific adds to the mass ofits waters. But if, within
these limits, we set down one book out of a hundred as worth the money
it costs, we are assuredly making too liberal an estimate.

“Our librarian informs me that the present Congressional library
(certainly not one of the most expensive,) has cost upwards of three dol
lars a volume; its binding alone has averaged over a dollar a volume.
The same works could be purchased now, it is true, much more cheaply;
but, on the other hand, the rare old books and curious manuscripts
necessary to complete a library of the largest class would raise the
average. Assuming, then, the above rate, a rival of the Munich library
would cost us a million and a half of dollars; its binding alone would
amount to a sum equal to the entire Smithsonian fund as originally
remitted to us from England.

_ “And thus not only the entire legacy, which we have promised to ex-
pend so that it shall increase and diffuse knowledge among men, is to
be squandered in this idle and bootless rivalry, but thousands on thou-
sands must be added to finish the work ; from what source to be derived,
let its advocates inform us. And when we have spent thrice the amount
of Smithson’s original bequest on the project, we shall have the satisfac-

‘tion of believing that we may possibly have saved to some worthy
scholar a hundred, or perchance a few hundred, dollars, which otherwise
he must have spent to obtain from Europe half a dozen valuable works
of reference !”

The most important feature of Mr. Owen’s bill was however con-
sidered by him to be the provision for normal-school instruction. He
maintained it to be the duty of Congress to elevate to the utmost the
character of our common schools. The normal branch was not intended
by him to take the place of similar institutions in the States; it would
be supplemental to these, but of a higher grade, and would enable young
persons who had passed through the former to perfect themselves in
“the most useful of all modern sciences—the humble yet world-subduing
184 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

science of primary education.” It would also be the place where we
might hope to find trained, competent, and enlightened teachers for the
State normal schools.

He also specially urged the importance of scientific researches.

“In these,” he said, ‘Smithson spent the greater part of his life.
And it cannot be doubted that were he yet alive and here to-day to ex-
plain his wishes, original researches in the exact sciences would be de-
clared by him a part of his plan. With the knowledge of his life and
favorite pursuits before us, and the words of his will specifying the’ in-
crease as well as the diffusion of knowledge for our guide, it seems
nothing less than an imperative duty to inelude scientific research
among the objects of a Smithsonian Institution.”

Mr. George W. Jones, of Tennessee, made himself conspicuous on
this, as on many other occasions, by bitter opposition to the adoption of
any plan for the organization of the Institution. He believed that the
whole matter was wrong; that the government had no right to accept of
the trust, and he proposed that the whole fund, in whatever form it
might be, whether money or State bonds, should be returned to any of
the heirs-at-law or next of kin of Mr. Smithson. He maintained that—

“Tt was neither the right, the power, or the true policy of the gov-
ernment to attempt to rear upon the city of Washington an institution
for the education of school teachers, agricultural professors, &ec., to
send out into the country. . . . Every measure of this kind had
the tendency to make the people throughout the country look more to
this great central power than to the STATE governments.”

Mr. Joseph R. Ingersoll, of Pennsylvania, favored the bill of Mr. Owen,
and ridiculed the idea of Mr. Jones of returning the money to England.
He thought that a great library was not desirable, and said that the
necessary building to contain the greatest library in the world would in
its own erection exhaust the entire bequest. The Capitol itself would
not contain eight hundred thousand volumes so properly arranged as to
be accessible. A library was not the object of Smithson. A plan should
be adopted to cover general ground, in which all objects of science
should be included. He favored that part of the bill providing for nor-
mal instruction, and would add an appropriation for defraying the ex-
pense of the delivery of lectures by our most distinguished men at dif-
ferent points throughout the country for scientific instruction.

Mr. Frederick P. Stanton, of Tennessee, in a brilliant and eloquent ad-
dress to the House, supported the bill in its present form. He maintained
that it was the result of the conflicting opinions of wise and experi-
enced men, harmonized by comparison, discussion, and mutual conces-
sion. He dwelt at length on the importance of advancing science, the
value of experimental research and observation; explained and advo-
vated every section of the bill, and concluded by saying: “By proper
management this institution may doubtless be made the instrument of
immense good to the whole country. To the government it will be of no
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 185

slight advantage. It will be a great institution. It may attain a char-
acter as highas that of the French Academy, and its authority will then
be decisive in reference to numerous questions of a scientific nature con-
tinually presented to the committees of Congress and the departments
of government for determination and consequent action. Such an insti-
tution is greatly needed in the federal city.”

Mr. William Sawyer, of Ohio, wanted students to be sent to the Tustitn-
tion selected from is various States and Territories according to the
rat of representation in Congress. He also thought the rate of inter-
est on the fund should be five instead of six per cent.

Mr. D. P. King, of Massachusetts, favored a provision by which stu-
dents could be educated free of expense, and pay their board by labor on
a farm connected with the establishment.

Mr. Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, advocated the bill as providing for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. It was too late to
make the objection that the trust ought not to have been accepted. It
was our duty to carry it into execution; and as to the fund, it ought to
be considered as money still in the Treasury, unconnected with any in-
vestment the officers of the government may have made. He regarded
lectures as the greatest means of extending knowledge which had been
adopted in modern times. It was second only to the invention of the
art of printing. He would admit that the government had no authority
to take charge of the subject of education, but he did not consider this
bill as liable to that objection. The normal school system he considered
as highly beneficial, serving to produce uniformity in the language, and
to lay the foundation of all sciences. The spelling-book of Noah Web-
ster, which had been used extensively in our primary schools, had done
more to produce uniformity in our language in this country than anything
else. If we sent out good school-books from this institution, it would be
of vast service to the country. He enlarged upon the benefits which
would result to science and the diffusion of every kind of useful knowl-
edge from an institution which would gather young men from the remotest
parts of the country at the common point where every facility for practical
instruction would be afforded. The taste of the country would be re-
fined, and he did not consider this as anti-democratic. Knowledge was
the common cement that was to unite all the heterogeneous materials of
this Union into one mass, like the very pillars in the hall of the House
before them

Mr. Geo. P. Marsh, of Vermont, said that whatever plan was adopted
must of necessity be one of compromise, and that though he would have
preferred the Senate bill for a library, yet he would cheerfully accede to
the present one as proposed to be mpdiaedt He regarded it as an ex-
periment which admitted, and which he trusted would hereafter receive,
great changes in its conditions rather than as a complete working model.
Two objects were aimed at by Smithson: first, the inerease of knowl-
edge—its enlargement, extension, progress; second, the diffusion of
186 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

knowledge—its spread, communication, dissemination. Of the various
instrumentalities for carrying out this noble and imposing scheme, he
considered as the simplest and most efficient the collection for public
use of a library, a museum, and a gallery of art, and he preferred that
for a reasonable period the entire income of the fund should be expended
in this way. While appreciating the value of research and experiment
in natural knowledge and the economic arts, and including them in the
plan of a great national institution for the promotion of all good learn-
ing, he dissented from the doctrine implied by the bill, which confined
all knowledge, all science, to the numerical and quantitative values of
:aterial things.

“Geology, mineralogy, even chemistry, are but assemblages of appar-
ent facts, empirically established, and this would always be true of every
study which rests upon observation and experiment alone. True science
is the classification and arrangement of necessary primary truths accord-
ing to their relations with each other and in reference to the logical de-
ductions which may be made from them. Such science, the only abso-
lute knowledge, is the highest and worthiest object of human inquiry,
and must be drawn from deeper sources than the crucible and the re-
tort. A laboratory is a charnel-house; chemical decomposition begins
with death, and experiments are but the dry bones of science. It is the
thoughtful meditation alone of minds trained and disciplined in far other
halls that can clothe these with flesh and blood and sinews, and breathe
into them the breath of life.”

Mr. Marsh then showed the importance and value of a great library,
and gave illustrations from his extensive knowledge of the libraries in
Europe.

My. Isaac EK. Morse, of Louisiana, was of the opinion that Smithson
was a practical man, and that, although possessed of the highest learn-
ing, he condescended to devote his time to subjects of the most domes-
tic and homely character. If his intention had been to establish a .ni-
versity or a magnificent library, and thus to have his name transmitted
to posterity, it would have been easy for him to have said so, and noth-
ing would have been left to this country but to carry out his enlightened |
and liberal intentions. But he had no doubt studied the peculiar char-
acter of the American people, and discovered that while they enter-
tained a proper respect for the learning and genius of the German uni-
versities and of the sciences taught in the schools of Europe, still there
was something in the common sense and practical knowledge of our
people which comported with his own notions; and he desired that his
money should be devoted to diffusing practical and useful knowledge
among them. Mr. Morse then introduced a new bill as a substitute
for that under discussion, providing mainly that “an offer be made
through the newspapers of the United States and Europe of suitable
rewards or prizes for the best written essay on ten subjects, the most
practical and useful of which should be printed and widely distributed,”
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 187

thus fulfilling, in the letter and spirit, the wise and comprehensive in-
tentions of the donor for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.

Mr. John 8. Chipman, of Michigan, spoke earnestly in opposition to
the bill. He thought that our great and powerful government, prosper-
ing and progressing as it was in original native intellect, fostered by
institutions known to no other country and no other people, should not
have consented to be the recipient of what was called a muniticent do-
nation of half a million from an Englishman to enlightened American
republicans in this country. ‘ How did it happen,” he exclaimed, ‘that
this government accepted such a boon from a foreigner—an Englishman
too!”

After further debate, Mr. Adams moved that until the arrears of inter-
est due from the States in which the money of Smithson had been in-
vested were paid, no appropriation should be made by Congress for the
fulfillment of the purposes prescribed by the testator.

Mr. A. D. Sims, of South Carolina, thought that he saw in the will of
Smithson only what he had observed in other instances. “After having
griped through their lives every shilling that came into their hands,
animated at last by some posthumous vanity, they sought to build up a
name which should live after them ; and such, rather than any feeling for
humanity, was the motive that guided them.” He then proceeded to
contend that the Government of the United States was not instituted
for any such purpose as the administration of charities. He would in-
troduce a bill repealing all laws heretofore enacted on this subject and
giving authority and direction for the restoration of the money to the
British chancery, where it could be devoted to purposes in England sim-
ilar to those which had been contemplated in the city of Washington.
The only difference would be in the location of the institution.

Mr. Adams proceeded to explain and advocate his substitute, and main-
tained that in the administration of this fund there were two or three
principles that should be observed. One was, that it should never cost
the people of the United States a dollar—that it should support itself;
another, that no part should ever be applied to the ordinary purposes
of education. It was unworthy the people of the United States to re-
ceive foreign aid for this purpose. There was no way in which the States
could more degrade themselves than by relying on foreign aid or on the
General Government for the education of their children.

‘‘But an experience of eight or ten years, since we received this
money, had shown him that whenever distinguished scientific men were
called upon for their opinions, scarcely two agreed.

“In addition to the application of a certain part of this fund to the sci-
ence of astronomy, there was another provision which he found, and
which he was happy to see this bill made, viz, that no portion of the
fund should be appropriated—that it should be a perpetual fund. It
was the interest which was to be applied.
188 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

“But in the mean time, while this delay had taken place, he was de-
lighted that an astronomical observatory—not perhaps so great as it
should have been—had been smuggled into the number of the institu-
tions of the country under the mask of a small depot for charts, &e.

“ He claimed no merit for the erection of the astronomical observa-
tory; but in the course of his whole life no conferring of honor, of in-
terest, of office, had given him more delight than the belief that he had
contributed, in some small degree, to produce these astronomical observ-
atories, both here and elsewhere. He no longer wished any portion of
Smithson’s fund applied to an astronomical observatory.

‘¢ Nor did he think it important to the people that any provision of this
bill should be carried into effect immediately, but rather that measures
should be taken to induce the States to pay the interest on their bonds,
and then let the money be appropriated to any purpose on which Congress
could agree more unanimously than on this bill.”

Mr. Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, was opposed to taking any
money out of the Treasury of the United States to establish such an
institution.

Mr. George Rathbun, of New York, did not feel disposed to object to
any plan with seeming plausibility. He was in favor of expending the
money in some way and upon some scheme, faithfully and honestly, but,
above all, he was in favor of appropriating the money whether the final
result should be good or not. He wished to wipe out the stain which
rested on the character of this Government of withholding the money
because we were not able to discover the best mode of expending it.
In his judgment, a library was the least plausible of any of the schemes
proposed.

Mr. Orlando B. Ficklin, of [linois, opposed the bill. He thought
however that the good faith of the Government required that this
money should be considered as being in the Treasury, and that we could
not excuse ourselves by saying that the fund had been loaned out to
the States and could not now be realized. He objected, however, to the
connection proposed to be established between this institution and the
United States Treasury. A million of dollars would be required to meet
the deficiency in this Smithsonian bequest. He was willing to expend
the money for a library, and for scientific apparatus, or for any plan by
which the fund could be disconnected from the Government. He regarded
Mr. Owen’s bill as one of the most odious and abominable ever pre-
sented, and he would rather see this half million returned to the British
court of chancery, or ten millions sunk to the bottom of the Potomac,
than to have this bill pass.

Mr. Allen G. Thurman, of Ohio, made inquiries respecting the orig-
inal investment of the fund, and then discussed the duties of a trustee.
He could not vote for the bill unless it were most materially changed.
He was opposed to the erection of an immense institution at the city of
Washington, that would ultimately become a charge upon the Treasury

and would necessarily be partial in its operations and benefits. He was
inclined to favor the library plan, although there were great objections
to it. But “there was one recommendation it possessed that strongly
influenced him. That was, that though it might not effect the greatest
amount of benefit that could be produced by the fund, it was not liable
to the abuses to which all the other plans would probably give rise. It
would create no large body of office-holders, no patronage, no favorit-
ism, no partially sectional advantages.”

Mr. Owen replied to Mr. Adams, and showed that the position of the
latter as to the condition of the fund was entirely inconsistent with the
reports and bills he had so often presented. He was not specially wed-
ded to the feature of normal schools, although he believed it was the
most important one in the bill. As to the disgrace of educating our
children with foreign aid, there was no proposition in this bill to educate
children, but the teachers of children. And as to disgrace, it might be
said with equal propriety that it was disgraceful to receive foreign aid
for founding a library.

Mr. Andrew Johnson renewed his attack on the bill:

“There was something a little farcical and amusing [to him] in this
system of normal instruction, which was to provide the country with
school teachers. He would like to see a young man, educated at the
Smithsonian Institution and brought up in all the extravagance, folly,
aristocracy, and corruption of Washington, go out into the country to
teach the little boys and girls to read and write! Those young men, so
educated, would steal, or play the little pettifogger, sooner than become
teachers. Ninety-nine out of a hundred of those who received the ben-
efit of this institution would hang about a law-ofiice, get a license, become
a pack of drones instead of schoolmasters. Washington City was not
a place for such an institution. He believed that it would result in an
injury to the country instead of a benefit.”

Mr. John Bell, of Tennessee, held that the United States was respon-
sible for the fund and ought to appropriate it for its object. He hoped
that Arkansas would one day pay the money, but he feared it would be
a distant day. Itwas necessary toact now. He did not wholly approve
of the bill reported, but he would take it rather than do nothing.

Mr. Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine, regarded this fund as one which had
been received by the Government to carry out the intentions of Mr.
Smithson, and to which, by their acceptance, they had solemnly bound
themselves. He alluded to the difficulty—nay, the impossibility—of any
select committee agreeing upon a plan which, in all its details, should
be in accordance with the views of all. Notwithstanding this, he trusted
we should not let this opportunity go by to make a commencement in
this matter. He had not the slightest doubt of the full and unqualified
power of this Government to take charge of this money and give it the
direction required by the will of Mr. Smithson.

While there were features in the bill with which he was not entirely
190 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

pleased, he should vote for the bill in case it was not amended. But
there were some amendments to the bill of the gentleman from Indiana
[Mr. Owen] to which he would fain hope that gentleman himself would
lend a favorable ear. One related to the appropriation of a part of it
to the science of agriculture. He referred to the general and deplorable
want of information of the components of the soil, the proper mode of
treating it, the proper adaptation of crops to different soils, &e., and said
he wished to see connected with this institution a department of agri-
cultural chemistry and a professor of agriculture proper.

Mr. Bradford R. Wood, of New York, said that if ever there was a
point in which the national honor was concerned, it was in carrying out
the intentions of the testator in his bequest. He considered it an honor
to the country that the subject of a monarchical government should
have selected this as the instrument of his expansive benevolence. He
thought normal instruction should be left to the States, but responded
heartily to Mr. Hamlin’s suggestion in relation to agricultural instrue-
tion. He would do all he could to increase and diffuse useful knowledge
among the masses, but this could not and would not be attained by such
education as would be obtained here, or by collecting at this point a
splendid library. The latter might, and unquestionably would, benefit
those already learned, but not the people.

Mr. William I’. Giles, of Maryland, proposed an amendment, provid-
ing for the publication and distribution of books for the instruction of
the blind.

Mr. W. W. Wick, of Indiana, discussed the duties of a trustee, and
took the ground that the Government of the United States had no dis-
cretion in this case as to the mode of investment of the funds. There
was no power given by the will of Smithson to invest the money in any
special manner, and the Government invested it at its own hazard. If,
of his own accord and without authority, a trustee made an investment,
he was responsible for it. Thus the United States stood in relation to
this matter, and to this extent they were responsible, if at all. The
honor of the country should be sustained by the faithful execution of
the trust.

Mr. Washington Hunt, of New York, entirely concurred with Mr.
Wick’s view of the subject. It was a reproach to the government to
delay carrying out the purposes of this trust.

At length, after a full and exhaustive debate for two days, the House
proceeded to vote on the bill and amendments. The normal school see-
tion was stricken out, on motion of Mr. Adams, by u vote of 72 to 42;
the provision for professors and lecturers by 77 to 42, as also that for
students. Mr. Jones’s amendment, to return the money to England,
received 8 votes in the affirmative to i115 in the negative. Mr. Adams’s
proposition, to defer the organization of the institution until the State
of Arkansas could be induced by “moral suasion to pay up its indebt-
edness for interest,” was voted down by 74 to 57. The provision for lee-
JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST. 191

tures was negatived by 72 to 39, while the annual appropriation for a
library was increased, on motion of Mr. Marsh, from $20,000 to $25,000.
The sections requiring experiment and research in agriculture, oreiniene -
tures, &c., the publication of books, pamphlets, tracts, &e., and the offer-
ing of prizes for essays, were stricken out. An amendment that all copy-
right books, maps, charts, prints, &c., should be delivered to the insti-
tution was adopted, and also one that the Government collections depos-
ited in it should be known as the National Museum.

Before a vote was taken on the bill as amended, a substitute for it
was introduced by Mr. William J. Hough, of New York, retaining most
of the features already agreed upon, and this was passed in the Com-
mittee of the Whole by a vote of 83 to 40. It was then reported to the
House, and passed by a vote of 85 to 76.*

Among the prominent men in the affirmative were John Q. Adams,
John Bell, Garret Davis, Jefferson Davis, Columbus Delano, Stephen
A. Douglas, Solomon Foot, Joshua R. Giddings, Hannibal Hamlin, H. W.
Hilliard, George Ee Marsh, %. D. Owen, F. P. Stanton, A. G. Thurman,
Samuel F. Vinton, David Wilmot.

Among the nays were Howell Cobb, R. M. T. Hunter, J. R. Ingersoll,
Andrew Johnson, George W. Jones, Preston King, Alexander H. Ste-
phens, and Jacob Thompson.

On the 10th of August, 1846, the Senate proceeded to consider this
bill; amendments proposed were disagreed to, and it passed without de-
bate by 26 to 13. The yeas were, Messrs. Archer, Atchison, Barrow,
Berrien, Cameron, Cilley, Thomas Clayton, John M. Clayton, Corwin,
Davis, Evans, Greene, Houston, Huntington, Jarnagin, Johnson of Ma-
ryland, Johnson of Louisiana, Lewis, Mangum, Miller, Morehead, Phelps,
Speight, Spurgeon, Upham, Webster.

Those who voted in the negative were, Messrs. Allen, Ashley, Ather-
ton, Bagby, Benton, Calhoun, Dickinson, Fairfield, McDufitie, Semple-
Turney, Westcott, Yulee.

The bill was signed by President James K. Polk on the 10th of Au-
gust, 1846, and became a law, and the Smithsonian Institution was or-
ganized under it with the following Board of Regents:

OBITUARY NOTICE OF JAMES SMITHSON.

(From the Gentleman’s Magazine. )

6 Oct. 1829.—Died: In the south of France, James Smithson, esq., M.
INE ARG SS

“The birth of this gentleman is thus described by himself at the com-
mencement of his will: ‘1, James Smithson, son of Hugh, first Duke of
Northumberland, and Elizabeth, heiress of the Hungertords of Studley,
and niece to Charles, the proud Duke of Somerset.’

‘Tt is well known that the wife of Hugh, tirst Duke of Northumber-
land, was Lady Elizabeth Seymour, grand- -daughter of the same ‘ proud
Duke of Somerset” It was the Hon. Frances Seymour, daughter of
Charles, Lord Seymour, of Troubridge, by his first marriage with Mary,
daughter and heiress of Thomas Smith, esq.—and thus half sister to the
fifth and sixth Dukes of Somerset, the latter of whom was ‘the proud
duke ’—that was married to Sir George Hungerford; but in the ac-
count of the family in Sir R. C. Hoare’s Hungerfordiana we find no
Elizabeth, nor the name of Macie, which was that which Mr. Smithson
originally bore. The family of Macie resided at Weston, near Bath.

“ James Louis Macie, esq. [the subject of the present notice], was a
member of Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was created M. A.
May 26, 1786. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1787,
and appears under the same name in the Philosophical Transactions for
1791; but between that date and 1803 he chose to change his name to
Smithson, although he continued to enjoy the property of the Macies.
He was, we believe, at one time a vice-president of the Royal Society.”*

NOTE 2.
ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND.
(Father of James Smithson.)

“Sir Hugh Smithson was one of the handsomest men in England.
He possessed much talent, a highly-cultured intellect, and more ‘learn.
ing than is generally found among the nobility. His parents, though
of gentle blood, did not belong to “the nobility. He had raised himself
by his marriage with the heiress to the name and fortune of the house
of Perey, and he showed that he was worthy of both.”

[His matrimonial alliance had somewhat of a romantic origin. Sir

Hugh had been unsuccessful in a first courtship, and the story of his
disappointment reached the ears of Lady Hlizabeth Seymour, only
daughter of Algernon Seymour, Baron Percy, who was at that time con-
sidered, on accBunt of her birth, wealth, and beauty, the greatest prize
in the kingdom. Lady Perey expressed to some of her friends ‘surprise
that any woman should have reiused the hand of such a man as Hugh
Smithson.’ These words soon became known to the rejected baronet,
and wrought a change in his feelings and aspirations. He became the
suitor of the fair and noble heiress, and married her on the 16th of July,
1740. |

‘‘ By his wise economv he improved the immense estates of this family,
and increased their value to such an extent that the revenues from them
amounted to over forty thousand pounds. He re-established the old
grandeur of the Pereys by his taste and splendor. The castle of
Alnwick, the former residence of the Earls of Northumberland, was en-
tirely ruined. He rebuilt it, and to please the duchess, his wife, he orna-
mented it in the Gothic style, which he himself did not admire; but he
exercised so much taste that he made the castle one of the most mag-
nificent buildings of this kind to be found anywhere in Europe. He
improved Sion, a country-house in the environs of London; and he ex-
hausted the resources of all the arts, and of unusual wealth, to fill these
two mansions with master-pieces of good taste, and to render them
worthy of their possessors. He was created an earl, had the order of the
Garter conferred on him, and was afterwards appointed viceroy of Ire-
land; finally, he was raised to the rank of a duke, and upheld these high
positions by an expenditure unequaled at that time.

“The Duchess of Northumberland was of the very highest birth, de-
scending from Charlemagne through Joscelin de Louvain, who had mar-
ried Agnés de Perey in the year 1168. She brought to her husband, as
her marriage portion, several peerages, the name and coat-of-arms of the
Pereys, and an immense income. She was very high-minded, and of a
natural and easy disposition; she was very good-hearted and charitable;
above all, she was truly attached to her friends, whom she distinguished
and served whenever an opportunity offered.

“The duke was fond of arts and sciences, so [entered into his tastes,
discussing all these subjects with him, in which he found that I was
well versed, and that he could converse with me on more topics than
with any one else. The duchess, on the contrary, had a predilection for
little ‘jeux @esprit’ in the company of friends, and she found amusement
in gathering together engravings, medals, and in collecting a variéty of
other things. I joined in these pursuits as if I had made them the busi-
ness of my previous life. Inthe evening I took part in her social games,
and made myself useful to her in her amusements, the only interruption
to my attentions being a short trip to Paris.” *

From the Gentleman’s Magazine for July, 1786, we also learn that
“The establishment of his Grace was as magnificent as it was possible
for any English nobleman’s to be. He had at all times three mansion-
houses—and of late four—in occasional use. He spent immense sums
in different sorts of very costly decorations ; pictures by every master ;
gardening by Browne; buildings by Adams. . . . More than fifteen

years ago he was able to purchase the property on which Lord Perey
had his seat, in Yorkshire; and a few years ago, the mansion, manors,
and boroughs of Humphrey Morice, in the West, all were sold to the
Duke. In “short, the rental, with the dukedom, he left at about 50,000
pounds, and to his second son 10,000 pounds perannum. The duke had
negotiated a further improvement of the Northumberland estate, but
did not live to see it completed.”*

On the death of the Duke of Northumberland, the following obituary
notice was given in the same magazine:

“June 6,1786. At eight o’clock this morning, died at Sion House,
in his 74th year, the Most Noble Hugh, Duke and Earl of Northumber-
land, Earl Percy, Baron W arkworth and Louvaine, Lord Lieutenant
and Custos Rotulorum of the counties of Middlesex’ and Northumber-
land, and of the town and county of Neweastle-upon-Tyne, Knight of
the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and Baronet ; who with a princely
sor tune sustained his exalted rank’ through life with the greatest dig-
nity, generosity, and splendor, and will ever be considered as one of the
first characters of that age of which he constituted so distinguished an
ornament. We are well informed that his annual income was not less
than 45,000 1. per annum. His Grace’s extensive charities to the poor,
his Concent encouragement of literature and the polite arts, and his
generous patronage of every kind of merit, make his death truly a
public loss, and will cause it to be long and sincerely lamented. His
Grace was the son of Langdale Smithson, esq., and Philadelphia,
daughter of W. Reveley, esq., of Newby, co. York. Upon the death of
his grandfather (Sir Hugh Smithson, of Stanwick, Bart.), which hap-
pened. in 1729, he succeeded to the title of baronet t, and to his grand-
father’s estate: and upon the de’th of his relation Hugh Smithson, esq.,
of Tottenham, he came into the possession of other estates in Yorkshire
and Middlesex ; and also succeeded his relation as knight of the shire
for the county of Middlesex, which he represented in three parliaments.
Upon the death of his father-i in-law, Algernon, Duke of Somerset, whose
daughter he had married, he succeeded to the title of Earl of Nor thum-
berland, the Duke having been created Earl of Northumberland upon
his daughter’ S marriage, with remainder to her husband, and their issue,
after the Duke’s death. The reason of this creation was as follows:
The Duke’s mother (whose third husband was the Duke’s father) was
daughter and sole heiress of Joscelin, the last Earl of Northumber ee
which title was become extinct. Being so great an heiress she wa
married three times while a minor. First, to the Earl of Ogle, ae
died in a short time after, leaving no issue. She was next married to
Thomas Thynne, esq., of Longle: ite, co. Wilts, but he was assassinated
in Pall Mall by some ruffians hired by Count Coningsmarck, whose
object was to marry the widow. Her third husband was the Duke of
Somerset, and she was still a minor,as was also the Duke, by whom she
had the above Algernon, who succeeded his father as Duke of Somerset,
and possessed all “the Perey estates. He married Miss Thynne, gre de
daughter of the first Lord W eymouth, and by her had one son aud one
dau ehter. The son died unmarried, and the daughter Teed in 1740

erset going to another branch of the Seymour family, the title of North-
umberland was revived to the Duke’s daughter in consideration of her

descent from the daughter of Joscelin the last Earl of Northumberland.
The Perey estate also settled in her, together with several baronies,
such as Percy, Lucy, Poynings, Fitz-Payne, Bryan, &c. The Duke of
Somerset dying in 1750 Sir Hugh Smithson immediately took his seat
in the House of Lords as Earl of Northumberland. In 1752 he was
appointed one of the Lords of the Bed-chamber to the late King. In
1757 he was installed Knight of the Garter at Windsor. In 1762 he
was appointed Lord Chamberlain to the Queen, and a Privy Counsellor ;
also Lord Lieutenant of the counties of Middlesex and Northumberland.
In 1763 he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In 1766 he was
created Duke of Northumberland. In 1778 his Grace was appointed
Master of the Horse, which he resigned in 1781. On Dee. 5th, 1776,
which was her birthday, his Duchess died, when she had completed her
sixtieth year. She was interred in her family vault in St. Nicholas
chapel, Westminster Abbey. They had two sons and one daughter.”*
The funeral of the Duke of Northumberland, whose death occurred ten
years later, was celebrated with great pomp on the 21st of June, 1756,
and his remains were also interred in Westminster Abbey with the fol-
lowing imposing list of titles and dignities inscribed on his coffin.

of Northumberland. This son was born August 25, 1742, and married,
in 1764, Anne, daughter of John, Earl of Bute, but had no issue. The
marriage was dissolved, by act of Parliament, in 1779, and in the same
year the duke married Miss Frances Julia Burrell, of Beckenham, Kent,
by whom he had five daughters and two sons.

Karl Percy, the second Duke of Northumberland, served in the Conti-
nental wars under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; came to Boston, 1774
in charge of a brigade; commanded the re- enforcements at the battle of
Lexington, April 19, 1775; and led the column that reduced Fort Wash-
ington, at King’s Bridge, n near New York, November 16, 1776. He re-
turned to England in May, 1777, devoted himself to improving his estates,
died July 10, 1817, and was buried with great pomp in Westminster
Abbey.

Of this Earl Perey an oil portrait has recently been presented to the
town of Lexington, Massachusetts, by his grandnephew, Algernon
George, the sixth and present Duke of Northumberland. The presenta-
tion was made through the Rev. Edward G. Porter, of Lexington, who
was a guest at the duke’s castle in 1879, and was permitted, during his
visit, to make extracts from the Percy family papers, especially from the
letters written home by Earl Perey during his American experiences.
In one of these letters, dated Boston, July 5, 1774, Perey told his parents
that the people were very hot-headed and that he feared trouble. On
the 27th of the same month he wrote that, owing to the absence of Gen-
eral Gage at Salem, he had been commander-i in-chief of the camp at
Boston. He also inclosed a view of the town of Boston and the camp,
and conveyed the information that the people say much and do nothing.
He advised a steadfast government, as the people are worthy subjects,
who talk as though they would wipe out the troops every night, but are
frightened to dez ith when they see them. Theclergy were spoken of as
teachers of sedition of the most virulent type. Another letter to his
father was dated August 15, 1774, and in this Percy described the scen-
ery around Boston as having the appearance of a park finely laid out.
This beauty he considered to be offset by the poverty of the soil, which,
in his opinion, was overtilled and scantily fertilized. In this lettersymp-
toms of trouble in the country were noted, and the writer professed his
determination to do his whole duty wherever he might be called upon to
serve rather than seek preferment where it might most easily be ob-
tained—at the Court of St. James. In a subsequent letter to General
Howe, at London, he wrote his serious apprehension of bloodshed and
his belief in the necessity of strong government. From the Congress at
Philadelphia he said he looked for either a wrangle among its members
or for the origin of serious business for the home @ government. To his
father, also, he wrote inthe same strain. On the 20th April, 1775, Perey
reported to General Gage about the march to Lexington. There, Percy
says, he met the troops retreating from Concord, and he ordered two
field- pieces to be trained upon the rebels {rom the heights. The shot from
the cannon dispersed them. As the British had but little ammunition,
and were fifteen miles from Boston, they were ordered by him to return.
They were pressed severely by the rebels until they reached Charles-
town, many men being killed. Perey attributed to the rebels cruelty
and barbarity, writing that they scalped and cut off the ears of the
wounded troops, showing that the British, too, believed that their oppo-
nents were cruel and barbarous. Perey, after this disastrous retreat,
was of the opinion that the colonists were not an irregular mob, but de-
termined men, accustomed to fight the French and the Indians. The
road to Charlestown, Karl Percy said, was taken for the retreat, as it
198 JAMES SMITHSON AND HIS BEQUEST.

was feared that the rebels, as they actually did, would have destroyed
the bridge over the Charles River. Ina letter referring to Bunker Hill,
Perey mentions the death of me Warren and that of Major Pite: airn,
While Percy was in America he was advanced in rank to be a lieutenant-
general, yet he was anxious to fies home, and he was allowed to do so
near the close of the war. He was the first to suggest making peace
with the colonists, and he was selected as minister plenipotentiary
to secure such an end. Owing to dissensions in the British cabinet, he
delined that honor and retired to private life.

NOTICES OF SMITHSON’S PAPERS,

On Tabasheer and Calamine.
(I. From the London Monthly Review.)

‘“ The first paper is an account of tabasheer, an article of importance
in the materia medica of the ancient Arabians, and still a medicine of
great note in many parts of the East, though neither the substance itself
nor its origin were known in the W ester n World. Dr. Russell ascer-

tained it to be a natural concretion from the juice of the bamboo cane,

and accordingly it is distinguished in different oriental languages by
names signifying bamboo milk, bamboo camphor, and salt of bamboo.
Dr. Russell had many green canes brought to him at Madras, and on
splitting them, found some joints full of a watery liquid, some with the
fluid much diminished and in different states of consistence, and others
with some grains or particles of tabasher, either loose, in which case
the reeds containing it are known by arattling sound on shaking them,
or adhering to the extremities or sides of the cavity. The quantity of
the tabasheer appears to be very inconsiderable, the whole produce of
twenty-eight reeds from five to seven feet long, not much exceeding two
drachms.”*

The following account of his paper in the Philosophical Transactions
is given in the Monthly Review for January, 1792, vol. vii, pp. 75, 76.

‘“ We have seen in a former paper that tabasheer is a vegetable pro-
duction, formed by spontaneous concretion from a fluid in the cavities
of the bamboo cane. Its chemical constitution, however, is very differ-
ent from what might be expected in a body of such an origin. The ex-
periments of Mr. Macie, very judiciously executed, and here stated in
detail, show it to be a siliceous earth, nearly the same thing with com-
mon flint that has been attenuated by artificial solution.

“ Neither water, alcohol, nor acids will act on it, but by imbibing

water it becomes tr ausparent ; the white bits ina low degree, the blui sh
nearly as much so as glass. lt dissolves (as the precipitate from liquor
silicum does) in caustic alealine lixivium; and the solution (like the
liquor silicum itself, or the precipitate redissolved) becomes gelatinous
on exposure to the atmosphere. In the fire it becomes harder, more
compact, and diminished in volume, without any loss of weight, except
of a little moisture, which it soon recovers from the air. With two-
thirds of its weight of fixed alkali, ina platina crucible, it ran into a trans-
parent glass ; phosphorated ammoniae and litharge readily acted on

it; borax more difficultly. It melted, also, at the blow-pipe, wheie the
ashes of the coal happened to touch it, or when rubbed over with calca-
reous earth; and this appears to be the only property in which it differs
materially from flint. This fusibility with calcareous e earth, and its con-
tracting and hardening in the fire, might lead us to suspect an admixture
of argillaceous earth; but no traces of that earth were discovered by the
usual process with vitriolic acid.

“The experiments from which these general results are extracted
were made on the finest tabasheer that could be purchased at Hydrabad.
Several other specimens were examined, and all the genuine sorts were
found to consist of the same earth. That which was taken immediately
from the cane became black in the fire from some admixture of vegeta-
ble matter, but as soon as the blackness disappeared it was in all re-
spects similar to the foregoing, so that the tabasheer of Hydrabad may
be presumed to have suffered a degree of calcination before its exposure

‘That a siliceous earth exists in vegetables is evident from their
ashes. Mr. Macie obtained a small portion of this earth from the ashes
of charcoal, but found it far more abundant in those of the bamboo
cane. He mentions a singular circumstance respecting this vegetable
which occurred after his experiments were finished :

‘A green bamboo cut in the hot-house of Dr. Pitcairn, at Islington,
was judg red to contain tabasheer in one of its joints from a rattling
noise discoverable on shaking it, but being split by Sir Joseph Banks,
it was found to contain not or rdinary tabasheer, but a solid pebble about
the size of half a pea, so hard as to cut elass.”

On the 18th of November, a paper, by James Smithson, esq., F. B.S.,
on the chemical analysis of some calamines, was read.

Much uneertainty has hitherto prevailed on the subject of the compo-
sition of calamines. The author was induced to carry on his researches
by the hopes of obtaining a more certain knowledge of these ores, and
he considers his results as fully proving the necessity for new investi-
gations, and that the opinions which had been adopted concerning them
were far removed from the truth. Mr. Smithson’s experiments were
made upon four different kinds of calamine: the calamine of Bleyberg,
that of Somersetshire, that of Derbyshire, and the electrical calamine.

The calamine from Bleyberg was white, and had a stalactitical form ;
its specific gravity was 3.584. It became yellow under the blowpipe ;
and when exposed to the heat of the interior blue flame was gradually
dissipated. It dissolved with effervescence in sulphuric acid, muriatic
acid, and acetous acid. It Jost by heat rather more than one- “fourth of
its weight. It afforded oxide of zine, carbonic acid, and water, in the
proportion of 714, 135, and 151; there was besides found in it a minute
portion of the -arbonates of lead and lime; but these the author con-
siders as accidentally mixed with the ore, and not in combination with
the other ingredients.

The calamine from Somersetshire was of amammillated form. Its color
was brown externally and greenish yellow internally ; its specific gravity
was 4.336. It dissolved in sulphurie acid, with effervescence: and when
analyzed by means of reé gents, afforded in 1,000 parts, 352 of carbonic
acid, and 648 of oxide of zine.

The Derbyshire calamine was in small crystals, of a pale yellow color ;
their specific gravity was 4.333. When analyzed, by solution in sul-

phurie acid, and the action of heat, 1,000 parts of them were found to
contain, of carbonic acid 348, of oxide of zine 652.

The electrical calamine, which Mr. Smithson examined, was from Reg-
bania, in Hungary. It was in the form of regular crystals; the specific
gravity of which was 3.454.

They became electrical by heat, and when exposed to the flame of the
blowpipe decrepitated and shone with a green light. The electrical cala-
mine differs materially in composition from the other specimens, in being
formed chiefly of quartz and oxide of zine, which, according to the author,
are in chemical union. One thousand parts of it gave 250 parts of quartz,
683 of oxide of zine, and 44 of water; the loss being 23 parts.

From his series of experiments on the calamines, Mr. Smithson has
been able to deduce, with a considerable degree of accuracy, the compo-
sition of sulphate of zine, which, when free from combined water, he
cousiders as composed of equal parts of sulphuric acid and oxide of zine.

In reasoning generally upon the constitution of salts of zine, Mr. Smith-
son offers some new observations in relation to affinity ; and he thinks
that the proximate constituent parts of bodies are not absolutely united
in the remote relations to each other, usually indicated by analyses, but
that they are universally very considerable parts of the compound, prob-
ably seldom less than 2. He applies this theory in accounting for the
presence of water in the calamine of Bleyberg, in which there is not suf-
ficient carbonic acid to saturate the oxide of zine; and he considers this
ore as probably composed of a peculiar combination of water with the
oxide of zine, which he names hydrate of zine, and of carbonate of zine
to each other in the proportions of 3 to 2.

All the calamines, when long exposed to the heat of the blowpipe, are
dissipated, with the production of white flowers. This circumstance,
the author thinks, ought not to be attributed to an immediate volatiliza-
tion of the oxide of zine, but rather to the deoxidation of this substance
by the charcoal and combustible matter of the flame, and the consequent
immediate sublimation and combustion of the metallic zinc, to which
tion of the oxide of zine, but rather to the deoxidation of this substance
by the charcoal and combustible matter of the flame, and the consequent
