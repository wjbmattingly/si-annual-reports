Resolved, That the income for the year 1883 be appropriated for the
service of the Institution upon the basis of the above report, to be ex-
pended by the Secretary with full discretion as to the items, subject to
the approval of the Executive Committee.

The Secretary stated that the bronze statue of Professor Henry, or-
dered by Congress from Mr. W. W. Story, had just been received, but that
owing to the condition of the weather, it was impossible to place it in
position at the present time. He suggested the propriety of deferring
the public unveiling of the statue until the next annual meeting of the
National Academy of Sciences in April. He also stated that Mr. Story
was now in the city, had examined the Smithsonian grounds, and fully
. approved of the site for the statue suggested by the Executive Com-
mittee.

On motion of General Sherman it was

Resolved, ‘That the 19th of April, 1883, be selected as the day for the
ceremony of unveiling the statue of Professor Henry, and that the
Congress of the United States, the Diplomatic Corps, the Executive

Departments, and the public generally be invited to be present.
XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

Dr. Maclean having called the attention of the Board to the fact that
the sundry papers of Professor Henry on scientific subjects had not
been published in the series issued by the Smithsonian Institution, it
was

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to have the scientific writ-
ings of Prof. Joseph Henry collected and published.

The Secretary presented his annual report of the operations, expendi-
ditures, and condition of the Institution for the year 1882.

On motion of Mr. Cox it was

Resolved, That the report of the Secretary be referred to the Execu-
tive Committee, with authority to transmit it to Congress.

The Secretary called attention to the importance of fire-proofing the
eastern portion of the Smithsonian building, especially as the supply of
water was now so scanty that none could be had above the basement
floor. The Committee on Appropriations of Congress had given assur-
ance that the necessary amount should be granted at the present session.

The Secretary also called attention to the growth of the Government
collections and the necessity for speedy action in relation to an addi-
tional building for the use of the Museum and the Geological Survey.
He presented the following bill, which had been introduced in the House
of Representatives, on the 10th of April, 1881, by Hon. Mr. Shallen-
berger, and was now before the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds.

FORTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS, First SEessron.—H. R. 5781.

A BILL for the erection of a fire-proof building on the south portion of the Smith-
sonian Reservation, for the accommodation of the United States Geological Survey,
and for other purposes.

Be rt enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of two hundred
thousand dollars be, and hereby is, appropriated, out of any money in
the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the erection of a fire-proof
building on the south portion of the Smithsonian Reservation, for the
accommodation of the United States Geological Survey, and for other
purposes: Provided, That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution be first obtained thereto, and that the building be under
their direction when completed : And provided further, That the building
be erected by the Architect of the Capitol, in accordance with plans
approved by the Director of the United States Geological Survey, the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the Architect of the Cap-
itol, acting as a board therefor.”

After a very full expression by the Regents in favor of immediate
action, on motion of General Sherman it was

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
recommend to Congress to enlarge the National Museum, so as properly
to exhibit the mineral, geological, and other collections already on hand
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. XIIT

and increasing each year, by the erection of a fire-proof building on the
southwest corner of the Smithsonian Reservation, similar in style to
the present National Museum; and they request an appropriation of
$300,000 therefor, to be expended under the direction of the Regents
of the Institution.

On motion of Dr. Gray it was

Resolved, That the Chancellor, General Sherman, and the Secretary
be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to act for and in the
name of the Board of Regents in carrying into effect the provisions of
any act of Congress which may be passed providing for the erection of
an additional building for the National Museum.

The Secretary informed the Board of the death of Miss Margaret
Connor, a lady who had been employed for fifteen years in the Institu-
tion, and recommended an allowance of one hundred dollars to defray
the expense of medical attendance and other expenses of her last illness,
which, on motion of Mr. Maxey, was agreed to.

The Board then adjourned to meet on the 19th of Aprit, 1883, to attend
the ceremonies of unveiling the statue of Professor Henry.

National Museum, making a total of 2,934 vouchers. All these bear the
approval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a certificate that the
materials and services charged were applied to the purposes of the
Institution or the Museum.

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1882.

To the Board of Regents:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith a report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
1882.

As in previous years, I propose to include in the present report, in
addition to matters pertaining strictly to the Institution, a brief account
of the operations of the National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnol-
ogy, which may be considered as part of the Smithsonian Institution,
as well as of the work of the United States Fish Commission, which is
under my charge.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

There are no specially distinctive or prominent facts to be mentioned
in connection with the work of the Institution and its collateral depart-
ments during the year 1882; although it may be said that, at no time,
has the establishment been in better condition, whether we take into
account the character of the work accomplished, the economy of expendi-
ture, or the satisfactory condition of its funds at the end of the year.

The publications of the Smithsonian Institution, or those made under
its direction, have been of average amount; the international exchanges
have been more than ever extensive and important; the scientific re-
searches.of the Institution have been extremely productive, while the
Museum has been enriched by a greater quantity of valuable material
than ever before.

THE HENRY STATUE.

I am happy to announce that the memorial statue of Professor Henry,
the construction of which, by Mr. W. W. Story, was authorized by
Congress on the 1st June, 1880, is finished, and in Washington. It was
hoped that it might be delivered in time to be in position by the end of
the year 1881. Owing, however, to certain imperfections found in the
Statue after being cast in bronze, it became necessary to reproduce it;
and it was not until the month of November, [1882,] that it was actually
completed and shipped.

H. Mis. 26——1
a REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ~*

The pedestal of the statue, which was made in the United States, was
delivered in the early part of the year, but the statue itself did not
arrive from Rome until the end of December. Itis hoped that the next
report to the Board will contain a notice of the successful erection of
this memorial.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The original law organizing the Smithsonian Institution provides for
vacancies of three members of the House and one member of the Sen-
ate at the end of each Congress, the successors to be appointed by the
Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, respectively, in
the ensuing December. Although no special provision is made for res-
ignations, it would of course naturally be inferred that an appointment
to a vacancy oi this kind should be for the period of the remainder of the
term of service of the former incumbent, as is the case in the United
States Senate. In fact, however, with some previous vacancies occur-
ring by death, or resignation of Senatorial position, the service was
continued for six years, and with a result that all the Senate regencies
became vacant at the same time. By the appointment, however, of
Senator Hoar, on the 2ist February, 1881, and of Senators Hill of (Colo-
rado) and Maxey (of Texas) on the 19th May, of the saine year, the nor-
mal term of service was re-established, with vacancies occurring at inter-
vals.of two years—the term of Senator Hoar expiring with his Senatorial
term, in March, 1883; of Senator Hill, in March, 1885; and of Senator
Maxey, in March, 1887.

The existing vacancies of the House members were filled by the ap-
pointment of Hon. N. C. Deering, of Iowa; Hon. E. B. Taylor, of Ohio;
and Hon. 8S. S. Cox, of New York.

The annual meeting of the Board was held on the 18th of January,
1882, and was attended by all the new regents. The Chief Justice, Mr.
Waite, referred to the loss the Institution and the whole country had
sustained in the untimely death of President Garfield, who had been
connected with the Board of Regents with but little ieee since
1863.

The committee having in charge the erection of the new building au-
thorized by Congress for the reception and exhibition of the collections
of the Government, made a report that the work had been completed in
a satisfactory manner and within the amount of the appropriation. The
thanks of the Board were voted to the committee for the able and sat-
isfactory manner in which it had discharged its duties.

The thanks of the Board were also tendered to General Montgomery
C. Meigs for his highly valued services as consulting engineer of the
National Museum Building Commission, in connection with the con-
struction of the fire-proof building for the Museum.

Authority was given to the Secretary and the executive committee to
apply to Congress for an appropriation to render the east range and

wing of the Smithsonian Institution fire-proof, in continuation of pre-
vious appropriations for the same purpose made and applied to the
main portion of the building.

FINANCES.

The report of the executive committee, which has just been presented
to you, presents the details of the financial condition of the Institution
proper, and a report upon the expenditure of items placed by Congress
under its direction. The sale of the Virginia bonds mentioned in the
last report is still believed to have been wise, and has removed all
source of anxiety as to the stability or amount of the funds permanently
invested from which a regular income could be depended on. With an
aggregate fund of $703,000 in the United States Treasury, the income
of the Smithsonian Institution amounts to $42,180. This, with a bal-
ance on hand at the beginning of the year, has furnished the fund from
which the expenses proper are paid. These are classified under the
several heads of building, general expenses, publications and researches,
and literary and scientific exchanges.

What has heretofore been a very great item of expense—from $9,000
to $11,000—connected with the international ~exchanges, has been
greatly reduced by the appropriation of Congress made specifically for
that purpose. This expenditure is either directly in the interest of
the country at large, or that of the Government bureaus and of the
Library of Congress, and it is, therefore, eminently proper that the
whole amount should be refunded. The Secretary of State has ac-
cordingly asked for an appropriation of $10,000 for the coming fiscal
year, instead of the $5,000, which is at present available. This saving
will enable the Institution to extend its labors liberally in the direction
of researches and publications, as well as be available for the unusually
heavy repairs required in connection with the Smithsonian building.’

After successive additions to the appropriation for a fire-proof building
of the National Museum the account has been finally closed by returning
$13.27 to the Treasury.

The available balance of the Smithsonian Institution for the expendi-
tures of the first half of the year 1882, according to the report of the
executive committee, amounts to $29,637.45.

BUILDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION.

Smithsonian Building.—No unusual expenditure has been required to
keep this edifice in good order, although a certain amount of wear and
tear has of course been necessarily provided for. Some important
changes have, however, been made, adding greatly to the facilities for
work. The entire basement has been putin thorough order; the floors,
walls, and ceilings covered with a thick coat of whitewash, answering
the double purpose of a sanitary protection and of increasing the
amount of light; the improvement in the latter respect being very
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

marked. The west basement, which has heretofore been occupied indis-
criminately for the preservation and elaboration of the collection of
birds and fishes, has been subdivided, and each subject confined strictly
to.its own section, much to the improvement of the service. An open-
ing has been made from the northwestern tower of the main building
into the second story of the adjacent corridor; and a stairway placed
in the tower, ascending from the basement to the level of the gallery of
the main hall, permits ready access between the three floors. The spe-
cial object of this was to give to the curators of fishes and marine inver-
tebrates an opportunity of using the galleries of the main hall in their
work of arrangement and cataloguing. The hall or corridor between
the main central room and the western or “pottery” room has been oc-
cupied by the collection of fishes, for which it was specially arranged.

At the last meeting of the Board the Secretary called attention to the
combustible and insecure condition of the eastern portion of the Smith-
sonian building, and presented plans, prepared at his request by the
architects, Messrs. Cluss & Schulze, which, without materially changing
the architecture of the building, would provide largely increased accom-
modations for offices and work-rooms, the storage of publications, the
exchange system, Xe.

The Board unanimously adopted a resolution instructing the Secretary
and executive committee to present the subject to Congress and request
an appropriation for the purpose. The Secretary, in accordance with
this instruction, sent the following letter on the 13th of March to the
Speaker of the House of Representatives :

“By instruction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, I have the honor to transmit to Congress the following
resolution adopted at the last meeting of the Board, January 11, 1882;
and, in doing so, beg that it be referred to the appropriate committee
of the House of Representatives and receive that attention which the
urgency of the case requires:

““¢ Resolved, That the Secretary and executive committee present a
memorial to Congress showing the importance and necessity of render-
ing the east wing of the Smithsonian building fire-proof, requesting an
appropriation therefor, and, if the means are furnished, to proceed with
the work.’

“Tt will be remembered that in January, 1865, a fire occurred in the
Smithsonian building, which destroyed a large portion of the main
edifice, with its adjacent towers, and a very large amount of valuable
public and private property.

“The main building was restored with fire-proof materials; but the
east wing, composed entirely of wood and plaster, and which had es-
caped injury, remains in its previous dangerous condition. Originally
a lecture room, it was fitted up many years ago with apartments for
the residence of the late Secretary and his family. This application of
the wing, however, was discontinued after Professor Henry’s death;
but the rooms thus set apart are entirely unsuited to the operations of
the establishment, and, while in every way objectionable, the timbers

have decayed, and no arrangements are provided for proper lighting,
heating, and ventilation.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

‘The main building and western extension are occupied by the col-
lections of the Government; the east wing embraces the offices of the
Secretary, chief clerk, corrresponding clerk, and registrar, and also ac-
commodations for the extensive operations of the department of in-
ternational exchanges, the benefits of which accrue not only principally
to the Library of Congress but to all the public libraries and scientific
societies throughout the United States.. The rooms are filled with the
archives, files of correspondence, original scientific manuscripts, vouch-
ers, the stock of Government and Smithsonian publications for distri-
bution at home and abroad, &c.; and their destruction by fire, to which
they are constantly exposed, would be greatly detrimental to the in-
terests of the Government and the general public.

‘“‘ In addition to this, an extensive fire in the east wing would endanger
and possibly destroy the main portion of the Smithsonian building, the
upper and lower halls of which contain rare specimens belonging to the
Government, and most of which could not be replaced.

‘Congress has recognized the importance and propriety of gradually
reconstructing the interior of the Smithsonian building, in fire-proof
materials, by making appropriations for the purpose at various times
between 1870 and 1875; and the last Congress, in 1879, appropriated
$3,000 ‘for providing additional security against fire in the Smithsonian
building.’

‘‘It is now proposed to remodel the interior of the east wing so that,
without disturbing its present architectural style, the internal capacity
will be doubled by a new arrangement of floors, partitions, and roofs,
and all the rooms be adapted to the efficient prosecution of the work of
the Institution and the various interests intrusted to its management
by Congress.

National Museum Building.—The Museum building was received from
the hands of the architects in so complete a state that but little re-
mained to be done beyond the tinting of a portion of the walls and the
filling up of some of the alcoves with canvas frames, &c. There is yet
much to be done, however, in the construction of the necessary cases for
the accommodation of collections. <A large addition to the number was
made during the year. It will require, perhaps, two more consecutive
appropriations, of the usual amount, before all the space contained in
the building can be suitably occupied with the necessary means of

with report No. 5.

“By invitation of Professor Baird, the east wing and connecting corridor to the
main building of the Smithsonian Institution were visited and inspected. In this
portion of the building are all the records and valuable documents belonging to the
Institution. The interior is entirely of wood and illy arranged, making it especially
unsafe and liable to accident from fire, thus endangering the entire building. As a
matter of safety, this wing and corridor should be completely cleared out and rebuilt
of fire-proof material, and furnished with improved modes of communication and
egress.”
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

exhibition. As heretofore, the cases have been, for the most part, built
by contract outside of the Museum, some in Washington, some in Phil-
adelphia, and others in Baltimore, but a good deal of work has been
done within the building by carpenters and other workmen employed
by the day.

A very great change has been made during the year in the appear-
ance of the interior, and a very decided approach towards the general
completion of the work accomplished. In order to accommodate the
increasing number of books required for the use of the curators and
students connected with the Museum, the original library room was
connected with the one above it by means of a stairway, so that prac-
tically two stories—the lower one with a gallery—have been provided.
It is thought that at least 10,000 volumes can be accommodated in this
manner.

The accommodations for the storage of coal having been found insuffi-
cient, the vaults under the western end of the south front of the Museum
were more than doubled in extent during the year, and space gained
in addition for a blacksmith’s shop and machine shop.

Armory Building.—Very important changes have been made during
the year in the Armory building and its surroundings. This edifice
was assigned by Congress, a number of years ago, for the special service
of the National Museum; to which, at a later period, was added by law
that of the United States Fish Commission. The original intent of the
assignment was for the purpose of accommodating the collections ob-
tained at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia; but as these were
removed, from time to time, to the National Museum building, after its
completion, the space gained was taken possession of by the Fish Com-
mission. ‘The lower story, or ground floor, was converted into a great
fish-propagating establishment, for the hatching of shad, salmon, and
other food fishes; and it was used, also, as a magazine for the distribu-
tion of carp, black bass, &c. The second floor was converted into a
series of offices, laboratories, and rooms for the messengers connected
with the fish-transportation service. The third floor was used as a
depot for supplies and materials of the Fish Commission; and the
fourth story is still oceupied by the property of the National Museum.

In order the better to accommodate the service of the Fish Commis-
sion, a Switch or branch railroad track was, by the permission of the
Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, and of the Commis-
sioners of the District of Columbia, introduced into the area at the south
of the building, on which the distribution cars of the Fish Commission
can be kept, aud loaded directly from the Armory building. Later in
the year a shed in the shape of the letter L was built on the lot, the
short branch being used for the cars, and the long one as a depository
for the collections obtained from the proprietors of exhibits in the Per-
manent Exhibition building in Philadelphia. The construction of a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 6

fence inclosing the interior court of the Armory yard gives great
security to the large amount of valuable Government property storea
in the main building and its annexes.

Laboratory of Natural History—By the transfer of Mr. T. W. Smillie
and his photographic apparatus from this buildit'¢ to the new photo-
graphic rooms specially arranged in the southea:‘ern pavilion of the
National Museum building, it became possible to oiler accommodations
for photographic work to the force employed by Major Powell, in con-
nection with the Geological Survey and Bureau of Ethnology. Mr.
Hillers, photographer, has utilized the rooms of the building particu-
larly in the preparation of enlarged photographs of the scenery and
the aborigines of the West for the windows of the National Museum.
It is proposed to introduce these photographs in a large number of the
windows of the Museum building, selecting for each room the subjects
most appropriate to its contents.

An Additional Museum Building required.—Large and capacious as is
the new Museum building, it has proved already inadequate to the exist-
ing requirements of the National Museum. ‘This building was designed
primarily to accommodate the vast number of industrial and economical
exhibits presented to the United States by foreign Governments at the
close of the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. A special appropriation
was made by Congress for their transfer to Washington and the Armory
building in the square between Sixth and Seventh streets was assigned
for their reception. It required nearly sixty large-sized freight cars to
transport the mass.

Before the building was completed in 1881, and available for its pur-
poses, almost equally enormous additions had been made to the collee-
tions of the various Government expeditions and of the Ethnological
Bureau, which, together with many thousands of objects previously in
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, but for which there was no room
in the old building, constituted a much larger mass than was originally
estimated. It is well known that at the close of the Centennial Exposi-
tion a company was organized to take charge of a large portion of the
collections exhibited on that occasion, and with these and such additional
articles as might be obtained to establish what was known as the “ Per-
manent Exhibition” in the main Centennial building, which covers nearly
eighteen acres. This organization, after struggling for existence for
several years, finally became unable to continue the effort, and the col-
lections in its charge were speedily scattered. Many of these had been
presented to the National Museum with the understanding that they
were to be left with the Permanent Exhibition Company for a period of
at least a few years. Others, however, including many of the most
valuable series, were obtained for the National Museum through the
efforts of Mr. Thomas Donaldson. All these collections were carefully
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

packed under his charge and stored in a building erected by him ad-
jacent to the Centennial building.

An appropriation was made by Congress to meet the cost of packing,
shipping to Washington, and storing the collections in question. About
twenty cars were required to transport them. They are now contained
in a wooden building adjacent to the Armory, there being absolutely
no space for them in the National Museum.

In addition to this a cabinet of at least double the magnitude, made
by the Institute of Mining Engineers and deposited with the Pennsyl-
vania Art Museum of Philadelphia, has been offered to the Govern-
ment simply on the condition of transfer to Washington and proper
exhibition. This is an extremely important collection, illustrating the
mining resources and metallurgy of the United States and foreign coun-
tries, and will constitute a most important addition to the means of in-
struction at the command of the Government. An appropriation will
be asked, and it is hoped obtained, for the purpose of transferring the
collection to Washington; but some measures must be taken for its
ultimate display.

An even greater mass of additional material to be provided for will
be found in the industrial collections of the United States census of
1880, and in the collections of the United States Geological Survey.
The census collections embrace more particularly the building stones
of the country, the ores (especially of the precious metals), the com-
bustibles, such as coal, petroleum, &c., and the forest timber.

All these collections are of great magnitude, representing as nearly
as possible a full series from all parts of the country. They are care-
fully labelled and recorded, and will be accompanied by full descriptions.

The building-stone collection is especially valuable, consisting, as it
does, of many thousands of samples of marble, granite, sandstone, and
other substances, for the most part dressed in 4-inch cubes, each of the
faces showing a different surface and treatment.

It is not believed that any established quarry remains unrepresented
in this series, while many extremely valuable deposits of ornamental
and building stones are presented therein for the first time. Prepa-
rations are in progress for testing the strength, resistance to torsion
and crushing force, and economical properties of all these samples,
The collection is now so far advanced that when a public building is to
be erected either by the States or the General Government it will be
possible to show specimens of all the best building stones in the vicin-
ity of the locality involved, and to present all the necessary data as to
availability, durability, cost of production, &c. Much use has already
been made of the collection by the commissioners of State capitals,
county court-houses, &¢., as well as by agents of the General Govern-
ment.

The collection of ores made by the census agencies is also very ex-
tensive, that of iron being particularly large. Nearly every iron mine
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. a

of any prominence in the United States has been visited, and samples
carefully selected, by experts. These have been analyzed under the di-
rection of Professor Pumpelly, and reports presented as to their chem-
ical, and metallurgical properties, and economical value. All the orig-
inals of this research are in charge of the Smithsonian Institution,
awaiting exhibition. The same may be said of similar researches in
regard to the ores of all the other metals.

The work of the United States Geological Survey, also of enormous
magnitude—begun under Mr. Clarence King and continued under Maj.
J. W. Powell—has resulted in the accumulation of several tons of speci-
mens of fossils, rocks, minerals, ores, and the like. Very few of these
can at present be exhibited for want of the necessary space. The Sur-
vey requires a large number of experts and assistants, and is at pres-
ent very badly accommodated. Some twenty rooms in the new Mu-
seum building have been assigned as quarters for the Director of the
Survey and his assistants.

This, however, causes great inconvenience to the other work of the
Museum, and as the survey now occupies a large building in Washing-
ton, for which it pays considerable rental, and for want of quarters in
Washington is obliged to scatter its stations over various parts of the
United States, itis thought desirable to ask Congress for an appropria-
tion to erect a second museum buildingcorresponding in general char-
acter to the first, but on the opposite side of the square, along the line
of Twelfth street.

This building it is proposed to devote almost entirely to the mineral
department of the National Museum; and when completed to transfer
to it everything of a geological and mineralogical nature, and also to
prepare a portion of it especially for the accommodation of the Geolog-
ical Survey, which is at present so inconveniently provided for. By
way of economy it is proposed at first to construct what will represent
the western side of the building, in which office-rooms and chemical
and other laboratories can be provided for.

It had been proposed to erect a separate building for the Geological
Survey, disconnected from the National Museum; but there being no
ground available for this purpose, it was thought expedient to ask for
an appropriation to furnish the required quarters on the Smithsonian
reservation, which is at present ample for the purpose.

On the 10th of April last the following bill was accordingly intro-
duced into the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds. The subject is still before that
committee, and it is impossible to state what will be its fate during
the present session. I would recommend action on the part of the Board
of Regents in this connection, since long before the edifice can be com-
pleted the need for it will become extremely urgent.
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“A BILL (H. R. No. 5781) for the erection of a fire-proof building on the south por-
tion of the Smithsonian reservation, for the accommodation of the United States
Geological Survey, and for other purposes.

“ Be it enacted, &c., That the sum of two hundred thousand dollars
be, and hereby is, appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated, for the erection of a fire-proof building on the
south portion of the Smithsonian reservation for the accommodation of
the United States Geological Survey, and for other purposes: Provided,
That the consent of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution be first
obtained thereto, and that the building be under their direction when
completed: And provided further, That the building be erected by the
Architect of the Capitol, in accordance with plans approved by the
Director of the United States Geological Survey, the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution and the Architect of the Capitol acting as a
board therefor.”

MEETINGS OF SCIENTIFIC BODIES.

The Board of Regents authorized the Secretary ‘‘to provide in the
building of the new Museum such accommodations as the National
Academy of Sciences may need at its meetings in Washington, and in
connection with the executive committee to extend similar hospitality
to other organizations of cognate character and importance.”

Under the authority thus conferred, meetings were held during the
past year in the new Museum: by the National Academy of Sciences
(April 18, 1882), the American Institute of Mining Engineers (Febru-
ary 21, 1882), and the National Dental Association (August 3, 4, 5, 1882).

The hall of the Museum has also been used for the bi-monthly meet-
ings of the Biological Society of Washington, and for lectures on Satur-
day afternoons in the months of March and April, 1882, under the au-
spices of the Anthropological and Biological Societies of Washington.

The following is a list of these lectures :

ROUTINE WORK OF THE INSTITUTION.

Administration.—The personnel of the Smithsonian Institution has
remained practically unchanged since the last report.

Correspondence.—In all the public Departments, the correspondence
constitutes a very large part of the office work, and the fact that the
Smithsonian Institution has come to be, in a measure, a bureau of in-
formation, adds greatly to the number of letters received and requir-
ing responses.

It is a rule of the Institution, observed from its earliest days, that
no respectful request for information ever goes without an answer—
either supplying what is wanted, or expressing inability to doso. In
the latter case references are frequently given, which answer the desired
object.

The known interest of the Institution in the subject of Anthropology
induces many notices to be sent to it of the discovery of Indian relics,
_ their characteristics, and other details; the more interesting portions
of which are usually extracted and published in the annnal report. The
number, however, has become so great that at present it is impossible
to give them in detail, as heretofore; but a careful abstract is made, for
publication in the annual report, by Prof. O. T. Mason, the editor in
charge of this subject.

The correspondence with all parts of the United States—largely, how-
ever, through members of Congress—in connection with the supposed
discovery of valuable minerals, has, as heretofore, represented a very
considerable portion of the business.

Applications for position in the Institution and its allied departments.
still continue to be numerous. At best there can be but very few vacan-
cies in the administrative and laboring force, and hence it is rarely
possible to give a favorable response to any such application, whatever
the merit of the applicant, or however strong and satisfactory the testi-
monials presented. The unpleasant necessity accordingly remains of
almost uniformly declining the urgent appeals of those seeking official
position and occupation.

RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS.

During no previous year has the Smithsonian Institution been con-
nected with so many different and important explorations of various.
regions, especially of America, as during that which has just closed;
and the results of the work are of commensurate value.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Among the subjects to which the Institution has always devoted
special attention has been that of developing a knowledge of the eth-
nology and physical and natural history of the less known portions of
the globe; confining, however, its attention more particularly to Amer-
ica. There are yet so many regions to be investigated, that whatever
funds are available for its purposes can always be advantageously em-
ployed; and the limitations in this respect have always been keenly
felt.

It is, of course, the policy of the Smithsonian Institution, in this and
in all other subjects, to occupy no ground that is covered by other suf-
ficient agencies; and where the United States Government or any other
body is at work in exploration the Institution does not interfere, except
in so far as it can act concurrently to advantage. For the third of a
century the Institution has worked harmoniously with the various
branches of the Government in this connection; and by calling atten-
tion to the importance of special inquiries, not originally contemplated
in the official research, by securing the appointment of competent ex-
perts, by taking charge of the notes and collections made, and assisting
in their elaboration and preparation for publication, and in various
other ways, it has been able to guide effort, and to secure the accom-
plishment of its object on a very large scale.

The number of exhibitions that the Institution has been more or less
connected with during the period mentioned is very great, and it is
difficult to calculate the influence that it has thus exerted in the devel-
opment of knowledge in ethnology and natural history in general, and
particularly in that of northern and middle America.

Of later years the strongest ally and associate of the Smithsonian
Institution and its work, has been the United States Signal Service;
first, under General Meyer, and next under General Hazen. Both these
officers have always exhibited the utmost readiness to render all the aid
in their power toward the furtherance of the objects of the Institution,
and especially by permitting it to nominate persons to the charge of, or
to act as assistants in, the principal observation stations who, while
competent meteorological observers, were at the same time naturalists
and able to utilize their opportunities to the utmost. The Institution
in these cases has usually met all the expenses in addition to what was
required for the purely meteorological service; supplying outfit, arsenic,
ammunition, &c., and taking charge of the collections and having them
properly elaborated for publication.

The previous reports of the Institution contain many references to
this most satisfactory co-operation; and this has been even more marked
and efficient during 1882 than formerly; as will be readily realized by
the following account, in which I propose to take up the several regions,
and show the more important work that has been done either by the
Institution alone, or in conjunction with the Signal Service and other
parties.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

Greenland.—It will be remembered that in 1881 Lieutenant Greeley
was sent, by the Chief Signal Officer, in charge of a party to establish
an international meteorological station at Lady Franklin Bay, in lati-
tude 81° 35’ north. The party was taken to its destination on the
steamer “ Proteus,” a sailing vessel chartered in Newfoundland, and was
safely landed, with all its stores, on the north shore of Lady Franklin
Bay, at Camp Conger. The naturalist and surgeon of the party in
charge, Dr. Pavey, had preceded the expedition to Greenland by about
one year, being occupied during the interval in studying the natural
history and ethnology of the country. In 1882, with an appropriation
made by Congress for the purpose, a relief party was organized by the
Signal Office to carry out stores and supplies. As Dr. Pavey intimated
his desire to return during 1882, the Institution, at the request of Gen-
eral Hazen, selected Dr. Hoadley to fill the place, as a surgeon of
ability and an experienced naturalist. This relief party, with the sup-
plies and stores, left Newfoundland on the steamer *“‘ Neptune” on its
way to Lady Franklin Bay; but, on account of the ice, was unable to
reach its destination; and after depositing the stores on the shore
and marking their position by intelligible indications, it returned
to the United States. During the voyage, Dr. Hoadley was able to
utilize the slight opportunity at his command in collecting some inter-
esting specimens of birds and other objects of natural history. The
commander of the party brought back a very finely constructed skin
boat, which has been deposited by the Chief Signal Officer in the
National Museum.

Labrador.—A very important beginning towards the exploration of
Labrador has been made during the year by the establishment, by the
United States Signal Service, of an international meteorological station
on Ungava Bay, its northern extremity. Mr. Lucien M. Turner, who has
been connected with theservice for many years in stations at St. Michael’s,
Alaska, and at many points along the Aleutian Islands, was selected
to establish a new station on the eastern coast of the continent, and one
that should be at a suitable distance from the Greenland station, and
those more or less adjacent to it of the German and English Govern-
ments. The courtesy of the Hudson’s Bay Company, which had been
8o signally exhibited to the Smithsonian Institution in connection with
the researches of Mr. Kennicott and others more than twenty years ago,
was again displayed, in its hearty consent to make Fort Chimo, in
Ungava Bay, the seat of the settlement in question; and Mr. Turner
accordingly left Quebec on a schooner for Rigolette Station, where,
taking the Hudson’s Bay steamer, he proceeded to Ungava. His equip-
ment for making collections of all kinds was very complete, and was
also transported by the Hudson’s Bay Company. He had received au-
thority from the Institution to obtain the necessary goods at the post,
and to secure such objects by barter with the Eskimo as could not
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

otherwise be readily obtained. The vessel returned very soon after,
leaving Mr. Turner and his equipment; but his letters indicate his entire
satisfection with the prospect, of efficient work both in meteorology and
in natural history. We are assured by the company’s officer at Fort
Chimo of his hearty co-operation; and are also gratified at the assurance
that, in their season, the variety of objects of natural history is very
great, especially of birds, with their nests and eggs. Four boxes of col-
lections were received from Mr. Turner by way of London, and found to
contain many articles of much interest. In accordance with the under-
standing with Mr. Turner, the collections will all be retained, so that he
may work them up at the proper time.

This may be an appropriate place to mention that, before leaving the
country, Mr. Turner completed his elaborate report upop the natural
and physical history of Alaska, and left it in the hands of the Chief
Signal Officer for such use as he might see fit to make of it.

A second exploration of Labrador during the year was prosecuted by
Mr. Winfred A. Stearns, a New England naturalist who has been in
the habit of spending several years successively on the coast, although
considerably farther south than the station occupied by Mr. Turner.
That gentleman applied to the Institution for the necessary alcohol to
preserve objects of marine zodlogy, and has forwarded to Washington
a satisfactoryreturn. A report by him on the various species of animals
observed during his successive visits to Labrador has been presented
to the Institution, and will shortly be published in the Proceedings of
the National Museum.

Arctic Ocean.—The ill-fated voyage of the Jeannette came to a close
by the wrecking of the vessel, and the loss of two out of the three divis-
ions into which the party was made up in the effort to reach the actual
settlements on the Siberian coasts. Among those saved was Mr. Ray-
mond L. Newcomb, the gentleman nominated by the Institution as
naturalist to the expedition. Mr. Newcomb was able, in spite of all the
privations and trials of the return, to save many of his notes and four
specimens of one of the rarest of known birds, namely, Ross’ Gull, which
is a Small species, characterized by a wedge-shaped tail, and having,
also, a black ring around the neck, in striking contrast with the other-
wise white plumage. Mr. Newcomb knowing well the interest to natur-
alists of these specimens, carried them with him, and delivered them
to the Smithsonian Institution. They are, naturally, not in very good
condition, but would be prizes under any circumstances.

_ The disastrous history of the Jeannette, almost unexampled among
Arctic explorations in its fatalities, does not come within my province
to detail.

Alaska.—Of all the stations in this vast and comparatively unknown
region, the most important occupied during the year is that at Point
Barrow, situated in latitude 714° N., the northernmost point of conti-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

nental North America, and forming a part of the purchase by the United
States from Russia in 1867.

In 1881 a thoroughly organized party was sent to that region by the
Chief Signal Officer, under the command of Lieutenant Ray, with
Dr. Oldmixon as surgeon, and Professors Smith and Murdoch as
meteorological observers and naturalists; the latter gentlemen having
been nominated by the Smithsonian Institution at the request of Gen-
eral Hazen. Both of them trained and accomplished naturalists, and
of much experience in practical work, a great deal is hoped from them,
as well as from the party generally, in the thorough investigation of the
anthropology and biology of the northern coast.

A vessel sent by the United States Signal Office to Point Barrow with
supplies, under Lieutenant Powell, found the party in admirable condi-
tion, and brought back a large number of very interesting specimens, -
which have already greatly increased our knowledge of the Eskimo
and of the animal life of the region. The labor of getting settled, and
of organizing the station, prevented the full utilization of the occasion
by the naturalists of the expedition. It is expected, however, that by
the next year’s return the objects secured will be of very great interest,
surpassing even those that have already come to hand.

Among the most noted features of the collections returned from the
expedition are the many implements, such as hammers, chisels, scrap-
ers, &c., made of a form of Jadite, closely allied to the precious Jad-
ite of China and New Zealand; and many other objects of Eskimo
workmanship are scarcely less interesting.

Among the birds, the eggs of three species of Arctic wading birds
constitute important novelties in the collections of the National Mu-
seum. ‘There were also some rare fishes, marine invertebrates, &c.

Among the most important collections received from Alaska during
the year are the ethnological objects transmitted by Mr. J. J. McLean,
Signal Service observer at Sitka. This gentleman has well utilized the
opportunities at his command by securing several very fine collections
both of modern and prehistoric workmanship of the Alaskan Indians;
adding much to the richness of the material in the National Museum.

While engaged in his surveying work in Alaskan waters, on the Coast
Survey steamer Hassler, Commander Henry H. Nichols of the Navy has
continued his important service begun several years before on the Gulf
of California, in obtaining rare specimens of animals, especially fishes.
A large collection of marine animals, made by him, is now on its way
from California.

Saint Michacl’s.—No collections were received during the year from
Saint Michael’s; a station which while in charge first of Mr. Turner,
and next of Mr. Nelson, has been so great a source of supply to the
National Museum. It is, however, expected that a consignment of in-
terest will be received next year.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Nushagak.—This station, also one of the important points of service
of the Signal Office, is in charge of Mr. C. L. McKay, who went there in
1881 with the usual supply of apparatus for meteorological observation,
and of outfit by the Smithsonian Institution. Few localities on the
coast are more important than Bristol Bay, on which Nushagak is sit-
uated ; and it is expected that Mr. McKay will do full justice to the op-
portunity; having been well trained, both as an observer and collector,
under Professor Jordan, of Bloomington, Ind. <A large amount of ex-
tremely valuable material has been furnished by Mr. McKay, those of
most interest being the ethnological objects. Many interesting species
of birds and their eggs, of mammals, and of fishes have also been sent.

Some interesting collections have been received from Pribylov, one of
the fur-seal islands, furnished by Mr. J. H. Moulton. Of these a very
fine walrus head with tusks has been mounted by Mr. Hornaday, taxi-
dermist of the National Museum.

Kodiak.—A. very accomplished naturalist and collector, Mr. W. J.
Fisher, is now established at Kodiak as tidal observer of the United
States Coast Survey, and from him the Institution has received a num-
ber of extremely interesting objects. These are, for the most part,
ethnological and zodlogical; and will be referred to in another part of
this report. The most interesting acquisition of Mr. Fisher is a new
species of petrel, which has been called Wstrelata jishert by Mr. Ridg-
way, after the discoverer.

The fishes collected by Mr. Fisher are particularly interesting; as he
is well versed in Pacific ichthyology, and able to make a judicious se-
lection where it is required.

From the other islands of the Aleutian group not much has come to
hand in 1882; a few specimens collected in previous years only having
been received.

Commander Islands.—Not in any way inferior in importance to the
other work of the year have been the results of an expedition made
to the Commander Islands by Dr. L. Stejneger. This gentleman, an
accomplished naturalist of Norway, visited the Smithsonian Institution
in 1881 for the purpose of studying the collections of aquatic birds in
the National Museum, and when this was done, offered his services to
the Institution for any exploration that might be desired. His first idea
was that of research in the Sandwich Islands, and next in the West
Indies; but finally the interest of an exploration in the Commander
Islands induced the Institution to make the necessary arrangements to
send him to that region. It may be stated, in this connection, that
this group of small islands is situated about 100 miles off Petropau-
lovski on the coast of Kamchatka, and that its special interest lies
in the fact of its originally having been the locality of the northern
sea-cow—the Rhytina gigas—a marine mammal closely allied to the
dugong and manatee but of enormous size, measuring 30 feet and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

upwards in length, and weighing many tons. When the islands were
discovered by the Russians in November, 1741, the species was very
abundant; but in a few years it was entirely exterminated, and it is
believed to be considerably more than one hundred years since the
last survivor perished. Quite naturally, the possession of some remains
of this animal is a great desideratum among museums; and until
recently the only relics were in the museum of the Academy of Sciences
in St. Petersburg. In completing his famous voyage over the Euro-
pean seas, around by the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific, Professor Nor-
denskj6éld, obtained at Bering Island, of the Commander group, a num-
ber of bones of the Rhytina, of the acquisition of which he was justly
proud. Desirous of obtaining specimens of the animal for the Na-
tional Museum, the Smithsonian Institution very gladly availed itself
of the offer of the Alaska Commercial Company, the lessee from the
Russian Government of the Commander Islands, to transport Dr.
Stejneger in the vessel which carries the usual annual supplies to the
station, and hopes soon to report success in its efforts.

Oregon and Washington Territory.—During the year several very ac-
ceptable transmissions of objects of ethnology and natural history,
especially of fish products, have been made by Mr. James G. Swan, of
Port Townsend. This gentleman’s name has appeared for many years
in the Smithsonian report, as a valued contributor, not only of materials
but also of interesting memoirs which have been published in the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, and in the Annual Reports.

Mr. Swan has been specially occupied during the year in collecting
material for the American display at the International Fishery Exhi-
bition, to be held in London in May next; and it is believed that his
collection, when received, will leave but little to be desired in the way
of a satisfactory representation of the aboriginal and other fisheries of
Puget Sound.

Capt. Charles Bendire, while stationed at Fort Walla Walla and at
Fort Klamath, has continued his researches into the bird life of the
Northwest; and, with his usual success, has secured many rare speci-
mens of the nests and eggs of birds, as well as of their skins.

To Captain Bendire we are also indebted for important collections of
reptiles, fishes, and small mammals, also fossil remains of both animals
and plants.

California.—Mr. R. EB. C. Stearns has been engaged in collecting ma-
terial along the coast of California for the London Fishery Exhibition,
and has also visited Puget Sound, Washington Territory, and Oregon
in the same connection; and to him we owe some interesting collections
of specimens in archeology obtained in the interior of California.

Mr. Gustav Eisen, a well-known naturalist, has also contributed some
acceptable collections in archeology from the vicinity of Fresno.

H. Mis. 26——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Lower California.—The earlier volumes of the report of the Institu-
tion contain allusions to the important work of Mr. John Xantus in the
exploration of lower California, resulting in the discovery of a peculiar
fauna at Cape Saint Lucas, represented by numerous undescribed spe-
cies of birds, reptiles, fishes, &c. In the lapse of time, the collections
made by Mr. Xantus have been greatly reduced, and it is considered
eminently desirable to renew them.

Mr. L. Belding, of Stockton, Cal., undertook, largely at his own ex-
pense, to visit the region in question and explore it in the interest of
the Smithsonian Institution. This was done by him with very great
success, his work resulting in the recovery of most of the species ob-
tained by Mr. Xantus, with a number of additions. So promising, in-
deed, was the field, that the available time during the winter and early
spring of 1882 was not sufficient to complete the work, and he therefore
returned again towards the end of 1882, and is now occupied in his
mission. As Mr. Belding is a trained naturalist, especially in the
department of ornithology, much is expected from his researches. He
proposes to prepare, for publication by the Institution, a methodical
account of the vertebrate natural history of Lower California.

New Mexico and Arizona.—From New Mexico and Arizona the con-
tributions have, as usual, been chiefly in the line of ethnology, the
Ethnological Bureau having continued its work on a very large scale.
A special aecount will be found in another part of the report of the
work of this Bureau in the region referred to and elsewhere. It will
be, therefore, unnecessary to do more than mention the names of Maj.
J. W. Powell, Director of the Bureau, and Messrs. F. H. Cushing and
James Stevenson, in this connection.

From Mr. H. H. Rusby some interesting collections of plants and
specimens from Silver City have been received.

The United States Geological Survey has also collected very many
minerals, fossils, and rocks in these Territories, all of which are for
the present in charge of the Survey.

Interior of the United States—No véry important explorations have
been made in the interior of the country, other than those mentioned, ex-
cepting the work of the Ethnological Bureau, which, as already stated,
will be found detailed elsewhere.

Prof. D. S. Jordan, however, has prosecuted extensive inquiries into
the fishes of Texas, and Prof. Hay into those of the Southern States.

Florida.—Florida has been the scene of great activity in explora-
tion. Mr. 8. T. Walker has been engaged on the western coast of the
State, principally in collecting the archeological material; Mr. James
Bell, of Gainesville, has furnished large numbers of birds and living rep-
tiles; Dr. Henshall, collections of fishes; and Mr. Whitfield of reptiles.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The most important collections, however, in Florida are those of the
fishes, made by Professor Jordan and Mr. Silas Stearns, of Pensacola,
the latter gentleman in continuation of very many previous transmis-
sions. Indeed, to no one are we more indebted than to Mr. Stearns for
a knowledge of the ichthyology of the Gulf of Mexico, his business con-
nection with the fish and fisheries, prosecuted from Pensacola as a basis,
enabling him to secure novelties as they presen! themselves. Several
papers describing a number of new species have been published by the
Institution on the collections made by Mr. Stearns, and other species
remain to be described. ;

Eastern portion of the United States.—In the eastern portion of the
United States the principal results have, as heretofore, been produced
by the United States Fish Commission, the continued investigations of
the steamer “ Fish Hawk” along the continental plateau having brought
to light many new forms of fishes and invertebrates, besides securing
numerous rarities, as well as duplicate specimens for distribution.

A special feature, in addition, has been the work connected with the
acquisition of material for the display of the London Fishery Exposi-
tion, opening in May next. An appropriation was made by Congress
for the purpose of securing suitable illustrations of the apparatus, proc-
esses, products, and results of the American fisheries; but the present
limits will not permit me to go into details, and a formal report will
hereafter be made on the subject.

The collections made in previous years by the Gloucester fishermen,
have not been continued to any great extent, in view of the fact that
the greater part of the objects coming within the limits of their work
have been obtained, the work of the “Fish Hawk” superseding largely
the less productive yield of the trawl and hand line.

West Indies.—From the West Indies a few objects of much interest
have been obtained, although no extended series. Mr. Guesde has con-
tinued his contributions of illustrations of a very valuable collection
of Carrib antiquities. Dr. Nicholls, of Dominica, Mr. Wells, of Grenada,
and Mr. F.. A. Ober, have all made contributions of more or less interest.

Mexico.—The receipts from Mexico are for the most part represented
by several collections from Prof. A. Dugés, of Guanajuato. This ac-
complished naturalist has been/in the habit, for many years, of sending
to the Institution specimens of animals and plants for indentification.

It is with deep regret that I am obliged to mention, in another part
of this report, the death of Mr. F. Sumichrast, of Tuchitan; who has
been, by far, our most important coadjutor in that country.

Central America.—The researches prosecuted in Central America,
under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, have been of unusual
importance in the results obtained, both of specimens and of informa-
tion; and of these quite a number are to be mentioned.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. J. F. Bransford, a surgeon in the Navy, under the auspices of
both the Ethnological Bureau and the Smithsonian Institution, made
a special visit to Copan by way of Guatemala, and also spent a portion
of his time in Costa Rica and elsewhere. In his work he was able to
secure the hearty co-operation of Mr. Keith, the engineer of the Costa
Rica railroad, who kindly furnished some very valuable archeological
specimens for investigation. The collections of Dr. Bransford have
been also of very great value, especially in objects manufactured of
jade. Much of Dr. Bransford’s work on the Gulf of Nicoya, a region
previously but little known to us, is very interesting. Heis now engaged
in the preparation of an elaborate report of his travels, which will be
published at an early day.

Mr. C. C. Nutting, of Illinois, was sent by the Institution to explore
especially the fauna of the Gulf of Nicoya and Costa Rica, and with
the help of Sefior José C. Zeledon, a long-tried collaborator of the Insti-
tution, he was able to make some interesting collections both on the
coast and in the interior of Costa Rica. No new species were brought
to light, but many rare and interesting forms were secured.

Mr. Nutting returned from the work of the winter of 1881-’82 in April,
and went back again by the steamer of the 20th December, to continue
his researches on the northern border of Costa Rica and the eastern
coast of that state and Nicaragua.

Mr. Zeledon himself has furnished some interesting additions to the
very large collections of Costa Rica vertebrates previously received from -
him, among them some new species of birds.

It is but proper to state that the labors of Mr. Nutting and Dr. Brans-
ford were very greatly furthered by the hearty co-operation of Capt. John
M. Dow, the agent of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company at Panama,
who has been so well known for many years as a coadjutor in all re-
searches of a scientificnature, whether under the auspices of Americans
or foreigners. No man is better known along the Isthmus; and a sim-
ple request secures his assistance to scientific enterprise at whatever
point in Central America it may be in the course of prosecution.

Mr. Gustav Hisen, a correspondent of the Institution, formerly a resi-
dent of California, but during the past year living in Guatemala, has
made important researches among the antiquities of Copan, Santa Lucia,
&c. An extended memoir by him has been prepared for publication
by the Smithsonian Institution. He has also supplied some interesting
collections of natural history.

The Isthmus of Panama itself has been represented by the collec-
tions of reptiles sent by Dr. Nelson, of the English Mail Steamer serv-
ice, and of fishes by Mr. Gilbert.

The report upon the work of 1880 and 1881 contained an account of the
labors of Mr. Charles H. Gilbert in the way of ichthyological investiga-
tions along the western coast of America. This gentlemen returned to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 22

Central America by the steamer of the 20th December, and expects to
devote a number of months, under the auspices of Captain Dow, to the
investigation of the fishes of the two shores of the Isthmus. It is proper
to say that for the co-operation which the scientific enterprises of both
Messrs. Nutting and Gilbert have received from the Pacific Mail Steam-
ship Company, and the amount of service rendered generally by the
company in question in the explorations of the Smithsonian Institution,
it is difficult to express our appreciation in words. For more than twenty
years, in all successive stages of administration, it has been ready to
respond to any reasonable request for service, not only carrying the
agents of the Institution free of charge, but also franking the collec-
tions transmitted by them to Washington.

South America.—From South America but little of importance has
been received, excepting from the Geological Survey of Brazil under
Prof. E. H. Derby. From him valuable collections of corals, fossils, &c.,
have been received, to be exchanged for some from the National Museum.

Dr. Hering, of Surinam, has sent collections of living reptiles, of
objects in alcohol, and specimens of anthropology, which have proved
very acceptable.

Mr. Thomas Herron, of Baranquilla, has also contributed some valu-
able archeological specimens.

Mr, W. FI’. Lee conducted an exploration in Peru and Ecuador with
some success during the months of July and August. He was obliged
to discontinue work on account of the hostility of the natives, who had
been prejudiced against explorers on account of the indiscretions of @
collector who had preceded Mr. Lee.

China and Japan.—The researches of Dr. Dale and Mr. P. L. Jouy,
in China and Japan, respectively, have been continued during the year
with very important results. Collections of great value of birds, mam-
mals, and other objects have come safely to hand from them. Dr. Dale
returned to the United States in the early part of the year, but Mr.
Jouy remained in Japan and visited some comparatively little known
portions of the country, where he found objects of very great interest.

Nothing of special moment has been received from the Old World,
beyond some occasional specimens of natural history exchanged with
museums or individuals. ‘These, with the details of the collections
generally, will be found recorded in the list of accessions to the Na-
tional Museum during the year.

PUBLICATIONS.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—In 1860 the Institution pub-
lished as one of the series of ‘‘Contributions to Knowledge,” the regis-
ter of meteorological observations made at Providence, R. I., by Prof.
Alexis Caswell, extending over a period of twenty-eight and a half
years, from December, 1831, to May, 1860. After the death of Professor
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Caswell, manuscript containing additional observations for sixteen years
and a half, or to the end of the year 1876, was placed at the disposal of
the Institution. It was accordingly decided to publish summaries of
the entire series of observations, and the necessary reductions, arrange-
ment, and revision were placed under the direction of Messrs. Charles
A. Schott and E. H. Courtenay.

The result, a condensed epitome of continuous records for forty-five
years, of observations of the barometer and thermometer, of winds,
clouds, rain, snow, &c., has been published during the year, forming
a quarto volume of 38 pages, entitled “‘ Results of Meteorological Obser-
vations made at Providence, R. I, extending over a period of forty-five
years.” This will doubtless prove a useful work of reference, not merely
for students of meteorology, but for engineers and others.

Miscellaneous Collections.—T wo volumes of this series have been com-
pleted during the past year, Vol. XXII and Vol. XXIII. The former
is composed of the Proceedings of the United States National Museum
for 1880 and 1881, and forms an octavo volume of 1200 pages, with 18
wood-cuts and 4 plates.

The twenty-third volume is made up of the following papers:

Bibliography of Fishes of the Pacific coast of the United States. By
Theodore Gill.

On the Distribution of Fishes of the Alleghany Region of South Caro-
lina, Georgia, and Tennessee, with a synopsis of the family Catosto-
mide. By D.S. Jordan and A. W. Brayton.

Flora of Saint Croix and the Virgin Islands. By H. I. A. Eggers.

Catalogue of the Collection to illustrate the animal resources and the
fisheries of the United States, exhibited at Philadelphia in 1876 by the
Smithsonian Institution and the United States Fish Commission, and
forming a part of the United States National Museum. By G. Brown
Goode.

Contributions to the natural history of Arctic America, made in con-
nection with the Howgate Polar Expedition, 187778. By L. Kumlien.

These five articles formed Bulletins of the National Museum, Nos. 11
to 15, and are now collected in one volume of 1003 pages.

Mr. F. W. Clarke has prepared for the Institution another of the
series devoted to the discussion and more precise determination of
various constants of nature, forming the fifth contribution to that sub-
ject published in the Smithsonian series. It is entitled “A Recalculation
of the Atomic Weights,” and forms an octavo volume of 293 pages. It
may be regarded as practically supplementary to the “ Digest of Atomic
Weights,” by Mr. Geo. IF’. Becker, published by the Institution in 1880,
and of which an account was given in the report for that year.

One of the articles of the Miscellaneous Collections (No. 469, Smith-
sonian series), is a list of the foreign correspondents of the Institution,
corrected to January, 1882. It was prepared by Mr. Geo. H. Boehmer, in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

charge of the exchange system, includes about 3,000 titles, and forms an
octavo volume of 174 pages, being No. 469 of the Smithsonian publica-

tion.
The various papers on anthropological subjects, contributed by Dr.

Chas. Rau to the Smithsonian Annual Reports, from 1860 to 1877, have
been collected and issued in one volume, with a preface by the author
containing notes as to changes and additions rendered necessary by re-
cent observations and researches.

The work forms an octavo volume of 180 pages, with 53 wood-cuts,
and corstitutes No. 440 of the Smithsonian series of publications.

The steady increase of publications by the Institution renders neces-
sary a frequent reissue and extension of the printed list of the same.
The last check-list (to the end of 1881) presented 438 titles, stated in
brief, and occupying 20 pages Svo. It wis at the time designed to have
a more complete catalogue prepared, giving the title-page of each work
in full. Mr. William J. Rhees has accordingly undertaken the labor
of compiling such a catalogue, in a much more thorough and satis-
factory form than has heretofore been attempted. This list (including
40 additional titles) has been brought down to the Ist of July, 1882.
The whole number of titles is 478; and in addition to a full biblio-
graphical description of each work, in the case of volumes which em-
brace several independent articles (as the Contributions, Collections,
Reports, Bulletins, and Proceedings), the contents of each are given.
This catalogue (of 89 pages) is followed by a classified list of all the
separate publications, under general heads. A very full alphabetical
index of all the articles contained in each of the publications (with
abundant cross-references) concludes the work. The whole (including
14 pages of prefatory information), comprises 342 pages, 8vo. In order
to make this catalogue still more available, it is intended to supple-
ment it with a complete subject-matter index of all the subjects treated
of in the different publications, including the miscellaneous papers fur-
nished in the annual reports.

A history of the rise and progress of the Smithsonian system of ex-
changes has been prepared by Mr. George H. Boehmer, of the Institu-
tion. The account is prefaced by a sketch of some earlier efforts at
interchanges of a limited character, in order to show more clearly the
distinctive features of the Smithsonian system as an agency of univer-
sal exchange among learned societies and others, irrespective of spe-
cial returns to itself. The history includes the work of the Institution
with reference to the distribution of Government publications; and
also a notice of the organization by the Paris convention of 1875, in
promotion of a system of international exchange of scientific and liter-
ary memoirs, together with the proceedings snbsequently taken by other
nations in the matter. The whole forms a pamphleé of 162 pages, 8vo.

The interest attached to Tuckahoe, or Indian bread, as a well-known
and largely diffused article of food among the aborigines of our country,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

has led Prof. J. H. Gore to make a thorough examination into the nature
and properties of this fungus. By means of circulars of inquiry, widely
distributed by the Institution, a considerable amount of material and
information has been collected. This substance is found growing in
irregular masses of mycelium around the roots of trees—especially the
conifers—and is met with in certain districts as far north as New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, and even in parts of New York, and as far south as
Florida and Texas. Professor Gore has shown that the somewhat
varied accounts given by earlier writers result from a loose application
of the term tuckahoe to different substances and tubers, and that the
genuine article is destitute of starch, and, though abundant in pectinous
matter, possesses in itself but a small nutritive value. The essay is
comprised in a pamphlet of 13 pages.

Since the publication by this Institution in 1862 of a work on the
‘Classification of the Coleoptera of North America,” by Dr. John L.
Le Conte, and in 1873 of a second part to the same, not only has the
collection of specimens been largely increased by the industry of entomol-
ogists, but many new genera previously unknown have been added to
this large and important order or group of insects. It has therefore been
thought desirable to have the original treatise thoroughly revised and
brought up to the present condition of the science. This laborious work
has been undertaken by the joint efforts of Drs. John Le Conte and George
H. Horn; and the new edition now nearly completed, has been put in
print as far as to page 480. Not more than a hundred pages will now
be required to finish this extensive systematic arrangement and descrip-
tion of the Coleoptera, and the work will be published early in 1883.

In October of the past year, the Institution commenced the printing
of a General Catalogue of Scientific Periodicals published in all parts
of the world since 1665, compiled by Prof. H. Carrington Bolton, of
Trinity College, Hartford, Conn. The plan of this catalogue does not
include the proceedings and transactions of societies, nor does it in-
clude art journals or professional journals, that is, periodicals devoted
to the subjects of law, medicine, or theology. This work originally
brought down to the year 1874, by Prof. Bolton, it was at first supposed
would be published by Congress under the auspices of the Congressional
Library. The subsequent publication by Mr. Samuel H. Scudder of
his admirable “Catalogue of Scientific Serials of all countries (includ-
ing the transactions of Iearned societies), from 1633 to 1876,” seemed
for the time to supersede the work on which Professor Bolton had been
solongengaged. As the latter, however, included the large field of “ ap-
plied” science (so called), such as the periodical literature of manufact-
ures, agriculture and horticulture, pharmacy, and technology in general
(not embraced in Mr. Scudder’s catalogue), and as it presented the
great advantage of a purely alphabetical arrangement instead of the
geographical classification adopted by Mr. Scudder, the Institution
undertook its publication on condition that it should be continued to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

the year 1882. This additional labor was cheerfully undertaken by the
author, and it is hoped that the work will be completed during the year
1883. It will contain geographical, chronological, and subject-matter
indexes, and also—what is regarded as a valuable feature in a biblio-
graphical work of the kind—an appendix stating the American libra-
ries in which any of the periodicals catalogued (and indicated by a num-
ber) are to be found. To attain this information, circulars have been
prepared and will be sent to some two hundred librarians (including
twelve in Canada), explaining the project and soliciting their co-opera-
tion in this particular. It is probable that this proposed bibliographical
aid to scientific students will embrace references to at least a hundred
libraries. The work when completed will form an octavo volume of
probably somewhere between 700 and 800 pages.

For the purpose of ascertaining the methods employed in various
public and private offices, of indexing and filing letters and other
papers, and of thence determining by a comparative review the most
convenient and practical system, a circular was issued in Jafiuary, 1882,
requesting our correspondents to furnish the institution with a detailed
account of the method employed by each. Thankful acknowledgments
are due to the various Government officials and to a large number of
others who have courteously responded to this inquiry. A large amount
of interesting information on this subject has been thus collected, which
will be properly digested and published by the Institution hereafter.

The usual activity in the preparation and publication (through the
agency of the Interior Department) of the “Bulletins” and ‘“ Proceed-
ings” of the United States National Museum has been displayed during
the past year.

Bulletin No. 24 of the Museum has been issued, and eqnsists of a
“ Check-list of North American Reptilia and Batrachia, with catalogue
of specimens in the United States National Museum, by H. C. Yarrow,
M. D., honorary curator of the department of reptiles.” This work
may be regarded as a revision and extension of the excellent list pre-
pared for the Museum by Prof. Edward D. Cope, and published in 1875
in Bulletin No. 1. The material selected as a reserve stock for the Mu-
seum, including typical forms heretofore described, those identified by
Professor Cope in his original study of the museum reptiles, those of the
same species found in different geographical areas, and those character-
ized by any abnormality in parts, coloration, or scale covering, forms &
collection of over 4,000 specimens, illustrating 469 species, and is be-
lieved to form a series unrivaled by that of any American museum.
The large extension of material here indicated is mainly due to the dis-
covery of new species and sub-species in California and Lower Califor-
nia by Messrs. Gustav Hisen and L. Belding, and in Texas by Professor
Cope and Mr. Marnock.

The first part of the work consists of a simple “ check-list” of the 469
species, in which an attempt has been made to introduce some kind of
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

uniformity in the popular designation of a species, to supersede the
numerous local names in use, by giving an English equivalent of the
technical Latin and Greek titles employed by naturalists. The next,
and larger portion of the work is devoted to a specification of the locality,
source, and nature of the various preserved examples of each species,
with a biblographical reference to a good published description thereof.
Following this is a ‘ List of specimens desired by the National Museum,”
numbering in all 132, of which, however, 78 are duplicates wished for
of examples already in the collection, leaving but 54 new species desired
to complete the Museum series. The whole is followed by copious in-
dexes ; Ist, to the generic and specific names; 2d, to the common names;
3d, to the localities whence obtained ; 4th, to the names of contributors;
and lastly, the general index. This bulletin forms an octavo volume of
254 pages. This work is to be followed by a supplementary one giving
a careful and concise description of each species of the class. This is
now in preparation.

Bulletin No. 22 of the National Museum has been published during
the year. Itis entitled ‘‘Guide to the Flora of Washington and vicinity,”
by Lester F. Ward. The work, besides the catalogue of the flora of the
District, with full notes, contains a sketch of the early botanical labors
undertaken by former students, the range of the flora, notices of local-
ities of special interest, the flowering-time of plants, and many interest-
ing facts relating to autumnal flowering, albinos, and double flowers, a
statistical view of the flora, a comparison with others, notes upon abun-
dant and scarce species, classification, common names, &c. There is also
included a check-list of the plants for the use of those who may be form-
ing herbaria and an excellent map of the region considered. An ap-
pendix is devoted to directions for collecting, which gives ample instruc-
tion for the preparation of an herbarium, the collection, preservation,
and identification of plants, as well as the proper way to arrange dupli-
cates for readily making exchanges. This is also published in separate
form as No. 460 of Smithsonian series. A full and complete index forms
a useful feature of the work, the whole making an octavo volume of 265
pages.

Another Bulletin of the National Museum, No. 11, which had been for
a long time in the hands of the printer, was issued during 1882. It is
entitled ‘‘ Bibliography of the Fishes of the Pacific Coast of the United
States to the end of 1879,” by Theodore Gill. The author gives an
enumeration in chronological order of the memoirs and articles of all
kinds that have been published on the fishes of the Pacifie coast of the
United States. The Bulletin forms an octavo volume of 77 pages.

The important work of Mr. Samuel H. Scudder, referred to in the
report for 1880, relative to the names which have been given by writers
on natural history to genera, has been published in part during the
year. It forms Bulletin No. 19 of the National Museum, and is entitled
“¢ Nomenclator Zoologicus. An alphabetical list of all generic names
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

that have been employed by naturalists for recent and fossil animals
from the earliest times to the close of the year 1879.” In two parts.
Part I. “ List of Generic names employed in Zoology and Paleontology
to the close of the year 1879, chiefly supplemental to those catalogued
by Agassiz and Marschall, or indexed in the Zoological Record.” It
forms an octavo volume of 398 pages.

Of the class of “ Proceedings of the National Museum,” volume IV
has been published. This work, commenced in April 1881, printed by
signatures as matter was prepared, and completed in August, 1882,
comprises biological and other notices by S. F. Baird, T. H. Bean, C.
Bendire, C. H. Boyd, W. E. Carlin, W. H. Dall, F. M. Endlich, W. G.
Farlow, C. H. Gilbert, T. Gill, W.C. W. Glazier, G. Brown Goode, G. W.
Hawes, E. Ingersoll, S. H. Johnson, D. 8S. Jordan, P. L. Jouy, G. N.
Lawrence, W. N. Lockington, O. Lugger, C. L. McKay, M. A. Moore,
A. Pirz, F. M. Plateau, J. Y. Porter, R. Rathbun, C. Rau, R. Ridgway,
J. A. Ryder, R. W. Shufeldt, R. Smith, S. B. Smith, L. Stejneger, F.
W. True, L. F. Ward, and C. A. White. These papers are followed by
anappendix of 141 pages, comprising 18 circulars issued by the Museum.
The whole forms an octavo volume of 680 pages, illustrated by 1 plate
of 15 figures, and by 15 figures in the text.

For several years past, under the co-operation of the Smithsonian
Institution and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, a collec-
tion has been made of the data obtainable as to the relative heights of
points over the surface of the continent of North America, with a view
to gather these together for permanent record and publication, and to
form the groundwork of a hypsometrieal map.

This colleggion has been intrusted to Mr. W. L. Nicholson, topog-
rapher of the Post-Office Department, who has devoted as much leisure
time as he could command to the extensive correspondence required and
to the co-ordination of the large mass of material gathered. But the
engrossing nature of the duties of his office, having delayed the progress
of this work, a transfer has been made during the past year of all this
material from the-Smithsonian Institution—under whose more imme-
diate direction the work has been prosecuted—tv the Coast and Geo-
detic Survey, one of whose officers may be assigned for the continuation
of this important subject.

Smithsonian Annual Report.—I regret to state that up to this time, the
annual report of the Regents for 1881 has not been published. It was
transmitted to Congress on the Ist of March, 1582, and has ever since
been in the hands of the Public Printer.

This work includes the usual Journal of Proceedings of the Board of
Regents, with the reports of the Secretary, of the Executive Committee,

ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS BY TELEGRAPH.

The service undertaken by the Institution in 1863, in the interests of
astronomicakscience, of acting as the central medium of reception and
transmission of telegraphic announcements of discoveries, continues to
be rendered, with general satisfaction to observers. It is of course
understood that this Institution is merely the channel of an international
exchange of astronomical research, and that it undertakes to act only
as the intermediary between foreign and domestic observatories, though
it has long been a desideratum to have the announcements of American
discoveries fully distributed in our own country—a result which has
to some extent been effected by the constant practice of the Institution
to have both foreign and American discoveries promptly transmitted
to the New York and National Associated Press for immediate publi-
cation.

The Atlantic Cable Company and the Western Union Telegraph
company still continue with their accustomed liberality to forward
the Smithsonian dispatches free of charge; an enlightened apprecia-
tion of the public value of such researches, and a courted&s and hearty
co-operation in scientific work which should always receive our most
thankful recognition.

The following is the list of astronomical discoveries of minor planets
and comets made during the past year:

Tt will be noticed that while only one new planetoid was observed in
1881 (the year of the last report), eleven have been discovered in the
year 1882. The irregularity of numbers added to the list in successive
years has not been observed to follow any assignable rule. The follow-
ing table gives a synopsis of the whole range of planetoidal discovery
by years, including the first four leading bodies of the group observed
at the beginning of the present century:

From this table it is seen that while only 13 of these bodies had been
detected in the first half of the century, the remaining 218 all belong to
the past thirty-two years. Or, while the first quarter gave 4, the second
quarter gave 9, the third quarter 144, and the last quarter gives the
still higher rate of more than 10 per annum. Or, still more specifically
(following the columns of the table), the first forty-seven years gave 8,
the next seven years 25, the next seven years 39, the next seven years
35, the next seven years 50, and the last seven years 74.

The following brief notice of these interesting objects has been kindly
furnished by Prof. Asaph Hall, of the U. S. Naval Observatory.

‘“Comet I, 1882, was discovered by Charles 8. Wells at the Dudley
Observatory, Albany, N. Y., March 17, 1882. Observations were made
in the southern hemisphere until July 25,1882. No definitive orbit has
been determined yet, but probably the orbit is nearly parabolic.” [That
is, a very elongated ellipse. |
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“Comet II, 1882, was the great comet of the year. It was seen with
the naked eye, at many places in the northern hemisphere; but the
first accurate observations seem to be those made by Mr. Finlay at
the Cape of Good Hope on September 7. This comet was very
bright, and was remarkable on account of several condensed parts that
were seen in its nucleus, and which led to statements of a separation
of this nucleus. But these brighter parts were always connected by
fainter parts of the coma. It is probable that these apparent separa-
tions have led to discordancies in the observations, which will make it
difficult to combine the numerous positions of this comet into a homo-
geneous system. Several elliptic orbits have been computed, the pe-
riodic times varying from five hundred to a thousand years.”

‘Comet 11f 1882, was a faint object. It was discovered by Mr. E. E.
Barnard, at Nashville, Tenn., September 13, 1882. Observations were
made in the southern hemisphere on December 8, and probably it was
followed longer. The orbit seems to be parabolic.”

The wide interest felt by astronomers in the Smithsonian interna-
tional announcements of planetary and cometary discoveries is evinced
by the number of proposals and suggestions received at the Institution,
for increasing the range and efficiency of the service. On one hand,
frequent applications have been made to the Institution urging that
American discoveries should be widely telegraphed at home as well as
abroad. On another, it has been repeatedly urged that in view of the
comparatively ephemeral character of the appearances of most of the
comets, frequent and prompt announcements should be telegraphed of
observed changes of position from day to day, as well as of provisional
computations of orbits. Valuable as such early information would evi-
dently be, the Institution has not been able (in the support of its other
multitudinous interests) to incur the additional expense of such trans-
missions. And the liberality of the various telegraphic companies has.
already been so extended beyond original purpose and proposal, that
we can hardly, with propriety, solicit this large increase of concession.

The “Science Observer,” published at Boston, has (with a commend-
able enterprise), in connection with the Harvard College Observatory,
entered this field of active usefulness, and by means of “special cir-
culars” has acceptably supplemented the work of the Institution in this.
department. The peculiar cable code employed by the ‘ Science Ob-
server” has not however commended itself for adoption by the Smith-
sonian Institution.

There has been some difference of opinion among astronomers as to
the best form of presentation of the elements of position of a new comet
or planetoid. From want of care, or of attention by some to the pub-
lished formule in announcing their discoveries, difficulties of interpre-
tation have occasionally arisen. A portion of the correspondence of
the Institution on this subject is given in the appendix to this report.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The Smithsonian system, so long conducted with benefit to libraries
and individuals in this country and abroad, has received new impetus
and extension during the past year. I have already referred to an
elaborate history of the system, and of the efforts made to promote in-
terchange of the literary and scientific productions of different countries,
published by the Institution during the year, and it is only necessary
here to present the usual statistics of the service. For a full account
of the details of operations I refer to Mr. Boehmer’s report in the ap-
pendix.

The total number of establishments outside of the United States with
which correspondence and exchange have been conducted amounts to
3,726, an increase of about 800 over the list of 1881. The number of
packages received from Europe for distribution in the United States
during the past year amounted to 7,187; the number of packages from
the United States received for transmission abroad has amounted to
19,292; making an aggregate of 26,479 packages.

The parcels received from Europe for distribution in America are
generally forwarded to their respective destinations in smaller bundles,
or in paper wrappers. The parcels received for transmission to foreign
countries are carefully packed in boxes. Of these there were shipped
during the past year 422, occupying a bulk of 2,950 cubic feet, and
weighing 105,500 pounds.

AS ete tatone: the Institution is greatly indebted to the lines of ocean
steamers between the United States and other countries of the world;
and grateful acknowledgment is due particularly to the agents of the
following companies for the continuation of their important favors in
the free transmission of Smithsonian packages: Anchor Steamship Com-
pany, Atlas Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique,
Cunard Steamship Company, Hamburg American Packet Company,
Inman Steamship Company, Merchants’ Line of Steamers, Netherlands
American Steam Navigation Company, New York and Brazil Steamship
Company, New York and Mexico Steamship Company, North German
Lloyd Steamship Company, Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Pacific
Steam Navigation Company, Panama Railroad Company, Steamship
Lines for Brazil, Texas, Florida, and Nareat N. P., White Cross Line
of Antwerp.

The railroad companies connecting Washington and Baltimore and
New York have also continued their favor of special rates of charges for
freight. These are the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, and the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad.

Acknowledgments are also due to the foreign ministers and consuls
of the various Governments for their assistance in taking charge of the
packages intended for the countries which they respectively represent
and transmitting them with care to their destination.

Government Document Exchange.—In addition to its general function of
intermediary between the institutions of the New World and the Old,
the Smithsonian Institution has been for some years the agent of the Goy-
ernment for the exchange of public documents and other official publi-
cations, in the interest of the Library of Congress, and under the provis-
ions of law. By act of Congress, fifty copies of all publications of the
United States Government, whether ordered for the use of Congress or
of the Departments, are available for distribution, under the direction
of the Joint Library Committee of the two houses of Congress, to such
foreign Governments as agree to make a corresponding return. These
returns, when received, are forwarded directly to the Library of Con-
gress, without being entered on the records of this Institution. A
detailed report in an appendix gives all the information possessed un-
der this head, including the aggregate of such distribution, the agencies
through which it has been effected, ane the parties ened in the
exchange. <

double sets having been discontinued.

LIBRARY.

The large increase in the number of books and pamphlets received in
1881 (the total number amounting to 11,959 pieces) has been well main-
tained during 1882, by the accession of 11,789 pieces, as detailed in the
following statement. This, compared with the 8,570 pieces received in
1880, represents a very gratifying increase.

te already explained, the books and articles received by the Smith-
sonian Institution (excepting only such as are needed for immediate
reference by the specialists of the Institution and National Museum)
are deposited at once in the Library of Congress, and represent a very
large part of the mass there which is at present calling so earnestly for
proper accommodation.

Reference has been made in a preceding report to the arrangements
for obtaining a special library for the service of the National Museum;

H. Mis. 26——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the effort being made in all cases to secure duplicate copies of the trans-
actions, monographs, &c.; one to be transferred to the Library of Con-
gress, the other to be placed in the library in question.

The report of Mr. True, in charge of the National Museum Library,
shows a stock of nearly 10,000 volumes and pamphlets; nearly all du-
plicates, as already explained, with the exception of certain works pre-
sented by myself. In the increasing amount of routine work with which
I am charged in the several capacities of Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, Director of the National Museum, and Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries, it has become entirely out of the question to con-
tinue those special researches in zoology, to which I devoted so much
time in the early years of my connection with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, and for which I had accumulated, at my own expense, a large
number of important works. These I have now formally presented to
the Library of the National Museum, feeling assured that they will do
the most good in that connection.

The most important source of supply to the Library of the National
Museum consists in the direct exchanges of publications for those of
foreign museums, and of scientific societies, and of specialists in natu-
ral history. Little, if anything, however, comes in not obtained under
similar circumstances by the exchanges of the Smithsonian Institution.

Under the regulations of the Museum, the curators in charge of special
divisions are permitted to withdraw from the central library all works
relating exclusively to the departments of which they have charge.
Mixed works, however, or those covering the scope of at least two or
more divisions, are retained in the central library; a record of the
transfer being kept in the central office, so that an applicant for a par-
ticular book can be directed to the office where it is to be found.

It is very desirable that some arrangement be made by which a rec-
ord of all books in the various public libraries in Washington can be
kept in some central office; so that a person wishing to refer to a par-
ticular title may have the means of knowing whether it is in the city,
and which of several depositories may be the most convenient to him.
This can best be done through the natural center of reference—the
Library of Congress.

If a law were passed making it obligatory upon the librarians of the
various Departments, Bureaus, &c., to prepare card catalogues accord-
ing to the rules of the Congressional Library, and to deposit therein a
duplicate set, they could be then collectively arranged in proper alpha-
betival or systematic sequence, and be available for the objects in ques-
tion. Of course this would involve a considerable amount of clerical
labor, but a moderate appropriation might be made to meet it at the
outset; after which the annual accretions of the libraries could easily be
recorded without extra expense.

The following is a statement of books, pamphlets, maps, and charts

received by the Smithsonian Institution during the year 1882, and trans-
ferred to the Library of Congress or to that of the National Museum:

NECROLOGY.

I have to record the lamented death of Mrs. HARRIET A. HENRY,
widow of Professor HENRY, which took place in this city on the 25th of
last March. This estimable lady, a native of Schenectady, N. Y., whose
maiden name was Harriet L. Alexander, was married to Prof. Joseph
Henry, at Albany, N. Y., in May, 1850. For forty-eight years she en-
joyed a happy domestic life, respected and beloved by all who knew
her. The death of her honored husband in 1878 was a severe blow,
from which she never fully recovered.

The melancholy duty devolves upon me of announcing the death
of two employés of the Smithsonian Institution during the past year.
The two whose loss I have to record are Dr. George W. Hawes, curator
of the department of mineralogy and economic geology in the National
Museum, who died on the 22d of June, 1882; and Mr. Joseph B. Her-
ron, janitor of the National Museum, who died on the 9th of April,
1882.

The following sketch of the life and scientific labors of Dr. Hawes

has been prepared by Mr. F. P. Dewey, curator of metallurgy in the
National Museum:
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

“GEORGE WESSON HAWES, son of Rev. Alfred Hawes and Clarissa
P. Partridge, was born December 31, 1849, at Marion, Ind., where his
father was engaged in missionary labor. But a small portion of his
life, however, was spent in his native place, as both his parents died
when he was quite young, in consequence of which the family was
broken up, and he removed to Worcester, Mass., where he was taken
care of and brought up by kind friends. His early education and prep-
aration for the Sheffield Scientific School was obtained in the public
schools of Worcester. In 1865 he becamea member of the Sheffield Sci-
entific School at New Haven, where he remained two years, at the end of
which time he went to Boston to go into business. Business life, how-
ever, did not at all suit him, as his natural love for science and investi-
gation and the acquirement of knowledge for its own sake was unusually
Strong, so that, despite a very flattering offer to remain in Boston, in
1871 he returned to New Haven, and graduated from the Sheffield
Scientific School in 1872.* The year after graduation he was Prof. 8.
W. Johnson’s private assistant in his laboratory at New Haven. At
the beginning of the college year 1873, he became assistant to Prof.
Geo. J. Brush, and instructor in mineralogy and blowpipe in the Shef-
field Scientific School, a position which he filled very successfully and
uninterruptedly until 187 8, and with some intermissions until the end
of 1880. His duties in this position were very congenial to his tastes
and allowed him to devote considerable time to his favorite studies
and lay a permanent foundation for his after work. It was during the
early portion of this period that microscopic lithology began to come
into prominence, and he was among the first in this country to study
that subject carefully and thoroughly, and so impressed was he with its ,
possibilities that he made it his specialty and during the remainder of
his life gave it his best efforts, doing all in his power to aid in its devel-
opment. He was so successful that at the time of his death he was the
recognized authority upon the subject in this country. In the spring
of 1878, he went abroad and spent the summer semester at Breslau,
under Prof. A. Von Laslaux, studying chiefly microscopic lithology. The
winter of 187879 was spent at New Haven, and in the spring of 1879
he again went abroad and remained until June, 1880. During this visit
he divided his time between mineralogy and crystallography at Bonn,
with Professor Vem Rath, and lithology at Heidelberg, with Professor
Rosenbusch, from whom he won golden opinions. Before returning he
took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the latter university. The
remainder of 1880 was spent at New Haven, but at the end of November
he was appointed a special agent of the tenth census to investigate the
quarry industry of the United States, and on the 1st of January, 1881,
curator of the geological department in the National Museum, which
occasioned his removal to Washington, D. C.

“The summer of 1872 was passed at Eastport, Maine, one of the party of the
United States Fish Commission, then prosecuting its fishery investigations in the
waters of the Bay of Fundy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SE

‘“<Up to this time his life, although quite prolific in results, had been
mainly one of study and preparation, and very few, indeed, of his age
could be found so well prepared to undertake extensive and far-reaching
investigations. Upon coming to Washington the investigation of the
quarry industries of the country, which was undertaken under the joint
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and the census, opened up a
broad and almost unoccupied field for his activities, and he undertook it
with all the earnestness and zest of one well prepared and confident of
accomplishing much good in the increase of knowledge. The plan of this
workas laid out by Dr. Hawes was very broad and comprehensive in its
scope. Besides the collection, arrangement, and study of the statistics
of the industries, it included the study and description of the occurrence
and preparation of building stones; the collection of specimens from all
the regions of production which, when properly dressed, should form a
graphic representation of the natural materials of construction of the
whole country; the thorough examination of these specimens microscop-
ically, chemically and physically; and, in fact, the thorough and com-
plete study of the subject in all its branches; so that had he lived to
complete the work there can be no doubt that it would have been very
fruitful of good results. His earnestness and zeal, however, led him to
overtax himself, and it was not long before it became evident to his
friends, although not to himself, that his health was being seriously
undermined; but near the end of the year even he became alarmed at
the evident signs of consumption that had developed themselves, and
he decided to take a respite from active work, which he did by a trip to
Bermuda. This, however, failed to afford any relief, and he gradually
sank after his return, until finally, as a last resort, he went to Colorado.
But the disease was too far advanced to be checked, and he lived but a
short time after his arrival in Colorado. The final dissolution came
rather suddenly, as up to the day before his death he was able to be up
and dressed and about the house. His remains were interred at Wor-
cester, Mass., June 28.

_ “The removal of one so well prepared and adapted to undertake exten-
sive investigations is a great loss to the world of science. Had he lived
there can be no doubt that he would have reached many valuable re-
sults, and his untimely death was sadly deplored by all who knew him.
Dr. Hawes’s contributions to science were mainly in the line of his spec-
ialty—microscopic lithology—and consist of some twenty articles pub-
lished in the American Journal of Science; three in the Proceedings of
the National Museum; an annual report upon geology and mineralogy
in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1880, and part Iv
of Volume III of the Report of the Geological Survey of New Hamp-
shire, entitled the ‘Mineralogy and Lithology of New Hampshire’. The
latter covers 251 pages quarto, embellished by twelve plates, and is his
mostvaluableandimportant completed work. It includes the results of
the examination of between two and three hundred thin sections of rocks,
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

some of which were very important andinstructive. Thisreport embodies
the results of much field work; containing much careful, honest labor
and establishing the author’s reputation as a microscopic lithologist,
which was afterwards strengthened by further studies under Professor
Rosenbusch. Of the results achieved by Dr. Hawes in the examination
of the building stones of the country little can be said, as it was a work
of great magnitude, requiring a great deal of care and exertion for its
proper inauguration, and he had barely gotten the investigation into
good working condition when he was obliged to abandon its prosecu-
tion, much against his will. Personally, Dr. Hawes wasa very pleasant
and genial man, and possessed a remarkable faculty of making warm
friends wherever he went. Although his immediate family relatives
were few in number and widely scattered, his death was mourned by
a large number who had been won to him by the sterling qualities of his
character, his truth, purity, unselfishness, and earnestness. The writer
had the pleasure of being one of his first students in blowpiping and
also of being associated with him in his work upon the building stones,
and is abundantly able to speak of the nobleness of his character, and
thus to bear testimony to the warm regard in which he held him.”

JOSEPH B. HERRON, a native of the State of Ohio, was born Au-
gust 7, 1839, at New Cumberland, Tuscarawas County. He was en-
gaged in the military service of his country at the period of the late
civil war, having enlisted in 1862, in the 98th Regiment of Ohio Volun-
teers, at the age of 23 years.

It was but a few months after his enrollment in the national defense
that he took part in the battle of Perryville, Ky., on which occasion he
received a bullet wound through his body, the ball entering the chest
on the left side, passing through his lung obliquely, narrowly escaping
the heart, and out at his back on the right side of the spinal column,
near the right shoulder blade. He unfortunately lay on the battle-field
from Wednesday until Saturday before receiving any medical attendance.
From the effects of this severe and dangerous wound he never fully
recovered. He was, however, restored to a moderate degree of health
and strength, and was able to attend to light duties.

In 1866, on the recommendation of General J. A. Garfield and Gen-
eral E. R. Eckley, he was appointed by Professor Henry janitor of the
Museum at the Smithsonian Institution, which position he held until
his death. He was always gentle and courteous in his deportment; and
though the injury to his lungs incapacitated him for exerting any
special activity, or apy great physical effort, he was always punctual
and attentive to his duties. He was a member of the Society of the
“ Army of the Cumberland,” and of the “Grand Army of the Republic.”
He was one of the Guards of Honor to the remains of President Garfield
while they lay at the Capitol in Washington, and accompanied the
funeral of the deceased President from this city to Cleveland. In these
exertions he probably overtasked his strength; for on returning to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

this city from the state funeral, he went into a somewhat rapid decline,.
and though able to walk about his house to the last day of his life, he
died rather suddenly of pulmonary consumption at his residence in
Washington, on Sunday morning, April 9th at 7 o’clock, at the age of
' 43 years, after a service in this Institution of sixteen years.

One of the collaborators of the Institution, whose death we have to
deplore, is LEw1is H. MorGAN, author of a very original and elaborate
‘Smithsonian Contribution to Knowledge.” He was born in Aurora,
Cayuga County, New York, November 21, 1818, and died at Rochester,
N. Y., December 17, 1881. His first communication, published by the
Institution, was a short paper comprising “Suggestions relative to an
Ethnological Map of North America,” which appeared in the Smithson-
ian Report for 1861. Devoting himself to the study of anthropology,
he published various treatises in relation to the North American Indians.
His most important work is a discussion of ‘‘Systems of Consanguinity
and Affinity of the Human Family,” a large quarto of 616 pages, which
forms Volume XVII of the “Smithsonian Contributions,” published in
1869. His last work, entitled ‘‘ Houses and Homelife of the American
Aborigines,” forms Volume IV of the Contributions to American Eth-
nology.

It is also my painful duty to announce the death of another esteemed
collaborator and eminent man of science, Dr. HENRY DRAPER, of New
York, a son of the distinguished philosopher, Dr. John Draper, and a
member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was born in Vir-
‘ginia, May 7, 1837, and died in New York, November 20, 1882, at the
age of 45 years, in the prime of his mental activity and usefulness. He
distinguished himself by his original researches in astronomy, chem-
istry, and in celestial photography. In recognition of his valuable
work in connection with the transit of Venus in 1874, a gold medal
was struck in his honor, by order of Congress, at the Philadelphia mint.
Perhaps his most celebrated work was the difficult discovery, in 1877,
of oxygen in the sun.

Like most original investigators he was a skillful manipulator and
artisan. He prepared for the Institution in 1864 a memoir “On the
construction of a silvered glass telescope, fifteen and a half inches in
aperture, and its use in celestial photography,” which was published
in the “Smithsonian Contributions,” Vol. XIV. This work has been
very popular, and is recognized as the standard authority on the sub-
ject. The demand for it has been constant, and still continues.

In the death of JoSsEPH DUNCAN PUTNAM, president of the Davenport
Academy of Sciences, and one of the correspondents of the Institution,
December, 10, 1881, a great loss has been sustained by the workers in
natural history and anthropology, particularly in the western part of
our country. He was a valued correspondent of the Institution and
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

devoted himself untiringly and unselfishly to the advance of science
and the elevation of public sentiment in regard to abstract research.

In the death of Don FRANCISCO SUMICHRAST, of Tonali, Mexico, on
the 26th December, the Institution lost one of its oldest and most valued
correspondents outside of the United States.

This gentleman (a Swiss by birth) was occupied for many years in a
close and critical study of the natural history of Mexico; the stations
occupied by him being Orizaba, Tuchitan, Tonala, &c.; the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec having received special attention from him.

The numerous contributions of specimens of natural history of the
country, with notes upon their habits and characteristics, especially
birds, mammals, and reptiles, have given to the National Museum a
large material, and enabled the Institution to publish a number of ex-
tremely valuable memoirs. One of these was edited by Dr. Thomas M.
Brewer, and another by Mr. George N. Lawrence, of New York.

It is proper to state that all the assistance rendered by Professor
Sumichrast to the Institution was done without any compensation
whatever, and solely for the sake of securing a prompt and complete
knowledge of the natural history of his adopted country.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Mercer Bequest.—Among various noteworthy items in connection
with the history of the Smithsonian Institution during the year 1882,
may be mentioned the circumstance of its being made a copartner in
the administration of a beneficiary trust, by Rev. Dr. Mercer, of New- -
port, R. I. That gentleman, dying on the 3d day of November, 1882,
left quite a large property, a portion of which was to be paid directly to
certain specified heirs, and the interest on the remainder to be given
to persons mentioned during their lifetime. After the decease of these
beneficiaries, the property was to be divided into three parts; of which
one-third was to be administered by a Beard, consisting of Harvard
College, Yale College, and the Smithsonian Institution; together with
three individuals mentioned, or their survivors, to establish scholar-
ships in some institution for the education of deserving and needy young
men. Although the money cannot be used directly by the Smithsonian
Institution, yet there seems to be no impropriety in accepting the trust
under the conditions named. It is not likely, however, that any occa-
sion for administering it will arise for probably a quarter of a century
to come.

In the history of the Institution thus far three bequests have been
made to it. The first was that of the residuary legateeship of the prop-
erty belonging to Mr. Wynne, who died in LBrooklyn, N. Y., the estate
being valued at the time at from $50,000 to $60,000. As, however, the
daughter married, and is, as far as known, still living, with a large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

family of children and grandchildren, the chances of an inheritance by
the Smithsonian Institution are practically none.

The next bequest was that of $1,000, made by Mr. James Hamilton,
of Carlisle; and the third and last, by Dr. Habel, amounting, with a
small addition made from the income of the Smithsonian Institution,
to $500; or $1,500, the two combined.

These two sums have been, in accordance with the law, paid into the
Treasury of the United States, as an addition to the principal.

The endowment of the Smithsonian Institution, at the present time,
amounts to $703,000, deposited in the United States Treasury, and it is
authorized to increase this amount to $1,000,000. A large part of the
expenses of the Institution consists in what may be called statical items,
such as salaries, repairs of building, &c.; and it is very evident that
the amount available for active operations is not at all represented by
the annual income of the fund. It is quite probable that the increase of
the endowment by 40 or 50 per cent. would permit the Institution nearly
to double the work accomplished, as it would require no increase of
force or incidental expenditure.

Naval Cadets.—In the American naval service, the cadets start with
four years’ study in the Naval Academy at Annapolis. They are then
sent to sea for two years, and do not obtain the rank of midshipman
until they have passed an examination at the end of this period, or of
six years after their entrance. They are then sent to sea again, or
placed on waiting orders.

About a year ago the Navy Department made inquiry of the Smith-
sonian Institution as to its willingness to receive six recently appointed
midshipmen, and assign them to some duty in the Institution or National
Museum that would enable them to take advantage of any opportuni-
ties they might have for natural-history research during their future
cruises, with the understanding that they were to be treated in every
way as regular employés of the Institution, and required to do regular
work.

The proposition was responded to favorably and the six cadets were
assigned respectively to the curators of Ichthyology, Marine Inverte-
brates, Ethnology, Paleontology, Geology, and Mineralogy. The expe-
riment, somewhat unexpectedly, has proved to be a very great success.
The young gentlemen devoted themselves earnestly to their work, and
became quite proficient in it.

A course of special instruction was given in regard to the taxidermy
of mammals and birds, which all the midshipmen attended with great
diligence, becoming quite expert in the preparation of skeletons and
in making excellent skins of mammals and birds.

The two assigned to ichthyology and marine invertebrates were de-
tailed for service on board the Fish Commission steamer “ Fish Hawk,”

where they had ample opportunity of becoming familiar with collecting
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

at sea; as also with the methods and appliances of deep-sea dredging, -

temperature observations, &c., all, of course, directly in the line of their
future vocation.

The other four accompanied one or the other of Professor Powell’s
parties into the Far West, and have had every opportunity for field work.

The results of this experiment were so satisfactory that six more mid-
shipmen have been detailed to the Institution, the first six to continue
another year, making the entire course one of two years.

The selections for this detail are made by the Navy Department afier
conference with the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, from among
those who, while pursuing their educational course, have shown most
interest in scientific matters.

The measure is extremely popular among the younger oflicers, although
of course it is decried by others, who consider it an innovation in the
established routine.

One special object of the experiment is to have, as a part of the regu-
lar force of the Navy, officers competent to do the scientific work for
which it has generally been necessary to employ civilians, as also on
any cruise to be able to utilize, to some extent at least, the opportunities
of research which constantly present themselves to the inquirer.

The following is an account of the work accomplished by these young
officers, now recognized by law as “ Ensigns”:

Of the class of ’79, six were ordered to the Institution early in Janu-
ary, 1882.

Ensign Rk. H. Miner chose ichthyology, made a summer cruise on
the “Fish Hawk,” resumed his studies in the fall, and was detached in
December and ordered to the Fish Commission steamer “ Albatross.”

i, HE. Hayden chose mineralogy, went on the U. 8S. Geological Sur-
vey to Nevada, and in the winter took up the study of fossil botany.

H. S. Chase chose mineralogy, went on a geological expedition to
Montana in the summer, and is now studying the same branch.

I. M. Garret chose geology, was in Montana in the summer, and
has resumed the same branch.

C. OC. Marsh chose ethnology, went on an ethnological expedition to
Moquis, Ariz., in the summer, and has since taken up fossil botany.

J. B. Blish chose marine invertebrates, went on the “ Fish Hawk”
in the summer, resumed the same branch in the fall, and was lately
detached at his own request and ordered to the ‘“‘ Jamestown.”

Of the class of ’80, six were detailed last fall.

H, G. Dresel is studying ichthyology.

J. B. Bernadou is engaged in the chemical laboratory in quantitative
and qualitative analysis and assaying.

A. A. Ackerman is studying mineralogy.

A. P. Niblack is studying ethnology.

EH. Wilkinson has chosen mineralogy.

s
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

W. H. Safford has chosen marine invertebrates.

Each one is engaged in the practical work of the respective depart-
ments in identifying, and classifying, as far as able, the collections
received from various sources.

Special Objects received.~Among the articles received during the year

may be mentioned a lock of Sir Walter Scott’s hair presented by Hon.
George Ainslee, Delegate in Congress from Idaho, whose father was a
neighbor and friend of Scott. The presentation was made through one
of our regents, Hon. S. 8. Cox.

A fine large specimen of agate, found off Keweenaw Point, in Lake
Michigan, near Manitou Island (which lies off the shores of Northern
Michigan) by S. H. Broughton, has been received by the Institution. It
was left to the Smithsonian Institution by bequest of the late Mrs.
Broughton, and was deposited by J. P. Newland, executor of Mrs.
Broughton’s will.

Set of United States Weights and Measures.—By act of Congress, March
3, 1881, the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to deliver to the
Smithsonian Institution a complete set of all the weights and measures
adopted as standard by the United States Government.

Naval Museum of Hygiene.—Congress having established a “ Naval
Museum of Hygiene” in connection with the Bureau of Medicine and
Surgery of the Navy Department, we have, in accordance with the prin-
ciple of co-operation adopted by the Institution, placed in its custody
a large exhibit of tile and terra-cotta pipe, for sewers and traps, and
other articles having sanitary relations.

Manuscript Declaration of Independence.—In the report for 1880 refer-
ence was made to the appointment of a commission, of which the Secre-
tary of the Institution was one, to consider the restoration of the faded
and now nearly illegible manuscript of the original Declaration of
Independence. The subject was referred to the National Academy of
Sciences, and a report was made by a special committee on the 17th
January, 1881. Nothing however, has been done in regard to the
matter.

Peale’s Portrait of Washington.—In the last report of the Institution
it was stated that a claim had been made by Mr. Titian R. Peale for a
portrait of Washington painted by his father, Charles Wilson Peale, on
deposit in this establishment. ‘his claim was originally made in 1871.
In 1873 the executive committee reported adversely to the claim, on
the ground that sufficient proof of ownership of the portrait had not
been presented.

During the last session of Congress, however, the matter was taken
up and investigated, and as the contesting claimants made a compromise
the portrait was finally purchased by the Library Committee of Con-
gress, and it is now the property of the United States.
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The work of organization of the departments of the Museum has been
carried on vigorously during the past year. For a full account of all
its operations I would refer to the report of Mr. G. Brown Goode, the
assistant director, given in the appendix to this report. The fullness
of this account seems to render any résumé of the operations and present
condition of the Museum unnecessary here.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The appropriation made by Congress for the prosecution of ethnolog-
ical researches among the North American Indians, under the direction
of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, was continued, and the
work remained in charge of Maj. J. W. Powell.

Field Work.—A large amount of field work was accomplished during
the year. The general excavation of mounds was placed in the charge
of Prof. Cyrus Thomas, with several assistants, through whose exertions
large collections were made, chiefly in the Mississippi Valley.

Dr. Edward Palmer has continued his explorations in Tennessee and
in Arkansas along the Mississippi, White, and Arkansas Rivers. A
short time was devoted to examination of the mounds and other works
in Southwestern Indiana.

Mr. F. S. Earle was engaged a short time in examining and locating
the mound groups of Southeast Missouri, and in opening mounds and
stone graves in Southern Illinois.

Mr. James D. Middleton, after Mr. Earle withdrew, continued the
work in Southern Illinois until stopped by the cold, when he was trans-
ferred to the South, and is now in Alabama.

Col. P. W. Norris entered upon the work in August, his field of labor
being the west bank of the Mississippi, from Dubuque, Iowa, to the Ar-
kansas line.

Hon. William M. Adams has been engaged to work up the mounds
in Madison County, Illinois, including the Cahokia group. He had
already completed the map of them and commenced opening them when
the co!d weather stopped him.

The result of operations so far may be summed up briefly as follows:

A very good and valuable collection, almost exclusively of mound
relics, consisting of pottery, stone implements, clay and stone images,
clay and stone pipes, plates of mica, gorgets, shell ornaments, engraved
shells, fragments of copper ornaments, fragments of wooden ornaments.
fragments of matting, pieces of burned clay which have been stamped,
an ancient Catholic medal of brass, a brass Chinese medal or coin (the
two latter are surface finds, the first found on a mound in Southern
illinois, the other on the site of an old French fort in Arkansas), quite
a number of crania and tibie. The collection of pottery is quite large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

and includes representatives of all the types hitherto found in the
mounds except one of Ohio and one of Iowa.

The most important results appertain to the mounds and works them-
selves. The statement in the Smithsonian Report of 1872 in reference
to the Elephant mound is confirmed; the Seltzertown mound is proven
to be a myth; at least no sign of it could be found on examination.

The mounds and graves on the Wabash are found to be, to a con-
siderable extent, of Indian origin, and comparatively modern, as shown
by the articles of European manufacture found in them and by the
mode of burial.

Dr. Palmer had with him for a month an excellent artist who has
furnished a number of very valuable drawings of mounds and other
works. From these it is noticed that the mounds of Arkansas are in
many cases quite large and of the truncated pyramidal form, often ter-
raced. Artificial canals and lakes, such as described by Garcilasso and
the Gentleman of Elvas, are found in Northeastern Arkansas. Several
of the hard clay floors of the large houses of the aborigines, as described
by Le Tonti, Joutel, and others, have been found in the very section
visited by these travelers.

An inclosure of considerable size, including mounds and house sites,
precisely such, even to minute details, as that examined by Professor
Putnam, near Lebanon, Tenn., has been discovered in Southern Illi-
nois.

On the whole, the results, considering the time the parties have been
at work, are very satisfactory, and will have a very important bearing
on the question, Who were the mound builders, and what is the age
of the mounds?

Professor Thomas made an examination of some groups of mounds in
Southern Illinois and Southeastern Missouri.

Further successful explorations were conducted in New Mexico and
Arizona, under the immediate superintendence of Mr. James Steven-
son. Mr. Victor Mindeleff was in charge of a party which made ex-
tensive collections in the province of Tusayan, in Arizona, supple-
merting the large collections obtainel in previous years from twenty
or more pueblos in New Mexico. The collections obtained by these
expeditions have been deposited, with proper arrangement, in the Na-
tional Museum, and have been catalogued and described. The field
work, with special reference to linguistic research, has been performed
by Mr. James C. Pilling, who visited several missions along the St.
Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, examining many manuscripts and pro-
curing numerous titles in connection with linguistic bibliography; by
Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith, who continued studies on the Iroquoian dialects
at St. Regis, Caughnanaga, &c.; by Mr. A. 8. Gatschet, who, among the
Shetimasha and other tribes in Louisiana, and by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey,
who, among the Kansas in Indian Territory, studied the respective lan-
guages.
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The visitors to the three last-named regions also pursued other
branches of ethnic research, including social organization, traditions,
and customs; and Dr. W. J. Hoffman was engaged in investigations
in gesture language and pictographs among the several Indian tribes
of California and Western Nevada. The highly valued researches of
Mr. F. H. Cushing among the Zuni pueblos have been continued, sev-
eral months of the year, however, being occupied by his conducting a
delegation of six of those Indians to the East, a course which was im-
portant to his further success.

Publications.—Several publications have been issued by the Bureau
during the year, as follows:

About 500 pages were put in type of Mr. James C. Pilling’s Biblio-
graphy of American linguistics, containing many fac-similes of titles,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

syllabaries, &c. Part 1 of Vol. II of Contributions to North American
Ethnology, consisting of the Klamath-English dictionary, by Mr. A. 8.
Gatschet, with grammatical notes, was put in type; also over 500. pages
of Rev. J. Owen Dorsey’s (iegiha language, and 400 pages of Rev. S.
D. Riggs’ Grammar and dictionary of the Dakota language, which will
appear in Volumes 6 (in three parts) and 7 (in two parts) of the last-
mentioned series.

The papers prepared and intended for the Third Annual Report are
as follows: Introduction to the study of tribe government, by J. W.
Powell, as an introduction to the three following papers, viz: The Mus-
koki confederacy, by J. W. Powell; The government of the Omahas, by
Rev. J. Owen Dorsey; and the government of the Zunis, by I’. H. Cush-
ing; Introduction to the study of pictographs, by Col. Garrick Mallery ;
On certain Maya and Mexican MSS., by Prof. Cyrus Thomas; The art
of weaving among the Navajos, by Dr. Washington Matthews, U.S. A.;
An illustrated catalogue, by W. H. Holmes, of Mr. James Stevenson’s
collection from Zui and Walpi; and two other miscellaneous collec-
tions. Mr. Gatschet has also furnished a paper on the chief deities of
the American Indians.

Work not yet sufficiently complete for immediate publication has
been continued by Mr. Gatschet in the synonymy of the tribes of North
America; by him and Colonel Mallery, on an ethnographic chart of the
distribution of those tribes when first met by Europeans; by Mrs. Er-
minnie A. Smith, on a vocabulary and grammar of several Iroquoian dia-
lects; by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, on Indian industries; by Dr. H. C. Yar-
row in completion of his monograph on Mortuary Observances; and by
Prof. O. T. Mason, on Indian industries. Colonel Mallery has been en-
gaged in completing a monograph on sign language, and collecting the
materials for another on pictographs, these two closely connected subjects
comprising the direct visible expression of ideas, of which the signs are
transient and the pictographs the permanent expressions. Mr. Victor
Mindeleff prepared a relief model of the pueblo of Zuni, on the scale
of one (1) inch to five (5) feet, which is now in the National Museum
and is an object of great interest.

During the year many linguistic MSS. were received from various
collectors.

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

In accordance with the practice of the Institution to supply an an-
nual account of the work of the United States Geological Survey, the
following brief summary, is given, furnished by the courtesy of its
Director, Maj. J. W. Powell:

Of the three phases which the field work of the Survey assumes,
the collection of representative rocks, minerals, and fossils is more
directly and manifestly contributory to the Institution and the Museum
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

under its care, than the topographic and stratigraphic work; but the
whole possesses interest as being part of a common endeavor to develop
and disseminate scientific truth.

Among the operations of the Survey that may be cited in this con-
nection are the following:

Field studies upon the much discussed Laramie group have been
prosecuted in Eastern Montana and Northeastern Dakota, covering
particularly a belt of about 80 miles along the Upper Missouri, and up-
wards of 100 miles adjacent to the Yellowstone, resulting in large col-
lections and important stratigraphic data. Similar combined strati-
graphie and paleontologic investigations have been in progress upon
the paleozoic series of the Eureka and Pine River districts of Nevada,
with a view to the more certain determination of the stratigraphy of
those important mining regions. The exploration of the interesting
ancient lake deposits of the Great Basin has been continued, the silts
of the ancient Lake Lahontan being the special subject of study. The
Permian and Carboniferous strata of Northern Arizona, in the vicinity
of Kanab, have been further examined, and important collections made
from them.

One of the more significant subjects of exploration was furnished by
the Grand Cajion group, an immense series of 12,000 feet thickness,
now demonstrated to lie between the upper Cambrian and the crystal-
line Archean rocks. Beside critical stratigraphic work, a large collec-
tion, involving a problematic organic form, was made, which yet awaits
exhaustive study. The investigations in the great mining districts of
Colorado and Nevada have been continued, with a view to supplement-
ing and perfecting the data previously gathered and the extension of the
work to new ground.

Investigations have likewise been in progress upon the great metal-
liferous series of the Lake Superior region, including the practical com-
pletion of the work upon the copper-bearing formation, as at present
planned, and the commencement of that upon the iron-bearing series.

In the interior basin, a special study of the great moraines that mark
the limit of the second glacial advance, and constitute datum lines
of great importance in glacial studies, has been in progress, and
about 3,000 miles of an essentially continuous morainic chain are now
mapped.

In addition to these more comprehensive studies, special collectors
have been in the field, gathering fossils from localities of exceptional
richness, or from critical and decisive horizons. Among these have
been the collections of Tertiary fossils, especially vertebrates, from
Oregon, and of Jurassic and Eocene remains from Wyoming. A special
effort has also been made to secure a full representative collection from
the marine Tertiary beds of the Lower Mississippi Valley.

Triangulation and topographic work, preparatory to geologic inves-
tigation, has been prosecuted in the quicksilver districts of New Alma-

den, New Idria, Knoxville, and Sulphur Bank, California, and also in
the northern part of that State. Similar work has been done in West-
ern New Mexico, in Southern Montana, in Central Colorado, in Western
and Northwestern Nevada, and in the Appalachian region. In the last
district, portions of Southwestern Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Western
North Carolina, and Eastern Tennessee have been covered by primary
triangulation and topographic contours.

Some minor investigations have received attention, and an unusual
amount of office and laboratory work, upon previously gathered material
and in preporation for further studies, has been in progress.

UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

General Object and Results.—Twelve years ago the United States
Fish Commission was established by law of Congress, and under a pro-
vision authorizing the President to select a Commissioner from among
the civilian employés of the Government, to serve without additional
pay, I was chosen and have continued to hold the position ever since.
The work, commencing on a very small scale in the year mentioned,
has broadened until it has now become the most important and ex-
tensive of its kind in the world; and it is hoped that the practical
results gained have vindicated the propriety of the initial experiment
as well as of continuing the work to such a period of time as the case
may require.

First as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and then
as its Secretary, it has been my duty to show to the Board of Regents
the occasion and reason for the occupation of a considerable portion of
my time, and thus to add not an uninteresting chapter to the report of
the Smithsonian Institution.

A detailed report of the doings of the Commission is published an-
nually by order of Congress; that of each year constituting a vol-
ume of nearly one thousand pages, with a considerable number of illus-
trations. In addition to this a Bulletin of the Fish Commission has
been authorized by Congress, to contain short articles of information
and instruction in reference to matters of fish culture and the fisheries.
This is restricted to five hundred pages annually; and this, with the
annual report, forms an annual contribution to practical science on the
part of the United States Government of nearly fifteen hundred pages.
For the more speedy dissemination of the information furnished in the
Bulletin, it is distributed to specialists in fish culture and the fisheries,
aud to the leading newspapers, so that the facts come fresh from the
press, and are largely reproduced in the serial literature of the day.
‘lwo volumes of the Bulletin (for 1881 and 1882) have now been pub-
lished.

The Smithsonian report for 1881 gave an account of what had been
done by the United States Fish Commission during that year, and the

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

general facts for 1882 are not materially different, except to some extent
in regard to the scale of operations.

By act of Congress the work of the Commission is divided into two
subjects: (1) the investigation into the condition of the fishery and the
search for improvements in the methods and products of the fisheries;
and (2) the multiplication and dissemination of the more important
species; the first representing what is known as the inquiry branch of
the Commission, and the second that of propagation.

As the subject of the investigation of the fisheries was that first in-
trusted to the Commission by Congress in 1871—that of the multiplica-
tion of fish not being authorized until the succeeding year—it has gen-
erally been customary to take up the two divisions in that order. The
method of this inquiry has been to visit successively the principal
points along the coast of the United States where research can be pros-
ecuted, establishing stations for a season to study very carefully the
nature and distribution of the animal life, the character of the water as
to temperature, salinity, currents, &c., and the general facts in regard to
methods of prosecuting the fisheries. In this manner, in the course of
successive years, the minute details or conditions of the marine life of
the Atlantic coast, and to a considerable extent that of the Pacific and
the Gulf of Mexico, have been worked out either through the establish-
ment of the stations referred to or by sending special. experts of the
Commission for the purpose. The general results of these investigations
are to be found partly in the published reports of the Commission,
partly in those still in press, and to a very large degree in the special
reports prepared by the Commission for the census of 1880. A quarto
report, ordered by Congress and now in press, will contain a large
amonnt of original information in regard to the natural history and con-
dition of the fishes and useful invertebrates of the ocean, lakes, and
rivers, illustrated by numerous well-executed figures.

The approximate completion of the inshore research has allowed the
Commission to undertake more fully an examination of the deep seas;
anda systematic survey is now being made of the grounds where fish-
ermen have hitherto plied their vocation, with a view of determining
the extent and condition of the fishing banks, and also to find out what
additional localities heretofore undiscovered yet remain to reward the
labors of the “‘toilers of the sea.” Much success has already been experi-
enced in this latter respect, and new and extensive ranges for the prose-
cution of their vocation bave been opened up. It is believed, however,
that much yet remains to be done, and it is hoped that in succeeding
years areas of important fishing ground of great extent will be brought
to light, especially in the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico.

For the better prosecution of this latter research Congress authorized
the construction of a first-class sea-going vessel, and in March, 1882,
the contract was awarded to Messrs. Pusey & Jones, of Wilmington,
Del., for an iron vessel 200 feet long on the water line, 27 feet beam, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

of about 1,000 tons of displacement. Lieut. Z. L. Tanner, U.S. N., at
the time in charge of the steamer “ Fish Hawk,” was assigned to the duty
of the superintendence of its construction, and subsequently to its com-
mand. The vessel was actually completed in December, 1882, and
started on its trial trip to Washington on the last day of the year, ar-
riving in Washington a few days later. This trip, while bringing to
light some points in which alterations and improvements were neces-
sary, presented a very remarkable success in all essential respects, the
boat being extremely stable in the sea-way and promising to answer
admirably the purpose of her construction.

After receiving in Wilmington the necessary alterations the vessel
returned to the Washington navy-yard, and is now being fitted out for
her first trip off the Middle Atlantic coast. It is proposed to devote the
early spring to the special investigation of the movements and habits
of the mackerel and menhaden, with a view of facilitating the search
for these fish on the part of the many fishing vessels of the Atlantic
coast.

The establishments of the Commission, summer by summer, at differ-
ent points on the coast have been already referred to. As this inshore
survey may be considered as practically completed, it was thought desir-
able to establish a permanent station at some convenient point on the
coast, from which the vessels of the Commission could extend their re-
searches to distant points of the ocean, and to which they could return
for the delivery of their collections and material, and for a permanent
harbor. Woed’s Holl, on the south coast of Massachusetts, was chosen
for this purpose, as it offera a convenient center at which to carry on the
work of hatching the sea fish, such as the codfish, the mackerel, hali-
but, and other species on a large scale. For this purpese a point on the
Great Harbor was selected, on which it is proposed to construct the neces-
sary buildings. There being no appropriation by Congress available
for the purpose, liberal friends of science, desirous of seeing the Com-
mission established at Wood’s Holl, contributed the necessary funds
to purchase the land and presented it to the United States; and in ad-
dition to this a large tract of ground forming a part of the water line
was presented by Mr. Joseph 8S. Fay, so that the control of the Commis-
sion was assured over all parts of the shore of the Great Harbor where
there was any danger of erection of buildings or factories likely to emit
poisonous refuse inimical to the work of the Commission. It is hoped
that the next report will chronicle the successful occupation of this
station for the purpose in question.

By the courtesy of the Light-House Board, the laboratory buildings on
the light-house wharf at Wood’s Holl were made use of, as in previous
years; and the “Fish Hawk,” under command of Captain Tanner,
made numerous visits to the adjacent off-shores, bringing in many inter-
esting collections. The most noteworthy result was the ascertaining of
what appeared to be the entire destruction of the tile fish (1eferred to
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the last report) over a large part of its northern range; this in con.
sequence, as is supposed, of the killing of the fish by cold currents ex-
tending beyond their usual limitations. This suspected destruction was
suggested by the discovery of millions of these fish found dead and
floating out in mid-ocean without any apparent indication of disease.

The usual scientific research was continued during the summer at
this station, and, as heretofore, large numbers of duplicate specimens of
natural history were collected for distribution to the colleges and acad-
emies throughout the country. Of these, two hundred sets are in prepa-
ration and will be distributed to that number of applicants. This policy
on the part of the Commission and the Smithsonian Institution is thor-
oughly appreciated by friends of education throughout the country as
farnishing material for instruction in the way of objects themselves, and
making it unnecessary to depend upon imperfect figures and descriptions.

The work of the Commission in the way of propagation of food-fishes
was continued in 1882 on a scale larger than that of previous years.
The general work of the season may be considered as commencing with
the shad in April, ar 1 was carried on for the most part with the two
stations of Washington and Havre de Grace as centers. On the Poto
mac River the practice of the Commission is either to keep men perma-
nently stationed at the different landings or to send them every day to
attend to the haulings of the seines, so that the ripe fish may be taken
as they are brought in, the eggs stripped from them and immediately
fertilized by the milt from accompanying males. The eggs are then
either transferred to the ‘‘ Fish Hawk,” as a floating station, or sent
to the hatching station at the navy-yard, or to the central station in
Washington, heretofore known as the Armory.

Near the close of the season of shad-hatching on the Potomac the
“Fish Hawk” was sent to the Susquehanna River at Havre de Grace,
to renew her work. What is known as Battery Station, the permanent
establishment of the Commission, about five miles below Havre de
Grace, was also in full operation. Here the experiment was first made
by the Commission of catching its own shad by hauling @ seine from
Battery Island. The result was very satisfactory and gives much prom-
ise for the future. The experiment was also initiated of placing partly
unripe fish in a pond on the island until the eggs were sufficiently ma-
tured to permit their being stripped.

The young shad as taken at the stations mentioned were forwarded
by the special cars of the Commission to different parts of the United
States and were planted in many rivers which it is hoped will in time
become the seat of important fisheries, this distribution including both
the fresh-water herring and shad. The total number of shad taken and
distributed during the season amounted to over 30,000,000. This added
to nearly 170,000,000 hatched and distributed in previous years repre-
sents a very important aggregate,—about 200,000,000 of shad planted
in suitable waters.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

A formal request from a large number of the members of the legis-
lature of New York, made through the Hon. Frank Hiscock, for the ser-
vice of the Fish Commission in adding to the supply of shad in the
Hudson River, was responded to by sending an entire car-load of the
young fish and depositing them in the vicinity of Albany.

Next in importance to shad, and perhaps of even greater promise for
the future is the carp, the distribution of which has continued on a
very large scale. It has seemed almost impossible to supply the demand,
coming as it does, from every county of every State in the Union. All
the resources of the Commission are taxed from the first of October
until the first of April or even May in sending out the fish in response
to requests, and very many thousands of ponds are now stocked with
this fish. Its distribution is made partly by express, partly by sending
a certain number in charge of special messengers ; but the most impor-
tant mode is by shipment in cars especially constructed for the Commis-
sion for the purpose. In these as many as 20,000 carp can be loaded
at a time and carried with perfect safety even is far as California and
Western Texas, the fish being delivered to applicants who have been
authorized to apply for them. So far it has been impossible to meet
the demand, and it will probably be many years before the carp are
so thoroughly introduced as to render further action of the Commis-
sion unnecessary. The calls are loud, and equally strong from Wash-
ington Territory, Texas, and Florida as they are from points much nearer
home. It is quite safe to say that more than 15,000 ponds have been con-
structed in the United States especially for the purpose of receiving the
fish bred by the Commission. The promise of the carp as an article of
food is very great, and the fish is considered entitled to rank among the
domesticated animals and to be capable of as profitable cultivation as
poultry or pigs, feeding as it does on the same vegetable matters and
making a considerably larger amount of flesh with the same materials.

The operations in connection with the California salmon have not
been carried on, on as large a scale as usual, in view of the fact that the
fish does not seem adapted to the Eastern waters. A few have been
distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, but the experiment has proved
less satisfactory than had been expected. The several millions placed
every year in the Sacramento River have, however, maintained the
abundance in that stream to a remarkable degree; and it is believed
that at no time since the occupation of the country by the Americans
has the yield been greater.

The work with the Penobscot salmon has continued to be very satis-
factory. A large number of fish hatched out have been planted for the
most part in the streams of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massa-
chusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania, in waters believed
to be best adapted to them. The supply of the salmon in the rivers of
Maine, formerly almost exhausted, has greatly increased and is rapidly
assuming very large proportions. The other States, less adapted, as

-
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

they are, to the growth of the fish, will doubtless yield a fair average
or result. The land-locked salmon—a favorite variety of fish—is also
bred in large numbers and distributed for the most part in lakes in the
States mentioned, as also in Minnesota, Michigan, lowa, and other por-
tions of the West.

The economical importance of the whitefish of the Great Lakes is
fully recognized by the Commission, and the measures begun a few
years ago to multiply it have been largely expanded during the year.

The State of Michigan has been the seat of operations in this direc-
tion, and the work is in charge of Frank N. Clark, at Northville, Mich.
To this station for several years the eggs collected in the adjacent lakes
have been brought, and developed to a degree—either hatched out
entirely or prepared for shipment to other points. During 1882 a second
station was established at Alpena, Mich., and about 70,000,000 of eggs
collected in the two establishments. These are now in process of hatch-
ing, and while a considerable number will be distributed to various
parts of the United States, by far the greater portion will be planted in
Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, where they cannot but ex-
ercise a material influence upon the supply.

The California trout has also received the attention of the Commission.
The idea of multiplying it in the East was first suggested by Mr. Seth
Green, of the New York commission, who several years ago took a
number of the fish to Caledonia Spring, from California, and has since
been distributing them in behalf of the State. As the benefits of this
work were confined to the State of New York, it was thought best for the
Commission to extend them, and several years ago a station was estab-
lished on the McCloud River, a few miles from the California salmon
station, and sub-stations were also started in connection with the estab-
lishment of Mr. Clark at Northville, and at the Virginia State hatchery
at Wytheville. By this means of muitiplication it is expected that large
numbers of the eggs and young fish will in time be available for dis-
tribution.

The special merits of the California trout consist in its rapid growth
and in its ability to resist extremes of temperature which would be fatal
to the ordinary brook trout.

Very little beyond experimental work was done with the codfish in
1882. At the suggestion of Mr. E.G. Blackford, of New York, an ettort
was made to utilize the living spawn of cod brought into the Fulton
Market during the late autumn and winter; but the impurity of the
water of East River was such as to render it impossible to carry on the
work on a large and successful scale. A considerable number of eggs,
however, were taken and fertilized, and the fish in large part planted in
the Chesapeake Bay as an experiment in stocking that body of water.
As soon as the hatching station at Wood’s Holl is completed, it is pro-
posed to 1esume this work on a very extensive scale by catching the
nearly ripe fish and placing them in basins at the station until they are
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

mature, when the eggs will be stripped and hatched in the exveption-
ally pure water of the harbor.

As in previous seasons, the Commission has to acknowledge the uni-
versal favor with which it has met on the part of presidents, managers,
and superintendents of railways and steamboats, the various branches
of the Government and individuals generally. The formal acknowledg-
ments and details of this courtesy will be found in the report of the Com-
mission. The usual experiments have also been made of the transmis-
sion of the eggs of salmon, whitefish, and other species of fish to various
portions of Europe, in return for which we have received specimens of
Salmonide as well as some of the later and improved varieties of Ger-
man carp.

Bulletin of the Fish Commission.—During the last session of Congress
an act was passed (approved February 14, 1881) instructing the Public
Printer to print and stereotype, from time to time, the regular number
of 1,900 copies of any matter furnished him by the United States Com-
missioner of Fish and Fisheries, relative to new observations, discover-
ies, and applications connected with fish-culture and the fisheries, to be
capable of being distributed in parts, and the whole to form an annual
volume or bulletin not exceeding 500 pages. The edition of this annual
work is to consist of 5,000 copies, of which 2,500 are for the use of the
House of Representatives, 1,000 for the use of the Senate, and 1,500 for
the use of the Commissioner.

Fishery Census of 1880.—The reports of 1880 and 1881 contain details
in regard to the co-operation between the United States Fish Commission
and the Census of 1880, under charge of Superintendent Francis A.
Walker, in collecting the statistics and history of the fisheries of the
United States in past years up to the present time. The result has been
the accumulation of a large mass of important information of very
great value.

The report of 1881 gives an account of the special work of the gen-
tlemen employed for this purpose, and during the year 1882 the reports
mentioned below were published, leaving quite a number still to appear
as among the series of special reports of the Census.

A number of other reports on fishes, of much interest but of less
relationship to the work of the Census, were presented to Congress by
the Commission, and their publication ordered in a series of quarto
volumes. Of these the first is well advanced and will be out in the
course of the year 1883. It is more particularly occupied by an ac-
count of the economical and natural history of the food-tishes and
invertebrates of the country, with the necessary illustrations.

Another of these reports will include figures and descriptions of all
the obsolete as well as more modern forms of apparatus for the pursuit,
capture, and utilization of the inhabitants of the waters, together with
a very minute account of the apparatus of the whaler.
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The great London International Fisheries Exposition.—The success of
the Berlin Fishery Exhibition in 1880, and those of Norwich in 1881
and Edinburgh in 1882, induced a number of gentlemen in England to
propose an exhibition in London in 1883, that should far surpass any of
its predecessors. The necessary arrangements were made, and invita-
tions extended to the United States to participate. This was favorably
responded to by an enactment of Congress appropriating $50,000 for the
purpose, and requiring the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fish-
eries, under the direction of the Secretary of State, to take the necessary
measures toward participation by the United States in the display in
question. The work of preparation was placed in the hands of Mr. G.
Brown Goode, who, with the help of the gentlemen who have been trained
for the work by the Census investigations, and of the assistants in the
National Museum, and the United States Fish Commission, made every
possible effort to secure a satisfactory competition on the part of the
United States. Much important material was already on hand, partly
gathered for the Fisheries Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, partly
for that of Berlin in 1880, and to a considerable extent representing
the general and incidental gatherings of the Fish Commission.

The exhibition in question will open early in May, 1883, and it is
hoped that the report of the result will be as satisfactory to the pride
of every American as was that of the Exhibition at Berlin already re-
ferred to.

Respectfully submitted,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

In presenting a portion of the correspondence of the Institution with
leading astronomers, relative to methods suggested for rendering the
telegraphic announcement of astronomical discoveries as free from am-
biguity as possible, it seems proper to preface these extracts with a
brief notice of the form previously adopted by European observatories
in communicating such information between themselves. The Smith-
sonian system of transatlantic or cable telegraphy, introduced in 1873,
may be regarded as essentially an extension of this earlier and more
local practice. In acknowledgment of the active zeal and assistance of
Dr. C. H. F. Peters, of the Clinton Observatory, in establishing the
Smithsonian enterprise, much deference has been paid to his judgment
in all doubtful questions.

Letter from Prof. F. Karlinski, director of tie observatory in Cracow,
November 23, 1865.

(Published in the Astronomische Nachrichten, Vol. 65, cols. 31, 32.)

It will perhaps not be superfluous if some form should be given in the
Astronomische Nachrichten, in which we can unite in the telegraphic
announcement of astronomical observations, in order that the informa-
tion may be condensed and still be perfectly and generally intelligible.
Our signs ° ‘ ”, as well as h. m. s., can, of course, not be telegraphed,
but to write them out in full makes the dispatch too long. The con-
version of the times of observation as expressed in hours, minutes, sec-
onds, into decimal parts of the day, as well as the expression of right
ascension and declination in degrees and decimals, can easily lead to
errors, and further necessitates a reconversion after the reception of the
dispatch. To me it seems that it would be simplest if we agree to give
not only the mean local time of observation but also the right ascension
and declination by means of 7 or 8 places of figures, of which the first
two indicate the number of the hours or degrees of declination, the next
two the number of minutes, the next two the number of seconds, and
the remaining figure the number of tenths of a second.

The words “right ascension” and “declination” may be entirely
omitted and replaced by “northerly,” southerly.”

Thus, for example:

“Altona Sternwarte 85 November 22 Krakau 0604597 scheinbar
00430620 nordlich 0247240 Karlinski” would be translated as follows:

57
58 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

“November 22d, 6" 4™ 59.7° Cracow mean time. Minor planet No. 85.
Apparent right ascension 0 43™ 6.208%. Apparent declination +2° 477
D402 .

And this would be entirely expressed in twelve words. Thus, there
would remain still eight words for other items, such as the daily motion,
brightness, &c., if the whole dispatch is to be kept within twenty words.

However, I leave the perfecting of this form entirely to your views,
without desiring to push any project of my own.

Notification by the Imperial Academy of Vienna, December 6, 1869.
(Published in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 1785, col. 142.)

The telegrams by which the Imperial Academy announces the dis-
coyery of anew comet to the various observatories will hereafter be
written in an abbreviated form and in general according to the proposi-
tion of Professor Karlinski.

The dispatch will contain: first, the word comet then the name of the
discoverer ; next the date will be given and then the local mean time of
the position in four consecutive figures, of which the first two indicate
the hour and the last two the minute, so that the missing tens for the hour
as well as for the minutes will be indicated by zeros. Then the place
of the discovery will be given, followed by the right ascension in arc, ex-
pressed by means of five figures, of which three indicate the degrees
and the next two the minutes, while the missing tens and hundreds
will be, as before, shown by the zeros.

Then follows an interval, and, after it, the polar distance represented in
five figures, of which three indicate the degrees and the last two the
minutes, and in which again all the missing figures have their places
filled by zeros. The motion, to be finally given, is always understood
to be daily motion in minutes of are, first the motion in right ascension
and next that in declination, each to be preceded by the sign or word
plus or minus.

The conclusion of the dispatch is to be formed of some words that
refer to the external appearance of the celestial body. If, still, an addi-
tional figure follows them, this will describe the diameter of the comet
in minutes of are.

The dispatch will be signed “ Akademie.” For example, the following
telegram from the Academy :

Comet Tempel three November nought nine nought nine nought
nought Marseilles three four one nought five. Nought seven five four
four bewegung plus six minus twenty four helle kern five Akademie”
would be translated as follows:

‘Comet discovered by Tempel. On the 3d November, at 9" 0™ Mar-
seilles meantime, the position is right ascension 341° 5’ and north polar
distance 75° 44’, The daily motion is +6/ in right ascension and —24/
in polar distance. Bright nucleus. Diameter of the comet, 5’.

CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS, 59

Letter from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, October 15, 1879, to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Str: In the telegrams announcing the discovery of comets and minor
planets, for which we have to thank you, the Astronomer Royal has
frequently found a difficulty as to the date of discovery and the date
to which the position given refers. The former is of less importance, but
the uncertainty as to the latter has frequently caused much delay in
picking up a quick moving body such as a comet. :

The Astronomer Royal would therefore suggest that the day of the
month, and Washington mean time, to which the position given refers,
should be in every case inserted just before the R. A. and Dee. (the
magnitude being put at the end of the telegram to avoid confusion).

Thus the telegram just received would run (supposing the position of
the planet to be given for Oct. 13, 14" Washington mean time): “ Planet
Peters Clinton thirteenth fourteen hours one nought north one twenty
motion five south eleventh.”

The Astronomer Royal trusts that you will not find any difficulty in
making this small addition, which will greatly increase the value of the

announcements.
I am, sir, &e.,
W. H. M. CHRISTIE.

Letter from the Smithsonian Institution to Dr. C. H. F. Peters (Clinton,
N. Y.), November 4, 1879.

DEAR Sir: The Astronomer Royal of England asks that hereafter,
jn astronomical announcements, the hour of discovery in Washington
time be given.

The Naval Observatory here requests that local time of discovery be
stated, and that seconds of right ascension be always given.

What would you advise us to instruct observatories in these particu-

lars?
Very truly, yours,

S. F. BAIRD.

Letter from the Litchfield Observatory of Hamilton College (Clinton, N
Y.), November 8, 1879, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: In reply to yours of 4th inst., regarding the demands of
observatories for certain changes in the dispatches of planet discoveries,
I take the liberty to make the following remarks. These remarks are, in
substance, the same I wrote a short time ago to Prof. Tietjen, of the
Berlin Observatory, who proposed as a desideratum similar alterations.

First, as to that the hour of discovery be stated, by which I suppose
the time for the position communicated is meant, the answer is that such
is done and has been done always in our dispatches. It is included in
the way prescribed (but overlooked or forgotten) in the programme that.
was issued at the time by the Smithsonian Institution (Smith. Miscel.
60 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

ColV’hs, 263). There Art. IV states distinctly: ‘“‘The right ascension
and declination in the dispatch will be understood to give the position
(by proper motion approximately reduced) for the midnight following the
date of the dispatch, Washington time for American discoveries, Green-
wich time for European.”

If this be borne in mind, it seems unnecessary to burden the dispatch
by additional figures, indicating a local time.

Still further, it seems unnecessary to add the daily motion in right
ascension. This, for the minor planets between Mars and Jupiter in
opposition, we know is always negative—the planets are retrograde—
and the numerical value of it will be in the neighborhood of 45* or 50°.
Taking into account the distance from the equator, the position of the
ecliptic, and the motion in declination, a little reflection will easily
decide whether to assume a smaller or a larger value sufficiently near
for knowing the run in a day or two.

The request of giving with the right ascension also the second of time
assumes that the discoverer himself knows it, that he has followed up
the planet for at least 24 hours, and hence the motion has become known
to him with accuracy. But this is usually not the case, as on the other
hand it is desirable that the discoverer make the announcement im-
mediately after the first night. The daily motion, consequently, is con-
cluded from single comparisons extending perhaps over an _ hour,
whereby the unavoidable errors are multiplied by a factor greater than
24. The seconds added to the right ascension, therefore, would be only
illusory.

When the nearest full minute is given, so that the uncertainty is 4
minute, this seems indeed also sufficient for recognizing the planet. It
will be among the stars that are in a field of 15’, and by studying with a
little patience the configuration of these stars, the one searched for will
soon betray itself by its change of place. The apparent motion in right
ascension, in most cases, is far surpassing that in declination, so that
the inconsistency in giving the declination to a minute of arc and the
right ascension to a minute of time only is not so great as might seem.
Nevertheless, if found desirable, it is possible to narrow the limits of
uncertainty in the right ascension to one-sixth by the addition of only
one word more in the dispatch, giving the nearest round tenth number
of seconds. And this is the only alteration I should be willing to rec-
ommend in the form of the dispatch.

To resume, I suggest, then:

1. The local time (or its equivalent) is to be presented and looked for
as before, in conformity with Art. IV of the Smithsonian programme.

2. To give the daily motion in right ascension seems superfluous.

3. After the minute of right ascension to be inserted one of the words,
“ten,” “twenty,” “thirty,” ‘‘ forty,” or “ fifty,” indicating the round tenth
of seconds (if no word follows, the second is understood to be zero).
CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS. 61

Thus, taking the example in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections
referred to, it might read:

“ Planet twenty three thirty five ten north, &c.,” 7. ¢., in 235 35™ 108
of right ascension, &c.”

Besides the convenience to observers, also consideration ought to be
had to the telegraph companies that convey messages free of charge.
The first application to the Atlantic Cable Company and which was
granted, was made, I remember, for about 10 words in each dispatch
and for 12 dispatches as a maximum in the year. When, of late, both
of these figures usually have been transgressed we owe the more thanks

to the liberality of the company silently acquiescing. But this should be

the more reason to use the privilege granted with modesty ; (Professor
Tietjen proposed even that a second dispatch after 3 or 4 days follow the
first;) and I believe the form stated in the Smithsonian programme (with
the slight modification now suggested above) as precise out as complete
as can be desired.

Permit me, dear sir, to take this occasion for reiterating the assurance
of the gratitude the astronomical world bears towards the Smithsonian
Institution for the acceleration of intercourse —and believe me, &c., &e.,

Letter from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, November 26,
1879, to Mr. W. H. M. CHRISTIE of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

DEAR Sir: In answer to your esteemed favor of October 15 we beg
to say that by the original programme adopted by telegraphic announce-
ments of astronomical discoveries, the position given in the dispatch is
understood to be that for the midnight following the date, Washington
time for American and Greenwich for European discoveries. This
seemed to us to render it unnecessary to state local time of discovery.
We however referred the matter to Professor Peters, who takes the
same view-as ourselves.

Very respectfully,
S. F. Barrp.

Letter from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, December 22, 1879, to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Str: With reference to your letter of November 26 respecting tele-
graphic announcements of discoveries the Astronomer Royal requests
me to say that there seems to have been a little misapprehension as to
what he desired.

Our difficulty has arisen from the frequent absence of any data what-
ever on the telegram, and even where this is given from an ambiguity
as to whether civil or astronomical reckoning is intended. (This am-
biguity occurred in the last two telegrams respecting comets discovered
by Lewis Swift—in the last the position given appears to have referred
62 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

to the date of discovery instead of to the midnight following the date
of the dispatch five days later.)

If you could kindly give the date of the dispatch our difficulty would
be entirely removed, it being understood, that the convention that the
position given should refer to the following Washington midnight will
be carried out in the case of comets as well as of minor planets.

As mentioned in my former letter, the date of discovery is of less im-
portance and may well be omitted.

W. H. M. CHRISTIE.

Letter from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, December 3, 1879,
to Lord LinpDsAy, Dun Echt Observatory, Aberdeen, Scotland.

DEAR Sir: I am in receipt of your circular of the Ist of November,
asking for the transmission of information respecting the occurrence of
comets and other astronomical phenomena; and I beg to inquire whether
the present arrangements, established some years ago by my predecessor,
Professor Henry, do not answer your purpose. These consisted in an
arrangement with the inland and ocean telegraph companies, by which
all discoveries of this kind made in America were transmitted by the
Smithsonian Institution to certain observatories in Europe, from which
it was supposed they would be forwarded to the more important ob-
servatories within their respective districts.

In return, these same observatories transmit similar information to
Washington, which is then sent to a specified list of establishments
here and also published in the telegraphic dispatches of all the daily
papers in the country.

As you will observe, the observatory at Greenwich receives these dis-
patchesfrom Washington for Great Britain, and I would suggest that
arrangements be made with the Astronomer Royal for immediate trans-
mission of all such information to your observatory.

Everything noteworthy in the line of astronomical discovery is at
once sent to him.

If you prefer to have a dispatch direct to Aberdeen, I will see what
can be done in regard to it, although the telegraph companies, which
perform this service gratuitously, only allow us one station in each
country.

Very respectfully,
SPENCER F. BAtrRD.

Letter from the Observatory, Dun Echt, Aberdeen, December, 1579, to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: I am instracted by Lord Lindsay to thank you for your
letter and inclosure of December 3, in reply to the Dun Echt circular
of November 1, asking for information respecting the occurrence of
comets, &c.
CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS. 63

Referring to your letter his lordship wishes me to explain that the
scheme which he is endeavoring to carry out is the collection of notices
of discoveries of the character indicated from the whole world, in order
to distribute them directly amongst observers in the British Islands.
In doing so it is intended to supply information to every owner of a
telescope in these islands who communicates an address for the purpose,
more especially to all those amateurs who may not be in communication
with a government observatory. I may add that, in this special en-
deavor to aid the owners of small observatories, Lord Lindsay pub-
lished and distributed the summary of Struve’s Mensur Micrometrice,
a work which has already greatly facilitated the observation of double
stars, nor has it been found useless in observatories of the first rank.
In proof of this, it may be mentioned that it served as a working list
for the admirable labors of Professor Pickering and his adjuncts at
Harvard College in sidereal photometry.

Irom the papers you inclose it is evident that the arrangements of
the Smithsonian Institution guarantee the certain intereommunication
of astronomical discoveries between the United States and five European
government observatories. This still leaves a large field unoccupied,
nor does it seem to provide at all (at least in Europe) for the distribu-
tion of information from the transmitting end. I would point out, for
example, that the news of Schmidt’s new star in the Swan was but very
imperfectly distributed in Europe. Although Dr. Schmidt telegraphed
to Herr y. Littrow, at Vienna, within three hours of the discovery on
November 24, 1876 (see Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2113), we first
learned of the star’s existence from a daily paper at the close of Decem-
ber. The Astronomische Nachrichten published the first account on De-
cember 23, and, in fact, the earliest observation possible at Dun Echt
was on January 2, 1877. In Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2115 Dr.
Vogel says that the first news reached him at Berlin on December 3.

From this it would seem that the European part of the Smithsonian
scheme is not at present adapted for the distribution of news on this
side of the Atlantic, and hence it arose that Lord Lindsay was not aware
that the telegrams of the Smithsonian Institution embraced more than
the discoveries of minor planets, with a partial recognition of other and
possibly more generally interesting phenomena, or that they were in-
tended for general distribution.

Apart from this, the information reaches the bulk of observers in these
islands through occasional notes in the public journals, but very rarely
in their telegraphic summaries. Nor are such notes always accepted;
e. g., itis well known that the “Times” declined all the earlier com-
munications respecting the new star in the Crown. ~

These reasons led Lord Lindsay to devise a plan for distributing intel-
ligence directly amongst British observers by posted circular, leaving it
to corporations or individuals to do the same in other countries if the
plan was found worthy of extension. Already the plan has been prom-
64 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

ised the aid of astronomers in many countries, and a similar and co-
operating scheme is starting in France. Stress is laid on the distribution
of information by special circular (or telegram, if particularly desired),
as it is found impossible to rely on the daily papers.

Trusting that these explanations will show that the Dun Echt scheme
is in no way calculated to take up ground already occupied by the
Smithsonian Institution. Iam,

Very respectfully,
RALPH COPELAND,
Astronomer at Dun Echt.

Letter from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, January 14, 1880,
to Prof. C. H. F. PETERS, Clinton, \N. Y.

DEAR Sir: In consequence of the difficulty experienced by many
astronomers in interpreting telegraphic announcements of astronomical
discoveries, we desire to publish in the forthcoming report of this Insti-
tution a circular on this subject, which shall prevent ambiguity aud
m&understanding in the future.

We therefore inclose a copy of the original circular, as prepared by
yourself, and request that you will insert therein such additions, cor-
rections, and explanations as experience has shown to be necessary.

We also send a letter in the same connection, from the Royal Obser-
vatory, Greenwich, which we beg you will return with suggestions for
its proper answer.

Yours very truly,
S. F. Barr.

Letter from the Litchfield Observatory of Hamil on College, Clinton, N. Y.,
January 21, 1880, /o the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: I have, as you requested, considered the different points of
the programme for telegraphic dispatches, and, in the suggestions which
I submit onthe annexed pages as a substitute for pp. 7 and following, I be-
lieve that the wishes expressed by various astronomers, especially those
of Greenwich, are fully embedied. The closing sentence I added in re-
memberirg the inaccuracy of Mr. Swift, by which both assistant Paul of
the Washington Observatory and myself lost a whole night in fruitless
searches for that comet. However, I beg you to strike out or correct as
you please.

If, in your answer to Mr. Christie, you refer to your forthcoming
circular, which will meet the demands of the Greenwich Observatory, [
think they will be satisfied. With reference to the query about astro-
nomical and civil reckoning, I think the expedient I suggested of using
simply the name of the week-day (e. g., ‘‘ Wednesday”) will prove satis-
factory, while it adds only one word to the dispatch.

Letter from the Smithsonian Institution, February 16, 1880, to Prof. C.
H. F. PETERS, Clinton, N. Y.

DEAR Sir: The dispatch from the Astronomer Royal of England
appears not to follow the convention for telegraphic announcements,
affording another instance of the ambiguity to which we have before
alluded and which we wish to correct.

As received by us, it reads:

“Gill telegraphs from Cape Town, comet, twelfth February, 0858 cape
12311, motion plus 235, minus 20. Astronomer Royal.”

The 0858 cape we think refers to time of discovery and the 12311 to
be a mistake of the operators.

Yours very truly,
SPENCER F. BAIRD.

Letter from the Litchfield Observatory of Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.,
February 19, 1880, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR SiR: You are right; there is certainly a mistake in the dispatch
from Cape Town about Gill’s comet, five figures having been omitted,
but it is impossible to say which—either those indicating the R. A. or
those of the North Polar Distance. The telegram, as communicated in
your letter received this morning, and which is in the cipher-system
proposed years ago by Littrow (but hardly applicable in this country,
where by law every figure must be written out in words), can be inter-
preted in the two following ways:

Comet 12th February 8, 58,, mean time Cape, R. A. 1239.11, N. P. D.
[5 figures omitted], motion 4+ 235’ =3°55/ in R. A. — 20’/in N. P. D.

Comet [etc.] R. A. [5 figures omitted], N. P. D. = 123° 11’ (7. e., Decl.
— 33° 11’) motion, etc.

Probably some telegrapher between Cape Town and Greenwich or
Greenwich and Washington got tired of sending ten consecutive fig-
ures; and indeed this system of dispatches has been a source of contin-
ual blunders, so that Lord Lindsay (whose assistant Mr. Gill was, before
he went to take charge of the Cape Observatory) did wrong in reviving
it. The system adopted by the Smithsonian Institution was discussed
with the late Professor Littrow, Professor Bruhns, of Leipzic, and others,
and has worked to satisfaction so far. It will be still more acceptable
to all when the additions lately discussed are introduced, and I would
recommend (which, perhaps, also, is your intention) to issue the amended

scheme in the form of a circular to the principal observatories interested
in it (perhaps sending a number of copies for distribution to Greenwich,
Paris, Berlin, and Vienna).

C. H. F. PETERS.

Zetter from Dr. B. A. GOULD, at sea, steamship “ City of Montreal,”
August 27, 1880, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

My DEAR PROFESSOR: I have been about six weeks in Germany,
France, and England, and have everywhere found the astronomers
greatly perturbed in the matter of astronomical telegrams regarding
comets, planets, &c., which, they tell me, almost unfailingly go wrong,
no matter how great the care with which they are sent.

Finally, the Germans have agreed upon a system to which they have
secured the assent of Admiral Mouchez at Paris, and of the Astron-
omer Rcyal. And they have asked me to communicate with you on
the subject and obtain your assent, which I told them you would surely
give, since the European astronomers are all of accord.

It consists of three principal points:

First. That instead of several transatlantic telegrams to different
observatories, the Smithsonian should send only one, viz, to Professor
Krueger, the new director of the observatory at Kiel and editor of the
Astronom. Nachrichten. He undertakes to communicate the same tele-
gram instantly to all the European astronomical centers, at the expense
of the Astronomische Gesellschaft, if necessary.

Secondly. That a second similar telegram should be forwarded next
diay, or as soon as a Second observation of the body has been obtained,
thus making only two trans-atlantic telegrams in all.

Thirdly. That for these telegrams a special code should be used,
which they have sent me, and which they all recommend. - - -

B. A. GOULD.

Proposed mode of transmitting notices of the discovery of comets, as-
teroids, &c., across the Atlantic.

%. Only one dispatch to be sent at a time. This, if for Europe, to be
addressed to Professor Krueger at the observatory in Kiel; if for Amer-
tea, to Professor Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

A second telegram, however, to be sent as soon as a second observa-
tion has been obtained. Thus only two dispatches in all.

2. All numerical data to be expressed by a word for each figure, with
out regard to its value as dependent upon its position. Thus 58” to
be telegraphed as “ five eight,” “12” as “ one two,” 30” as “ three
nought,” &e.

3. All places which would ordinarily be left vacant when the num-
ber is written in figures must be filled up by the word “ nought.” Thus
for the right ascension 1" 5™.3 would be written ‘ nought one nought five
three” or for R. A. 19% 3™ the dispatch would be sent “ one nine nought
CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS, 67

three nought” (the tenths of minutes being given for right ascensions,
but not for other data, as per section 5).

4, Time of observation to be given in round hours of Greenwich
mean time, preceded by day and month, and never in any other way.
Thus an observation on October 12, at 13" Gr. M. T., would be announced
“ one two October one three;” or November 3, 7" Gr. M. T. as “ three No-
vember nought seven.’ In this way the time of observation which is to
be given first of all will be expressed by the name of the month pre-
ceded by one or two numbers, and followed always by two.

5. Right ascension to follow the date and be given by jive figures ex-
pressing hours, minutes, and tenths of minutes, in time, preceded by the
word ‘ ascension.”

6. Declinations to be given by four words expressing degrees and
minutes, preceded by the word “ north” or “ south.”

7. Daily motion in R. A. to be givenin minutes and tenths of minutes
of time, preceded by the word “ plus” or “ minus.”

8. Daily motion in Decl. to be given in minutes of arc, preceded by
the word ‘“ north” or *‘ south.”

9. Magnitude, if given, to be preceded by the word “ mag.”

Thus, in ordinary cases, the essential numerical data will be con-
tained in twenty-four words.

EXAMPLE.

“Comet discovered by Swift, Oct. 12. Place, k. A. = 2 23.7 and
Decl. = 4+ 35° 2/ at 7 Greenw. M.T. Motion—1™.2 in R. A. and +4 8
in Decl. 12th magnitude.”

DISPATCH.

“Comet Swift one two October nought seven ascension nought two
two three seven north three five nought two minus one two north eight
mag one two.”

Professor Krueger (editor of the Astronom. Nachrichten) undertakes to
repeat the dispatch throughout Europe at cost of the Kiel observatory
or of the Astronomische Gesellschaft. The Paris and Greenwich ob-
servatories, as well as all the German ones, accept the arrangement.

Letter from the Smithsonian Institution, November 11, 1880, to Prof. C.

DEAR Sir: I inclose herewith a proposition for the modification of
the present plan of the exchange of telegraphic announcements between
the United States and Europe. Will you kindly give me your views at
the earliest possible moment? We have in type a new circular on this

The proposition submitted, which Dr. Gould has just sent us, is the
result of a conference with the leading astronomers of Europe.

Letter from the Smithsonian Institution, November 24, 1880, to Prof. C.

DEAR PROFESSOR PETERS: Will you kindly send me at your early
convenience that promised criticism and memorandum in regard to the
accompanying proof of the circular, and all the suggestions of change
brought up by Professor Gould? I wish to close this business as soon
as possible, with your kind assistance.

Letter from the [ttchfield Observatory of Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.,
November 25, 1880, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: I hasten to answer yours of 11th instant in regard to
the telegraphic exchange system of astronomical discoveries. I found
it here after my return from New York (delayed by a few days’ visit
at West Point), and, in order to be brief, I can touch only upon the more
essential points.

Of the three points made in the letter (written by Dr. B. A. Gould)
of which you send me a copy, the first gives, as the reason, economy in
the number of trans-atlantic dispatches. I must wonder, after I had
explained twice before during the last year to the astronomers at Berlin
that as far as I know only one message: passes the Atlantic and is dis-
tributed then in Europe to the five central stations, that, without evi-
dence to the contrary, this again is used as an argument for having the
dispatches from the Smithsonian Institution sent to only one European
central station, and this to be (as if of course) in Germany. When
Dr. Gould’s letter asserts that ‘‘the European astronomers are all of
accord” he says too much for, from a letter of Professor Foerster on the
subject (found here likewise at my return) it appears that Vienna does
not consent; that Pulkowa seems to have been not even asked, and it is
CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS. 69

not quite clear besides under what aspect the matter has been presented
at Paris and Greenwich, and how far these agree with the proposed
change of programme. But after all, what is there objectionable to
sending the communications from the Smithsonian Institution not to
Germany only, but also, as heretofore, to Greenwich, Paris, Vienna,
and Pulkowa? I remember when, on a visit to Washington, I laid the
first proposition before your illustrious predecessor, I had named only
Greenwich, because the nearest place, to send the dispatches to, and
it was Professor Henry who suggested to insert besides, Berlin, Paris,
and Vienna, to which later was added Pulkowa. Fortunately, from our
stand-point on this side of the ocean, we have a broader and more equi-
table view of scientific life in Europe, free from national jealousies.

As to the second point suggested in Dr. Gould’s letter, I cannot deny
that sometimes a second communication about the same object of dis-
covery (not the next day, but rather after the lapse of three or five days)
would be very welcome, though in most cases such a repetition would
not be of very great utility. Professor Foerster puts it on the ground to
make sure against a mistake in the first dispatch. But then, if the two
should not agree? Would he then desire even three dispatches (as bank
accountants take the sum three times when the first two give it differ-
ent). While the cable company with great liberality did concede a lim-
ited (and later frequently surpassed) number of words and of dispatches
per year, it seems hardly proper to ask a duplication of the favor, as
long as it has not been clearly shown that such duplication is of abso-
lute desirability.

Thirdly, as to the code to be used, I do not see in the slightest what
objection can be made to that adopted by the Smithsonian Institution.
It was the result of a consultation with the late Professor Littrow at
Vienna, was in the main set up by Professor Bruhns and myself at Leip-
zic, and approved at the time by the astronomers at Berlin. The new
edition of your circular of instructions embraces the modifications and
suggestions which you had received from various sides, and Professor
Airy, as you will remember, expressed himself satisfied. Professor
Pickering, as well as myself, has carefully compared the scheme with
the one now presented by Dr. Gould. I cannot find that it is an im-
provement in precision to say for example “one two” for “twelve,” “two
nought” for “twenty,” or always “nought three” for simply “three,”
&ec. Looking at the economy of words, Dr. Gould’s scheme requires
twenty-four, the Smithsonian (even with the additions now introduced)
at the utmost only sixteen—a difference of considerable and (for the
cable) essential importance.

Dr. Gould says of his code, ‘which they all recommend,” I am sure
that what all desire and recommend is only a uniformity of the code in
use. The Smithsonian code, being far superior in precision, also more
economical and now perfected by the suggestions of experience, will
readily be accepted. The difficulty has been that some astronomers
70 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

either have not carefully enough read the articles of the programme, or
had forgotten them. The complaints that have come to my knowledge
from abroad have all been in regard to certain comet announcements
telegraphed from this side, and not worded in accordance with the rules
ofthe programme. On the other hand I had to remind the Berlin astron-
omers (and also those at the Washington observatory) that the time
for the position is the “following midnight,” while they mistook for it
the hour and minute of sending from Washington, added by the teleg-
rapher. The circular which you have prepared will prevent for the
future these and similar mistakes.

Letter from the Litchfield Observatory, Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y.
December 21, 1880, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: [ have sent to the “ Astronom. Nachrichten,” as you per-
mitted me to do, an article in explanation and elucidation of the form
of dispatches we have used, and of the additions that have been made
in the new edition.

As you have still under consideration the publication of this revised
programme (I infer sv from your last letter), I inclose here a compari-
son, which shows that our form requires only 16 words, while that pre-
sented by Dr. Gould requires 26 |or, more correctly, 27]; and it is to
be remarked besides that the latter never can have less, because the
“noughts ” always must be inserted, while ours has usually less than 16
words.

Letter from the Observatory Dun Echt, Aberdeen, January 7, 1&81, to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Str: Referring to your letter of November 29, 1880, I may say that our
experience at Dun Echt shows that telegraphic announcements of astro-
nomical discoveries should represent the actual known facts of the case
im a way to which the majority of the senders and receivers of the mes-
sages are accustomed. Thus the message should take the form of an
observation as usually published, the name, date, and place being given.
Any reduction of the time to a meridian other than that of the observa-
tion or any prediction of a future place of the object are equally to be
deprecated as likely to introduce errors.*

*The possibility of making a blunder in the simple operation of referring the time
to another meridian or of failing to recognize the somewhat improbable nature of a
72 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

Besides, by giving the R. A. to the nearest tenth of a minute of time
and the declination to the nearest minute the observation is available, in
- the case of a comet for combination to find an approximate orbit. This
form, too, gives the dispatches a permanent value.

I give the following partly in confirmation of what I think the best
features of the proposed systems and partly as suggestions that may
probably be of use.

The greatest clearness seems to be obtained by giving numbers as
spoken thus: “12” should be “‘ twelve” and not “one two”

I would suggest that the day of the month counted astronomically
be absolutely distinguished from the rest of the message by giving it
the ordinal form. Thus “October 12” would be “twelfth October.”

For a like reason the motion in declination might be given as ** north-
ward” or “southward.” If the length of a telegram is estimated by the
number of words in it and not by their length, it would seem desirable
to express “‘magnitude” in full and not by “ mag,” which a telegraph
elerk would probably confound with “*may “or May.”

Again, if “nought” is objected to why not use “cypher” as being in
more frequent use than ‘‘zero.” If the daily motion in &. A. and Deel.
is not given, would it not be better to use the words “ preceding” and
“‘following” or their symbols “p” and “f,” in place of “west” and
“east,” which latter in practice refer to the horizon and not to the equa-
tor. Thus “nf” would represent ‘‘ northeast.” But the daily motions
in R. A. and Decl. admit of greater precision.

A complete message would thus contain the word “ comet” or “planet,”
the discoverer’s name, the day (expressed as above) and month, the
hour in local mean time and the place. The right-ascension to the
nearest tenth of a minute of time, the declination to the nearest minute
preceded by the word “north” or “south.” Next, the daily motion in
R. A. also to the tenth of a minute of time with the sign “plus” or
¢¢minus” then the daily motion in minutes of are “‘ northward” or “south-
ward,” and lastly, the magnitude or any other particulars likely to aid
the search.

Thus:

““Comet Swift twenty-fifth October seventeen Rochester twenty-one
fifty-nine cypher north fifty-one twenty-five minus twenty-one two
northward fifty-seven magnitude ten.”

Would mean—

“Comet discovered by Swift on October 25th at 17" Rochester mea
time in right ascension 21" 59™.0 and declination + 51° 25’, Daily
motion— 21™.2 and + 57’. As bright as a star of the tenth magnitude.”

This form of message, although slightly longer than others that have

dispatch when so transformed, is shown in the example given in the ‘‘ Proposed Mode
of Transmitting, &c.,” where the comet Swift (presumably discovered at Rochester)
must either have been found at 2p. m. or the longitude have been applied with the
wrong sign.

been proposed, has the advantage of giving a complete approximate
observation.

In conclusion, whatever form the dispatches may take, it seems an
admirable proposal that for transmission across the Atlantic they shall
all pass between two responsible persons; in this way only does it
seem possible to prevent the useless distribution of messages which are
obviously unintelligible.

CRAWFORD & BALCARRES.

Letter from the editor of the *‘ Science Observer” (and Corresponding Seec-
retary of the Boston Scientific Society, Boston), February 4, 1881, to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sir: The announcement in Monthly Notices Vol. XLI, No. 2,
that a letter concerning a somewhat new method for the transmission
of comet discoveries to your Institution across the cable, has caused
quite a discussion among the members of the Boston Scientific Society,
who are now discussing the matter in all its lights. Lack of informa-
tion on one or two points have been difficulties in the way, and if you
can inform us on these subjects you will greatly favor us. These points
relate to the transmission over the cable. It is customary for Govern-
ment messages to be composed of letters and figures, which, by keys
at both ends, may be translated into the vernacular. Knowing this to
be the case, we would respectfully inquire whether comet announcements
in the past have been sent in words or in figures, thus:

Comet Swift twelfth Oct. seven twenty-three seven &c &c, or
Comet Swift 12 Oct 7 2 3 7 &e &

And furthermore, we would like to know whether the new arrange-
ment contemplates the transmission of the words or the figure charac-
ters.

Sincerely yours,
JOHN RITCHIE, Jr.

Letter from the Smithsonian Institution, February 16, 1881, to JOHN
RITCHIE, Jr., corresponding secretary of the Boston Scientific Society.

DEAR Sir: In reply to your letter of February 4, relative to the sys-
tem of telegraphic announcement of astronomical discoveries, I beg to
say that the present Smithsonian system and the proposed substitute
contemplate the use of words only. One dispatch has been received by
us expressed according to Karlinski’s code; but in all the other an-

-nouncements, the data communicated have been given in words.

Inclosed we send you copies of the circulars referred to.

Very truly yours,
SPENCER F. BAIRD.

Leiter from the editor of the “ Science Observer,” Boston, May 13, 1881, to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

DEAR Sie: It is with pleasure that Iam able to call your attention
to the success of a scheme devised by Mr. 8. C. Chandler, jr., and my-
self for the transmission by cable of astronomical intelligence. It has
just been successfully tested by transmission both ways, of the elements
and ephemeris of Swift’s comet, and I append a scheme showing how
an announcement would look according to both codes.

Yours, &e.,
J. RITCHIE, Jr.

Should words 4, or 4 and 5, in the “Science Observer” code, or words
5, or 5 and 6, or words 4, or 4 and 7, be made unintelligible in trans-
mission, the message would still be as intelligible and the comet as
easy to find as was the case before the present European code was
adopted, while the loss of word 2 would be of no consequence, being
merely the name of the discoverer, and word 3 the time of discovery is
as a rule so well determined by the date of message that its loss would
not be of detriment to the general sense. By loss I mean the mutila-
tion of a word so as to render it unrecognizable as is sometimes the

case in ocean telegraphy.
J. RITCHIE, Jr.

Letter from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, May 16, 1881, to
Mr. J. R1iTcHI®£, Jr., editor of the “ Science Observer,” Boston.

Str: This Institution hails with satisfaction every attempt at en-
larging the channels, and at increasing the fullness and accuracy of
scientific information. Itis possible that for the purpose of cable trans-
mission of the details of an astronomical ephemeris, an arbitrary signal
code (as suggested by you) may have some advantages; though it must
not be concealed that it also presents some disadvantages; the complica-
tion both of preparation and of translation increasing with the number
of elements to be communicated.

With the spread of astronomical knowledge and interest, and the

*T am in some doubt about this figure as I have nct the code by me,

growth of desires and needs for more minute information respecting
sudden or transitional phenomena, improved methods and formulas will
doubtless be correspondingly developed.
For the present purposes of this Institution the system it has adopted
will (with probably some slight improvement) prove sufiicient.
Yours, very respectfully,
SPENCER F. BAIRD.

Letter from the [itch field Observatory of Hamilton Collge, Clinton, Oneida
County, New York, April 28, 1882, to the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution.

DEAR Str: At the meeting of the International Astronomical Society
at Strasburg in September last, the matter of telegraphic communica-
tions of astronomical discoveries was considered. In the committee ap-
pointed upon this subject, after some discussion about the ‘ Phrase-Code”
of the (Boston) ‘Science Observer,” it was agreed that the code of the
Smithsonian Institution (Mise. Coll., 263), be recommended for general
use—at least for the present. A resolution to that effect was adopted
by the Society (S. Report in Viertelgahrschrvft, vol. 16, page 285 and 351).
But there was a strong feeling expressed against the manner in which
most of the telegrams of comet discoveries, sent through the Smithsonian
Institution, lately had come to hand in Europe. They were worded
without the slightest regard to the Smithsonian programme, therefore
unintelligible, and worse than no information at all, by reason of causing
fruitless painstaking to astronomers searching for the object.

Unwilling that astronomers abroad should be led to throw the blame
thereof upon the Smithsonian Institution, I take the liberty to suggest
that you would refuse to forward dispatches of the kind, if they are not
made out in conformity with the Smithsonian programme. This pro,
gramme has been distributed so largely throughout the United States (in
the Smithsonian Annual Reports and asa circular), that any amateur dis-
coverer who desires to avail himself of the channel of communication
so liberally offered by the Smithsonian Institution can hardly be ig-
norant of it. Any delay, therefore, will be his own fault, if he neglects
following the prescribed form.

Yours, very respectfully,
Ont hy PETERS.

Letter from the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, May 10, 1882, to
Prof. C. H. F. PETERS, of the Litchfield Observatory, Clinton, N. Y.

DEAR Sir: In reply to your favor of April 28, Iam gratified that
the astronomical convention at Strasburg has approved of the Smithson-
ian code for telegraphic announcements. With regard to the irregulari-
ties noticed, it may be said that very few of the dispatches received by
this Institution comply fully and literally with the published programme.
76 CORRESPONDENCE ON ASTRONOMICAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

Thus, notwithstanding that Article LV, section 6, specifies the very con-
cise and explicit statement of the day of the week for the date, a majority
of notices received substitute the day of the month. It is difficult,
therefore, to carry out your suggestion that we should refuse to forward
dispatches not in exact form.

Before going to press with our long-delayed astronomical telegraph
circular, I will trouble you with extracts from a single additional re-
sponse to our request for suggestions, asking from you the favor of
your consideration and judgment on it.

Copy of extract from a communication received from the Observatory
at Dun Echt, Seotland, and dated January 7, 1881.

[Inclosure.—The principal portion of the latter from Lord Lindsay-
Earl Crawford. |

On the foregoing extract, I venture to make the following queries:

1. Is there not some force in the suggestion to employ date of obser-
vation rather than prospective date and predicted place?

2. Is there any advantage in designating R. A. in hours, minutes, and
tenths, over the present form in hours, minutes, and sixths (or seconds
in tens)?

3. Might it not be well to write the motion in declination, as north-
ward or southward, in fall?

4, To avoid any risk of misapplication, might it not be well to write
in full “tenth magnitude”?

5. Is not the word “zero” really preferable to either “nought” or
“cipher”?

Your frank opinion and decision on these points will be very accepta-
ble, and I may say will be finally adopted.

Yours, very respectfully,
SPENCER F. BAIRD.

The publication of the revised edition of the Astronomical Telegraph
Circular was delayed by various circumstances; among which was a
contemplated plan for telegraphing American discoveries to our own
observatories as well as to those abroad. This had been urged by a
large number of American astronomers; the correspondence on which
subject it is unnecessary here to publish. Prof. E. C. Pickering (of the
Harvard Observatory), under date of January 13, 1882, strongly recom-
mended, in addition to this, the adoption by the Institution of the cipher
code of Messrs. 8S. C. Chandler and John Ritchie, of the Science Observer.
This whole matter still remains under advisement.
REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR 1882.

By GEORGE H, BOEHMER.

The growth of the business of receiving and transmitting the scien-
tific and literary exchanges of the Institution has necessitated a change
in the method of recording and managing the same; the plans of opera-
tion, satisfactory some half a dozen years ago, being no longer available
without entailing increased trouble and considerable confusion in trac:
ing the histery of transactions.

With increase of duties has arisen the need of more complete organi-
zation; and during the past year a system of double entry, or of debit
and credit accounts, has been adopted. These accounts are arranged
in the form of card-catalogues, representing the societies in correspond-
ence with the Institution; and upon these cards each society is debited
for the books forwarded to it, and is credited for the receipts as commu-
nicated in return by formal announcement.

This experiment has of course greatly increased for the time the
amount of work required from the limited assistance allotted to this de-
partment, but in return it gives an increased command over the results,
and a much greater facility and economy of time in making references |
and comparisons.

By this plan, on the arrival of an invoice of parcels or boxes from
any establishment in the United States, for foreign distribution, ac-
companied (as required by the established rules) with a list of the inten-
ded recipients, to each of these is prefixed the number assigned to it in
our printed list of foreign correspondents, and the same are entered on
the proper cards, giving the date of reception, the name of the sender,
and the number taken from the entry in the invoice book (representing
the whole transmission considered as a single transaction), in which
book all receptions are first daily entered in their consecutive order.

The books or parcels receive the same numbers and are then laid
away in bins, each of which represents a certain city or cities or part of
them, in any given country. <A sufficient number of books having ac-
cumulated to justify a sending to any country, the card-catalogue serves
as a basis from which the invoices for the respective societies are made
up. This is done in advance, and while the books are being removed
from the bins and made up in bundles. In this manner sendings which
required a week, on the old plan of making up the invoices from the
parcels on hand, while being assorted and packed, may now be com-
pleted in two days.

This system has been introduced in the exchanges with Great Britain

V7
78 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

and Ireland and with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and is found to
work so well that its adoption for all other countries is deemed advis-
able. Such a course, however, will require the detail of two assistants
exclusively for this purpose; but, considering that the receipts during
the past year averaged 90 parcels per working day—exclusive of 31,568
parcels for the Government—the work required will be such as to keep
them both well employed.

The duty of the assistant in charge of the card-catalogues does not
cease here, but includes the entry to the credit of the respective socie-
ties, of any acknowledgments of the receipt of parcels sent them through
this office, while the duties of the receiving clerk include the verifying
and distributing of all incoming exchanges.

Another feature introduced during the year is a form of duplicate in-
voice which is to be mailed to every recipient within the United States
and British America, of exchange parcels from abroad, to be returned
to the Institution and transmitted as occasion offers to the sender of
the respective parcels.

During the past year over eight thousand parcels were sent out un-
der the system of domestic exchanges, requiring this number of entries
in the book of transmission. Each parcel had to be addressed and prop-
erly wrapped. This domestic branch of the service required the writ-
ing of nearly 13,000 letters of advice and invoices, and the directing of
the parcels and envelopes. All this work has been performed by the
entire force at intervals between foreign transmissions. Great punctu-
ality, of course, cannot possibly, be expected in each case, and it is
respectfully recommended that one assistant be appointed exclusively
for these duties.

The arranging and sending off of the foreign exchange, and the duties
pertaining to the transmission of Government document exchange should
be intrusted to one assistant, to the exclusion of any other duty.

One of the most important works begun during the past year is that
of completing the sets of Smithsonian publications furnished to foreign
societies. Several attempts have been made at different times to supply
such deficiencies, and circulars have been sent out on different occasions
requesting the foreign establishments to report the number of Smith-
sonian volumes in their respective libraries.

In connection with this work, a thorough examination of the number
of publications in the Smithsonian library, of the societies applying for
completion of our sets of publications, is required, for an equitable ap-
portionment. The preliminary steps to this have been taken, but the
magnitude and importance of the work, and the pressure of other busi-
ness, have made it impossible to complete the undertaking.

It has been the aim of the assistants of this Department not to allow
any accumulation whatever in the current work, and although with the
limited force it required great exertion, still the close of the year finds
the service unincumbered by any work of the previous year.
REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES. Cie
List of correspondents.

Mention was made in the report for 1881 of the sending of a circular
toall scientific establishments in correspondence with the Institution,
asking for corrections and additions of any addresses of public libraries,
learned societies or scientific bureaus of Governments. The Institution
also requested secretaries of societies to furnish a list of the names and
addresses of persons actively engaged in scientific or literary investiga-
tions, together with the particular branch of learning to which each was
devoted, with a view of facilitating communications and exchanges
with specialists in all parts of the world. Another item of information
desired related to the literary productions and the libraries of the re-
spective establishments.

Prompt responses having been very generally made to this circular,
a new list of foreign correspondents was prepared and issued in the
early part of the year, showing an increase of almost 600 new societies
over the list published in 1878. Copies of this new list were sent to all
corresponding establishments, and, as a result of further corrections
since the date of publication, an “addition sheet” for the year 1882 is
herewith presented :

Card catalogues.

The information received from the foreign establishments in reply to
the circular relative to the preparation of a new list of foreign corre’
spondents served in the preparation of three card catalogues, of which
one is to represent a list of scientific persons together with the partic-
ular branch of learning to which they are devoted. The second one is
to represent an account kept, with each establishment, of the Smith-
sonian publications on hand, as reported by the librarians, and shows
the successive sendings. As an illustration the card for the British
Museum, London, England, is given:

In order to fully understand this card, it must be mentioned that each
lot of books sent to the Smithsonian Institution for transmission accord-
ing to directions forms one single entry inthe in voice book of incoming
exchanges, in which the daily receptions are entered consecutively. The
number of this entry is noted on the list of addresses (which has to
accompany each sending, specifying the nature and contents of the
respective parcels) and on the parcels themselves. This numberwill be
found on the above card catalogue, appended to the name of the sender,
thus simplifying inquiry into the nature of the sending, should it become
necessary.

Rules relative to scientific and literary exchanges.

In consequence of the great inconvenience occasionally experienced
by this office from indiscriminate sendings to it, for foreign transmis-
sion, of exchange packages, without specification of contents or any list
of addresses, involving an increase of work and the risk of misunder-
standings, the following rules regarding the scientific and literary ex-
change have been adopted, and they are now rigidly adhered to.

1. Transmissions through the Smithsonian Institution to be confined
exclusively to books, pamphlets, charts, and other printed matter sent
as donations or exchanges, and not to include those procured by purchase.
The Institution and its agents will not receive, for any address, ap-
paratus and instruments, philosophical, medical, &c. (including micro-
scopes), whether purchased or presented; nor specimens of natural
history, except where special permission from the Institution has been
obtained.

S. Mis. 26——6
82 REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES.

2. A list of the addresses and a statement of contents of each sending
to be mailed to the Smithsonian Institution at or before the time of
transmission.

3. Packages to be legibly addressed, and to be indorsed with the name
of sender and the contents.

4, Packages to be enveloped in stout paper, and securely pasted or
tied with strong twine—never sealed with wax.

5. No package to a single address to exceed one half of one cubic foot
in bulk.

6. To have no inclosures of letters.

7. To be delivered to the Smithsonian Institution or its agent free of
expense.

8. To contain a blank acknowledgment, to be signed and returned
by the party addressed.

9. Should returns be desired, the fact is to be explicitly stated on or
in the package.

10. Unless these conditions are , complied with, the parcels cannot be
forwarded by the Institution.

The total number of boxes sent during the year is 422, which is an
excess of 15 boxes over the year 1881, and is the highest on record. Of
these 422 boxes, 298 contain books, and 2 boxes specimens sent by
REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES. 87

the National Museum. In the year 1881, with 407 boxes, only 264 con-
tained books, while 45 entire boxes of specimens were sent by the
National Museum and Fish Commission.

The transmissions of 1882 compare with former years as follows:

1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. | 1879. 1880. 1881. 1882.

boxes sent under the system of Government document exchange to the
various Governments specified in the special report appended, and the
transmissions to Canada, which will be found specified in the detailed
report on domestic exchanges.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF EXCHANGES. 101

The decrease as compared with 1881 in the parcels sent under do-
mestic exchanges is due to the fact that the statistics of that year in-
clude a large number of parcels left over from 1880. At the clcse of
the year 1881, however, all accumulations had been worked off, and not
one package remained on hand, so that the figures in the present re-
port represent the actual receipts and transmissions for this year only.
The receipt of packages for 1881 was 7,890, and for the present year
8,359, thus showing an actual increase of 460 parcels, that is, a little
above the average increase (400 per year) for the past ten years.

The total number of packages transmitted compares with former
years as follows:

1873. | 1874. | 1875. | 1876. | 1877. | 1878. | 1879. | 1880. | 1881. | 1882.

3. Government transmissions.

On the 2d day of March, 1867, the following resolution was passed
by Congress, tv provide for the exchange of certain public documents:

“Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all documents hereafter
printed by order of either house of Congress, and fifty copies additional
of all documents printed in excess of the usual number, together with
fifty copies of each publication issued by any Department or Bureau of
the Government, be placed at the disposal of the Joint Committee on
the Library, who shall exchange the same, through the agency of the
Smithsonian Institution, for such works published in foreign countries,
and especially by foreign Governments, as may be deemed by said com-
mittee an equivalent, said works to be deposited in the Library of Con-
gress.”

A primary object of this movement was to secure as regularly and
economically as possible all reports and other documents relative to the
legislation, jurisprudence, statistics, internal economy, technology, &c.,
of all nations, so as to place the material at the command of the com-
mittees and members of Congress, heads of Bureaus, We.

The receipts from the Public Printer during the year 1882, under
this act of Congress, were 50 copies each of 631 distinct publications,
representing 31,550 copies. The specified list of these documents will
be found appended.

The total receipts for the year, together with some of last year’s ac-

Three Governments were added to the list during the year, namely:

1. Hungary; depositing the documents with the Prasidium des Konig.
Ungarischen Ministeriums, Budapest.

2. United States of Colombia; books to be deposited in the National
Library, Bogota.

* East Indies; deposited with the Secretary of State for India, Cal-
cutta.

The first instalments of 16 boxes each were made to Hungary, June
10, 1882; Colombia, October 20, 1882; East India, October 20, 1882.

In 1879 the French Commission of ease ercil Exchange requeeeed
that an additional set of Government publications be sent to France,
to be distributed among the various Government departments and bu-
reaus, who in return were to furnish their publications for the use of the
United States Government Bureaus, while the original set was deposited,
together with its continuations, in the National Library. This practice,
however, has been abandoned now, at the request of the French com-
mission, and it has been suggested that, should the various Government

should do so directly without drawing from the allowance set aside by
law for the exchange among Governments.

The following tables show the Government who at present exchange

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED
STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1882.

Prof. SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Director of the United States National Museum:

Str: I have the honor to submit herewith a report upon the work of
the Museum for the year 1882, in which are included certain sugges-
tions relative to the administration of the Museum, which may at some
future time, either in their present form or with modifications, be recom-
mended for adoption.

Very respectfully,
G. BROWN GOODE,
Assistant Director.
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, January 1, 1883.

With the beginning of the year 1882 systematic work in the reorgan-
ization and installation of the collections may be said to have been
fairly commenced. Although something had been accomplished in the
three or four months prior to the above date, the work was, for the most
part, experimental. The year 1882 may, therefore, be regarded as the
first year of the occupation of the new building.

On January 1, 1882, was issued Circular No. 1, containing a plan of
organization and regulations. This pamphlet contains 58 pages, and
in it are defined the limits of each department of work, the duties of every
officer, and the routine to be followed in each kind of administrative
work.*

This code of regulations has been systematically enforced during the
year with consequent important improvement in the efficiency of each
department.

Cases.—Much thought and time have been expended in making experi-
ments for the purpose of ascertaining what forms of cases are most suit-
able for the exhibition of our collections. Old patterns have been modi-
fied and new ones invented. A detailed account of these experiments,
and their results, will be submitted at some future time. Four thousand
five hundred and eighty-six cases and boxes of various patterns have
been received, as specified in the accompanying schedule. They have

*See Appendix to Proceedings United States National Museum, Vol. IV, following
page 534.

120 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

been, as a rule, constructed by contract after the specifications had been
submitted for competition to a number of reliable firms in Washington,
Baltimore, and Philadelphia. The glass has been imported free of
duty, the locks and other hardware purchased of manufacturers, and
the finishing of the wood-work, the setting of the glass, and the fitting
up of the interiors with shelves, and otherwise preparing them for the
reception of specimens, have been done by a force of men working in the
Museum building, paid by the day or job, as was found in each par-
ticular instance to be more economical and satisfactory.

The adoption of a peculiar style of case, known as the “unit-box,”
for the exhibition of many classes of objects, has rendered it necessary
to employ a number of mechanics in mounting the specimens for dis-
play. In this work several women have been employed, who have
proved to be industrious and skillful.

The following is a list of cases in use in the Museum and for the
most part received during the year:

Labels.—Similar experiments have been made in regard to labels,
many different styles of type and colors of paper and methods of ar-
rangement having been tried. It has been found necessary to employ

SS ae ee
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 121

a printer to operate the presses belonging to the Museum, and his serv-
ices have been particularly valuable in this work of experimenting.
One of the chief obstacles to the labeling of the collections has been
the uncertainty as to what form of label should be used, while another
difficulty, equally embarrassing, has been experienced in endeavoring to
decide exactly how much descriptive matter might properly and effect-
ively be printed on a given label. Nearly 1,200 objects have, however,
been finally labeled, and this work is rapidly advancing.

Fitting up Laboratories.—Several of the curators’ laboratories have
been fitted up with storage cases and furniture, and are now better sup-
plied with conveniences for work than ever before. Among these may
be specially mentioned those in the departments of birds, fishes, mol-
lusks, insects, invertebrate fossils and fossil plants; and the increased
facilities for work thus afforded to the several curators cannot fail to be
productive of great general advantage to the Museum.

Monthly Reports.—During the year each curator and chief of depart-
ment has submitted to the Director a monthly report of the operations
of his department.

Storage and Archives.—The Registrar, Mr. S. C. Brown, has had in
charge the Department of Registry and Storage, his duties being the
keeping of the registry books, the reception and assignment of packages,
the packing and unpacking of boxes, and the acknowledgment of dona-
tions. He has also had in charge the department of archives. The
storage rooms have been entirely rearranged and a card-catalogue of
their contents prepared, and the records of the year have been carefully
kept, in accordance with the requirements of the new code of regulations,
besides which considerable progress has been made in the work of arrang-
ing in a similar manner the accumulations of past years. The rules for
the administration of collections, as specified upon pages 25 and 26 of
the “Plan of Organization,” already referred to, have been faithfully put
upon trial by the Registrar, and have been found thoroughly practicable
and much to the advantage of the general service of the Museum.

Tibrary.—The Librarian, Mr. Frederick W. True, has successfully
carried owt the regulations and specifications issued in the “Plan of
Organization,” on pages 37 and 38. The establishment of the central
and sectional libraries has been perfected, and a complete card cata-
logue prepared.

The Library is now estimated to contain 5,800 books and 5,500 pam-
phlets.

The Library room has been remodeled and enlarged during the year,
and will now accommodate conveniently at least 10,000 volumes. Fuller
details may be found in the report of the Pibeavian

Publications —Volume tv of the “‘ Proceedings of the National Mu-
seum” for 1881, has been published, under the editorship of Dr. T. H.
Bean. It is a book containing 534 pages, with an appendix consisting

Bulletin 19 of the Museum, consisting of Mr. Samuel H. Scudder’s

Bulletin 11, consisting of Prof. Theodore Gill’s “ Bibliography of the
Fishes of the Pacific Coast; ” Bulletin 22, consisting of Mr. Lester F.
Ward’s “ Guide to the Flora of Washington and Vicinity ;” and Bulle-
tin 24, consisting of Dr. H. C. Yarrow’s ‘“ Check-List of North Ameri-
ean Reptilia and Batrachia,” complete the list of those published in
1882. Bulletin 23 has been sent to press. Bulletins 16 and 20 have
been passing through the press during the year, but have not yet been
issued.

Dr. Bean has prepared a list of the publications of the Museum, with
indexes. This has been printed in Circular 18, and is of great aid in
the consultation of the matter which has been published by the Museum
during the last seven years. It has not yet been found practicable to
issue, from time to time, as provided for in Section C of the ‘ Plan of
Organization,” the list of accessions to the Museum, although the de-
sirability of such a publication as this is growing constantly more ap-
parent.

Duplicates and Exchanges.—During the year 1882 there were only

During the year, 102 applications for specimens were received from
museums, schools, and individuals; and of these and previous applica-
tions on file, 98 have been supplied in whole or in part.

The total number of specimens distributed prior to the close of 1882 is.
about 435,000.

Property and Supplies—Operations in this department have been
greatly facilitated during the year by the introduction of two impor-
tant measures.

There is now only one order-book, which is kept in the office of the
Assistant Director, and no supplies, however small, can be obtained
without the filing of a formal requisition specifying the probable cost of
the articles required. The requisitions approved are numbered to corre-
spond with the serial numbers in the order-book, and are filed away for
reference. Every expenditure is thus placed on record, and the sum
total of the prices entered on the order-book, together with the amount
of the regular pay-roll, will, at the end of any month, indicate exactly
the amount of liabilities for the month. A requisition for the hire of
a laborer for half a day is treated in the same manner as that fora
large order of goods.

In addition to this, a property clerk has been appointed to take the
charge of unpacking and cataloguing every article of furniture or supply
received, of issuing the same upon “house requisitions,” and of prepar-
ing a semi-annual report, thereby relieving the Superintendent of the
labor and responsibility of this work.

Mr. C. W. Schuermann was appointed property clerk on July 1, 1882,
and has been efficient in his work. He has submitted perfect invento-
ries of all articles in the several buildings, and also statements of the
exact quantity of each kind of article received during the year, bal-
anced by a report of the quantity of each article now in stock and the
exact disposition of such articles as have been issued upon requisition.

The property clerk has also been charged with the duty of inspect-
ing and reporting upon each article of furniture and all supplies pur-
chased for the Museum.

Accounts.—As heretofore, all accounts have been administered under:
the direction of the Chief Clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, and all
124 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

payments have been made through his office. The question of receipts
and expenditures will not be discussed in this report, since it is in-
cluded, as hitherto, in the report of the Executive Committee of the
Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Buildings and Labor.—Under the administration of Mr. Henry Horan,
superintendent of the buildings, the watchmen, mechanics, and the
laborers have rendered exceedingly efficient service. The published
regulations * have been put into effect, and found not only practicable,
but of great advantage in promoting the efficiency of all departments.

There are now upon the permanent roll in this department one
superintendent of buildings, two assistant superintendents of buildings,
‘one engineer, one assistant engineer, three firemen, three carpenters,
two painters, one mason, twelve watchmen, four janitors, twenty labor-
ers, four messengers, and two cleaners.

In addition to the permanent force, several mechanics, chiefly car-
penters, have been working, under the direction of the superintendents,
on the construction and fitting up of cases. It has been found more
economical and satisfactory to build cases in this way than to put them
out by contract, but lack of room has rendered it impossible to do this
except in a fewinstances. The regular employees of the Museum have,
as in former years, been required to wear a simple uniform. The clean-
liness of the building and its preservation in good repair, as also the
general public-comfort service, have been efficiently attended to.

The safety of the collections has been more carefully guarded during
this year than hitherto. The numerous private doors in the old build-
ing have been closed, and a watchman is now stationed at every en-
trance. No persons, except officers of the Museum, are allowed to
carry packages out of the buildings without a written pass, and no
one is allowed to carrry umbrellas or canes into the exhibition halls.
These rules have caused considerable dissatisfaction, both among em-
ployees and visitors; but in my opinion strict custody is absolutely
necessary for the safety of the collections. Even now it is impossible
to keep people from handling and disfiguring objects which are not
covered with glass; and on Saturdays and other holidays it is necessary
to employ a considerable portion of the laboring force in guarding un-
covered objects in order to prevent visitors from carrying them away
piecemeal. One of the worst annoyances with which we have to con-
tend is the mania of the “relic-hunter,” who, devoid of all conscience,
does not hesitate to break off and carry away with him pieces of any
objects that may come within his grasp, especially such as are the more
interesting on account of historical associations. The more precious
the objects, the greater is his greed for the possession of fragments.

The number of persons employed in guarding and caring for the
building seems, at first sight, unnecessarily large, and it certainly is a

cause of great regret that it should be necessary to expeud so much of
the appropriation in this manner; but experiments, made with a view
to reducing the number of this body, have forced me to the conclusion
that it should be increased rather than decreased.

Electric Service.—The electrical service is being slowly perfected, under
the supervision of Mr. W. J. Green, electrician. Extensive systems of
telephones in the several buildings, as well as at the residences of three
or four of the chief executive officers, have aided in facilitating business,
and have enabled us to dispense almost entirely with messenger boys.

I here present a description of the electrical service as at present.
arranged. In the electrical room of the National Museum are the fol-
lowing articles of apparatus:

One 50-drop telephone switch-board, with 34 connections, 14 of which
are in the National Museum, 9 in the Smithsonian building, and 11 out-
side. There are 5 ordinary electric lamps, and 2 electric lamps for pho-
tographic purposes, with dynamo-electric machine and resistance-box.
There is also a 100-drop annunciator, to which are connected 300 win-
dows and 85 doors throughout the Museum building; 1 large watch-clock
for recording on paper dials the time signals which the watchman turns
in from the 12 clock stations throughout the building as he makes his
_ patrol; and one alarm box of the district Telegraph Company. In the
Smithsonian building there are 9 clock stations, controlled in the same
manner as those in the Museum building, and also a special telephone
connection with the city.

Preparation of Specimens.—The work of the preparators has been ex-
tensive and important. Mr. Joseph Palmer, chief modeller, has been
engaged during a large part of the year in mounting the skeleton and
cast of a humpback whale, 32 feet in length, which now stands in the
south main hall. This is the largest cast of an animal that has yet been
made, and is unique in conception. Viewed from the left side, the visitor
sees the cast of a whale in the attitude of swimming through the water.
Standing on the right he sees the concavity and inner outline of the
half cast, in which against a suitable background is mounted the articu-
lated skeleton of the animal. Mr. Palmer has also made during the
year a number of casts of smaller whales and of fishes, and his assistant,
William Palmer, has devoted several months to making a papier-maché
cast of the model of the town of Zui, which was prepared by Mr. Min-
deleff under the direction of the Bureau of Ethnology. Mr. Wm. T.
Hornaday was appointed chief taxidermist on March 16, 1882. Among
the important objects mounted by him during the year are a young
African elephant, a polar bear, and a cinnamon bear. Mr. Henry Mar-
shall, taxidermist in the department of birds, has mounted about 450
specimens in a very satisfactory manner. Mr. A. Zeno Shindler, artist,
has been employed almost entirely in repainting the collection of fish
casts.

Mr. J. Hendley has devoted much time to repairing broken speci-
126 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

mens, and during the past five months has been employed in making
dummies for the display of various costumes in the possession of the
Museum.

Accessions.—The number of packages received by the Registrar dur-
ing the year was 10,045, of which 5,401 were cases and parts of cases
paid for from the ‘furniture and fixtures” appropriation, while 1,287
were received through Mr. Thomas Donaldson from the permanent ex-
hibition on the Centennial grounds at Philadelphia, having been trans-
ported hither in December in seventeen freight-cars. The remaining
3,357 were packages received in the ordinary course of administration.

Number of Visitors.—Since the 8th of February the janitors at the
doors of both buildings have registered the number of visitors by means
of a tally machine, and it has been ascertained that the average daily
number of visitors to the Museum building has been 535, and to the
Smithsonian building, 488. The total number of visitors for the year,
calculated upon this basis, has been, for the Museum, 167,455; for the
Smithsonian building, 152,744.

Lectures.—During the year the Biological Society has held its meet-
ings regularly in the lecture-room of the Museum, and two ccurses of
lectures have been delivered in the same apartment.

The first of these, the Saturday lectures, under the direction of a com-
mittee of the Biological and Anthropological Societies, were given on
Saturday afternoons in March and April. These lectures, eight in num-
ber, were attended by audiences of 500 to 900 people. In December a
course of “ young folks’” lectures, under the same auspices, was begun,
and twelve lectures were delivered. These were attended chiefly by
teachers and advanced scholars of the public schools and seminaries of
the city. Many of these lectures were illustrated by specimens from
the Museum, or have had a definite bearing upon its work, and it is
hoped that they have increased its popularity and efficiency.

The first lectures were delivered in the northwest range, which was
fitted up with considerable care as a lecture-room; but it was soon dis-
covered that this was not large enough to accommodate the audiences
in attendance, and accordingly the west-north range, which is 26 feet
longer, was fitted up, and the old lecture-room abandoned.

The Bautent of the Museum.—An attempt has been made by the curators
of the several departments to estimate the total number of specimens
in the Museum. This estimate is at present only a partial one, but it
may not be amiss to quote its results for the departments which are
sufficiently organized to permit it.

DEPARTMENT OF ANTIQUITIES.

The arrangement of the collections in the department of antiquities,
under the administration of Dr. Charles Rau, is, as it has been for some
years past, more perfect than in any other in the Museum. To this
department will eventually be devoted all of the upper exhibition hall
in the older Museum. At present the upright floor-cases and more
than half of the wall cases are filled with specimens belonging to the
department of arts and industries, the implements and manufactures of
partly civilized races of the present day. These are being removed as
rapidly as possible to the new Museum.

The unexpected delay in transferring the ethnological and industrial
materials to the new Museum has retarded Dr. Rau’s contemplated re-
arrangement of portions of this collection in the upright floor-cases
A few, however, have been emptied, and in these, special mound collec-
tions have been placed, with excellent effect.

During the coming year (without question) an additional number of
these cases will be emptied, thereby providing space for a much more
striking presentation of the relics of prehistoric man than at present.

Embarrassment has also been caused by the fact that prehistoric
objects and modern ethnological and industrial material have hitherto
been entered indiscriminately in the same register, and that, with the ex-
pansion of the scope of the Museum and the separation of modern and
ancient material in the two buildings, these combined catalogues are
very inconvenient. The work of making a duplicate copy of the cata-
logue has already been begun.

Dr. Rau reports the following as the number of specimens at present
under his charge: Total, 35,512, of which 21,217 are on exhibition, 7,748
are in the reserve series, and 6,547 are duplicates.

The total number of accessions has been 3,569, of which 2,554 were
acquired by gift, 353 by exchange and purchase, 511 from explorers em-
ployed by the Smithsonian Institution, and 141 by deposit. Two lots
of duplicates, containing, respectively, 27 and 171 specimens, have been
distributed.

Four papers have been published by the curator of this department
during the year, and in the “Proceedings” of the Museum, volume Iv,
was printed a list of his publications relating to anthropology which
appeared between 1859 and 1882—fifty-two titles in all.

Dr. Rau has been engaged during the year in the preparation of an
128 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

extensive illustrated work upon prehistoric fishing in Europeand North
America.

DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND INDUSTRIES.

When, in 1857, the Smithsonian Institution assumed the custody of
the collection of the United States Exploring Expedition, together with
the miscellaneous material which had gathered around this nucleus, a
great quantity of material was transferred to the Smithsonian building
which has not to this day been classified and placed upon exhibition.
The rapid growth, espécially during the past decade, of the collections
illustrating the ethnology of North American Indians, and especially
of prehistoric objects from this continent, has absorbed the attention of
all who were interested in this department of the Museum. A year ago
the majority of the foreign ethnological objects were, on account of lack
of room, packed up or crowded together in a too limited amount of case-
room. At the close of the Centennial Exhibition the Museum received
from foreign Governments great quantities of material exhibited at
Philadelphia, which, while possessing an undoubted ethnological inter-
est, could not in many instances be displayed in the manner usually
adopted in ethnological museums.

The material received from Philadelphia in 1876 was for several years
stored in the Armory building. On completion of the present Museum
building, and before the collections could be transferred to it, it became
necessary to decide by what method the stored material (other than
zoological, botanical, geological, or mineralogical) could be most effect-
ively classified for purposes of study and exhibition.

After a careful consideration of the methods of the large museums of
Europe, the officers of the Museum agreed that the ordinary classifi-
cation by races or tribes would in this case be less satisfactory than a,
classification based upon function.

In the report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1881, pages 117-122,
and also in circular No. 13, of the National Museum, the Assistant Direc-
tor presented a provisional outline of a plan of classification for the Mu-
seum. This classification, while its purpose was to embrace every kind
of object which could possibly be exhibited in the Museum, was especially
full in those parts which related to the arts and industries, forty-nine.
out of the sixty-four primary classes relating to this group of museum
material. The general idea of the classification, as there explained, is:
that the collections should constitute a museum of anthropology, the
word “anthropology” being applied in its most comprehensive sense..
It should exhibit the physical characteristics, the history, the manners
past and present of all races civilized and savage, and should also illus-
trate humgn culture and industry in all their phases; the earth, its
physical structure, and its products are to be exhibited with special
reference to their adaptation for use by man. The so-called “ natural
history” collections are grouped in separate series, which are to be
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 129

arranged in accordance with the well-tried methods prevailing in natural-
history museums, and which would, of course, occupy a very large por-
tion of the space and the attention of a majority of the staff, as at pres-
ent constituted, but which, at the same time, should illustrate and
supplement the collections in industrial and economic natural history.

Some experiments have already been made with reference to the feas-
ibility of this plan of arranging the exhibition series, but I am not yet
prepared to recommend its final acceptance.

The adoption of this plan would necessitate the grouping together, in
continuous series, of objects which had never before been placed side by
side in any museum. If the evolution of any given industry or class of
objects is to be shown, the series should begin with the simplest types
and close with the most perfect and elaborate objects of the same class
which human effort has produced.

In the textile industry, for instance, at one extreme is shown the simple
whorl of stone or terra cotta, used by savage or semi-civilized man, to-
gether with the archaic representative of the same, surviving among
rural members of the most highly civilized races; these being supple-
mented by the threads and the simple woven fabrics produced by them ;
on the other hand, the steam spinning apparatus and the power and
Jacquard looms.

Much attention has been devoted during the year to experiments for
determining the manner in which the idea of this classification can best
be carried into effect. It is not possible within the limits of this report
to describe what has been done. In fact a full account of them at pres-
ent would be premature. The practicability of the scheme can best be
judged of by an examination of the one or two groups, such as the
materia medica collection, the collection of musical instruments, and the
portion of the costume collection, which are already partly installed.

The department of arts and industries with the growth of the Museum
will naturally be divided into a number of independent sections, each
under the charge of acurator. In its present partially organized condi-
tion it is under the special charge of the Assistant Director. The sec-
tion of materia medica has, however, been entirely under the control of
Dr. James M. Flint, U.S. N., detailed for this service by the Surgeon-
General of the Navy. Mr. J. King Goodrich has since the first of
November been acting as assistant, devoting particular attention to the
arrangement of the musical instruments and the costumes, while Mr.
A. Howard Clark has been engaged in the reorganization of the section
of fisheries. The section of building-stones and stone-working has re-
cently been assigned to Mr. George P. Merrill.

This department at present occupies nearly all of the northern half of
the Museum building. No assignment of space has been made to
special subjects. The extremely flexible system of cases which has been

adopted permits us to arrange the collections in very small subdivisions.
H. Mis. 26——9
. 130 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The unit of bulk is a glass-covered box 24 by 30inches. When sixteen
of these boxes are filled with specimens and labelled, they are grouped
together by sliding them into place in a specially prepared frame.
When several of these groups have been arranged, if a different order of
sequence seems preferable, the work of re-arrangement can easily be ac-
complished by giving a few words of instruction to a mechanic, who
changes the position of the unit boxes in the screens. We thus have an
immense advantage over those museums which have fixed cases of
large dimension, and which must needs, therefore, assign from the
first a definite amount of space to each class of objects. Our policy has
been to mount objects in the unit boxes as rapidly as small groups could
be brought together, the only limitation being that objects derived from
different races or nations should not be mingled in the same box. By
this means, if at any time a rearrangement by race criteria seems de-
sirable for any special purpose, it can be effected without difficulty. For
instance, let us suppose that all the objects in the department of arts
and industries had been arranged according to function—all the pipes
together, all the weapons together, all the foods together and all the
games and amusements together. If the Eskimo or Japanese objects
are to be studied or lectured upon, it is simply necessary to go through
the halls, and to mark upon the glass front of each small unit case with
French chalk, to withdraw these unit boxes from the screens, and to
close up the gaps by sliding the unit boxes closer together and removing
the screens, which are thus thrown out of use.

It is, of course, impracticable to arrange everything in the unit boxes.
Many other similarly flexible systems of installation are employed which
will be described in a future report.

In the above remarks I have attempted simply to explain the princi-
ple of our methods.

At the end of the year about 500 unit boxes had been filled, and about
500 labels had been printed. The work of preparing descriptive labels
is very laborious, and the subject of labels has received almost as much
study during the year as that of cases.

It is impossible at present to form any estimate whatever of the ex-
tent of the collections in this department. There are over 60,000 entries
in the ethnological catalogues. A large number of these relate to pre-
historic objects which are not assigned to the department of arts and
industries, while great quantities of objects still remain unentered. A
great quantity of others properly belonging to this department are en-
tered in the catalogues of the department of mineralogy and other
departments of the Museum.

The number of entries during the year in the catalogue, exclusive of
archeological specimens, has been 7,875. At the close of another year
the curator hopes to present a careful estimate of the condition and
capabilities of the department.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS.

Mr. Frederick W. True, assistant curator, has been acting as curator
of this department since January 20, 1882, at the same time perform-
ing the duties of librarian.

The south main hall of the new Museum has been fitted with exhi-
bition cases for the reception of the mounted mammals, and also with
a considerable number of storage cases of the unit-table pattern for the
reserve series of skins. The room at the west end of the south baleony
is used as a laboratory for this department, and the room on the third
floor above it has been assigned for the storage of the alcoholic series:
These rooms are very small, and it has been found necessary to make
use of a part of the south balcony in addition.

Since the mammal hall has been ready for occupation, the entire
time of the curator and one or two assistants has been devoted to trans-
ferring the collections from the old Museum and to their rearrange-
ment. Little attention having been paid to the mammal collections
since 1876, it has been found necessary to devote much time to bring-
ing up arrearages of work, and to inspecting and relabeling almost
every specimen. This work has been very efficiently inaugurated by
Mr. True, who has also nearly completed a preliminary card-catalogue
of the collection arranged alphabetically under genera.

A very effective preliminary display of the mounted manrmals has
been made, and studies have been prosecuted and experiments made in
preparation for a system of full descriptive labels.

The osteological section of the mammal collection still remams in the
east gallery of the lower hall of the old Museum.

The cast of a humpback whale, elsewhere referred to, has within the
past month been finally placed at the south end of the mammal hall.

The number of specimens is estimated by the curator to be 8,265, 4,660
being skins, of which 689 are mounted and on exhibition, 3,535 in the
osteological series, and 70 in the anatomical series.

On page 130 of last year’s report may be found the census of the col-
lection of mounted mammals. The number of entries for the past year
in the mammal catalogue has been 293; in the osteological catalogue,
139.

One paper based upon the material of this department has been pub-
lished by its curator, who has, however, also printed several contribu-
tions to other departments of science.

DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS.

There has been great activity in the department of birds, notwith-
standing the fact that it has been impossible for the curator, Mr. Ridg-
way, to make any changes in the appearance of the exhibition series.
The mounted birds are now displayed on the main floor of the lower
hall of the old Museum and in a part of its western gallery, but the
132 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

eases are crowded so fully that no effective display can be made until
the cases in the eastern gallery are emptied of the osteological collec-
tion which they now contain. The cases in this hall are all old and
somewhat unsuitable, and it is hoped that before long they may be re-
constructed. The number of mounted specimens is so great that their
rearrangement is an undertaking of great magnitude, especially since
it involves the transfer of a large proportion of them from the old fash-
ioned white perches, to which they are now fastened, to the improved
pattern recently adopted. It also involved the rewriting and reprinting
of a majority of the exhibition labels, changes in ornithological nomen-
clature having of late years been very considerable. Rearrangement,
therefore, means an immense amount of work, and Mr. Ridgway has
refrained from undertaking it until the whole of the hall assigned to
ornithology shall be at his disposal. The birds in the exhibition cases
are, however, arranged in systematic order, with the exception of those
in one case. Much has been done also in the way of weeding out from
the exhibition series surplus specimens and those which are faded or
badly mounted, the latter being replaced by newly-mounted speci-
mens of excellent workmanship. It is but fair to say that the curator
of birds would have accomplished much more in this department of his
work, had not the fitting up of the new Museum absorbed so much of
the time of our force of mechanics and preparators.

His time has been no less usefully spent in the rearrangement of the
study series, which is nearly eight times as large as that upon exhibi-
tion. This series is arranged in “Salvin” cabinets and other recepta-
cles in the southern half of the west basement and in the two upper
rooms of the south tower, the lower of which has since 1870 been used
by the curator of birds for a laboratory. The necessary inspection of
the collections occupies much time, since they fill 347 drawers, in which
they are often arranged in small trays, three or more layers deep. An
important improvement introduced into this department has been to
line the drawers containing the birds with heavy carbolized paper, as
protection against insects. This same carbolized paper of thinner text-
ure has been used to great advantage in wrapping and packing skins
sent in by collectors from remote localities, especially when part of the
transportation has been by sea.

The collection of eggs which, as is well known, is, so far as North
American species are concerned, the most complete in the world, is
stored in various receptacles in the west basement and in the drawers
of table cases in the ornithological hall. Plans are being made for new
cabinets, in which this great collection shall be arranged.

Mr. Ridgway makes the following report upon the present condition
and general needs of the collection :

Number of specimens.—The collections belonging to the department of birds are at

present divided into nine separate lots or series as follows:
1. The reserve series of smaller North American birds, including the orders Passeres
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 138

(except larger Corvide), Macrochires (except Humming-birds), aud Picariw (except
genera Campephilus and Hylolomus). These are stored in walnut cabinets in the up
per room of the south tower.

2. The reserve collection of smaller Neotropical birds, including the order Passeres
(except Corvide and larger Cotingide), the Humming-birds (with which are in-
cluded also the North American species), and smaller Picidw (Woodpeckers). These
are temporarily packed in tin herbarium cases in the main upper room of the south
tower.

3. The reserve series of smaller old world land-birds, arranged in a walnut cabinet
in the top room of the south tower.

4. The reserve series of larger birds, arranged systematically, and including chiefly
Gallinaceous birds, water-birds, and birds of prey, but also the larger Corvide and
Cotingidew, the genera Campephilus and Hylotomus, and all of the Neotropical as well
as old world Picarie (except Picide) and Parrots. This, the most bulky portion of
the collection, is stored in twelve large cabinets of the ‘‘Salvin” model (measuring 8
feet in length by 4 feet in breadth and height), and seventeen large chests, and other
cases, in the west basement.

5. The exhibition series in the museum cases.

6. Mounted specimens intended for the exhibition series, but not yet put on stands

7. The duplicate series, stored chiefly in the west basement.

8. The collection of alcoholic specimens, intended for anatomical investigation, also
in west basement.

9. Collections in storage, not yet acted upon.

A summary of the number of specimens contained in these separate series, as de-
termined by a careful inventory concluded December 30, 1882, is as follows: *

Storage.—The bird collections of the Museum are stored as follows:

The North American reserve collection of smaller birds in ten walnut cases, fitted with
open drawers and loose-fitting sash doors ; two of these cabinets measuring 53 inches
long, 26 inches wide, and 38} inches high; the others measuring 374, 26, and 364 inches,
respectively.

The Old World reserve collection of smaller birds in one case similar to the larger sized
ones containing the North American collection.

The Neotropical reserve collection of smaller birds (except Humming-birds), in eighty-
one old Japanned-tin herbarium cases, 19 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 6 inches
thick.

*The discrepancy between this statement of the extent of the bird-collections and
that contained in tne Assistant Director’s report for 1881, is explained by the fact that
the latter was based merely upon a rough estimate, it being impracticable at the time
to make an actual inventory.
134 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The reserve Humming-bird collection, in a galvanized-iron chest, 30} inches long, 21
inches wide, and 20} inches high.

The reserve collection of larger birds (not classified geographically ) in twelve large ‘‘Sal-
vin” cabinets, each 8 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 4 feet high, with closed, interchangeable
drawers; and in seventeen large chests measuring 464 inches long, 294 inches wide,
and 214 inches high.

The duplicate collection in various drawers, chests, and boxes, or wherever room can
be found.

Desiderata.—It having been the policy of the Museum to make a specialty of Ameri-
can ornithology, the chief desiderata are in consequence principally among foreign
birds. The collections of the Museum embrace, however, tolerably good collections
from Europe, New South Wales, New Caledonia, Polynesia, and Kerguelen Island.
But from Africa, Asia (except Japan and parts of Eastern China), New Guinea, the
East India Islands, Philippines, Tasmania, Madagascar, and the various islands of
the Indian, South Atlantic, and Antarctic Oceans, the Museum possesses little or noth-
ing; while the birds of New Zealand, Western and Northern Australia, the Sandwich
Islands, and Japan, are are very incompletely represented. The most desirable Old
World birds are of course those of the eastern portion of the Palerctic region (Siberia,
Kamtschatka, Japan, etc.), the close zodlogical relationship between that region and
North America requiring a careful and complete comparison of specimens from the
two regions, not only in the case of species common to the two (circumpolar species),
but also of representative species and genera.

There are also still many important desiderata among Neotropical birds, which it is
highly desirable should be secured as soon as practicable. <A full list of these desi-
derata has been published in the “ Proceedings” of the National Museum (vol. 4, pp.
165-203). The total number of Neotropical species of birds known to date, is about
3,800, exclusive of North American species found within Neotropical limits. Of this
number the National Museum possesses no less than 2,225 species, among them being
not a few which are unrepresented in other museums. The national collection is es-
pecially rich in West Indian birds, containing as it does nearly all the known species
of that interesting portion of the world, and is by far the most complete extant.

The aggregate number of specimens of Neotropical birds in the collection is not
known; but the reserve skin series of Passeres, Trochilide, and Pici (exclusive of
the genera Campephilus and Hylotomus) alone contains nearly 9,000 specimens.

In volume 4 of the ‘‘ Proceedings” of the National Museum (1881, pp. 165-203), there
was published a ‘‘ List of speciesof Middle and South American birds, not contained
in the United States National Museum,” the object of the list being to acquaint mu-
seums and individuals with the desiderata of the collection. Cwepies of this list were
judiciously distributed, the direct result being the addition of nearly 100 species to the
collection, and the promise of several hundred more.

Among North American birds there still remain a few important desiderata. Prin-
cipal among these are, of course, species of which the Museum possesses no specimens
whatever, as Cuvier’s Kinglet (Regulus cuvieri), Lawrence’s Warbler (Helminthophaga
Zawrencei), the White-throated Warbler (H. leucobronchialis), the Cincinnati Warbler
(H. cincinnatiensis), the Carbonated Warbler (Perissoglossa? carbonata), the Blue
Mountain Warbler (Dendrwca? montana), Small-headed Flycatcher (Myiodioctes? mi-
nutus), Grinnell’s Water Thrush (Siurus nevius notabilis), Large-billed Shrike (Lanius
ludovicianus robustus), Brewster’s Linnet (A?giothus brewsteri), Thick-billed Parrot
(Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha), Arctic Horned Owl] (Bubo virginianus arcticus), Krider’s
Hawk (Buteo borealis krideri), Pallas’s Cormorant (Phalacrocorax perspicillatus). Siber-
ian Gull (Larus affinis), Hornby’s Petrel (Oceanodroma hornbyi), Large-billed Puffin
(Fratercula arctica glacialis), Short-winged Guillemot (Brachyrhamphus brachypterus),
and Sooty Guillemot (Uria carbo). The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of the above
named species, it may be remarked, do not exist, so far as known, in any collection.
The Museum is also particularly desirous of obtaining good specimens of the Califor-
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 135

nian Vulture or Condor (Pseudogryphus californianus), and of the American Flamingo
{Phenicopterus ruber), for the exhibition collection.

A complete list of the desiderata of the Museum among North American birds has
also been published in the “Proceedings” (vol. Iv, pp. 207-223).

The number of entries in the bird register during the year has been
3,761, and of eggs 300. In the latter case, however, the figures afford no
indication of the actual number of specimens catalogued. The number
of packages sent out was 57, twelve being distributed in exchange, 38
lent for examination, (of which 28 have been returned,) and seven miscel-
laneous, the total number of specimens distributed having been 892 of
skins, representing 597 species, and 123 lots of eggs, representing 90
species.

Forty-four papers founded upon this collection, have been published
by eleven persons as follows: Robert Ridgway, 18; William Brewster,
13; Dr. L. Stejneger, 3; Mr. George N. Lawrence, 2; Mr. N. C. Brown,
2, and one each by Dr. T. H. Bean, Mr. E. P. Bicknell, Mr. J. H. Gur-
ney, Mr. C. C. Nutting, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, and Mr. L. M. Turner.

The curator has also devoted much time to the revision of the final
volumes of the “ History of North American Birds.”

A full bibliographical list, as well as an account of the many-valuable
accessions to this department will be found in another part of this re-
port. ;

Bird Skeletons.—The care of the collection of bird skeletons was vol-
untarily assumed by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U.S. A... During the early
part of the year the unassorted material was inspected and re-arranged,
and was made by Dr. Shufeldt the basis of several publications. In
1882 Dr. Shufeldt was ordered to New Orleans, and the collection now
stands in the bird compartment of the west basement of the Smithsonian
building.

DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

Dr. Henry C. Yarrow, U.S. A., has continued to act as curator of
this department. His services have been voluntary as heretofore, and
and he therefore stands upon the list of officers as an honorary curator.
His duties in connection with another department of the Government
service have rendered it impossible for him to devote very much time
to the Museum except in his vacation, though two assistants have been
working steadily upon the collections during the entire year. This col-
lection is now established in the easternmost of the small rooms south
of the corridor leading to the west basement of the Smithsonian build-
ing. This can be regarded solely as a storage room and the collection
as being provisionally in storage, though the specimens are arranged
in a systematic order unsurpassed in any other department. Nothing
is on exhibition except the collection of casts of snakes and turtles in
the north hall of the new building. Much of the material, lent many
136 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

years ago to Prof. E. D. Cope for investigation, has been reutrned and
incorporated with the remainder of the collection.

One of the most important tasks accomplished during the year has
been the preparation of a complete catalogue of the North American
species in which every specimen, with its locality and the name of its
collector,is given, the duplicates being specially designated. This is
the first of the systematic catalogues of the National Museum and
forms Bulletin 24, prefaced by 1 new check-list of the reptiles and
batrachians of North America.

Much has already been accomplished by the curator of this de-
partment in the identification and final arrangement of the exotic rep-
tiles, a task which, like that of rearranging those of North America,
has been especially laborious, for the reason that the original labels in
many instances were destroyed in the fire of 1865, and have never been
replaced.

The number of entries in the record books for the year is 230, repre-
senting about 920 specimens. The following census of the collection is
presented by the curator:

This census relates to the North American reptiles. In addition
there are estimated to be about 8,000 foreign reptiles. A number of
living reptiles have been placed on permanent exhibition in the new
building.

DEPARTMENT OF FISHES.

The west range of the Smithsonian building has been assigned to
the department of fishes for exhibition purposes, and has been redec-
orated and fitted with new cases. The fish laboratories in the north
end of the west basement on the first story, in the basement north of
the corridor leading to the west basement, in the east end of the cloister
north of the west range, and m the temporary second story of the same
cloister, have been re-arranged and made more convenient by building
a private stair-case in the tower at the northwest corner of the main
building, and by the construction of new stories in book-cases.

A large number of fishes were placed on exhibition, but have been
withdrawn for the purpose of making a revision of the entire collection.
This task, which is still in progress, is one of great magnitude, the
number of duplicates being large, and the history of many of the speci-
mens having been recovered since the fire. It is now being carried on
with great rapidity by Dr. Bean, who has been assisted by Messrs.
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. TST

R. H. Miner and H. G. Dresel, U. S. N., Mr. Peter Parker, and Mr.
Barton A. Bean.

The extent of the task may be estimated from the fact that between
the time of the beginning of this work, in October, and the first of Jan-
uary over 10,000 catalogue cards were written, each containing the
name of the species and of the donor, the catalogue number, the locality,
and the size of the jar in which the specimens were contained. In con-
nection with this work every specimen is inspected and every receptacle
supplied, when necessary, with fresh alcohol.

Specimens frequently have to be transferred from old tanks and bot-
tles to better vessels. Another laborious task is that of stamping the
catalogue number on a strip of block tin and attaching it permanently
to each specimen in the reserve series,a work which has been going on
during the entire year with the hope of having every specimen in the
Museum before long permanently identified by having attached to it an
indestructible label.

Dr. Bean presents the accompanying census of this collection, based
upon estimate :

And remarks as follows upon its condition and his present methods of
administration:

I am confident that this estimate is below rather than above the real figures. More
than 10,000 catalogue cards have already been written for the specimens in bottles,
and the work is not more than two-thirds completed. There will be certainly 15,000
cards for the identified species, exclusive of large faunal collections, such as those
of Alaska, Japan, China, Southern United States, Bermuda, West Indies, and deep
sea off the New England coast, all of which are set aside for special reports from offi-
cers of the Museum now employed in their investigation when opportunity can be
had. The tank collection is also very large, and will bring up the total number to
the figures given above, and probably far beyond.

As a matter of course, where so many fishes are to be cared for, some of which are
received in bad condition, part of the materialis poorly preserved and some is fit only
to be thrown away. Difficult as it is to keep a collection of fishes in good order, and
remembering the length of time during which some portions of it have been in this
Museum, subjected to the ordinary causes of decay as well as to the wear and tear in-
volved in such examination of specimens as has always been permitted here, it is not
to be wondered at that we have some mutilated and decayed fishes. Until a thorough
overhauling, which is now in progress, is completed, the collection will contain some
things which are neither pleasing nor useful.

The bad element, however, is comparatively small and is rapidly decreasing. With
the exception of the salmonoids and allied families proverbially hard to preserve, the
bottled fishes are mostly in good condition. Many of the tanks used for holding large
fishes are leaky and their tin lining is worn off, so that copper stains are frequent on
specimens so kept. We have transferred such lots to newly-tinned tanks, recently
received, whenever their condition was noted.

The fish skins, as might be expected from the nature of such preparations, are gen-
138 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

erally in a pitiable condition. Dust-incumbered, moth-eaten, rigid and brittle from
age,gnawed by rats and mice, they are a solemn warning against the attempt to
illustrate species by such means. I have only too gladly obeyed my instructions to
destroy all such material unless, for some reason or other, it is necessary to keep it in
the collection. Hereafter nothing but types or examples from localities of especial
interest will tax our efforts to preserve them, and, whenever possible, these skins
will be put in glass jars.

During the first ten months of the year Mr. H. L. Todd executed 93
drawings of fishes under the direction of the curator. These are in
continuation of the series of drawings of the fishes of North America
begun five years ago, the number of which has now extended to 665.
These drawings are prepared especially for reproduction by the photo-
relief process, and are exceedingly fine, thorough scientific accuracy of
detail having been secured through the supervision of Dr. Bean, who
has devoted much time to the examination, measurement, and criticism
of each drawing.

During the year 88 papers, written by 22 persons, as shown in the
following list, were prepared with special reference to specimens in this
department.

There are only two persons who have made much use of the collec-
‘tions besides the Museum officers. Professors Jordan and Gilbert, by
reason of their contributions of fishes from the west coast of the United
States, Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, Charleston, and other re-
gions, have performed much labor upon the elaboration of these colleec-
tions and other Museum material previously sent here from the same
places. By reference to the bibliography immediately following this
chapter, it will be seen that nearly twenty papers have been written by
these gentlemen, principally upon material recently contributed by one
or both of them. These studies were made principally upon fishes of
Lower California, Mazatlan, Panama, Gulf of Mexico, and Charleston.

Professor Hay studied and reported upon the 64 species taken by
him in Mississippi, Tennessee, and other Southern States before they
were forwarded to the Museum.

Miss Rosa Smith and Mr. Joseph Swain reported upon a collection
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 139

of fishes made at Johnston’s Island, Pacific Ocean, and Mr. Swain pre-
pared papers on Syngnathine and Stolephorus.

As in years past, the curator of this department has acted as editor
of the “Proceedings” and “Bulletins” of the United States National
Museum, also performed the duties of editor of the Fish Commission
Bulletins until April 1882, at which date this work was transferred to
Mr. C. W. Smiley, of the Fish Commission.

DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS.

Mr. William H. Dall, of the United States Coast Survey, has continued
his voluntary supervision of this department. No assistants, however,
having been assigned to him this year, and his own time having been
largely occupied by his official duties elsewhere, including an investi-
gation of the deep-sea mollusks collected by Mr. Alexander Agassiz on
the Blake, little has been done on the general collections, which are
in the main stored in the drawers of the table cases in the main Smith-
sonian hall and its galleries. The mollusk laboratory on the fourth
floor of the main central tower of the Smithsonian building has, how-
ever, been entirely refitted and refurnished, and is now the most com-
pletely equipped of all the special laboratories. A great quantity of
material belonging to this department, including the Binney collection,
the collection of fresh-water shells identified and labeled by Mr.
James Lewis, and that portion of the collection labeled by Mr. Robert
E. C. Stearns, which has already been received, together with many
other valuable lots, is stored in packing-boxes in the general storage
room in the central basement of the Smithsonian building. During the
year the boxes containing mollusks have been separated from the others
in storage and have been included in the card catalogue of the storage
rooms prepared by the registrar. Our collection of mollusks is exceed-
ingly rich, and it is hoped that during the present year steps may be
taken toward its final arrangement. Mr. R. E. C. Stearns, of Berkeley,
Cal., who had been expected to assume the curatorship, has hitherto been
prevented by ill health. Mr. Dall in his report for the year presents a
history of the department and suggestions for its administration, which
it seems desirable to place on record:

The collection of the mollusca has suffered many vicissitudes in the past. It is
about eighteen years since I first became interested in the mollusk collection of the
Institution. It is about fourteen years since I first took charge of it, and my connec-
tion with the duties of the position has been (except during about fourteen months
in 1870~71) that of a volunteer worker, struggling to keep from deterioration a val-
uable typical collection, without clerical assistance, without any of the mechanical
aids to labor employed in all museums of equal importance, without any regular al-
lowance whatever for the needs of the department, with a building and cases which
rendered the work of preservation more than ordinarily difficult, and with the ne-
eessity of supporting myself by other work which occupied nearly all the ordinary
working-hours of the day. It is obvious that under such circumstances the curator
who succeeded in making any impression on the material which was added from
140 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

time to time by gift or exchange, in addition to keeping order among that originally -
on hand, might reckon himself fortunate.

The original collection was mounted with cement on glass plates by the late Dr.
Philip P. Carpenter. Twice the writer replaced the twelve or fifteen thousand spec-
imens upon their tablets, from which the extremes of winter cold and summer heat
had detached them. When the third winter passed and the effect of the temperature
was again apparent, I spent a month experimenting with cements, found none reli-
able, and proceeded to relabel and place in paper trays the entire collection.

From July, 1871, to January, 1875, I was detailed on field work in Alaska by the
United States Coast Survey, and again in 1880. During these periods the curator-
Ship remained practically vacant. While engaged in the above-mentioned field work,
dredgings were carried on over nearly the whole coast of Alaska, and of invertebrates
alone, from 1871 to 1875, not less than 100,000 specimens were forwarded to the
Museum. On my return in 1875, the question of representation at the Centennial Ex-
hibition was mooted, and the curator of mollusks devoted, with the exception of his
Sundays, every spare hour of his time fur six months in preparing a collection of eco-
nomic invertebrates for that occasion.

The funds available for this purpose indirectly benefited the collection by the
duplicates which came in with specimens collected for exhibition and which were
administered upon simultaneously.

At this time the valuable services of Mr. F. G. Sanborn were temporarily obtained,
and by hard and constant work the general collection of the Museum was labeled,
cleaned, and systematically arranged. The policy of the curator from that time for-
ward has been simple.

Specimens of a general character coming in are carefully registered and boxed’ and
put in store. A collection prepared by the late Dr. James Lewis, for the Centennial,
of the land and fresh-water shells of the United States, carefully labeled, catalogued,
and packed, has been retained in its original boxes. Everything of value or not ad-
ministered upon has been put away, packed and secluded, safe from harm at least,
until better times for the colection should arrive. In this way only could the progress
made be held good. Until skilled assistance and a constant guardianship are availa-
ble, it would be very unwise to expose to the inevitable injuries of dust, accident, or
carelessness, collections whose value could not be estimated in money. Meanwhile the
curator has bent his energies and employed his leisure in putting into shape for future
reference special groups, one by one. In this way something has been accomplished.
This has been done especially with the brachiopods, limpets, and chitons, but unfortu-
nately, owing to defects of the only cases available, mice and dust have since made
such effectual inroads upon the chitonide that the labor of months has been lost and
that part of the collection practically ruined. -

The immense collection of Alaskan mollusks, howevei, has been registered and sys-
tematically arranged, compared, and studied in a preliminary way, and has suffered
from nothing worse than dust. The administration upon some thirty or forty thou-
sand specimens has taken several years, and has been carried on wholly out of ordi-
nary office hours,

During the last year the curator has been engaged during spare moments in re-
porting upon the very interesting mollusks of the deep sea obtained by various United
States vessels, especially the party on the Coast Survey steamer Blake, under the
supervision of Prof. A. Agassiz; and the mollusks of the northwest coast have been
temporarily laid aside, to be returned to hereafter. The latter are in a forward state
and will take comparatively little labor to prepare a proper monograph and cata-
logue of them for publication.

The present state of the collection may be summarized as follows:

1. Labeled in order and accessible for reference, the general collection of mollusks.
prepared by Dr. Carpenter, and of which part was originally mounted on glass, ex-
cept two boxes as hereafter mentioned.
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. ¢ 141

2. In order and accessible for reference, but requiring new labels, the West American
collection prepared by Dr. Carpenter and originally mounted on glass, containing
many of his types. Also the types of Dr. Gould’s descriptions of North Pacific mol-
lusks, from the Rodgers exploring expedition, so far as they are in the possession of
the Institution. The majority of the types of Dr. Gould, however, though the prop-
erty of the United States, have never reached the National Museum, and are believed
to be in private hands.

3. In order, labeled, catalogued, and inaccessible (i. e., packed up), the collection
of North American land and fresh-water shells prepared by Dr. James Lewis for the
Centennial exhibit of the National Museum.

4, Identified and labeled with rough labels, to be replaced by the standard Museum
label before exhibition, catalogued, but not unpacked, two boxes of the original
Carpenter collection of miscellaneous shells.

5. Identified and labeled as above by the donors, packed up safely, but never yet
placed on the Museum catalogues or registers, the Binney collection of typical
American land shells; a large number of shells (between 2,000 and 3,000 species)
given to the Museum by W. H. Dall, being his own private accumulations by pur-
chase, collection, or exchange, when not connected with the Museum; numbers of
small donations from many friends of the Institution, received from time to time;
typical land and fresh-water shells received from Dr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia, &c.

6. Unidentified virgin material received from definite localities, packed safely, but
not administered upon in detail, an immense stock from the United States, and di-
vers valuable lots of exotics.

7. Separated, labeled with preliminary labels, registered, and in process of being
worked up, generally dusty, but in good order, the general Alaskan and northwest
coast collection contributed by W. H. Dall, his associates and friends, from original field
researches; a smaller but still valuable Californian collection from the same sources;
a North European collection of recent and Tertiary fossil species obtained by purchase
and exchange for special comparison with and identification of the preceding ; also
many Arctic species gathered with the same end in view.

8. Injured and worthless specimens; though notwithstanding the great mass of the
material belonging to the Institution, it is probable that there is unusually little trash
in it.

9. Alcoholics, in good order, partly labeled. There isa large collection of alco-
holics, much of which is labeled and, thanks to the care and energy of Mr. Rathbun,
in excellent order. It may be worth while to remark that, all earlier alcoholics hav-
ing been removed by Dr. Stimpson to Chicago and subsequently burned in the historic
conflagration, when the curator returned to Washington, in January, 1875, there was
no alcoholic collection except that made by himself in Alaska and California. (The
Fish Commission collection, not having reached Washington, is not included among
the assets of the Museum, though eventually to become so.) Special attention has
been given to this class of specimens; and by a wide correspondence and the gener-
osity of the never-failing friends of the Smithsonian Institution, a good representa-
tion of most types of mollusks may now be found in the room devoted to inverte
brates in alcohol. A few species have lately been received from the collections of
the Fish Commission, and a larger number from Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, collected on the
Pacific coast.

Having thus briefly reviewed the treasures of the National Museum in the present
curator’s department, a few words as to facilities obtained during the year and re-
quired for the future are in order.

Until the present year, the conchological department of the Museum has not been
provided with cases suitable for receiving and preserving shells free from dust, mice,
and sudden concussions from ill-fitting drawers.

During the present summer the laboratory has been partly fitted up in excellent
shape. The middle and chief working room of the range of three in use for the
142 ° REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

shells has been fitted with good and dust-proof cases, a new gallery, and accommoda-
tion in the shape of universal drawers for a large number of specimens. It is hoped
and believed that to these will be added suitable cases for the Museum Hall, in
which finally perfected work may be placed permanently for reference or exhibition,
without fear of deterioration. Steps have already been taken to replace the inflam-
mable partitions of the east and west laboratory rooms by brick walls, and to refur-
nish with suitable shelving and cases this part of the work-shop.

Means for making sections of shells are desirable, but the necessary lathe might
economically and easily be made a part of the taxidermist’s equipment, where it would
be equally and more frequently useful, while still accessible when needed.

It is the writer’s opinion that an extensive exhibition of the shells as mere objets
de regard is not desirable. He believes that, first, a thoroughly illustrated series of a
few typical forms from embryo to adult, with enlarged models and dissections of the
soft parts; secondly, an economical series, with illustrations of their economic applica-
tion, asin cameo shells, pearl shells, &c.; thirdly, a good local series of the mollusks of
the District; and, lastly, a case or two of prominent characteristic forms of the different
orders, recent and fossil, side by side, would be more instructive, more interesting,
and more desirable than the large series of every attainable species common to most.
museums, and which produces, except for the specialist, only a confused and even
wearying impression upon the visitor’s mind.

DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS.

As was stated in my last report, the department of entomology is one
which has been very little cultivated in the National Museum, although
in past years the Smithsonian Institution has published many valuable
works on insects, and through its various collectors gathered much ma-
terial for investigation.

The material thus obtained by special collectors, by the various Gov-
ernment surveys, as well as that sent in by correspondents, has always.
been distributed for study to the several entomologists who have been
serving as collaborators of the Smithsonian Institution, much of the mate-
rial having passed into the hands of the entomologists of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, it always having been the understanding that all
material, after being reported upon, should be returned to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture for preservation in its cabinets. The custody and
entire responsibility of the national collection of insects was in this way
transferred to the Department of Agriculture; but the lack of a per-
manent museum organization and the constant changes in the heads.
of the Department resulted very unfavorably for the collection, and the
remnants of the same, which have recently been transferred to the
National Museum by the present Commissioner, are of very slight im-
portance. Prof. C. V. Riley, the entomologist of the Department of
Agriculture, has, from the time of his accession to that position, urged
the transfer which has recently been made, and has from the beginning
insisted that the systematic collection should be preserved under the:
permanent organization of the National Museum. Following out this
idea, Professor Riley accepted, in 1881, the position of honorary curator,.
performing voluntarily such duties connected with this division of the
Museum as are at present necessary.
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 143

Professor Riley has deposited his own private collection of insects,
which comprises about 30,000 species of all orders, mostly from North
America, arranged in some 350 double folding boxes, and in two cabinets
with eight glass-covered drawers, the specimens being all in good
condition and classified so far as determined. In addition to this col-
lection, Professor Riley has deposited a large amount of material pre-
served in alcohol, mounted on microscopic slides, or blown and mounted.
dry, illustrating the life, history, and economy of more than 3,000 spe-
cies. This collection is illustrated by a large quantity of notes and.
descriptions, in large part still unpublished.

The Riley collection now on deposit represents about all that is val-
uable in this department of the Museum.

Mr. Albert Koebble was assigned as an aid to the curator during a por-
tion of the year. The actual work has consisted chiefly in the answering
of inquiries made regarding insects, from correspondents of the Museum
and the Smithsonian Institution, and in taking care of and mounting
the material received. The collection has been constantly used in the
work of the Department of Agriculture by specialists who have found
occasion to refer to it. All investigations in entomology made by the
curator during the year were for the Department of Agriculture, anda
statement of the various lines of investigation pursued will be found in
his annual report for that Department. <A list of papers by him printed
during the year is also given in the bibliography appended.

The following suggestions are extracted from the curator’s report:

Repeatedly during the year collections have been offered but necessarily declined,
because there was no fund for their purchase. I would strongly recommend, therefore, _
that provision be made, Ist, for the purchase of such collections as are of sufficient.
value and which maz se from time to time offered or obtainable; 2d, that a com-
petent assistant be permanently engaged in the general work of the Department and
in the preparation of the exhibit collection.

Hitherto no attempt has been made to preserve and keep together the entomologi-
cal material that has been gathered and brought to Washington by officers of the
Government. Such material has generally been turned over to the Department of
Agriculture and either distributed among specialists or neglected and lost sight of.
While my present work as curator is a labor of love, and very little can be accom-
plished without means, yet I shall strive to at least properly care for the specimens
that accumulate from various sources until such time as their importance shall war-
rant more means and labor being devoted to them.

DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

The collection of marine invertebrates under the direction of the cura-
tor, Mr. Richard Rathbun, is rapidly being reduced to order; the ar-
rearages of many years fast being made up. This has been a task of
considerable magnitude, from tie fact that in the decade ending 1880
very little attention had been paid to this department, and that the best
part of the material was destroyed in the burning of the Chicago Acad-
emy of Sciences. The amount of space assigned to this department is
very small, consisting of the western work-room south of the corridor
144 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

leading to the west basement, the laboratory in the western end of the
cloister north of the west range, and the west range of the Smithsonian
building. The west hall has been assigned to this department for its
exhibition purposes, but is still to some extent filled with other material
eventually to be moved to the new museum. Very little, therefore,
has been done in the development of the exhibition series, and the chief
activity has been in the store-rooms, but the results are not so apparent
now as they will be when room can be found for the proper installation
of the collections. The coral collection, as well as part of the echino-
derms and sponges, have been mounted on ebonized tablets, and the
experiments which have been made in arranging these in cases with
maroon backgrounds indicate that the west hall when arranged will be
one of the most beautiful and attractive in the Museum.

Mr. Rathbun has been assisted during the year by Messrs. J. B. Blish
and W. E. Safford, midshipmen, U.S. N., and by Messrs. R. S. Tarr and
George F. Weld; the latter a volunteer.

The number of entries in the catalogue during the year have been
2,630. The card-catalogue begun last year is now nearly complete, con-
taining between 8,000 and 9,000 cards. This card-catalogue indicates
which of the specimens are in the reserve and which in the duplicate
series.

During the summer the curator was attached to the party of the
United States Fish Commissioner at Wood’s Holl, and under Professor
Verrill had charge of the dredging operations on the steamer Fish
Hawk. Mr. Rathbun paid special attention to the use of the tow-nets
at different depths in collecting free-swimming copepods, on which he
is preparing a special report; and he has also been engaged in preparing
for the Fishery Report, now in progress of publication under the joint
direction of the Commissioner of Fisheries and the Superintendent of
the Census, a chapter descriptive of the natural history, of all known
species of economic American marine invertebrates, and of the methods
and results of this particular fishery. These reports, which are now in
the hands of the printer, set forth the practical features of this depart-
ment of the Museum, which are of no small consequence, as they embrace
the lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and sponges, the annual fisheries for which
amount to over $1,200,000. This is the first attempt made to report
upon this class of fisheries in this country from accurate data. Fourteen
papers relating to this department have been published during the year,
five by the curator, six by Prof. A. E. Verrill, one by Mr. Sidney I.
Smith, one by Dr. T. Hale Streets, and one by Mr. John A. Ryder.
The collection of fresh-water crayfish has been lent to Mr. Walter An-
derson, of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, for study and publica-
tion.

Mr. Rathbun has submitted the following special statement upon the
distribution of duplicate specimens:
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 145

The condition of the collections in this department of the Museum can now be con-
sidered as exceptionally good, considering the restricted quarters in which they are
contained. It was the first care of the curator, when he entered upon his duties, in
the fall of 1880, to examine every part of the collection with reference to its safe
keeping, and every new accession has been unpacked as soon as it was received, in
order that no destruction might result from long storage. The dry specimens have
all been removed from the basement rooms, which are too damp for the preservation
of such materials, and the entire alcoholic collection has been examined at least once a
year, for the purpose of replacing alcohol lost by evaporation or the cracking of jars.
It is impossible to state the number of specimens or species now belonging to this de-
partment, as large portions of the collection are still uncatalogued and larger portions
un-identified. The reserve series is very extensive and contains much unique mate-
rial. The dry reserve specimens of corals and sponges have been mostly mounted and
placed on exhibition, as have also representatives of all the groups of echinoderms
and a few of the crustaceans. The exhibition series, thus far prepared, contains the ~
following number of specimens:

Corals, 734. Sponges, 235. Echinoderms, 510. Crustacea, 47.

The National Museum suffered severely by the Chicago fire of 1871, which destroyed
almost all of the alcoholic reserve series of crustaceans and radiates, as already ex-
plained. The reserve series as now constituted has been derived from innumerable
sources, of which the following are the most prominent, either from the size or value
of the collections furnished :

From the United States Exploring Expedition: About 50 types of Dana’s species of
crustaceans, partly dry and partly alcoholic, have been left to the Museum, and are
still in good condition for examination. A large number of the corals obtained by
the same expedition and named by Dana are also intact, and, although they have
suffered much from rough handling, they still form the most important feature of the
exhibition series of corals. A few of the United States Exploring Expedition sponges
were also saved.

From the North Pacific Exploring Expedition: A small number of Stimpson’s types
of crustaceans and many dry echinoderms were retained at Washington, and thereby
escaped destruction.

From the United States Fish Commission: As elsewhere stated, the Fish Commission
collections constitute the bulk of the materials in nearly all the branches of this depart-
ment. These collections are especially complete for the New England coast as to
the decapod and isopod crustaceans, pycnogonids, worms, echinoderms, and anthozoa,
and include large quantities of unidentified crustaceans and radiates from the South
Atlantic coast, collected by Messrs.Earll and MacDonald; from the Gulf coast, by
Mr. Silas Stearns, and from the Pacific coast, by Prof. D. 8. Jordan.

From the Bermuda Centennial Commission: A fine collection of Bermuda corals.

From the Museu Nacional de Rio de Janeiro: A complete collection of Brazilian
corals.

From Mr. John Xantus: An old collection of corals and other specimens from Southern
California.

From various naval expeditions, including the Transit of Venus Expedition, the
Palos Expedition, and the Alliance Arctic Expedition: Numerous collections of radi-
ates, crustaceans, and worms.

From Dr. T. H. Streets, U. S. N., and Dr. William H. Jones, U. S. N.: Similar
collections from several sources.

From the United States Coast Survey: Alaskan collections of crustaceans, worms,
radiates, and sponges, collected by Mr. William H. Dall. j

From the United States Signal Service parties in Alaska, including Mr. E. W. Nelson.

From Mr. L. Turner and the party at Point Barrow: Miscellaneous collections.

From the United States Coast Survey steamer Blake: Crustaceans, crinoids, anthozoa,
and sponges, received from Prof. Alexander Agassiz.

ous collections from the North Sea.

By purchase: A large and fine series of the commercial sponges of the world,
exhibited at the Centennial Exposition and identified by Prof. Alpheus Hyatt.

From Prof. H. L. Smith : 1,275 microscopicslides of foraminifera, from many sources.

It would be quite impossible to enumerate further the constituent parts of the reserve
series without going beyond the proper limits of this report.

The duplicates still on hand and available for distribution are as follows: Number
of species: Crustaceans, 43; Worms, 19; mollusks, 48; bryozoans and tunicates, 30;
radiates, 42; sponges, 5; total, 187. Number of specimens: Crustaceans, 24,000;
worms, 4,000; mollusks, 24,000; bryozoans and tunicates, 6,000; radiates, 16,000;
sponges, 259; total, 74,250.

The reserve series of specimens is still in quite an unfinished state, which makes a
report upon it very unsatisfactory. So much material has been received during the
past year, and other administrative work, including the distribution of duplicates,
has interfered to such an extent, that in many cases it has been only possible to
enter the specimens in the record books and store them for future examination. In
reality, more time has been spent upon the reserve series than upon any other collec-
tions. The different groups are arranged separately in the storage cases and any
specimens desired can be readily found. <A portion of the reserve series of alcoholic
crustaceans and echinoderms has been stored temporarily in the wall-cases of the main
hall of the Smithsonian building; but the bulk of the alcoholics still remain in the
east and west basements of the same building.

In this connection it may be proper to refer to the work now being carried on at
New Haven by Prof. A. E. Verrill and Prof. 8. I. Smith, on the marine invertebrates
collected by the United States Fish Commission on and off the New England coast.
The curator is not kept informed as to the progress of this work, excepting as reports
are handed in for publication and finished collections are received for the Museum.
An account of the materials so far received from Professors Verrill and Smith has
already been given, and a bibliography of their reports published this year will be
found below.

The exhibition series—The work thus far accomplished in the preparation of the
exhibition series of invertebrates has been extremely satisfactory, and gives promise
that the display of marine invertebrates will be second to no other in the Museum
in attractiveness. In the fall of 1881 the west hall of the Smithsonian building, which
had been previously occupied by the mineral exhibit and a portion of the pottery
received from the Centennial Exposition, was assigned to this department, but as yet
only a part of the wall space has been made available for use. This hall, which has
a length of 90 feet and a width of 40 feet, is admirably fitted for the exhibition of
specimens, and is well lighted. Suitable cases of black walnut cover the walls, to
« height of 74 feet, on three sides of the room, the east, south, and west. The empty
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 147

floor space remaining after the large objects of pottery shall have been removed will
be sufficiently great to accommodate five or six separate upright cases, and the semi-
circular space at the north end can also be utilized for smaller cases. Only the cases
on the east and south sides have thus far been emptied of the old collections, and
these are now filled with marine invertebrates. Considerable time was spent in pre-
paring this exhibit, in studying the effect of different-colored tablets and backgrounds
upon the specimens, ebonized tablets and a maroon background to the cases being
finally adopted as the most desirable and attractive. The collections first selected for
exhibition were those which could be the most readily prepared and which were in
greatest need of proper storage—the dry corals, sponges, and echinoderms—and these
naturally constitute the most showy portions of the marine invertebrate collections.
Mr. E. H. Hawley, who had been very successful in the preparation of the exhibition
series of marine invertebrates at the Peabody Museum, of Yale College, and at the
American Museum, New York, was employed for this task, which he has executed in
a very superior manner, producing a more attractive display than probably exists in
any other similar museum in the country. Mr. Hawley continued his work upon
this collection during most of 1881, and until March, 1882, when his services were
required in another department of the Museum, and the mounting of marine inverte-
brates was temporarily discontinued. He had, however, finished all the specimens
that had been prepared for mounting up to that time.

As the cases prepared for this purpose were inadequate to hold the entire mounted
display collection, it has been impossible to arrange it in proper order, but, never-
theless, the temporary arrangement has been duly appreciated by the public, judging
from the many favorable criticisms passed upon it. The showy corals now form the
bulk of the display collection, and, considering that a majority of the corals are types
from the United States Exploring Expedition, their value is very great. Other feat-
ures of this display are the centennial collection of Bermuda corals; a complete series
of all the known species and varieties of commercial sponges, identified by good
authority ; a large series of Alaskan sponges; and a great variety of echinoderms,
from many sources. The proposed additions to the exhibition series will be discussed
further on. The Museum printing office having been fully occupied with preparing
labels for other departments, the exhibition collection in this department is still un-
labelled, but this deficiency will be remedied during the coming year.

Distribution of duplicates.—The extensive explorations of the United States Fish
Commission, along the eastern coast of the United States, during the past twelve
years, have brought together a large mass of duplicate materials, in the line of marine
invertebrates, which is being distributed as rapidly as possible to institutions of
learning throughout this country, and to a few foreign ones. No returns have been
demanded for the duplicates disposed of in the United States, but those sent to for-
eign countries are generally in exchange for collections of equal value for the Museum.
Three general series of duplicate sets have already been prepared and two distributed.
The first series, consisting of 50 sets, with 118 species each, and over 18,000 speci-
mens in all, was sent out, in 1879, to many of the higher schools of learning in this
country, and to a few foreign institutions. Series II, also containing 50 sets of 189
species each, and a total of over 50,000 specimens, is now very nearly ready for distri-
bution, and will be sent out the coming January or February. Series III, or the edu-
cational series of 50 sets, with 98 species each, and a total of over 15,000 specimens,
was finished and distributed in June, 1882. Enough material stills remains for mak-
ing up a second educational series of 200 sets, with about 125 species each, and the
work of preparing this series will be begun in January, 1883.

As a part of Series II, ten additional sets, containing the same species and many
others, is now being prepared, for sending to the London Fishery Exhibition of 1883,
to be disposed of in Europe, by exchange, for collections for the Museum. This
Museum is greatly in need of authentic foreign collections of marine animals for the
purposes of comparison, and much valuable material of this character can undoubt-
edly be obtained by such a system of exchange.
148 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The disposal of such a quantity of duplicate material as is now being sent out, of
no further value to the Museum, will be of benefit to the institution in more than one
way. In addition to increasing its sphere of usefulness, and bringing back to it some
returns in the way of exchanges, it will also relieve the Museum of much care and
expense, necessary to the preservation of such an extensive colleetion, and enable
the workers in this department to devote their entire time to the reserve and unde-
termined materials.

From the many resources of the National Museum, it is natural to suppose that this
department will, in the course of time, assume greater proportions than the same
department of any other museum in the country. The accessions for the past three
years, or since the renewal of activity in this line, have beenso great that the depart-
ment has outgrown the space assigned to it, and, unless more room is made available
at an early date, the safety of the collections will be more or less imperiled. It is
very gratifying to the curator to be able to note such rapid progress in a department
which has lain dormant for so long a time.

Among the many plans proposed for the coming year, it is intended to make con-
siderable advancement in the preparation of the exhibition series, in order that the
more instructive specimens, of which many are still packed away, may all be made
serviceable to the general public at once. Another reason for rapidly perfecting the
exhibition series is one now generally recognized by all museums, that, as a rule, less
damage happens to specimens when they are open to constant inspection than when
they are stored away out of sight. The pottery now filling the cases on the west side
of the marine invertebrate hall is to be soon removed, when these cases will be altered
to correspond with those now containing the invertebrate collections. Enough speci-
mens of corals and sponges are now mounted or prepared for mounting to nearly fill
these new cases, so that with little exertion a very extensive display can be made.

The scheme for the exhibition of specimens in this department, as at present worked
out, comprises two features—the general display collection, which we have deen dis-
cussing, and the synoptical collection, which has not yet been begun. The former
will illustrate the several groups of marine invertebrates, with reference to external
form, by a massing together of all the members of the groups, which it is possible to
obtain or to exhibit to advantage in the cases. The synoptical collection will be of a
more educational character, and will represent the external and internal anatomy,
and embryology of typical members of each group by means of careful preparations,
dissections, and diagrams. The latter scheme will necessitate a much greater outlay
of labor than the former, and will require a number of years for its accomplishment.
This portion of the exhibition collection will have to be accommodated in new up-
right cases, to occupy the center floor space, after the present incumbrances are re-
moved. The general display collection will also soon outgrow the wall cases allotted
to it, and require additional space on the floor.

In the present scheme no account has been taken of the large reserve series of al-
coholic specimens, excepting where such may be used in the synoptical collection.
The general display collection now contains only dried specimens, which are the most
suitable for display. The ordinary cylindrical jars of thick glass distort their contents,
and it is generally impossible to keep the alcohol so clear that the specimens can be
readily distinguished from the outside. Nevertheless, there are in this department
large quantities of showy specimens, of which dry preparations cannot be made, and
which it is desirable to display. Square jars have been suggested, and would certainly
be preferable to the round ones. A matter of greater importance, however, is the safe
keeping of the entire reserve series of specimens in alcohol, which is now mainly stored
in dark rooms and passageways in the basement, where it is very difficult to giveit the
proper attention. A portion of these specimens, which have been determined and
properly labelled, have been arranged in the wall cases on the south side of the main
Smithsonian hall, and if no objection is made the curator proposes to fill as many of
these cases as are not now used for other purposes. There is no doubt but that the
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 149

safety of the collections will be greatly improved by keeping them open to daily
inspection.

A great desideratum in this department is a supply of authentic foreign collection
for the purposes of comparison in making identifications, and an attempt will be made
this spring to remedy this deficiency in part by soliciting exchanges from several
European authorities. For this purpose, ten very superior sets of duplicates of Fish-
Commission specimens have been prepared and will be sent to the London Fishery
Exhibition, where they can probably be disposed of to the best advantage of the
Museum.

DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL INVERTEBRATES. j

The department of fossil invertebrates has been under the charge of
Dr. C. A. White, who during part of the year was directly in the em-
ploy of the Museum, and who now, having accepted the position of pa-
leontologist of the United States Geological Survey, continues his work
in the Museum as honorary curator. Unlike most of the honorary eu-
rators, however, his whole time, except when in the field with the survey,
in summer, is devoted to administrative work and investigation upon
the collections, and his office is in the laboratory of the department.
This department is now installed in the west-south range of the new
Museum, being deposited in the drawers of thirteen unit table-cases,
the laboratory being in the two adjoining rooms at the west side of the
south entrance. No part of this collection is on exhibition, and consid-
erable portions of it are still in the storage rooms. The most valuable
specimens, particularly those which have been studied and have served
as types for the publication of the late Prof. Fielding B. Meek, have
been cleansed of the accumulated dust of long storage and put in excel-
lent order.

Dr. White’s own specialty is in the study of the invertebrates of the
Mesozoic and Cenozoic periods, and Mr. C. B. Wolcott, also of the Geo-
logical Survey, has been assigned by its director to work in this depart-
ment, and is acting as assistant curator, under the direction of Dr. White,
having special charge of the Paleozoic fossils. His work in the field
extends over more than half the year, and work upon this section of the
collection is not so far advanced. Mr. L. M. Garrett, U. S. N., has
acted as assistant in this department and accompanied the curator to
the field upon the work of the United States Geological Survey from
July to October. Dr. White has already devoted much time during the
year to duties as chief of the Artesian Wells Commission.

Of this department of the Museum it can be said that its material is
in excellent order for scientific investigation, and that it is being exten-
sively used for that purpose.

I quote from Dr. White the following statements and recommenda-
tions:

The present state of the collection is that of only partial arrangement, and there-
fore the number of specimens cannot be given, even approximately. Their condi-
tion, however, is favorable to their complete arrangement and division into series as
soon as I shall get time and suitable assistance to do the work. A few years ago @
150 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

considerable quantity of duplicate specimens was set aside for exchange. Subse-
quent investigation has shown the desirability of retaining a large part of these in
the Museum, and it is therefore necessary to review them again before any are sent
out.

Since even an extensive collection of fossil invertebrates may be presumed to be less
attractive to the public than much of the material of other departments, my plans
have contemplated mainly such a classification and arrangement of the Museum col-
lection as will make it conveniently available to students for scientific purposes.
The fact that so large a part of these specimens are those upon which official reports
and other scientific writings have been based, makes it especially desirable that they
shall be made accessible to students of paleontology as early as practicable.

DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL PLANTS.

This department, like that of fossil invertebrates, is under the honor-
ary curatorship of an officer of the United States Geological Survey,
Prof. Lester F. Ward. The collection is installed in the drawers of a
number of unit-table cases in the west south range and upon the south
balcony, contiguous to which at its east end is the laboratory of the
curator. This laboratory has during the year been filled up with cases,
and a large amount of preliminary work has been done by the curator,
who since October has been assisted by Mr. E. E. Hayden, midshipman
of the United States Navy. This collection, like many others, has been
in a quiescent state for many years, and a large amount of work has
been found necessary, preliminary to its final arrangement in proper
shape for study. No effort has as yet been made to provide exhibition
space for it. Its present condition is well shown by the following ex-
extracts from Professor Ward’s report:

The extensive collection which had been received from Mr. Leo Lesquereux, of Co-
lumbus, Ohio, who had previously employed it in the preparation of his printed re-
ports, and had catalogued and numbered it according to your instructions, was merely
unpacked during the last months of 1881, and remained at the beginning of the year
in a wholly unorganized condition. The bulk of the work done in the department
has therefore been that of systematically classifying and arranging this material. This
work was deiayed by the necessity of having appropriate cases erected in the labora-
tory rooms to receive it, as also by the lack of assistance and the performance of du-
ties in connection with the Geological Survey.

The deficiencies of a merely chronological catalogue rendered necessary the prepa-
ration of a much more complete and convenient slip catalogue, which could be sys-
tematically arranged and serve as an efficient aid in the progress of the work.

The catalogued material has been arranged in three series according to horizon,
viz, the Cretaceous (chiefly from the Dakota Group), the Tertiary (including for con-
venience the Laramie Group, which Mr. Lesquereux considers to be Eocene), and the
Carboniferous and lower formations (there being a few from the Old Red Sandstone
of Ireland, and a few from the Silurian of New York).

The system of classification adopted is, in so far as this was practicable, that of
Schimper, as given in his ‘“‘Traité de Paléontologie Végétale,” the most comprehen-
sive work on the subject.

As the greater part of the undetermined material in the department belongs to the
later formations, and as my field work for a great while will probably be chiefly con-
fined to these horizons, I have found it necessary to reserve, for the present at least,
the whole of the Cretaceous and Tertiary collection and retain it in the laboratory
as a basis for comparison and investigation. For the same reason I have not thought
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. Toe

best to select a reserve series of the Carboniferous plants, and have prepared the
whole collection for exhibition in the cases below. It still remains on the balcony
waiting the completion of the necessary cases.

Very little was done during the year in the way of original research or towards the
elaboration of new material, owing to the time required in making these prepara-
tions.

Fifty-nine specimens of Alaskan fossils were sent in September by your instructions
to Mr. Lesquereux to be figured. These have been returned. One specimen (No. 556):
was sent, August 15, to Dr. J. S. Newberry, to be used in connection with a report to
be published by the Geological Survey.

The following is a summary exhibit of the state of the collection so far as regards
specimens which have been specifically determined :

The undetermined material consists chiefly of the thirty-one boxes collected by my-
self in 1881, and seven boxes collected by Captain Bendire.

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS.

The classification of the departments of the Museum provides for three
departments in the division of geology: (XVI) physical geology, in which
branch no work has as yet been attempted; (XVII) minerals and rocks;
and (XVIII) metallurgy and economic geology. The two latter were for
nearly two years under the charge of Dr. George W. Hawes, whose
death on the 22d of June has been in many ways an irreparable loss to
the Museum.* Mr. William 8S. Yeates, aid in the staff of the Museum,
has during the year had special charge of the department of minerals,
and with the assistance of Messrs. E. E. Hayden, Henry 8S. Chase, and
EK. Wilkinson, midshipmen in the United States Navy, has been pressing
forward the work of unpacking and cataloguing the accumulated mass
of material. The number of entries on the Museum register has been
2,528, representing 3,437 specimens; of these 1,370, have been assigned to
the exhibition and reserve series, and 417 to the duplicate series; 155
have been rejected, and the remainder assigned, according to their nature,
either to the collection of rocks or ores and metallurgical products.
The card catalogue in the duplicate series has been increased during
the year by 1,261 cards. Mr. Yeates reports that such work as has been
done is that of putting in order the specimens in the old collection, a
large number of which have never been entered on the register. The

work of entering these and putting the catalogue number on each
specimen has been for some time, and is now, in progress. Numbers
have been painted on 2,894 specimens, and nearly 2,000 labels have been
written. A preliminary classification has been begun, and twenty.
three sets of duplicate specimens have been distributed; some of them
as exchanges, but the majority to institutions of learning. Mr. Yeates
reports, upon the present state of the collection, that it contains 6,939
specimens in the combined reserve and exhibition series, while in the
duplicate series there are about about 7,000 specimens, making an ap-
proximate total of 14,000 specimens. During the past year 413 specimens
were added to the reserve and exhibition series, and 1,261 to the dupli-
cate series.

The mineral collection is disposed in drawers of unit cases in the
west hall of the new Museum, while a great mass of material, unas-
sorted and in process of classification, is still in the temporary work-
room in the southwest court.

The department of building-stones, which in the preliminary classi-
fication was associated with that of mineralogy, has already been re-
ported upon as one section of the department of arts and industries.

DEPARTMENT OF METALLURGY AND ECONOMIC GEOLOGY.

This department, like the preceding, has been without a head for
the greater part of the year. In July, 1882, Mr. I’. P. Dewey, previously
employed as chemical assistant to Dr. Hawes in his investigations upon
the building stones for the Tenth Census, was given temporary charge of
the department of the collection, and made some preliminary studies and
inspections. On December 1, Mr. Dewey was appointed to the eurator-
ship of the department. Active work in the department is, therefore,
hardly begun, and all that can be said concerning it is in the way of
anticipation. To this department is assigned a very large portion of the
material given to our Government by the various foreign Governments
and other exhibitors at the close of the Centennial Exhibition, which
from 1876 to 1882, was stored in the basement of the Armory Building,
and which has in part been removed to the new museum, together with
the material recently received from the permanent exhibition in Phila-
delphia and stored in the temporary building adjoining the Armory.
The curator of metallurgy and economic geology also necessarily acts as
curator of the section of metallurgy and metal-working in the department
of arts and industries, which is already in possession of great quantities
of heavy and bulky material, and which may be expected rapidly to grow
in extent and importance. This department is one of the most difficult
the Museum to manage; the material which it includes is always heavy in
and unwieldy and oftenof great bulk. Unlike many other departments,
it must place on public exhibition almost everything which it contains;
in fact, it has a greater share than any other department of material
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 155

which is chiefly useful on account of its educational value, which for
purposes of investigations might perhaps better be examined in the
place in which it was collected. Its proper arrangement, therefore, must
be the work of several years; and, on account of the number of laborers
required to handle it, the work must be comparatively very costly.

The original intention, to the carrying out of which the Museum is in
a certain way pledged, was that the mineral resources of each particular
State should be shown separately; and, to accomplish this, it will be
necessary to secure extensive additions to the collection from almost
every State in the Union; extensive not only in number, but also in
bulk, weight, and cost of transportation.

Another difficulty in the management of this department is the
uncertainty as to its final location. At present the southwestern quar-
ter of the building, including the west hall, the southwest court, and
the two adjoining ranges, are assigned to the division of geology, to
metallurgy and metal-working. ~A portion of this space is at pres-
ent occupied by paleontological collections, but even when these are
removed the space will probably be inadequate for the accommoda-
tion even of the material already on hand. Should a new building be
erected for the Museum, these collections will naturally be the first to
be transferred, and consequently much bulky material will require to be
moved. It cannot be doubted, however, that this department will be of
greater importance to the country in an industrial way, and will interest
and benefit a larger number of the visitors to the Museum, than any
other; especially when it is so arranged as to show concisely and im-
pressively the character of the mineral resources of each State and the
methods by which the various products of the metal-working industries
are produced.

Mr. Dewey reports that in the catalogue of the collection there have
been made 3,851 entries, representing 4,772 specimens; of these 4,420
were specimens previously received from Centennial sources, and of
which no entry had been made, and 281 were specimens entered from
the old Smithsonian collection. Almost all the work done has been
upon the reserve series, especially upon the Centennial material, about
150 boxes having been unpacked and specimens identified as far as pos-
sible, and all information in regard to them put in a permanent form for
preservation. This was a work of considerable magnitude, since much
care and time were necessary in unpacking the specimens and tracing
up their records.

The southwest range is at present assigned to this department, and
in it quite a number of specimens are to be seen, although nothing
can properly be said to be on exhibition. The collection of ores from
Nevada is the only special collection which has been thoroughly exam-
ined; the records in regard to this are perfect and its condition satis-
factory.
154 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

‘The curator has presented the following estimate of the present con-
dition and possible future of the department:

As to the number of specimens it is not possible to give it exactly, as many speci-
mens are still packed in the boxes in which they came from Philadelphia, and with
the exception of 360 they are all as yet in the reserve series; after a careful estimate
I would place the number at about 20,000.

In general, the condition of the specimens is perhaps fair, although many of the more
showy specimens have suffered from want of proper care and attention aside from
the necessary deterioration by decomposition, generally confined to the surface, but
in some cases extending to the interior, in which case serious disintegration has been
the result. Decomposition is the chief source of deterioration of metallurgical speci-
mens, and while there are various devices for its prevention, no feasible plan has yet
been proposed to completely arrest its action.

A matter of the first importance in this departmentis a collection for the study of the
science of metallurgy, which need not be large, as it will contain little or no duplicate
material, and will be designed to show the following points in the production of the
metals: the natural occurrence of the various ores of each metal, together with the
prominent associated material ; the natural occurrence of such materials as are neces-
sary in the refining of the ores; the various processes for the extraction of the natural
occurring material showing the plans and methods of exploration and working
principally by means of models and drawings, and, where practicable, by the exhi-
bition of specimens of the tools actually used; the various steps in the treatment
of the ores from the time they leave the mines until they are converted into the com-
mercial metals, with specimens of the various intermediate products and plans and
models of the machines, furnaces, &c., brought into requisition during the processes;
(this is perhaps the least satisfactory part of the present collections in the Museum,
and one that should be increased as rapidly as possible ;) and, finally, the various forms
in which the different metals are produced and placed upon the market, together with
the incidental products, especially such as can be utilized.

By far the greatest portion of the collection, however, should be arranged upon a
geographical basis, whereby the ores and products of certain regions would be grouped
together, and, when possible, the connection between the various regions should be
clearly indicated. In the arrangement of this collection a somewhat different plan
should be followed from that adopted in the scientific collection, as in this case there
will be of necessity considerable duplication of specimens, and prominence should be
given to peculiarities in occurrences and composition of the ores, and the modifications
thereby necessitated in the usual course of treatment. This collection will require
constant care and attention to keep it abreast of the progress of development, which
is very rapid in this country where many new regions are being explored and devel-
oped every year, and where the varying conditions found in isolated regions lead to in-
teresting and important modifications in processes, which should be examined and made
available to the rest of the world. It is also very desirable to have suites of speci-
mens showing the changes occurring in the composition and character of ores from
the surface tothe greatest depth attained, but these cannot be obtained after a mine
has been in operation a fewyears. At the same time, as regions decline in importance,
and processes become antiquated and pass out of use, a judicious culling out of unim-
portant material could be made with advantage. There is one field which the depart-
ment could with propriety occupy, namely, the collection of the literature of American
metallurgy, which is at present very restricted, a condition readily explained by the
fact that metallurgical knowledge has a high commercial value which its possessors
desire to retain, from purely selfish motives. Such books as there are upon metallur-
gical subjects are mainly of European origin, and their ignorance and silence upon de-
velopments in metallurgy made in this country are so great as to make them valueless
for application here except so far as broad general principles are concerned. There
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 155

have been many and great advances in metallurgy made in this country, and a com-
plete record of their development would be a valuable contribution to knowledge. It
is but just to say that, asa rule, American metallurgists have written and published
. far more than their European brethren, but there is still room for improvement. The
majority of papers by American writers are scattered through various society-journals
and other periodicals, so that the student is obliged to waste a great deal of time in
tiresome search through a large amount of (to him). valueless matter.

DEPARTMENT OF EXPLORATION AND FIELD WORK.

The explorations which have been made, especially in the interest of
the National Museum have been, as hitherto, under the immediate di-
rection of the Smithsonian Institution, from whose funds the expenses
have been for the most part defrayed. The details are given at length in
the report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Various
officers of the Museum have been attached, especially during the summer
months, to the service of the United States Fish Commission, the Geo-
logical Survey, and the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, while others, more or less affiliated with the Museum, have been
engaged in field work incidentally in connection with their duties as
employees of the Coast Survey and the Signal Service of the Army.

DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY.

The chemical laboratory occupies the two upper stories of the south-
west pavilion, and the chemist, Mr. Frederick W. Taylor, has been
engaged in the solution of many questions in chemistry and economic
geology, proposed by the other departments of the Museum or by out-
side departments of the Government. The chemist reports that, in an-
swer to letters received from the Director, he has made 119 reports, 15
being letters in response to queries submitted to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution; 70 being reports of qualitative analyses of specimens received
by the Institution, and identifying 93 specimens of minerals, rocks, and
ores. Thirty-four reports have been made representing 65 quantitative
anaylses, and involving 274 determinations. '

One of the most interesting of the investigations was made for the
chairman of the Heuse Committee on Ways and Means for the purpose
of determining the possibility of extracting the methylic alcohol from
the ethyl alcohol contained in English methylated spirit. Another was
the analysis of eight samples of zinc-covered or galvanized-iron tele-
graph wire for the Signal Office of the War Department, the object
being to find some explanation of the different degrees of resistance to
an electric current exerted by the different wires.

The main work of the laboratory has, however, been the examination
of questions in economic geology, involving the analyses of numerous
specimens of iron ore, coke, gold and silver ore, of natural brines, and
of soda incrustations from Nevada, the latter for the United States Geo-
logical Survey.
156 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The chemist makes the following statements upon the present condi-
tion of the laboratory:

The present condition of the chemical laboratory is, with very few exceptions, most
promising. In the balance-room we have three No. 7 analytical balances, one large
analytical balance to carry one kilogramme, one assay button balance, one small so-
called prescription scale, one pulp scale for assay charges, and one Jolly’s balance for
specific gravity determinations.

Ample facilities for the preparation of samples for analysis are provided, the labo-
ratory being provided with a small Blake crusher for reducing samples to small frag-
meuts, a ‘‘ buck plate ” for assay samples, and a number of valuable agate mortars for
preparing samples of silicates, rocks, &c., where iron cannot be used.

The facilities for assaying are good, there being three furnaces for that purpose, one
for crucibles, and two for searification and cupellation. The stock of glassware is good,
as alsothe porcelain. The main feature of the laboratory, however, is the fine stock
of platinum ware in the form of dishes and crucibles, the laboratory possessing 19
platinum dishes holding from 50 cubic centimeters to nearly half a liter, and 25 plat-
inum crucibles. In addition to the 2,070 grammes spoken of, the Institution has pur-
chased at different times about 700 grammes of platinum, this being purchased before
we had received the addition from Newport, making in all about 2,770 grammes of
metal, representing a money value of over eleven hundred dollars.

In regard to the general arrangements of the rooms of the laboratory a full descrip-
tion will be found in the report of the Institution for 1881. The main room is fitted
with white-pine desks, one running across the entire width of the room against the
south wall, the other being placed against the third wall, besides which there are
cases for chemicals and apparatus, and afume chamber. The balance room is hand-
somely fitted up with cases of black walnut and contains a heavy black walnut table
for the balances. The third floor of the building has also been fitted up during the
year with a substantial double desk. During the past year the supply of water has
been entirely insufficient, or rather the pressure has been insufficient, causing much
annoyance, the flow often ceasing for the greater part of the day; and should the en-
gineer desire to fill his boilers no water can be had on the laboratory floor during the
process. Frequently the operation of distilling water for use in making analysis
had been suspended for lack of water to cool the condenser. To remedy this evil,
the chemist would suggest that a tank be placed on the roof of the building and con-
nected with the feed pump for the boilers in the engine room by a suitable arrange-
ment of valves; this could be so arranged as to supply the upper or third floor contin-
uously, being used on the second floor only when the ordinary supply should fail.

DEPARTMENT OF EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY.

Mr. John A. Ryder, embryologist of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, has occupied during the year a laboratory fitted up for micro-
scopic work, and especially for embryological investigations, in the
Armory building, and has carried on several important investigations
upon the embryology of fishes and oysters. The laboratory has been
filled up with considerable completeness, chiefly at the expense of the
Fish Commission.

A list of Mr. Ryder’s publications will be found in the appended bib-
liography.

The Museum has furnished a considerable amount of material to Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, who is engaged in investigating the
venom of the rattlesnake, and also a number of specimens to Dr. John
J. Mason, of Philadelphia, for his studies upon the brain.
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM, 157

In connection with the Fish Commission work some very important
experiments have been made by Colonel MacDonald and Mr. Ryder
upon the retardation of the developement of the eggs of shad and other
fishes. :

Involuntary experiments have been made in this department dur-
ing the year by Dr. Rk. W. Shufeldt and Mr. A. Z. Shindler, of the
Museum, the former having been bitten by a Heloderma suspectum, and
having described his experience in the ‘‘ American Naturalist,” Novem-
ber, 1882, Vol. XVI, No. 11, the latter having suffered a like mishap while
handling a specimen of Hlaps fulvius, as described by Mr. F. W. True
in the “ American Naturalist,” 1882, Vol. — page —.

DEPARTMENT OF VIVARIA.

A number of living animals are on exhibition in the rotunda of the
new building and seem to afford much amusement and instruction to
visitors. This department, while of but little service in the general
disposition of the collection, is well suited for the exhibition of a few
cases of living animals; and I am inclined to believe that fifteen or
twenty characteristic forms might be obtained and maintained here at
trifling expense, while serving an excellent purpose in illustrating and
supplementing the preparations in the Museum eases.

At present, the following mammals are thus exhibited:

A Red-footed Douroucouli, or Owl Monkey (Nyctipithecus rufipes, Sela-
ter), from Costa Rica; two Pinches, or White-tufted Marmosets (@dipus
titi, Lesson), from Chiriqui, Colombia; a young Mexican Deer (Cariacus
mexicanus, Gmelin), from Chiriqui, Colombia. All these specimens were
presented to the Museum by Capt. John M. Dow.

In the same room is also a large case in which at various times
throughout the year many species of American snakes have been shown.
Upon these the curator of herpetology has made the following report:

The vivarium for reptiles continues to prove of the greatest interest to visitors, and
it is hoped a sufficient number of living specimens may be sent to render it still more
popular. In connection with it, a most instructive and interesting event occurred
early in the summer, namely, the birth of 109 young snakes (Tropidonotus sipedon).
The act of parturition was carefully observed, and it is the intention of the curator
to publish a paper upon the subject.

There is little trouble in keeping the harmless reptiles alive in captivity for an in-
definite length of time, provided proper food can be obtained; but with regard to the
Crotalus and Ancistrodon, as yet our efforts have failed to induce them to feed.

It has been noticed, also, that quite a numberof our specimens die from necrosis
of the jaw, an experience which has, it is believed, been shared by nearly every
museum and zoological garden in the world.

Early this year a very fine and extremely large rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus)
was received from Florida, and shortly after an equally large kingsnake (Ophibolus
getulus), and it was determined to test the popular belief as to the antagonism exist-
ing between the two species. They were accordingly placed in a large case, the bot-
tom of which was covered with sand, and allowed to remain together for some time.
No hostilities took place, and it was noticed that neither species appeared to fear the:
other. Perhaps under more natural surroundings the case may be different.
158 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

It has been found necessary to keep king-snakes apart from the others, as their canni-
balistic tendencies are well developed.

In the months of September and October copulation was noticed between some fine
examples of the indigo snake (Spilotes erebennus) in the vivarium, and it is aoped
young specimens may be secured as a result.

In the basin of the fountain in the rotunda are kept living fishes of
the following species :

1. Cyprinus carpio (Linné). a scale carp; 6b leather carp.

2. Carassius auratus (L.) Bleeker. Goldfish; a common form; } triple-
tail form.

3. Hybrid between Nos. 1 and 2. 4, Idus melanotus (Heckel).

In a tank in the same room are shown two specimens of albino axo-
lotls (Siredon pisciformis), which were bred by M. Carbonnier in Paris,
France, from other albinos which were the progeny of a pair of black
axolotls.

Nearly all the living species of North American Testudinata are kept
in confinement in one of the smaller inclosures on the carp ponds on
Monument lot, where they remain for purposes of acclimation.

Fishes of the following species are cultivated in the carp ponds:

1. Cyprinus carpio (Linné). ascale carp; b mirror carp; c leather carp.
2. Idus melanotus (Heckel). Leuciscus idus (Gthr.). Nerfling; Orfe;
Golden Tench; Ide. 3. Tinca vulgaris (Cuv.). Tench.

These ponds are under the control of the Director of the Museum, and
the details of their management are described in his report as Commis-
sioner of Fisheries. Many American species of fish have also during a
part of the year been kept in aquarium tanks in the Armory Building,
where during the spring months extensive operations in connection
with the hatching of fish have been carried on, which have been wit-
nessed by large numbers of visitors.

OBITUARY NOTICE OF DR. G. W. HAWES.

GEORGE WESSON HAWES was born December 31, 1848, in Marion,
Ind., and died of quick consumption June 22, 1882, in Manitou Springs,
Colo., whither he had gone in the hope of benefit to his health.
Both his parents were natives of Massachusetts; and both died while he
was very young. His father was the Rev. Alfred Hawes, a missionary
of the American Home Missionary Society, stationed at Marion, Ind.
His early days passed under the care of a lady in Worcester, Mass., a
friend of his parents whom he regarded as his foster-mother.

His taste for scientific studies was early manifest, and, having been
for some years a student in the High School, Worcester, at the age of
seventeen he entered the Sheffield Scientific School at New Haven, to
which with some intermissions he was attached for fifteen years in the
capacities of student, laboratory assistant, and instructor. From 1867
REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM. 159

_to 1871, he was engaged in business pursuits in Boston, but returneé to
graduate with the class of 1872, four years later tuan would otherwise
have been the case. The first year after his graduation he was private
assistant to Prof. 8. W. Johnson in the chemical laboratory, subse-
quently until 1880 assistant and instructor in mineralogy and blow-pipe
analysis in the Sheffield Scientific School. The summer of 1878 he de-
voted to the study of microscopic lithology in Breslau, under Prof. A.
Lasaulx, and from March, 1879, to June, 1880, was studying mineralogy
and crystallography at Bonn with Professor vom Rath, and lithology
with Professor Rosenbusch at Heidelberg. He received the degree of
doctor of philosophy from the University of Heidelberg in 1880.

In the fall of 1880, he accepted the position of curator of the Depart-
ment of Economic Geology in the National Museum, and about the same
time was appointed special agent of the Tenth Census in charge of the
building-stone investigation. His strength was too heavily taxed by
close study in the hot summer of 1881, and in the fall he found himself
unable to continue his work. A month at the Warm Springs in Vir-
ginia failed to restore his vigor, and on his return it was ascertained
that incipient lung trouble existed. He decided to spend the winter in
the Bermudas, hoping that the mild air of a southern ocean would
restore him to health. On his return in May it was evident to us all
that his days of life were few, and as we bade him good-bye, when he
set forth for Colorado, we could scarcely hope to see him again.

In the early part of his student life he paid much attention to bio-
logical studies, and in the summer of 1872 was one of the party accom-
panying the United States Fish-Commission at its summer station at
Eastport, Me. Later he became an enthusiastic botanist and published
a most admirable work upon the flora of New Haven and vicinity.
After finally selecting a specialty he devoted himself to it with untiring
zeal, and. at the time of his death had piaced himself in the front rank
of American mineralogists and lithologists. His future was rich in
promise. He regarded his life work as just begun, and his chief regret,
as he often expressed it to me, was that he had to leave a task which
he had for so many years been laying out and preparing himself for.
‘His death,” remarks Dr. Rosenbusch in the Neues Jahrbuch fiir Min-
eralogie, ‘‘has deprived science of an enthusiastic and unusually gifted
servant.” He was possessed of unusual executive ability, and his asso-
ciates in the Museum often wondered at the ease with which he organ-
ized and conducted his own department. He had published twenty
or more memoirs upon mineralogical and lithological topics, promi-
nent among which are his studies upon contact zones in the Albany
granites, and the Mesozoic diabase of Connecticut. His largest work was
the Mineralogy and Lithology of New Hampshire, constituting volume
IV of the Reports of the State Geologist. He regarded the investiga-
tion of the building stones of the United States, which he had just taken
in hand, as the great work of his life, and had laid out an extremely
160 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

comprehensive scheme for its prosecution. The report upon this sub-:
ject, soon to be published by the Census Bureau, his in conception and
chiefly the product of his labors, will undoubtedly be the finest of its
kind ever prepared. The National Museum contains an imperishable
monument to his memory in the magnificent collection of building
stones which he gathered—a collection far surpassing any other in the
world.

Hawes was a man of upright and noble character—a character shaped
by a reverent faith in the teachings of the Christian religion. Like
many men trained in the methods of scientific thought, he felt unable
to agree with the doctrines of any sect, but in our conversations he
asserted his belief in the Christian revelation, and all who know him
must feel that his life was shaped by this belief.

first to be a pyroxene, is hornblende, and that the rock belongs therefore to
the diorite group.

On liquid carbon dioxide in smoky quartz.

(Am. Jour. of Science, 1881, xx1, pp. 203-209.)

The author finds the smoky quartz of Branchville, Conn., to be particularly
rich in cavities, containing carbonic acid in both the liquid and gaseous state.
Considers that the motion of these included bubbles is due to changes in
external temperature. The paper is supplemented by a communication by
Mr. A. W. Wright, giving the results of chemical examinations of the gases
and liquids contained in these cavities.

On the determination of feldspars in thin sections of rocks.

(Proc. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 134-136.)

The author gives as the result of his experience that grave errors are liable
to arise through relying altogether upon optical methods for determining
feldspars in thin sections, since, owing to the uncertain angle at which the
crystals are cut, it is not only not possible at all times to distinguish with
certainty between the different varieties of plagioclase, but at times they can
with great difficulty be distinguished from orthoclase.

On a phosphatic sandstone from Hawthorne, Fla.

(Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1882, v, pp. 46-48.)

Gives the results of microscopic and chemical analysis of a phosphatic

THE COLLECTION OF BUILDING STONES.

About the time that Dr. Hawes entered upon his duties as a curator
at the National Museum he also assumed charge of that branch of the
Tenth Census relating to the quarrying industries of the United States.
His plan was to make acomplete census of all the quarries of stone worked
in the country, to ascertain the amount and value of their productions,
the number of men employed, and all the facts usually included in cen-
sus reports; in addition to which it was hoped to gain a large amount
of information of more strictly scientific interest. In order to carry out
his plans, special agents or collectors were employed, in all cases in
which it was possible, men of scientific attainments, whose education and
training had especially fitted them for the work, who were to visit the
quarries in person and gather all necessary facts of economic import-
ance relative to the industry, besides which they were instructed to col-
lect all additional facts possible of scientific importance but perhaps of
less practical value. Among the printed questions to be answered rela-
tive to each quarry were the following: “Kind of rock quarried?”
‘Geological age of formation?” “ Structure of natural blocks as regards
stratification and jointing?” ‘“ How large a block can be obtained?”
‘‘ Principal uses for which it is employed?” &c.; or, if the stone was
used for ornamental purposes only, there were added such questions as,
* What are the qualities that render this stone desirable for ornamental
purposes ?” and, “Is it suitable for ornaments exposed to the weather ?”.

From each quarry two specimens, or more if the character of the rock
seemed to require it in order to represent it in all its varieties, of suffi-
cient size to be dressed into four-inch cubes, were forwarded by mail
to the Museum for further examination. Here a corps of aids and
assistants was employed to work up the material as it came in. Each
specimen on its arrival, after being catalogued, was placed in the hands
of stone-cutters who dressed them into four-inch cubes the different faces
of the cubes being finished as follows : Polished in front, drafted and
pointed on the left side; drafted rock face upon the right side; rock
face behind, and smooth sanded or chiseled upon the top and bottom.
This preparation was modified to suit individual cases; for example,
sandstones which do not polish, had the front face simply rubbed
smooth. The specimens thus prepared were placed in suitable exhibi-
tion cases and properly labelled, where they might be examined by all
who wished.

The chips made in the process of dressing were carefully saved to be
utilized in chemical and microscopic analyses. Also specimens from
each quarry, so far as practicable, were to be submitted to proper tests,
to ascertain their powers of resistance to pressure. Special tests were
also to be made to learn the absorptive properties of the various kinds
of stone; their specific gravity and weight per cubic foot; their powers
of resistance to the effect of heat and frost, together with the effect of
166 REPORT ON NATIONAL MUSEUM.

certain included minerals upon their weathering properties. Prepara-
tions were made for extensive chemical analyses, and several hundred
thin sections prepared for microscopic study.

The final report was to be published in quarto form and to contain, in .
addition to extensive articles upon the subjects already mentioned,
chapters on the history of the quarrying industry of the United States,
and upon rock weathering and decomposition as illustrated in the stone
buildings of the principal cities of the country. It was also to contain
numerous plates showing the rocks both as they appear to the naked
eye and as seen in thin sections under the microscope. A|so illustrations
of some of the principal quarries and of special machinery used in
quarrying and dressing stone.

When it became evident that Dr. Hawes could no longer continue his
work it was placed in other hands for continuation, but the long delay
already caused by his illness rendered its full completion impossible
within the limits of time prescribed by the census, and it was therefore
greatly abbreviated. Had he been able to carry out his plans as origi-
nally intended, this would, beyond all doubt, have been the most impor-
tant work upon the subject of building stones ever produced in this or
any other country.

(Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 317-333.)

The object of this catalogue, as expressed 1n the preface, ‘‘is to render ap-
parent the desiderata of the National Museum in the way of Old World birds,
so that museums or individuals desiring to make exchanges (or donations)
may know what species are wanted.” The total number of species enumerated
is 1,339, to which there have been many additions* during the year, the re-
sult chiefly of a judicious distribution of the catalogue. It is proposed to
publish annually a supplement to this list, giving the names of all the species
added to the collection during the year,for the information of those from
whom accessions to the collection may be expected.

Notes on some Costa Rican birds.

(Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 333-337.)

This paper is based upon a small but very interesting collection of birds
presented by Sr. Don José C. Zeledon, of San José, Costa Rica, and mostly
obtained upon the voleanic peak of Irazti. This elevated peak, like many
others of a similar character throughout tropical America, possesses a number
of entirely peculiar species, increased by two in the collection upon which
this paper is based, viz, a very pretty wren (Troglodytes ochraceus), and a re-
markable, as well as totally new form of dendrocolaptine bird (Acanthidops
bairdi), the genus as well as the species being new.

Description of a new flycatcher and a supposed new petrel

from the Sandwich Islands.

(Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 337-338.)

The birds described in this paper are new and very distinct species (Chasi-
empis sclateri and Cymochorea cryptoleucura) from the island of Waimea Kaui.
The ornithology of the Sandwich Islands, notwithstanding their accessibility,
being very imperfectly known, every addition to our knowledge of the birds
of these islands possesses peculiar interest.

—— Description of a new owl from Porto Rico.
(Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 366-371.)
In addition to the description of a new species (Asio portoricensis), this paper
treats critically of the nearly cosmopolitan Asio accipitrinus, or short-eared
owl, and its allies.

Descriptions of two new thrushes from the United States.

(Proc. U. 8. Nat. Mus., 1881, Iv, pp. 374-379.)

The birds herein described are Hylecichla fuscescens salicicola, or willow
thrush, from the Rocky Mountains, and H. alicie bicknelli, from the Catskill
Mountains, New York. The latter is of particular interest, as being a local or
geographical race of a species which breeds abundantly along the Arctic coast
of North America, and which was supposed to be specially limited to that dis-
trict during the breeding season. Nevertheless, Mr. Eugene P. Bicknell, of
Riverdale, N. Y., found a smaller and darker colored form, unquestionably
referable to the same species, breeding upon the Catskill Mountains, at an
elevation of about 4,000 feet.

being spent at La Paz, on the eastern side of the peninsula. Among the birds
obtained at this locality was a single example of Swinhoe’s wagtail (Motacilla
ocularis), a species belonging to eastern Asia, so that the individual in ques-
tion must in all probability have crossed the Pacific Ocean, perhaps aided
by some vessel bound toward our shores. The other, a Mexican species, the
chestnut-headed yellow warbler, (Dendraca bryanti), first described in 1874,
Mr. Belding found to be a common inhabitant of the mangrove thickets skirt-
ing the Gulf shore.

(Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, 1, 1882, vir, pp. 1-6.)

This article embodies areview of the question of dichromatism in Ardea occi
dentalis (first hinted at by the author in the Bulletin of the U. 8. Geol. and
Geog. Survey of the Terr.,1, 1878, Iv, pp. 2-236), and also brings to notice
an allied dichromatic species, or race, from western Florida, named Ardea
wardi, in honor of its discoverer, Mr. C. W. Ward, of Pontiac, Mich., who

generously turnished the facts and specimen upon which the new species
was based.

RIDGWAY, ROBERT. Notes on some of the birds observed near Wheat-
land, Knox County, Indiana, in the spring of 1881.

(Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, 1, 1882, vu, pp., 15-23.)
This paper presents the chief results of a collecting trip to the locality in
question, in the interest of the National Museum.

On the generic name Helminthophaga.

(Bull. Nutt. Orn, Club, 1, 1882, vir, pp. 53-54.)

This paper calls attention to the necessity (if the rules of nomenclature be
strictly adhered to) of suppressing this name as used for a North American
genus of warblers, it having been applied forty-seven years previously to an
entirely dissimilar European group, including the nightingale and redbreast.
In order to render the change as slight as possible, the name Helminthophila
is proposed.

The great black-backed gull (Larus marinus), from a new

locality.

(Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, 1, 1882, vu, p. 60.)

The known range of this species has been greatly extended by specimens
from Herald Island, in the Arctic Ocean, north of Bering Strait, and Port
Clarence, on the Atlantic side of the same strait, collected by Captain Hooper,
U.S. Cutter “Corwin,” and Dr. T. H. Bean, curator Department of Fishes,
U. S. National Museum. The nearest previously recorded locality was Japan.

Urges practicability and desirability of the culture of Sericaria mori in the
United States ; gives estimates of the profits of silk-culture ; a brief natural
history of S. mori, with its enemies, diseases, and food-plants; directions for
the culture of the insects and the reeling of silk, and a glossary of terms used

formance of classificatory work.

New insects injurious to agriculture.

(Amer. Nat., Feb., 1882, xvi, pp. 151-152.)

An abstract of a paper read at the Cincinnati meeting of the A. A.A.S.;
states that the occurrence of previously unnoticed noxious insects is due some-
times to the introduction of species from abroad, sometimes to previously-
existing unnoticed species, and at other times to the acquisition of new habits
by previously-known innoxious species. In the last case the acquisition of
new habits may be accompanied by the acquisition of new descriptional char-
acters, constituting of the insect a new species. New species may thus be-
come developed within brief periods of time.

——— A new depredator infesting wheat stalks.

(Amer. Nat., Mar., 1882, xv1, pp. 247-248, fig. 1.)

This insect was described as a new wheat pest, under the name of Jsosoma
allynii, by G. H. French, in Prairie Farmer, 31 Dec., 1881; and in his ‘“‘ Two
new species of Isosoma” (Can. Entom., Jan., 1882, x1v, pp. 9-19), is aspecies
of Eupelmus, doubtless parasitic on some of the wheat-stalk feeders and prob-
ably on some species of Chlorops; habits and figures of larva are also given
and descriptions of female imago of Jsosoma tritici n. sp. (previously charac-
terized by author in Rural New Yorker, March 4, 1882), which is injurious to
wheat; gives comparison between I. tritica and I. hordei ; states doubt con-
cerning the habits of I. lineare of Europe, and the relative conspicuousness of
the ‘‘humeral spot” in European, American, and Australian species of Isosoma.

This is a critical review of J. A. Lintner’s “A new principle in protection
from insect attack” (Proc. Western N. Y. Hort. Soc. for 1882, v. —— p. —);
states that odorous substances repel insects more by their toxic properties
than by their odor; mentions failure of attempts by the use of strongly
smelling substances to prevent oviposition, and shows that the senses of sight,
touch, and taste are generally more important in the insect economy than the
sense of smell.
