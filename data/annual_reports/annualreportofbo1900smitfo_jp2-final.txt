PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, JANUARY 24. 1900.

In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller), in the chair; the
Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Senate, who was
present by invitation of the Regents in place of the late Vice-President
Hobart; the Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. O. H. Platt, the Hon. R. R.
Hitt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh A. Dinsmore, Dr.
James B. Angell, the Hon. J. B. Henderson, Dr. Alexander Graham
Bell, and the Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

The Secretary said that while he had no excuses for non-attendance
to read he might state that Dr. Wilson had left so recently for Arizona
that there had been scarcely time to hear from him, and that the
appointment of Mr. Richard Olney as a Regent by joint resolution of
Congress was still awaiting the President’s signature.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read the minutes of
the last annual meeting in abstract, and there being no objection the
minutes were declared approved.

The Secretary announced the death of Dr. William Preston John-
ston, a Regent of the Institution, with a few remarks, and, at the
request of the Chancellor, Dr. Angell submitted a minute and reso-
lutions, which will be found under the heading ‘* Necrology,” on
page 47 of the report of the Secretary.

On motion, the minute and resolutions were adopted by a rising
vote, with the provision that they be suitably engrossed and trans-
mitted to the family of Dr. Johnston.

The death was announced of Vice-President Garret A. Hobart, a
Regent of the Institution, and Senator Platt was designated to submit
a minute and resolutions. These will be found under the heading
** Necrology,” on page 49 of the Secretary’s Report.

On motion, the minute and resolutions were adopted by a rising
vote, with the provision that they be suitably engrossed and trans-
mitted to the family of Vice-President Hobart.

xI
XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary then read a letter from Mr. James 8. Morrill,
returning his thanks to the Regents for the resolutions concerning
Senator Morrill, his father, passed by the Regents at their last meeting.

The Secretary then announced the appointment of the following
Regents:

Senator William P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Senate,
requested to be present in the place of the Vice-President, deceased.

Senator William Lindsay, appointed March 3, 1899, to succeed
Senator George Gray.

Representative R. R. Hitt, appointed January 4, 1900, to succeed
himself.

Representative Robert Adams, jr., appointed January 4, 1900, to
succeed himself. ;

Representative Hugh A. Dinsmore, appointed January 4, 1900, to
succeed Representative Joseph Wheeler.

The Secretary then presented his annual report to June 30, 1899,
stating that customarily the Secretary made a personal and viva voce
report in a manner which enabled the Regents to question him on any
points on which they wished information, but that now, by the advice
of the Chancellor, as there would probably be scarcely time for later
special business, he would do little more than refer the members to his
printed report, which they had already received.

He then spoke of the fact that while the Institution was never so
well known abroad or more honored than now the enormous increase
of endowments of most institutions of learning in this country left it
with relatively far less means than it once had. With the exception of
$200,000 from Mr. Hodgkins its fund was now practically what it was
fifty years ago, and he urged that its future independence and useful-
ness were concerned in its being able in some way to command such
added means as would leave the Regents with a free disposition of a
larger fund than at present and one absolutely under their own control.
He had intended to ask the Board to use part of the time at their dis-
posal at this meeting in discussing the question and in advising him as
to their wishes upon this point, which he had thought better not to
enlarge upon in his printed report. Under the circumstances he would
not press the matter now, but he hoped that what he said might receive
the consideration of the Regents as a part of his report.

On motion the Secretary’s report was accepted.

Senator Henderson then presented the report of the Executive Com-
mittee to June 30, 1899, which, on motion, was adopted.

Senator Henderson then presented the customary resolution relative
to income and expenditure, as follows:

Resolved, That the income oi the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1901, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secre-

tary with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part of
the Secretary as to items.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

On motion the resolution was adopted.

Senator Henderson, chairman of the Permanent Committee, then
reported upon the condition of the Hodgkins and Avery estates, stat-
ing that there remained in the hands of the executor of Mr. Hodgkins’s
will the sum of nearly $9,000, which would have been paid over some
time before to the Institution but for the fact that notice had been
served on the executor to retain money sufficient to meet possible
litigation.

Senator Henderson also referred to the conditional bequest of Wal-
lace C. Andrews, who died in April, 1899, and who, after disposing of
half a million dollars of his large property, gave the residue of his
estate to trustees for the purpose of establishing an institution for the
free education of girls, stating at the close of his will that in case his
intention with respect to the institution for girls ‘‘shall, because of
illegality, become impossible of realization, I then devise and bequeath
the sum intended for it to the Smithsonian Institution at Washington,
D. C., to be devoted for the purpose for which it was established.”

The terms of this will had been studied, with a view of ascertain-
ing whether the gift was valid under the laws of New York, with special
reference to perpetuity. As yet no defect had been discovered. The
will had been drawn with great care, evidently by some one thoroughly
cognizant with the law.

If Mr. Andrews’s estate were a little more than $500,000, the sur-
plus would not suffice to carry out the plan of the institution for girls.
In that event, this surplus would come to the Smithsonian Institution.
As yet, the permanent committee had not been informed how large the
estate was.

KIDDER BEQUEST.

The Secretary stated that he would like to bring before the attention
of the Board, briefly, the matter of the Kidder Bequest of $5,000.
This bequest had already been placed on the same footing by the
Board with a similar sum given as a donation by Dr. Alexander Gra-
ham Bell, both being put at the disposal of the Secretary. Dr.
Bell was here and able to explain the meaning of his gift, but Dr.
Kidder was so no longer, and the Secretary felt a scruple about using
this money for scientific researches in which he might be the principal
agent without being sure that the Regents understood exactly the
conditions in question.

In order that there should be a thorough understanding about the
matter, he would ask Dr. Bell to make a statement of the facts.

Dr. Bell said that previous to the appointment of Mr. Langley as
Secretary, Professor Baird had been afraid that the Secretary of
the Smithsonian might become a purely administrative officer, with-
out time or means for scientific investigation, and Secretary Langley
XIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

had, in fact, declined to accept the position if he were wholly inhibited
from carrying on original researches. After conference, Dr. Kidder
and himself (Dr. Bell) had agreed then, at the suggestion of Dr. Baird,
to place a certain sum of money at the present Secretary’s disposal
for scientific investigations. The amount which he (Dr. Bell) gave
had been given by him to be devoted for any purpose to which Secre-
tary Langley might wish to put it in his reseaches, and he felt sure
that such use would be entirely consonant with the wish of Dr.
Kidder.

Dr. Bell then offered the following resolution:

Whereas, at the meeting of the Board of Regents held January 27, 1892, the fol-
lowing resolution was passed:

“That Congress having appropriated $10,000 for the maintenance of an astrophys-
ical observatory, without reference to any precedent condition of buildings to be
furnished by the Smithsonian Institution, that the Secretary be authorized to expend,
under the general resolution relative to income and expenditure, the sum of $5,000
bequeathed by Dr. J. H. Kidder, and $5,000 given by Alexander Graham Bell, in
directions consonant with the known wishes of the testator and the donor.”’

Resolved, That to prevent any misconception as to the meaning of this resolution
the Board of Regents declare that it was their intent that the sum of $5,000, received
from the estate of Dr. J .H. Kidder, be placed at the disposal of the Secretary for his
personal scientific investigations.

After some further discussion, on motion the resolution was adopted.
THE SECRETARY'S STATEMENT.

The Secretary then said that, owing to the evident limitations of time
at the Board’s disposal, he would abridge his usual statement to it.

He spoke briefly of the National Museum, of the cooperation of the
State, War, and Navy Departments in providing animals for the
National Zoological Park, and of the relationship of the Institution to
the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications.

In regard to this last he said that it was a matter on which he would
state to the Regents that his connection with experiments, which had
already their sanction, was being continued on the request of the Way
Department, and reminded them that it was estimated that these
experiments would occupy, even if crowned with unexpectedly early
success, two or more years. The sum allotted by the War [epart-
ment would be insufficient to carry out this work were it not for the
permission of the Regents already given to make use of the facilities
in the workshops under their control, though at the cost of the War
Department. The Secretary was giving his time in his private hours,
apart from his official duties, to this work, and without charge.

The Secretary then spoke of the Hodgkins Fund, of the awarding
of the medal to Prof. James Dewar, of the coming solar eclipse of
May 28, 1900, and of the probability of an appropriation by Con-
gress for this purpose.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

In regard to the civil service the Secretary said:

The Board will remember that at its meeting held in 1898 the Regents passed a
resolutioi instructing the Secretary to request of the President certain modifications
in the civil-service regulations, and at its meeting last year the Board was informed
that the Chancellor, together with the Secretary, had called upon the President,
who stated that he was holding the matter under advisement. Asa result of this
action, I beg to report that in the President’s order of May 29, 1899, directing cer-
tain modifications and additions to the civil-service rules, the position of assistant
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National Museum and one
private secretary or confidential clerk to the Secretary of the Institution were relieved
from examination; that for positions on the scientific staff of the Institution non-
competitive examinations are permitted, or examinations may even be waived, pro-
vided the President approve of such action in each case, persons thus entering the
service being not eligible to transfer to other divisions of the classified service.

Continuing his statement the Secretary briefly mentioned the sub-
jects of the National Reserves, the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature, and the Centennial Celebration of Professor Henry’s birth,
as well as the relinquishment of the Toner Lecture Fund.

The Secretary then called attention to a second gift to the Institution
from the Jate Chinese minister, Chang Yen Hoon, of an interesting
bronze piece of great antiquity, which was shown to the Regents. On
motion, the Secretary was requested to make a proper acknowledgment
‘‘by direction of the Board.”

NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

Senator Henderson then presented the following report of the
Special Committee:

Wasuinaton, D. C., January 24, 1900.
To ihe Bourd of Regents:

In July, 1897, a meeting of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and
Experiment Stations was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at which meeting the fol-
lowing resolution was adopted:

‘‘Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed by the President to investigate,
to consider, and, if practicable, devise a plan whereby graduate students of the land-
grant and other colleges may have access to, and the use of, the Congressional Library
and the collections in the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, and the
scientific bureaus of the various departments at Washington of the United States Gov-
ernment, for the purposes of study and research; said plan to include suggestions as
to the manner in which such work may be organized, coordinated, and directed to
the best advantage; the composition and organization of such a staff as may be neces-
sary to properly coordinate and direct such work, and also an outline of such legisla-
tion as may be necessary to effect the general purposes of this resolution.”’

This committee seems to have made diligent inquiries into the subjects submitted
to its investigation, and in the autumn of 1898 presented a full and interesting report
of its labors to the Association.

A brief extract from that report is as follows:

‘The inquiries and investigations so far made lead the committee to the conclusion
that it is entirely practicable to provide for the use of the Library of Congress and the
collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, and of the various
scientific and other bureaus in the several departments of the General Government,
by graduate students of the land-grant and other colleges for study and research, and
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

that it is also practicable to organize, coordinate, and direct such work as to make it
eminently effective.

‘“The committee has been greatly desirous that some existing agency be found to
undertake such work of organization, coordination, and direction, and has naturally
turned to the Smithsonian Institution as the one best fitted for the purpose.

‘Hach of its great secretaries—Henry, Baird, and Langley—in the language of
President Gilman, ‘has been free and has felt free to open new roads and enter fresh
fields when the public good required it.’

“The permanence of its organization, its objects, and purposes, as expressed in the
will of its founder, viz, ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men;’ the fact
that it has nobly performed and is still nobly performing many of the functions
incident to the proposed scheme of graduate study and research, by the encourage-
ment of investigation and research, the study of local history and archeology, and
the founding of libraries and museums; its broad catholicity and its freedom from
partisan influences, have led the committee to hope that it might feel free to take
the work in hand.

‘Tt already has all the officers and agents for its successful general control, and to
them could wisely be left the selection of such additional officers and agents as might
be necessary to direct the details of successful administration. It could wisely con-
trol and direct the application of all funds appropriated or donated for its support.

‘““The committee has thought that, perhaps, the Secretary and Regents might not
look favorably upon the idea of constituting the Smithsonian the permanent agent
for the control and direction of such graduate work, but that they might be willing
to take the initiative in its organization and direction, and when a successful plan
was fully developed, might generously relinquish its control to a separate and inde-
pendent management, such as experience might suggest to be more wise and effective,
as it did under Henry in the case of the Weather Bureau, under Baird in the cases of
the National Museum, the Fish Commission, and the Bureau of Ethnology, and as it
has done under Langley in the cases of the Astrophysical Observatory and the
National Zoological Park.

‘Any positive recommendation as to the agency for the organization, coordination,
and direction of the proposed graduate work, and any detailed plan of organization,
are therefore held in abeyance.

“The committee is unable, at the present time, to present a complete outline of
the legislation necessary to effect the general purposes of the resolution.

“Tt submits tentatively, however, that Congress might be asked to provide for the
establishment of an administrative office in Washington, preferably in the Smith-
sonian Institution, in which graduate students of the institutions we represent, and
others as well, might be enrolled and directed to the appropriate department.

“To maintain this office, pay the expenses of administration, support graduate
courses of research, freely open to the graduate students of the land-grant and other
colleges without distinction, sex, or color, on such terms as the administrative office
should prescribe, and to aid such students in their researches, Congress might be
asked to make an appropriation of, say, $25,000, to be increased annually $1,000, to
be expended under the discretion of the institution or department in which the office
of administration may be located.”’

It appears that this report of its committee was unanimously adopted by the Asso-
ciation, and its secretary, Mr. MacLean, under date of December 16, 1898, communi-
cated to Mr. Langley, as Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, a full report of
the proceedings of the Association on the subject. A short extract from Mr. Mac-
Lean’s letter will best explain the object and purpose of the communication. It is
as follows:

“The committee have resolyed respectfully to ask you and through you the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to consider the action of the Association, and
in particular, the matter of the report on pages XVIII, XIX.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

“The committee further earnestly request youand the Regents of the Smithsonian
to intimate to us if the Institution would accede to what is the first preference of all
the educators who haye been consulted—the establishment of an administrative
office in the hands of the Regents and Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. If
the Regents will consider the proposition, the committee would like to have the
Regents exercise full power as to the entire plans for the organization of said admin-
istrative office. In case of favorable consideration, the committee would be glad to
know what steps the committee saould take further. It is desired to introduce a
bill before the close of the present session of Congress for the authority and petty
funds needed in the organization of the work. The committee would be glad to
answer any inquiries that you or the Regents would like to make. It is believed
that the scope of the work is set forth in the report.

‘‘The committee regret to trouble you among the multifarious affairs ever waiting
upon you, but they feel confident that you and the Regents have an interest in the
matter so important for education and the diffusion of knowledge as that proposed
by the representative and National Association for whom the committee speak.

‘“Would it be too much to ask if, in your first acknowledgment of the receipt of
the document submitted, you will let me know when the Regents are likely to con-
sider the subject? The committee heartily hope for a favorable consideration and
are sensible of the grace begged of yourself and the Regents.”’

This letter of Mr. MacLean, with the accompanying papers, was, at its last January
meeting, laid before the Board of Regents by Secretary Langley; whereupon the
papers were referred by the Board to a committee of five of its members under direc-
tion of the following resolution:

‘Resolved, That the communication from the committee representing the agricul-
tural colleges of the United States be referred to a committee of Regents to be
appointed by the Chancellor, to consider the same and all kindred questions, and to
make a report thereon at the next meeting of the Board.”’

The Chancellor appointed the Executive Committee consisting of J. B. Henderson,
William L. Wilson, and Alexander Graham Bell, and also J. B. Angell and R. R.
Hitt. The Secretary, at his own request, was not made a member of the committee.

And now your committee comes and takes pleasure in reporting such facts as it has
been able to gather for the information of the Board of Regents.

In the judgment of this committee, it was deemed necessary at the threshold of
the investigations to ascertain with a greater degree of certainty the details of such
plan as might be suggested and formulated by the associated colleges for the accom-
plishment of their wishes. For that purpose, therefore, a joint meeting of this com-
mittee with that of the colleges was recently held, in which the subject was discussed
with commendable frankness and freedom. <A record of the action of this joint
meeting was preserved, and its official proceedings will probably best convey to your
minds the extent and bearing of the questions involved in the proposition of the
associated colleges. These proceedings are as follows:

A joint meeting of the Committees on Graduate Study of the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution and of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and
Experiment Stations was held December 27, 1899, in Washington, D. C., at the
residence of Mr. J. B. Henderson, at his invitation. There were present of the
Regents, Messrs. J. B. Henderson, A. Graham Bell, and R. R. Hitt; of the Associa-
tion, M. H. Buckham, president of the University of Vermont; H. H. Goodell,
president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College; Alexis Cope, secretary of Ohio
State University; J. H. Washburn, president of the Agricultural and Mechanical
College of Rhode Island; and A. C. True, Director of the Office of Experiment
Stations. The meeting was called to order at 7.45 p. m. by Mr. Henderson, who
suggested that a joint session be organized. On motion, Mr. Henderson was chosen

chairman and Mr. True secretary. Mr. Buckham briefly explained the purpose of
the Association in favoring the establishment of a Bureau of Graduate Study in the
Smithsonian Institution, urged the importance of this step to the colleges and uni-
versities of the country, and explained that the Association comprised State univer-
sities as well as agricultural and mechanical colleges. The foilowing outline plan
for a Bureau of Graduate Study in the Smithsonian Institution was then read by the
secretary, with the prefatory remark that it was merely tentative and had been
drawn in definite terms to serve as a basis for discussion:

PLAN FOR BUREAU OF GRADUATE STUDY IN THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The Committee on Graduate Study of the American Association of Agricultural
Colleges and Experiment Stations (including all the universities and colleges organ-
ized under the Morrill Act of 1862) asks the Smithsonian Institution to organize and
conduct a Bureau of Graduate Study, having as its principal functions the following:

1. The keeping of a register of graduates of approved colleges and universities who
desire opportunities for graduate study in connection with the different branches
of the United States Government.

2. The conducting of negotiations with the different branches of the Government on
behalf of registered graduates to secure for them opportunities for study and
research according to their qualifications and aims.

. The establishment and maintenance of lecture courses and seminars by specialists
on the subjects on which researches are being made by the Government and

the Smithsonian Institution.

is)

The requirements of this Bureau shall be:

1. A competent chief to organize and manage it.

2. An office force to conduct the routine business.

3. A building for administration offices and lecture rooms.

4, An annual income to pay administrative officers, lecturers, and miscellaneous
expenses.

Methods of securing the needed funds:

1. Ask Congress to provide without delay a new building for the National Museum,
part of which may be utilized for the offices and lecture rooms of the Bureau
of Graduate Study.

2. Ask Congress for an appropriation of $50,000 annually to pay running expenses,
lectures, etc., including rental of temporary quarters until permanent building
is provided.

3. Announce that the Smithsonian Institution will gladly receive funds from private
sources for scientific researches in which graduates of American colleges may
participate and the methods and results of which will be taught to graduate
students connected with the Bureau.

Legislation required:

1. Act of Congress establishing the Bureau and defining its functions.

2. Appropriation for current expenses.

. Appropriation for building for National Museum.

4. Act of Congress permitting officers of the Government participating in the work
of Bureau to receive extra compensation for services performed outside of official
hours; this compensation to be determined by regulations made by the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution.

Reasons why the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the management of a
Bureau of Graduate Study:
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIX

1. The graduates of the universities and colleges of the United States need opportu-
nities to utilize the libraries, collections, and special apparatus under control of
the Government and to familiarize themselves with the technical and scientific
operations of the Government. This principle has already been recognized by
Congress in act of April 12, 1892, as regards institutions in the District of
Columbia.

2. The National, State, and local governments and the people of the United States
need the services of an increasing number of technical and scientific experts
who can best be trained in special lines in connection with the Government
work.

3. The Smithsonian Institution is regarded by the Government officers and by the
universities and colleges of the country as a central agency for the promotion of
higher scientific education and research. It is already a recognized leader in
scientific enterprises in this country and only needs to broaden its operations
somewhat to take up this new work. It has an invaluable basis for this work
and its freedom from political influences gives it the confidence of the country.
All its traditions regarding scientific work are right.

4. By allying itself with the universities and colleges and with the scientific Govern-
ment bureaus, the Smithsonian Institution will strengthen its scientific leader-
ship and be able more thoroughly to promote the increase and diffusion of
knowledge. It will broaden its basis of support and have a better chance of
securing public and private funds for research work of the highest order. It
will thus be able to maintain and extend its leadership in science and grow in
strength with the growth of universities throughout this country. As local
scientific institutions develop in different parts of the country, is it not desirable
that the Smithsonian Institution shall take an advance step in its relation with
these institutions?

ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERIMENT
- STATIONS.

If the Smithsonian Institution is declared to be favorable to the organization and
maintenance of a Bureau of Graduate Study, this committee is authorized to pledge
and does pledge the active support of the American Association of Agricultural Col-
leges and Experiment Stations toward the securing of the necessary legislation and
funds for the establishment and support of the Bureau. If the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution so desire, this committee will take the initiative in seeking the
introduction into Congress of bills for this purpose and in urging their passage, but
only after an express assurance from the Regents that such action will receive their
cordial indorsement and support.

TENTATIVE DRAFT OF ACT OF CONGRESS ESTABLISHING A BUREAU OF GRADUATE STUDY.

Beit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That there shall be and hereby is annually appropriated out
of any money in thé Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of fifty thousand
dollars for the year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and one, and the same
sum for each succeeding year, to enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
to organize and maintain a Bureau of Graduate Study for the purpose of securing
for the graduates of the universities and colleges of the several States and Territories
‘and of the District of Columbia, opportunities to utilize the libraries, scientific col-
lections, apparatus, and laboratories owned by the United States and in charge of
officers of the United States, for advanced studies and researches under regulations
to be prescribed by the said Regents and as far as shall be mutually agreed upon
between the said Regents and the heads of the several Executive Departments of the
xX PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Government, the Librarian of Congress, Commissioner of Labor, Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with due
regard to the needs and requirements of the technical, scientific, and administrative
work of the Government; and the said Regents are authorized to establish and main-
tain seminars and courses of lectures on subjects relating to the technical and scien-
tifie work of the Government and to employ experts and specialists for this purpose;
and the heads of Departments and the other officers aforesaid are authorized to grant
permission to officers and employees of the Government working under their direc-
tion to take part in the work of the Bureau of Graduate Study under direction of
the said Regents, Provided, That such services shall not in any way interfere with
the efficient discharge of their regular duties as Government officials, And provided
further, That officers and employees of the Government may receive extra compen-
sation on terms to be fixed by the said Regents for services actually performed for
said Bureau of Graduate Study outside of the hours when their services are required

After the reading of this paper a tree discussion of its contents was had, in which
all present took part. At the conclusion of this discussion an understanding was
reached that the committee of the Association would be satisfied with any effective
plan by which graduates of the colleges and other qualified persons should be guided
by the Smithsonian Institution in advanced studies and researches in connection
with the facilities presented by the Government bureaus at Washington, and that
this committee would await the action of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
at their meeting in January, 1900.

Dr. William L. Wilson, who was unable to be present, sent the following letter to
the chairman:

the land-grant colleges, has flickered out. I know the importance of this meeting
and I am exceedingly desirous of hearing the college committee develop their plans
and wishes.

The more I reflect on the question, in the light of my experience in Washington
and as a college officer, the less able I find myself to formulate any plan on a scale
such as doubtless these gentlemen desire. We are, I am sure, desirous that the
Smithsonian Institution should meet their wishes as far as it can without swamping
the larger work of research and of the diffusion of knowledge among men, which it
was founded to do and which it has so well done.

But our resources are small, and even if adequately increased I do not see clearly
how the work of research and of instruction can be made to go hand in hand. The
best endowed universities have not been able to unite the two, except in a small and
occasional way. The men who by scientific research have extended human knowl-
edge are generally compelled to work in such individual and even eccentric ways
that they can not carry learners with them, and they benefit the world by making
known their results and methods, not by carrying with them a company of specta-
tors, to whom every step must be explained and every process of reasoning made
clear in advance.

Very sincerely, yours, Wm. L. WItson.

At a subsequent meeting of the joint committees, held in this city, at the residence
of Dr. Bell, on the 11th instant, in which President Harper, of the Chicago Univer-
sity, participated as a representative of the National Educational Association, other
proceedings of an interesting character were had. Reports of these proceeding were
promptly furnished by Dr. True to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and
also by this committee.

At the possible risk of being tedious in the presentation of its report your committee
deems it advisable to preserve a full record of the papers and documents connected
with the propositions now submitted to the consideration of the Regents.

The report of Mr. True is as follows:

Unirep States DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,

Mr. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.

Dear Srr: With a view to facilitating your consideration of the pending questions
regarding the opening of the Smithsonian Institution and the Government depart-
ments to graduate students, permit me to lay before you a series of papers relating
to this matter.

Exhibit E.—A summary of points on which there is agreement between the com-
mittees of the National Educational Association and the agricultural colleges, drawn
up by President Harper and myself after a conference on this matter January 11,
1900.

I may add that all the plans which have been proposed by the three associations
referred to in the above statement have been based on the idea that the Smithsonian
Institution should be the leader in this enterprise, that it should have a free hand in
the formation and execution of plans for carrying on this work, and that this new
enterprise should be undertaken by the Smithsonian Institution only so far as it can
obtain funds for the purpose from Congress and private sources. There is entire
agreement on the proposition that the funds at present at the disposal of the Smith-
sonian Institution should not be used for this new work.

Iam authorized by the committee on graduate study of the Association of Agri-
cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations to act as their representative here, and as
such I shall be glad to give you any further assistance in my power to make plain
the attitude of this Association in this matter.

Very respectfully, yours,
A. C. Tron,
Secretary of Committee on Graduate Study of the Association
of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations.

Exarpir i.

Points of agreement between committee of National Educational Association and American
Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations, regarding the work which
the Smithsonian Institution might undertake for the benefit of graduates of colleges and
universities. :

Memorandum made by President Harper, of Chieago University, of the committee
of National Educational Association, and A. C. True, Director of the Office of Exper-
iment Stations, of the committee of the American Association of Agricultural Col-
leges and Experiment Stations, January 11, 1900.

1. That the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution ask the Congress of the United
States for a special appropriation for the work of research and investigation, to be
conducted under their supervision by persons properly qualified therefor. Such
work to be so conducted as to utilize the libraries, scientific collections, apparatus,
and laboratories owned by the United States, and in charge of the officers of the
United States, for investigations and researches, under regulations to be prescribed
by the said Regents, and as far as shall be mutually agreed upon between the said
Regents and the heads of the several Executive Departments of the Government, the
Librarian of Congress, Commissioner of Labor, Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries,
and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with a view of carrying out the
policy of Congress, declared in the joint resolution of April 12, 1892.

2. That the Regents ask the general public for gifts of money, to be used in providing
buildings, laboratories, equipments, and endowments, for purposes of instruction,
such instruction to be limited to students who are graduates of properly accredited
institutions or those who are otherwise properly qualified, it being understood that
it shall not be the purpose of the Smithsonian Institution to confer degrees of any
kind in connection with such instruction.

3. That the Regents formulate a plan for the appointment of an advisory board;
the members of said board to represent the leading educational institutions of the
country, with a view to securing the active cooperation of the colleges and universities
of the country in carrying on this enterprise.

(No. 8.)

JOINT RESOLUTION to encourage the establishment and endowment of institutions of learning at
the national capital by defining the policy of the Government with reference to the use of its
literary and scientific collections by students.

Whereas large collections illustrative of the various arts and sciences and facili-
tating literary and scientific research have been accumulated by the action of Con-
gress through a series of years at the national capital; and

Whereas it was the original purpose of the Government thereby to promote
research and the diffusion of knowledge, and it is not the settled policy and present
practice of those charged with the care of these collections specially to encourage
students who devote their time to the investigation and study of any branch of
knowledge by allowing to them all proper use thereof; and

Whereas it is represented that the enumeration of these facilities and the formal
statement of this policy will encourage the establishment and endowment of institu-
tions of learning at the seat of government, and promote the work of education by
attracting students to avail themselves of the advantages aforesaid under the direction
of competent instructors: Therefore,

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the facilities for research and illustration in the following
and any other governmental collections now existing or hereafter to be established
in the city of Washington for the promotion of knowledge shall be accessible, under
such rules and restrictions as the officers in charge of each collection may prescribe,
subject to such authority as is now or may hereafter be permitted by law, to the sci-
entific investigators and to students of any institution of higher education now incor-
porated or hereafter to be incorporated under the laws of Congress or of the District
of Columbia, to wit:

1. Of the Library of Congress.
Of the National Museum.
Of the Patent Office.
Of the Bureau of Education.
Of the Bureau of Ethnology.
Of the Army Medical Museum.
Of the Department of Agriculture.
Of the Fish Commission.
Of the Botanic Gardens.
Of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
. Of the Geological Survey.
12. Of the Naval Observatory.
Approved, April 12, 1892.

The papers already copied and referred to in this report are deemed amply suffi-
cient to acquaint the Regents with the propositions made by the associated colleges.

And now, in conclusion, your committee does not hesitate to express its warm and
decided sympathy with the general purposes of the movement thus made for your
consideration. The object sought commends itself to us all, and the zeal and ability
with which it has been pressed upon our consideration by the very able and distin-
guished educators and scientists connected with these colleges furnish ample assur-
ance that the consummation of the great and leading object sought by them is only
a question of time. The material already collected in the bureaus and departments
of the Government furnishes a rich mine of educational wealth that will not be per-
mitted to remain forever undeveloped. This material is now being constantly
enriched by the most valuable additions to its present enormous wealth. Already
it has invited to the national capital many distinguished scientists, anxious to avail
themselves of the superior advantages thus offered for investigation and research.
XXIV PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Your committee, however, is painfully impressed with the fact that the powers of
the Smithsonian Institution as at present organized are scarcely broad enough to
embrace the work proposed. And the committee is equally impressed with the fact
that even with enlarged authority its present financial condition would absolutely
prevent anything like efficient and creditable performance of the work contemplated.

It is well known to the members of this Board that a great wealth of material—
material which would be of immense utility in the successful accomplishment of the
purposes indicated by the associated colleges, lies buried in the crypts and cellars
of the National Museum.

If our Institution is unable for want of room, as it undoubtedly is, even to place
this valuable material on exhibition for the public eye and as little able to arrange
it for scientific uses, the problem of providing halls for lectures and meeting the nec-
essary expenditures incident to the work proposed, becomes serious and formidable
in the extreme.

Your committee is not prepared to make definite recommendations to the Board
for its final or ultimate action.

That which is clearly inexpedient to-day may become not only expedient, but
eminently desirable to-morrow.

If in your judgment the committee should retain its powers and report progress
from time to time in the future, it will be our highest pleasure to comply with your
further demands.

Yours, truly, J. B. Henperson, Chairman.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., January 23, 1900.
My Dear Senator HENDERSON:

At your request I hand back to you the letter which I sent you some time since in
a personal capacity, now authorizing its use as in your discretion you may deem fit,
though I do so with some hesitation, since it deals with a matter on which the Board
has not yet defined its policy.

Under the circumstances, I can then, perhaps, be of most service by pointing out
what the attitude of the Board has been under analogous circumstances in the past,
and by indicating in a general way the present situation of the Institution and its
relations to the scientific bureaus in Washington.

I will first comply with your request by citing the passage in the communication
of the representatives of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and
Experiment Stations, concerning which you inquire. This passage reads as follows:

“The committee has thought that perhaps the Secretary and Regents might not
look favorably upon the idea of constituting the Smithsonian the permanent agent
for the control and direction of such graduate work, but that they might be will-
ing to take the initiative in its organization and direction, and when the successful
plan was fully developed, might generously relinquish its control to a separate and
independent management.”’

Next, at your kind solicitation, I take this occasion to speak of the plan in ques-
tion, which, you will remember, is but one of several plans. With these I have
large sympathy, as with every step in aid of the higher education and research. Let
me recall, however, not my opinions, but the decisions of Congress and the Regents.

After the Smithson bequest had been received by the Government, nearly ten
years were employed by Congress in considering the form which the Institution
should take. The most distinguished members in Congress and almost all the nota-
ble educators in this country expressed their opinions, and the proposal that the
Institution should be more or less a teaching body, or in some way assimilable to a
university, was most thoroughly discussed and embodied in various bills, which
failed to become law. The proposal then was defeated, and its defeat created a pol-
icy for the Institution, which has been followed by the Regents up to this time.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXV

I understand that the wish at present is to found a school of research by utilizing
the existing scientific departments and the bureaus of the Government through the
means of an administrative office wader the Smithsonian Institution. This is, of course,
to be managed by the Regents, and it is claimed that it can be supported by a small
appropriation from Congress. I am not, then, considering the abstract merits or the
difficulties of a proposal to found such a system of research, so much as the difficulties
of establishing it under this Institution.

The proposition has much in its favor from one point of view; and yet it seems
questionable whether this connection even furnishes the best means of producing the
results anticipated when we consider that each scientific bureau and office has grown
out of some practical need of the Government; that each at all times is occupied on
practical work, and that each now looks to the head of its department and not to
the Institution as having the sole right to direct any part of its affairs. Let me say,
too, that in an important branch of science like physics, no bureau, with one unim-
portant exception, has any laboratory worth mentioning; that there is at present but
one chemical laboratory in Washington which could be considered with reference to
the admission of students, since in the rest not a score of students could be accom-
modated if a hundred applied; and that the Regents would almost necessarily be
called upon to find means to create these costly accessories of the plan, although they
are now representing to Congress the insufficiency of its appropriations to meet the
needs of the special work which is already committed to them.

What is more important, the Smithsonian Institution has been founded and carried
on with functions so distinct from that of teaching or of a university, that to create
anew department in it for the proposed use would be like remaking the whole
machinery of its action. The change that is proposed, though apparently superficial,
is radical, and in advance of experiment no one knows where it will lead.

It is well, then, to consider here, that while the money question is of very great
importance indeed, it is for the moment secondary. If some one desiring to conduct
such a scheme were to offer to give outright to the Regents of the Institution a fund
as large as its present one, which was to be used for managing a bureau of graduate
study and research (and I should consider even this amount insufficient), I should,
if my opinion were sought, ask to have the plan considered only with the under-
standing that this Institution was distinctly altering its functions in accepting the
money for such a purpose.

These gentlemen suggest an appropriation of something like $50,000, which I under-
stand them to believe will be sufficient, because of their hope to secure continuous
voluntary work by the gratuitous or nearly unpaid contributions of our local men o1
science. This sum would, however, I think, prove wholly inadequate. Being myself
long a student of science here, I may be allowed to say that while in my own knowl-
edge there are some who like to teach and would do it without reward, and do it well,
they are in an almost negligible proportion to the large number who have (it should
always be remembered) accepted the lower salaries given here, as against higher
ones they could obtain in colleges and universities, because no condition of tuition is
now attached to their work of research.

If upon careful consideration it is found that the scientific departments and bureaus
of the Government could be advantageously used in connection with other agencies
as auxiliaries for post-graduate study, without interfering with their primary functions,
I, for one, should be glad to see this done. The Institution and all its branches are
now and always have been open to any properly accredited investigator so far as the
limited accommodations and the regular work permit.

The communication under consideration by your committee comes from representa-
tives of the agricultural colleges and agricultural experiment stations created, in the
main, by the General Government. Their relations to it have always been intimate,
and they present the most important outcome of Congressional action for the higher
XXVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

education, each State in the Union haying such a college and experiment station.
The gentlemen who represent these organizations do not stand in the position of
ordinary educators, but are accustomed to deal with Government affairs, whether
with State legislatures or members of Congress, and it is in the course of natural
development that they should seek to crown their system by a great school of
research in Washington, connected more or less directly with the General Govern-
ment. I think their aspiration is a most legitimate one, and I believe that they rep-
resent a body of men who in some way or other are very likely to succeed in any
well-matured plans which they deliberately set out to accomplish.

Since the permissive act of 1892, however, no bureau, within my knowledge, has
taken official advantage of the powers already granted, and I think that this indicates
the feeling which these bureaus may be expected to entertain toward an agent
invested by Congress with larger authority. The responsibility as well as the danger
and trouble of organizing this scarcely formulated plan, and accepting the often
ungracious task of engrafting it on bureaus of the Government not otherwise under
the control of the Institution—in short, of bearing the brunt of the struggle for it in
its early years—would fall on the Smithsonian Institution, whose present kindly
relations with these bureaus I should be sorry to see jeopardized.

Let me say (if in conclusion I may venture to express a personal opinion) that it
is at least certain that the Institution can not draw back from a line of action to
which it is once morally committed, and that ordinary prudence indicates the need
of care in acquiring at its own risk a knowledge of the effect which this radical change
might make in its future.

Very respectfully, yours,
S. P. LANGLEY.

Hon. J.B. HENDERSON,

Chairman of Special Committee of the Board of Regents, Washington, D. C.

CastLE CREEK, Hor SpRINGs,
; Yavapai County, Ariz., January 20, 1900.

Dear Mr. Lanaury: | regret that I shall not be able to attend the annual meeting
of the Regents.

I suppose the most important subject that will come before the Regents will be
the application of the agricultural colleges for some form of connection with the
Institution, through which select graduates of those colleges may secure advanced
instruction in science and in scientific research, in the bureaus under its administra-
tion. I feel much interested in this question, and regret that I am under the dis-
ability of not knowing the definite proposition of the colleges and of not having
conferred with my associates on the committee appointed at the last meeting of the
Regents. Without these lights, it seems to me that many difficulties and much mis-
apprehension must be cleared away, before any safe and practicable plan can be
reached, looking toward the end proposed. That end proposes a diversion of the
Institution and of its scientific bureaus from the main work they were founded to
accomplish, and such diversion if suddenly and sharply made, will lessen their
present efficiency without accomplishing the new results. To receive any consider-
able number of students and give them proper guidance and fair opportunites of
work, would certainly interfere, seriously, with the regular operation of the Institu-
tion and of its affilated bureaus.

It is impracticable to turn aside men engaged in research to the work of instruction,
as a rule, and only a limited number of such men have any aptitude or taste for such
work. Specialists accept positions under the Government at less salaries than col-
leges would pay them because they do not have to teach, and because they can
pursue their researches in their own individual ways, and wherever the local advan-
tages are most favorable. By this method their work inures to the benefit of all
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXVITI

the educational institutions of the country, and the scientific and economic world
gets the fruits of that work. It is also true, that collections are destroyed in the
regular work of instruction, and that most of the collections in the National Museum
and scientific bureaus are consequently available only for the individual and advanced
investigator, toward whom the most liberal policy should be, as I feel sure, it always
has been, adopted.

These are some of the views which have occurred to me, and some of the many
difficulties to be reckoned with, in any movement in the direction proposed. I need
not say that I am fully in accord with what I feel sure, is the general wish of the
Regents—to meet the request of the colleges, in the most sympathetic and friendly
spirit, and to extend to them the fullest and freest access to every source and facility
of information, under the control or influence of the Institution, or that can be made
compatible with its administration. Yet it seems to me that any beginning of a new
and wider policy, must keep carefully in view the continued success and preemi-
nence of the Institution itself in its chosen field, and the further fact that the scien-
tific bureaus of the Government have been established and are maintained more for
practical and economic purposes than for strictly scientific purposes, and only inci-
dentally or occasionally for the work of instruction, save as involved in their regular
work.

Very truly, yours, Wo. L. Witson.

Mr. 8. P. Lane ery,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

A very general discussion arose, participated in by Senators Cullom
and Platt, and Messrs. Henderson, Hitt, Bell, and others.

Senator Cullom stated that this might end in the Institution’s
resources being scattered and in its becoming simply a place of learn-
ing, school, or college, or university. He did not think that was the
purpose of the founder, but that the more separately it maintained
itself, the freer would be the position of the Institution in the end, and
that to put the matter on record he would move

That the report be accepted and printed and that the committee be discharged.

Mr. Platt then moved

That the report be accepted, but that the committee be continued.

Mr. Bell observed that the matter was too important to be passed
over briefly, that a very great many of its details might perhaps be
impracticable, but that some features were practicable, and that it
came, he thought, within the functions of the Institution to carry them
out, possibly by the help of Congress.

Aftersome further remarks, Mr. Bell offered the following resolution:

In order to facilitate the utilization of the Government Departments for the pur-
poses of research—in pursuance of the policy enunciatud by Congress in a joint reso-
lution approved April 12, 1892—

Resolved, That Congress be asked to provide for an Assistant Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution in charge of research in the Government Departments,
whose duty it shall be to ascertain and make known what facilities for research exist
in the Government Departments, and arrange with the heads of Departments, and
with the officers in charge of Government collections, rules and regulations under
which suitably qualified persons may have access to the Government collections for
the purposes of research, with due regard to the needs and requirements of the work
XXVIII PROCEEDINGS OF IHE BOARD OF REGENTS.

of the Government; and it shall also be his duty to direct the researches of such
persons into lines which will promote the interests of the Government, and the
development of the natural resources, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce of
the country, and (generally) promote the progress of science and the useful arts and
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.

The Chancellor ruled that the resolution was not in order until the
report had been disposed of, and the discussion was continued on
Senator Cullom’s motion, turning on the advisability of continuing
the committee, Senator Henderson, the chairman, remarking that if
the committee were continued it should be instructed as to the wishes
_ of the Board.

Mr. Adams said that he thought it would be better to take some
decisive action; that if it were not thought within the province of
the Institution to undertake this it would be franker to say so, in
order that the people who were looking to the Institution for help
could turn elsewhere, and that he thought it would be better for the
movement itself that some such positive statement should be made
now and not postpone the matter, giving these gentlemen ground for
hope that the Institution would do something favorable.

The Chancellor observed that it was open to these gentlemen them-
selves to go to Congress and obtain the assistance they desired.

There were further remarks by different Regents on Senator Cul-
lom’s motion, when upon the suggestion that it would be considerate
to the committee to use instead of the word ‘* discharged” some other
expression which would give a similar meaning, Mr. Hitt said that a
motion to accept, like a motion to adopt, carried with it the discharge
of the committee.

Senator Cullom by consent modified his motion by omitting any
reference to the ‘* discharge” of the committee.

Senator Platt said he would not insist on the motion that the com-
mittee be continued. :

The Chancellor then put the motion as modified, ‘‘ That the report
be accepted and printed,” and it was adopted without any dissenting
voice.

Mr. Bell then moved the adoption of his resolution, but it being
now a quarter to 12 o’clock, the Chancellor and the Congressional
Regents were obliged to leave, and it was voted to adjourn to meet
again on the call of the Chancellor and the Secretary, leaving Mr.
Bell’s resolution pending for consideration at some future meeting.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

For THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report
in relation to the funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Con-
gress, and the receipts and expenditures for the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the U. S. National Museum, the International Exchanges, the
Bureau of Ethnology, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory for the year ending June 30, 1900, and balances
of former years:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Condition of the Fund July 1, 1900.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson, savings from
income and other sources, to the amount of $134,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift
from Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000 and $8,000,
being a portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and
$1,000, the accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in
all, as the permanent fund, $912,000.

The Institution also holds the additional sum of $42,000, received
upon the death of Thomas G. Hodgkins, in registered West Shore
Railroad 4 per cent bonds, which were, by order of this committee,
under date of May 18, 1894, placed in the hands of the Secretary of
the Institution, to be held by him subject to the conditions of said
order,

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1900, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary, or, in his absence, of the
acting secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have
been examined and found correct.

Bae nntAnY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my report show-
ing the operations of the Institution during the year ending June 30,
1900, including the work placed under its direction by Congress, in .
the United States National Museum, the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park,
and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the precedent of several years, I have given, in the body
of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution and
its bureaus, while the appendix presents more detailed statements by
the persons in direct charge of the different branches of the work.
Independently of this the operations of the National Museum are fully
treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report, and the
Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology constitutes a volume
prepared under the supervision of the Director of that Bureau.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Institution was created an ‘‘ Establishment.” Its statutory members
are the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice of the United
States, and the heads of the Executive Departments. The prerogative
of the Establishment is the ‘*supervision of the affairs of the Institu-
tion and the advice and instruction of the Board of Regents.”

A vacancy in the membership of the Establishment, caused by the
death of Vice-President Hobart on November 21, 1899, will remain till
March 4, 1901.

The Hon. Russell A. Alger resigned as Secretary of War, and was
succeeded by the Hon. Elihu Root.

sm 1900——1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As organized on June 30, 1900, the Establishment consisted of the
following ex officio members :
Wituram McKintery, President of the United States.
(Vacancy), Vice-President of the United States.
Metvinte W. Fuuuer, Chief Justice of the United States.
Joun Hay, Secretary of State.
Lyman J. Gace, Secretary of the Treasury.
Exrmu Root, Secretary of War.
Joun W. Griaas, Attorney-General.
CuHarLes Emory Suitu, Postmaster- General.
Joun D. Lone, Secretary of the Nawy.
Eruan Atuen Hrrencocn, Secretary of the Interior.
JAMES Wixson, Secretary of Agriculture.

BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Board consists of the Vice-President and the Chief Justice of
the United States as ex officio members, three members of the Senate,
three members of the House of Representatives, and six citizens,
‘*two of whom shall be resident in the city of Washington and the
other four shall be inhabitants of some State, but no two of them
of the same State.”

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted

January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 24, 1900, at 10
o'clock a. m.
_ The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which will be found
in fuller detail in the annual report of the Board to Congress, though
reference is made later on in this report to several matters upon which
action was taken at that meeting.

The Secretary announced the death of Dr. William Preston John-
ston, and Senator Platt announced that of Vice-President Hobart.
The action taken by the Board will be found under the head of
‘* Necrology.”

The Hon. William P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Senate,
was present, in accordance with custom, in place of Vice-President
Hobart, deceased. On January 4, 1900, the Speaker of the House
appointed Representatives R. R. Hitt and Robert Adams, jr., to suc-
ceed themselves and Representative Hugh A. Dinsmore to succeed
Gen. Joseph Wheeler.

The Secretary presented his report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, and said that the past
year had brought many evidences of the continued esteem in which
the Institution was held at home and abroad. It was certainly at the
present moment better known in Europe than in any previous period
of its history.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

After the reports of the executive and permanent committees, pre-
sented by their chairman, Senator Henderson, had been adopted, the
Secretary stated that, owing to other business which was to come
before the meeting, he would abridge his usual statement. He then
spoke briefly of the National Museum, of the cooperation of the State,
War, and Navy Departments for increasing the collections of the
National Zoological Park, of the exemption by the President from the
rules of the civil service of the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, in charge of the National Museum, and one private secre-
tary or confidential clerk to the Secretary of the Institution, as well as
the waiving of competitive examinations for positions on the scientific
staff, and of other matters. He further referred to the fact that he
was continuing, with the sanction of the Regents, some experiments
for the Board a Ordnance and Fortification which were likely to take
up considerable time, and he desired to repeat that the Secretary’s
time, which was partly given in his private hours, was all without
charge to the War Department.

The Secretary added that he had intended to bring before the Board
specific statements as to the position of the Smithsonian fund relative
to those of other institutions of learning, and to seek their instruction
as to the best means of increasing it. It was the most important sub-
ject, perhaps, that could be brought to their consideration, but in
view of the business immediately before them he deferred enlarging
upon it.

The special committee, composed of the Hon. J. B. Henderson, Dr.
William L. Wilson, Prof. A. Graham Bell, Dr. J. B. Angell, and the
Hon. R. R. Hitt, which had been appointed by the Chancellor in
accordance with a resolution passed at the previous meeting to con-
sider the proposal submitted by the Association of Agricultural Col-
leges and Experiment Stations for the establishment of a Bureau of
Eraduate Study under the Smithsonian Institution, and all kindred
questions, presented a report which dealt comprehensively with the
subject (which will be found in the Report of the Regents to Congress),
and the committee was discharged.

The Board then adjourned.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS.

The Hon. Richard Olney, of Massachusetts, was appointed a Regent
to suceeed Dr. Johnston, by joint resolution of Congress approved by
the President on January 24, 1900, and Dr. Andrew D. White, of New
York, was reappointed a Regent by joint resolution of Congress
approved June 2, 1900.

As organized at the end of the fiscal year, the Board of Regents
consisted of the following members:

The Hon. M. W. Fuller, Chief Justice of the United States, Chan-
cellor; Senator William P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Sen-
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ate, in place of the Vice-President, deceased; Senator 5. M. Cullom;
Senator O. H. Platt; Senator William Lindsay; Representative R. R.
Hitt; Representative Robert Adams, jr.; Representative Hugh A.
Dinsmore; Dr. James B. Angell; Dr. ‘Ruder D. White; the Hon.
Je: Menercn: the Hon. W. L. Wilson; Dr. A. Graham Bell; the
Hon. Richard Olney.

ADMINISTRATION.

The conduct of the business of the Institution, the management of
the bureaus under its charge, the relations with Congress, with the
Executive Departments of the Government, with colleges, universities,
societies, and libraries, with foreign establishments, governmental and
scientific, and with the thousands of persons who address the Institu-
tion seeking aid, counsel and information necessitates details of admin-
istrative labors far in excess of what was contemplated in the early
days of the Establishment. To these the greater part of the Secre-
tary’s time must be given, leaving but a minor portion for engaging
in and directing scientific work.

As far as is consistent with an orderly scheme of government, the
management of the various interests are left to the officers in direct
charge of the several branches of the work. The Secretary feels that
he is fortunate in having such efficient and hearty support as he receives
from these gentlemen, yet all questions of policy and almost number-
less matters of detail arising from Government practice or the regu-
lations of the Regents require his immediate attention and must be
passed upon by him or by the Assistant Secretary, who should have
more than the merely clerical aid he has at present.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, held on January 26, 1898, the following resolution was
unanimously adopted:

‘* Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to request of the Presi-
dent such a modification of the civil-service regulations relating to
appointments as will permit an exemption of such scientific positions
under the Smithsonian Institution as the Secretary may deem best for
the interests of the Institution.”

In accordance with this instruction the Secretary formally laid the
matter before the President in a communication which, since it has
already been the subject of discussion in the public press, may not im
properly be here given. It is as follows:

DECEMBER 5, 1898.
The PRESIDENT:

At the annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, held on January 26,1898, the following resolution was
unanimously adopted:

** Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to request of the Presi-
dent such a modification of the civil-service regulations relating to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

appointments as will permit an exemption of such scientific positions
under the Smithsonian Institution as the Secretary may deem best for
the interests of the Institution.”

Present: The Chancellor, the Chief Justice of the United States, in
the chair; the Vice-President of the United States; Senator Morrill,
of Vermont; Senator Cullom, of Illinois; Senator Gray, of Delaware;
Representative Hitt, of Illinois; Representative W heeler, of Alabama;
Representative Adams, of Pennsylvania; ex-Senator Hendet rson, of
Washington City; the Hon. W illiam L. W ilson, president of Wash-
ington and Lee University; Prof. Alexander Graham Bell, of Wash-
ing City; the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

In accordance with this instruction I respectfully request of the
President the exemption from the operations of the civil-service regu-
lations of the assistant secretaries in charge of the bureaus of the
Smithsonian Institution and of the heads of its several bureaus,
namely, the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the Bureau
of Ethnolog y, the Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory,
and to further respectfully represent that the above exemptions are
indispensable to enable the Institution to serve the Government’s
interests as it has hitherto done.

I further respectfully represent that in the opinion of the Regents
it is desirable that the Secretary should also have the power, as here-
tofore, of appointing scientific men of eminence as curators.

Lask to be permitted to state that men of high scientific position
have been usually found to be unwilling to subject themselves to exami-
nations, that the Smithsonian Institution has for more than a half cen-
tury secured to the Government the services of eminent men by selec-
tion from the whole body of American science, and that in my opinion
the public service will suffer if this can no longer be done.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. Lanaury, Secretary.

In adopting the recommendations of the Regents the President, on
May 29, 1899, amended the civil-service regulations in the following
respects:

Under section 3, Rule IV, noncompetitive examinations are per-
mitted to test the fitness of persons whom the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution shall nominate for appointment in the classi-
fied service, provided the Secretary shall certify that in his opinion
the positions to be filled ‘‘require such peculiar qualifications in
respect to knowledge and ability, or such scientific or special attain-
ments wholly or in part professional or technical as are HOw ordinarily
acquired in the executive service of the United States,” on which
account *‘an examination should be waived in whole or in part.” It
is required that the President of the United States shall approve such
nominations, whereupon the Civil Service Commission shall grant a
certificate of qualification, ‘‘ upon such evidence as may be satisfactory
to it, that the person so nominated is eligible for and may be appointed
to such position by reason of his ascertained qualifications and by rea-
son of his age, health, and moral character.” Such appointee may
not be transferred to any other position in the classified service except
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to one that may be filled in like manner, ‘‘and shall not be assigned
to any other duties than those pertaining to the particular position to
which thus appointed.”

Rule VI is amended to relieve from the requirements of exam-
ination or registration the Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution in charge of the United States National Museum, and
‘*not exceeding one private secretary or confidential clerk to the Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution.”

BUILDINGS.

The fitting up of the lower story in the south tower of the Smith-
sonian building as an exhibition room specifically for children has
occupied attention at intervals during the year, and the preliminary
work is now approaching completion. To obtaina maximum of light,
large doors, fitted with glass, protected where necessary by a light
grill of wrought iron, have been placed on the south side, and the win-
dows have been enlarged as far as could be done without interfering
with the masonry. The columns which formerly occupied the room
have been removed and the apartment finished in light color.

The purpose in establishing this room has not been to appeal to the
trained adult mind, but to the untrained and even childish mind, and
to group the objects with regard to those characteristics attractive to
and comprehensible by the general public, and particularly by chil-
dren. In this way it is hoped that the child at least will receive
impressions which will guide and influence it when serious studies are
taken up.

Further progress has been made in the renovation and rearrange-
ment of some of the storage rooms in the south tower, and changes
are in progress in the basement of the north tower.

Improvements in the Museum, the Astrophysical Observatory, and
the Zoological Park buildings are mentioned elsewhere.

Revised Statutes) was amended by act of Congress approved by the
President March 12, 1894, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding with the original bequest the sum of one mil-
lion dollars: Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on
the power of the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other
property by gift, bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the
same in promotion of the purposes thereof.

The permanent fund of $912,000, as above, is deposited, under this
provision, in the Treasury of the United States, and bears interest at
6 per cent per annum, the interest alone being used in carrying out
the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1899, the unexpended
balance, as stated in my last report, was $74,703.42. The total receipts
for the year were $60,809.81, being $56,400 derived from the interest
on the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, and $4,409.81
received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $59,294.16, the details
of which are given in the report of the executive committee. The
balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1900, for
the expenses of the Institution was $76,219.07, which includes the
$10,000 specifically referred to in previous reports, as well as the
interest accumulated on the Hodgkins and other funds, which is held
against certain contingent obligations, besides relatively considerable
sums held to meet liabilities which may be expected to mature asa
result of various scientific investigations and publications in progress.

Congress charged the Institution during the fiscal year 1900 with
the disbursement of the following appropriations:

8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for dis-
bursements made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of
the receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in
accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October 2,
1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to by
the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that
committee’s report.

The following estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, for
carrying on the Government interests under the charge of the Smith-
sonian Institution were forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the
Treasury.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

RESEARCH.

The Institution has continued research work in various fields of
science, including experiments in the solution of the problem of
mechanical flight, and, through its Astrophysical Observatory, inves-
tigations of the solar spectrum. A fuller account of the latter will be
found under the proper head.

The Institution has made some experiments during the year on
**radio-active substances,” based on the discovery by Professor Bee-
querel in 1896, that uranium salts emit invisible radiations capable of
charging electrified bodies and of producing shadow images on sensi-
tive plates.

The Secretary secured from France and Germany specimens of chlo-
ride of radium, polonium subnitrate, and other radio-active substances
prepared by Monsieur and Madame Curie. These substances were
alleged to have the altogether extraordinary property of emitting light,
that is, a form of energy, without limit, somewhat like the pretended
lamp of the medizval alchemists. A portion of this which was repre-
sented as having never been exposed to the sunlight, and which had
certainly been several weeks at least in total darkness, was opened by
Dr. Bolton in an entirely dark room, and immediately displayed a
feeble light which was, nevertheless, strong enough to enable the pho-
tographer to secure a very distinct print of a photograph. Other
experiments were made by Dr. Bolton, which will be found fully
described in the General Appendix of the Smithsonian Report for 1899.

It is not to be presumed that we have obtained this energy out of
nothing, but it remains to be shown what the something is out of which
it may have come. This subject has since attracted much interest
among chemists in this country as well as abroad. The experiments
at the Institution were perhaps the earliest, but not the only ones in
this country, and their publication seems to have excited such wide
attention as to justify this mention.

THE HODGKINS FUND.

The different branches of research now progressing under grants
from the Hodgkins fund are making satisfactory advances.

Prof. William Hallock, of Columbia University, New York, has
supplemented his report of last year by a summary of the further
progress of his investigation of the motion of an air particle under the
influence of articulate speech. The instruments which Professor Hal-
lock has invented, and is now perfecting, have proved a great aid in
this research, and will, he states, enable him to settle definitely the
question of phase differences in the components of a complex sound.

Prof. A. G. Webster, of Clark University, reports the completion
and successful application to the use for which it was designed of the
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

new apparatus, perfec «d with aid from a Hodgkins grant, by means
of which it is now poss dle to measure the intensity of rapidly varying
sounds with :n accuracy not hitherto attained. <A report of the results
of the further experiments of Professor Webster upon the propaga-
tion, reflection, and diffracticn of sound, the action of the megaphone
and the trumpet phonograph, as well as a verification of the theory of
resonators, is awaited later.

A grant was approved November 28, 1899, on behalf of Prof. Louis
Bevier, of Rutgers College, for an investigation of vowel-timbre on
the basis of the phonographic record. This research will endeavor
primarily to determine:

1. The characteristic partia! tones which differentiate the various
timbres recognized by the ear <s the vowels of speech.

2. How these partiais vary 1a articulate speech, with stress, pitch
of fundamental, etc., and in the transition to other sounds.

This research is still in progress, and will be reported upon more
fully, but Doctor Bevier states that the vowels already studied form
a series acoustically, quite as truly as phonetically and physiologically.

The meteorological investigations with kites have been successfully
continued at Blue Hill under the direction of Mr. Rotch with the
assistance of a grant from the Hodgkins fund. During the year
ending July 1, 1900, s'xteen flights were made in four series in order
to obtain the changes with height under different weather conditions,
the maximum altitude reached being 14,000 feet on June 21.

In addition to the above investigations a Hodgkins grant has been
approved to enable Mr. Rotch to carry on a series of experiments in
space telegraphy, it being thought that the unprecedented heights
attained by kites might materially extend the range of communication
by this method. In the preliminary experiments, however, kites were
not used, sufficient elevation being attainable without them, but when
the difference between the stations was increased from 1 mile to 3, kites
were employed to raise the transmitting and receiving wires. In the
later experiments it was found, not unexpectedly, that the long wires,
carried up and supporied by kites, collected so much electricity as to
interfere with and greatiy complicate the messages sent from station to
station. These interruptions seem to show that the limit of elevation
for the receiving wire was under thése conditions less than 500 feet.
The greatest distance covered in the experiments was approximately 12
miles, from a wire supported by a kite about 200 feet above Blue Hill
to the tower of Memorial Hall in Cambridge, which was used as the
receiving station. These experiments draw attention to the fact that
electrification increases with the altitude to which the wire is carried,
and that it is always present, although varying with the meteorological
condition of the atmosphere. The experiments were discontinued in
the autumn of 1899.

sna
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. li

It has been found practicable to approve a second grant on behalf
of the journal, Terrestrial Magnetism, which was warmly recom-
mended by the committee for such aid last year, Professor Bauer, the
editor, as in the case of the first grant, agreeing to send out a specified
number of copies of his journal to scientific men and institutions.

In November of last year an application was received from Dr. Carl
Barus, now connected with Brown University, for a grant from the
Hodgkins fund in aid of his experiments on atmospheric condensation.
This application, having been duly passed upon, was approved.

This research is supplemental to the experiments already conducted
by Dr. Barus, as described in Bulletin No. 12, of the Department of
Agriculture, and will be:

1. A study of the origin, activity, and growth of the condensation
producing dust partictes; their reactions on each other, their relation
to electric radiation, ete.

2. A study of the growth, ete., of water corpuscles after condensa-
tion; the reaction of corpuscles of different sizes on each other, ete.

A preliminary report was submitted by Dr. Barus, and, in accord-
ance with the usage of the Institution and as a matter of interest to
those engaged in similar researches, he has been invited to publish in
the scientific journals a detailed account of his experiments.

A grant has been approved on behalf of Prof. Dr. R. von Lenden-
feld, of the University of Prague, for a study of the motion of birds
in actual free flight, a subject to which, although primarily known as
a zoologist and meteorologist, Dr. von Lendenfeld’s attention has been
directed for years, and for the better understanding of which he has
made numerous anatomical preparations, physiological observations,
ete. The investigations of Dr. von Lendenfeld have been aided by
the Society for the Advancement of Scientific Research in Bohemia,
and also by the Austrian Government. His publications have been
numerous, the simultaneous issue in German and English of his mono-
graph on flight having been arranged for by the author with Mr.
Fischer in Jena and Messrs. Macmillan & Co. in London.

Dr. von Lendenfeld’s published work on his Australian explorations
and researches was submitted to the Institution in 1893, at which time
he entered his application for a grant, since fully considered and
advised upon, and now approved as above stated.

Since my last report ansapplication has been received for a grant in
aid of the researches on the spectrum which have been prosecuted
with ardor by Dr. V. Schumann, of Leipsic, for several years. As is
the custom, the question of the advantage to.science of such a grant
was referred to leading specialists, both in this country and Europe.
The testimony thus obtained as to the value of the work already
accomplished by Dr. Schumann, added to my own knowledge of his
ily REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

investigations, led to the approval of a subvention from the Hodgkins
fund for the prosecution of researches in connection with the spectral
relations of atmospheric air. The apparatus by means of which Dr.
Schumann has heretofore secured such noteworthy results being
chiefly of his own invention, he has been permitted to apply the
present grant to the further perfection of his instruments before enter-
ing upon his special experiments, which will be definitely reported
upon as they progress.

As referred to in my last report, in accordance with the purpose
of the Institution, copies of the Hodgkins prize memoir, La Vie sur.
les hauts Plateaux, which were obtained through the authors, Drs.
Herrera and Lope, have been distributed to the libraries and educa-
tional institutions of the country, thus making a valuable work accessi-
ble in widely separated localities.

In October of last year copies of the Hodgkins medal in silver and
bronze were presented to Pembroke College, Oxford, England, of
which establishment James Smithson, the founder of the Institution,
was a graduate. The receipt of the medals was acknowledged in the
following letter from the Right Rey. Lord Bishop Mitchison, master
of Pembroke College, through whom the presentation was made:

PEMBROKE COLLEGE, OxForD, Wovember 19, 1899.
Drar Dr. Lancury: Yesterday your kind present of the copies of
the Hodgkins medal of the Smithsonian Institution came safely to
hand, and on behalf of myself and of the college I tender you my best
thanks for a beavtiful and interesting gift. The medals will form a
suitable adjunct to the cases of books from the Institution, which

form, as you know, a feature in our college library.
Believe me to be, ver y faithfully, yours,
J. Mrrcuison.

In order that the scope permitted by the will of the donor in
expending the income from the Hodgkins fund may not fail to be
understood by those likely to be interested in the range of researches
which may be thus fostered, a circular, a transcript of which follows,
has been recently issued:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[Presiding officer ex officio, the President of the United States; Chancellor, the Chief Justice of the
United States. ]

THE HopaGxKins Funp. z

In October, 1891, Thomas George Hodgkins, Esq., of Setauket,
New York, made a donation to the Smithsonian Institution, the income
from a part of which was to be devoted ‘to the increase and diffusion
of more exact knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of
atmospheric air in connection with the welfare of man.”

These properties may be considered in their bearing upon any or
all of the sciences—e. g., not only in regard to meteorology, but in
connection with hygiene, or with physics, or with any department
whatever, either of biologic: ul or physical knowledge.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

With the intent of furthering the donor’s known wishes, the Insti-
tution has already given considerable money prizes for treatises em-
bodying new and important discoveries in regard to the nature or
properties of air. This form of encouragement will not at present be
renewed.

A gold medal has been established under the name of the ‘* Hodg-
kins Medal of the Smithsonian Institution,” which will be awarded
annually or biennially for important contributions to our knowledge
of the nature and properties of atmospheric air, or for practical appli-
cations of our existing knowledge of them to the welfare of mankind,
and grants of money are made from time to time to specialists engaged
in original investigations which involve the study of the properties of
atmospheric air.

These properties may be understood in the widest sense of the word.
Thus the physicist may consider them in an investigation which
involves the study, for instance, of atmospheric electricity, or of the
absorptive powers of the air, or of the atmospheric lines in the spec-
trum; the hygienist may be assisted in researches in this connection
looking to the promotion of health; or even the geologist, in a study
which connects the earth’s crust with the absorption of the constitu-
ents of the atmosphere in past or coming time. Thus the Hodgkins
Fund may be considered to cover in effect something belonging to
nearly every division of the applied sciences.

It being the desire of the Institution to give the widest extension to
the great purpose of the founder of this fund, and to prevent any mis-
apprehension of his wishes, it is repeated, then, that the discoveries or
applications proper to be brought to the consideration of the Institu-
tion may be in the field of any department of science without restric-
tion, provided only that they have to do with ‘‘the nature and proper-
ties of atmospheric air in connection with the welfare of man.”

The following conditions are imposed with a view to obtaining the
fullest possible benefit to science from grants made from the fund:

1. Applications for grants should have the endorsement of some rec-
ognized academy of sciences, or other institution of learning, and
should be accompanied by evidences of the capacity of the applicant,
in the form of at least one memoir already published by him, based
upon original investigation.

2. The purchase of necessary laboratory appliances for the particular
research in view is authorized, and in special cases on explanation by
the applicant, the payment of the salaries of assistants in prosecuting
such research; but the defrayment of the purely personal expenses of
the grantee is not intended to be provided from moneys advanced from
the Fund.

3. Upon the conclusion of a research, it is expected that any special
piece or pieces of apparatus purchased from a grant from the Fund
will be returned to the Smithsonian Institution.

4, Should investigations for which a grant has been made be of con-
siderable duration, a summary of progress should be submitted to the
Institution at the end of six months, as well as a subsequent report in
which the results of such investigations may be recorded.

5. The Institution does not claim any legal property in a research
promoted by its aid, but it expects to make the first publication of the
results obtained, if it desire to do so. If this can not be done without
delay, and if the results seem to require it, the Institution has, when

requested, hitherto opposed no obstacle to the publication elsewhere
of the fullest abstract of such results, with the understanding that
acknowledgment shall be made in any such preliiunary publication
of the assistance given by it in promoting the research in which the
advances have been made.

All communications in regard to the Hodgkins Fund, medals and
publications, and ali applications for grants of money, should be
addressed to

NAPLES TABLE.

In accordance with the urgent desire cf many of the leading biolo-
gists of the country, a contract for the Table in the Naples Zoological
Station fora third term of three years was entered into in February,
1900, and appointments to the seat were at once approved.

Dr. B. M. Duggar, of Cornell University, was accorded the seat
for six weeks during February and March, 1900.

Asst. Surg. V. G. Heiser, of the United States Marine-Hospital Serv-
ice, was permitted to use the Table at periods suited to his convenience
whiie stationed at Naples during the months of March and April, 1900.
As in this instance, the kindness of Dr. Dohrn, the Director, renders a
double occupation frequently possibie, thus adding materially to the
service of the Table.

It is a matter of regret that Mr. Willard G. Van Name, who received
the appointment for six weeks during the spring, was prevented by
illness from filling his term at the Table.

Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr College, who occupied the Smith-
sonian seat six months during the winter and spring of 1894-95, and
has since served temporarily on the Smithsonian Advisory Committee
for the Table, was reappointed fora part of June and July, 1900.

The application of Dr. P. C. Mensch, of Ursinus College, Pennsy!-
vania, was approved for the month of November, 1900.

Dr. E. B. Wilson, Columbia University, New York, has returned to
this country and resumed his duties as a member of the Advisory
Committee. Each succeeding year renews the Secretary’s sense of
obligation to the committee for the assistance afforded him in recom-
mending action on the various applications for the Smithsonian seat.

The reports of the different investigators appointed to the Table
show that the advantages for research enjoyed at Naples are appreci-
ated by them; they also testify to the earnest desire of the Director
and his assistants to render all possible aid to those conducting
researches at Naples.

It may be noted that the established condition requiring an appli-
cant for the Table to submit, with his request for the seat, a summary
of his scientific history, including a list of his published works, is not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5)

only an aid to the Institution in passing upon the question of appoint-
ment, but tends directly to the personal advantage of the student at
Naples, as asummary of such history is forwarded to Dr. Dohrn with
each notice of appointment.

EXPLORATIONS.

While it has never been possible for the Institution to devove large
amounts from its income for carrying on explorations, it has uever-
theless been able to promote such work in various ways, particularly
in connection with the bureaus of the Institution and in cooperation
with the Executive Departments of the Government. The explora-
tions have in these directions had a very wide range, and have been
productive of a very great increase in the knowledge of the natural
history of the regions visited and of the ethnological conditions of
the people.

During the past year the Institution has thus been more or less
directly concerned in explorations in various parts of the world, from
the arctic regions as far south as Patagonia, and in the distant posses-
sions in the Philippines, as well as in South Africa.

In the pages devoted to the National Museum, the Bureau of Eth-
nology, and the Zoological Park the detailed results of explorations
are narrated and need not be repeated here.

PUBLICATIONS.

Through the publications of the Institution and its bureaus, much is
done each year in carrying out one of its fundamental objects, the
‘*diffusion of knowledge.” Works covering practically every branch
of human knowledge have been distributed throughout the world to
libraries and institutions where they may best be available to scholars
and to the reading public.

The Institution itself publishes three established series—the Contri-
butions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual
Reports. In the first series, in quarto form, are published original
researches in various branches of science. The series of Miscellaneous
Collections, in the words of Secretary Henry (Smithsonian Report, 1861),
‘includes works intended to facilitate the study of the various branches
of natural history, to give instruction as to the method of observing
natural phenomena, and a variety of other matter connected with the
progress of science. Although the object of the Institution is not
educational, yet in carrying out the general plan it has been thought
important in some cases to publish elementary treatises, which will
not only furnish an introduction to special subjects to those who have
not access to expensive libraries, but also serve to point out the way
in which individuals by special studies can not only promote their own
enjoyment, but also cooperate with all others engaged in the same
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

pursuit in extending the domain of knowledge. The objects of nature,
like the specimens of high art, are the luxuries of the cultivated mind,
and the awakening of a taste for the study affords an inexhaustible
source of pleasure and contentment to the most numerous and the
most important classes of the community.”

In carrying out the policy planned for the Miscellaneous Collections,
there have been published in the 40 volumes of that series 106 bio
logical papers, 67 physical papers, and 22 papers of a business charac-
ter, such as lists of libraries, publications, and of correspondents.

The Annual Reports are accompanied by an appendix distinct in
purpose from the other publications of the Institution. Formerly the
Institution published a summary of the progress of science in all its
branches during the year, but this grew so increasingly inadequate
with the more numerous fields that science occupied that it was dis-
continued, and in its place has been published a series of articles,
occasionally original, but more frequently drawn from other and
nontechnical publications, giving short popular memoirs by writers of
authority on the subjects familiar to each, and collectively a résumé
of those of most special! interest in all departments of science which have
appeared during the year. The special characteristic of these memoirs
is that, while authoritative, they are nontechnical and of interest to
the general reader, and there are few portions of the work of the
Institution which more effectively serve in the diffusion of knowledge
than this.

The Institution publishes through the National Museum the Pro-
ceedings and the Bulletin and an Annual Report. Through the Bureau
of Ethnology there are likewise issued very complete works on Ameri-
can Ethnology.

During the past year the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory
have for the first time appeared, the first volume having been put to
press and practically published at the close of the fiscal year. This
work is discussed somewhat in detail in the paragraph devoted to the
Observatory. It is an exhaustive account of the work of the Secre-
tary during a long series of years in his study of the infra-red solar
spectrum, a work begun at Allegheny in 1878, and continued in the
Astrophysical Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution.

An important work put in type during the year, under special
authority of Congress, was a Documentary and Legislative History
of the Institution from 1836 to 1899, comprising about 1,900 pages,
to be published in two volumes.

There has also been in hand a second Supplement to Bolton’s Bibli-
ography of Chemistry, giving about 6,000 titles of academic disserta-
tions. The first part of the Museum portion of the Smithsonian
Report for 1897 was distributed early in the year; but the second part,
to consist of some of the more important papers by the late Assistant
Secretary, Dr. Goode, has not been completed. Both the Smith-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Ly
sonian and Museum volumes of the 1898 Report were put in type, but
it was impossible to issue them in bound form before the year closed.

In order to meet the demand for information in regard to the abo-
riginal antiquities of the West Indies, the Institution reprinted from
the Reports for 1876 and 1884, descriptions of the Latimer Collection
from Porto Rico and of the Guesde Collection in Pointe-a-Pitre,
Guadaloupe.

Of the Proceedings of the National Museum, Volume X XI was
published in bound form, and 23 papers included in Volume XXII
were issued as pamphlets.

As the principal paper in the Museum Report for 1898, it seemed
advisable to publish an exhaustive monographic treatise by the late
Professor Cope on the Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North
America.

The elaborate work by Drs. Jordan and Evermann on the Fishes of
North and Middle America was brought to completion by the publi-
cation of Part 4 of Bulletin +7 of the Museum, this part consisting of
392 plates, with explanations, and a general table of contents of the
four parts of the work.

The Bureau of American Ethnology issued Part 2 of the Sevententh
Annual Report, but Part 1 has been delayed. The Eighteenth and
Nineteenth Reports are also in the hands of the Government Printer,
and some progress has been made in the printing of the first bulletin
of a new series authorized by Congress.

LIBRARY.

The number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts
added to the library has aggregated 25,701. As this appears to show
a decrease over previous years, it seems well to record the fact that
the decrease is apparent and not real. From the inception of the
Institution each item, even a periodical issued weekly, was separately
entered in the accession book. Last year the number of such items
aggregated over 36,000, and the clerical labor involved was very great.
Inasmuch as the separate parts were checked upon cards, it seemed
advisable to give up the old system which, while affording an abso-
lutely permanent record of each item, involved an expenditure of
energy disproportionate to the result. The Librarian of Congress
and the librarian of the Institution joined in recommending this
change.

From January 1, 1900, only completed volumes were entered in the
accession book.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The third and final conference on an International Catalogue of

Scientific Literature was held in London June 12 and 18, 1900, and the

United States Government was invited to participate, through the
sM 1900 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department of State, as it has in the previous conferences. The
invitation requested the appointment of delegates prepared to pledge
their governments to definite support of the undertaking; and to meet
this condition the Secretary of State urged upon Congress an appro-
priation of $10,000 for the purpose. As Congress adjourned without
making the grant, it appeared that no authority existed to send a
representative to the conference with the powers stipulated in the
terms of the invitation, and accordingly none was sent. This result
is greatly to be deplored, since probably no country has a larger inter-
est in scientific bibliography than the United States.

So keenly was the absence of American co-operation felt, and the
danger of the entire failure of the undertaking was so apparent should
American aid not be forthcoming, that the Secretary informally agreed
to draw upon the slender resources of the Institution temporarily, and
furnish to this international undertaking an index of American scientific
literature.

It is hoped that in some way Congress may be brought to see the
importance of this undertaking, and make adequate provision. It
would constitute a real reproach to the country, should America not do
its share in this work.

GALLERY OF ART.

The act of foundation of the Institution declares (section 5586 of the
Revised Statutes) that ‘‘ whenever suitable arrangements can be made
from time to time for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign
and curious research, all objects of natural history, plants, and geo-
logical and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States
* * * shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by
the Board of Regents to receive them, and shall be so arranged and
classified in the building erected for the Institution as best to facilitate
the examination and study of them;” so that the first object of the
Institution, in the eyes of its founders, appears to have been to give
it the curatorship of the art collections of the nation.

During its early years this object was promoted in various ways;
among others by the purchase of a very valuable collection of prints
and engravings belonging to the Hon. George P. Marsh. After the
fire in the Institution in 1865 these prints were deposited for tempo-
rary safe keeping in the Library of Congress and (with other works
of art) in the Corcoran Gallery.

Subsequently an appropriation was granted by Congress for making
a fireproof room in which these could be kept, but it was not until 1896
that the Regents provided for their recall to the Institution. In the
journal of the proceedings of the Board for 1896 (Smithsonian Report,
1896, pp. xlii and xiv) will be found the action taken by the Board
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

providing for their restoration to their own immediate control. The
following resolution offered then by Senator Gray was adopted:

Resolved, That the question of the propriety of bringing the works
of art belonging to the Institution under the more immediate control
of the Board of Regents be referred to the Executive Committee and
the Secretary, with power to act.

In pursuance of this the Institution brought back to its own keeping
a number of prints of value, both from the Library of Congress and
the Corcoran Gallery, leaving, by an amicable understanding with the
latter establishment, as a loan, a few of the works of art, notably a
large picture by Healy.

The old name of the collections was the ‘**Gallery of Art,” a title
which seems almost too ambitious for the present collections of the
Institution, though it is to be hoped that this designation will be justi-
fied by their future increase. These have been placed by me ina room
specially fitted up for that purpose (the Art Room), under the tem-
porary charge of the librarian.

THE CHILDREN’S ROOM.

An educational museum has been elsewhere defined as ‘*a collection
of instructive labels, each illustrated by a well-selected specimen;” but
though the first purpose of a museum be for the increase of original
knowledge by investigation and research, its second purpose is to
entertain as well as to instruct. To some extent the scientific system
of classification which requires a Latin name on every natural-history
specimen is associated with a treatment on the label which does not
principally consider what interests, but what instructs, and makes the
collection less entertaining than it might otherwise be to the general
public; but this, the customary arrangement, while right and neces-
sary for scientific purposes, and the one which must always chiefly
prevail, is not that which is most readily ‘‘ understanded of the people,”
almost the only way to whose comprehension lies through a newly
awakened interest and attention. It may truthfully be said that not
one in twenty persons who enter a museum of natural history does
profit in this sense by the intelligence conveyed along with the Latin
name, and though our own labels are chiefly in English, and though
the wants of this public have already been considered in the National
Museum in the collections as now displayed, it might seem to be pos-
sible to do yet a little more and to place at least in a restricted space
specimens which will engage the interest of the majority of the public
and especially to bring these things within the reach of children.

Speaking for myself, and I believe for most other students of science,
I-may say that each will usually recognize that his ‘* bent” toward his
particular study came to him at a very early period of his life, when
something which excited his childish wonder grew to have unaccountable
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

attraction, which developed into a lifelong pursuit. At least if he can
remember, he will find that this ‘t bent” did not begin in a dry instrue-
tion, but in something which powerfully interested him.

This has been recognized as true philosophy from the time when
Aristotle said ‘* Knowledge begins in wonder;” and with it in view I
have felt desirous of devoting at least some small portion of the col-
lections to the purpose of stimulating the wonder and interest of all
the unlearned, and especially of the children, and I am fitting up in
the south tower of the Smithsonian building a small room on the
ground floor which is to be called the ** Children’s Room.” The little
group of specimens it contains is meant to stimulate, interest, and
entertain rather than to ostensibly instruct. Latin is banished from
its labels, and the classification is not that of science, but that which is
most intelligible to the untrained mind.

T shall return to this subject in a future report, when I can speak
both of the completion of the collection, which is not yet finished, and,
I hope, of useful results in the direction for which it is intended.

CORRESPONDENCE.

The correspondence of the Institution embraces letters having refer-
ence not only to the scope of work of the Institution, but also relating
to the bureaus placed by Congress under its direction. Many letters
relating exclusively to the activities of the bureaus mentioned are
referred to them for attention and answer, but those involving in any
way the policy of the Institution or relating to other than routine
matters are referred to the Secretary.

As in former years, a considerable amount of correspondence relates
to matters not strictly within the purview of the Institution’s inter-
ests, but it has been the endeavor in every instance where the infor-
mation desired could be readily obtained to supply the wants of the
applicant. Where the inquiry addressed to the Institution appears to
come within the immediate scope of the functions of some other branch
of the Government service, the communication has been referred to the
chief of the department or bureau concerned, and the writer so informed.
The correspondence of the Institution is perhaps more varied and
embraces a wider range of subjects than obtains in other departments
of the Government, and but avery small percentage of the letters
received, concern business of aroutine nature. It can readily be under-
stood that this circumstance requires an unusual amount of energy and
labor on the part of the staffs of the Institution and its several bureaus
to properly reply as fully as possible to correspondents.

The system inaugurated in 1890, of registering and referring letters
received at the Institution, when of sufficient importance to warrant
a permanent record of them, has continued in successful operation,
and entries have been promptly made and any arrears avoided.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2A
COOPERATION OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS.

The several Departments of the Government have always generously
cooperated in furthering the interests of the Institution, particularly
in collecting objects of biological or ethnological interest, and the
results of such cooperation are particularly seen in every department
of the Museum. Among those who have been most active in increas-
ing the collections have been officers of the Army and Navy who
have voluntarily given their services to the work.

In order to promote and increase the interest in the Institution on
the part of the officers of the United States resident in foreign coun-
tries, the Secretary of the Institution issued circulars to be sent to
United States consuls and to army and navy officers. The forms of
these circulars were printed in the last Report, and it is gratifying to
note that a considerable number of objects have already been thus
acquired, as mentioned elsewhere.

EXPOSITIONS.

By act of Congress approved March 3, 1899, the sum of $300,000
was appropriated for a Government exhibit at the proposed Pan-
American Exposition to be held at Buffalo in 1901.

The Government Board of Management in charge of the preparation
of the exhibit having apportioned a part of the sum for a display by
the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus, considerable progress has
been made during the year in gathering objects that would best illus-
trate the work of the Institution. In this connection a few objects
connected with the history of art will be exhibited on the part of the
Institution, but the collection will chiefly consist of specimens illus-
trative of its scientific functions, and more especially in the National
Museum and Bureau of Ethnology. An opportunity was thus afforded
for gathering biological collections in Cuba, as well as objects chiefly
of ethnological interest from the Philippines.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF ORIENTALISTS.

As mentioned in the last report, the Secretary, on December 9, 1898,
designated Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University, as delegate
of the Institution to the Twelfth International Congress of Orientalists
at Rome, on October 3-15, 1899; and Dr. Haupt, as well as Prof.
Charles R. Lanman, of Harvard University, and Prof. Morris Jastrow,
of the University of Pennsylvania, were, upon recommendation of the
Secretary, appointed as delegates of the United States Government.

The congress was a notable one, nearly 600 persons being present,
of whom 15 were from the United States, and a number of valuable
papers were presented by the American members. One important
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

outgrowth of the meeting was the establishment of an International
Association for the archzologic exploration of India. The next con-
evess will be held in December, 1902, in Hamburg, Germany, while
Athens has been proposed as the place of meeting for the Fourteenth
Congress.

STANDARDS OF COLOR.

Mr. Robert Ridgway, curator of ornithology in the National
Museum, published a number of years ago, for the use of naturalists,
a handbook on color, and he requested a grant from the Institution
fora new edition. It appeared to the Secretary that a work upona
more extended scale and a somewhat different plan would be of value
primarily to naturalists, but also in every department of science, to
artists, and in many branches of industry.

At the present time there is practically no uniformity in the common
use of color names, one name designating as a rule as many as half a
dozen different shades; nor is there any absolute method commonly
available by which a person in one place can describe to a person in
another the exact shade or tint meant by a given name. The produc-
tion of a work which would obviate these difficulties and make availa-
ble what might be called the ‘‘ CONSTANTS OF NATURE” in color, is
directly in line with previous publications of the Institution in
endeavoring to establish standards whereby a definite nomenclature in
scientific and popular writing might be introduced.

The conception is that of a comprehensive and important work, and
this has been under consideration for some time, for it has been felt
that it could not be undertaken by the Institution unless it was to be
done in a worthy manner. One of the difficulties in such books as
they have hitherto been published, is that they are absolutely depend-
ent upon color illustrations which fade with time, so that the original
tints, which should be the standards of comparison, can not be
recovered.

The Secretary, after consulting with others expert in the matter,
decided that it would be desirable not only to secure more permanent
tints, but to connect every tint published in the book with some defin-
ite wave length in the spectrum, whether the solar spectrum or a com-
posite one. The investigations of Professor Rood and others show
that it is difficult to do this directly, but that it can be effected by the
use of intermediate means of comparison.

Again, experiments must be made to determine how far this large
object (of connecting every tint employed with some definite wave
length or combination of wave lengths of light) is practicable. If it be
fully so, the work may be said to be in one sense something absolutely
permanent, relating as it will to standards which can never alter with
time, so that, as has been said, those who expect that their writings
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

will be more permanent than the planet itself should take this method
of illustrating them.

The work promised such magnitude that a committee was appointed,
as follows: Mr. Ridgway, curator of the ornithology in the National
Museum, as possible editor; Mr. Holmes, head curator of anthro-
pology, and known as an artist of ability; Dr. Gill, the distinguished
naturalist, and Dr. Adler, the librarian of the Institution, who has
been charged to procure information on the history of the subject.
To these it is quite probable there will be later added a physicist and
possibly a special colorist, unless these last two qualifications can be
found combined in the same person, which is hardly probable.

NATIONAL STANDARDIZING BUREAU.

The Hon. James H. Southard, chairman of the Committee on Coin-
age, Weights and Measures of the House of Representatives, invited
the Secretary to appear before the committee last April in regard to
the merits of a bill then before Congress for the establishment of a
bureau of standards, but he was unfortunately prevented from doing
so by other engagements.

It is proper to say, however, that the establishment of a bureau of
standards is a matter in which the Secretary has been always greatly
interested, and that at the request of the Superintendent of the Coast
Survey he had an interview with him and made some suggestions in
reference to proposed legislation.

The Secretary was the first to establish a practical plan, which was
afterward very generally adopted by the railways of the United
States, for communicating standard time over long distances, and he
has always taken a special interest in the subject of determinations of
exact measurements in other ways.

The Smithsonian Institution has preserved in its Museum sets of
standards of the United States, and the Secretary has also personally
commenced a collection of instruments to illustrate the history of
standards in all countries. Certain archaic specimens which have
been acquired for this purpose are being at the present time arranged.

He takes this opportunity of recording the fact of his interest in the
measure now before Congress for the establishment of a national
bureau of standards, and saying that his testimony, if given before
the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, would have been
in favor of the plan proposed in the bill under consideration.

PROPOSED CHALCEDONY PARK.

The region known as the Petrified Forest in Arizona has been a
place of much popular and scientific interest, and at various times the
question of setting the region apart as a Government reservation has
been agitated but without any definite action until the past year,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

when, us a result of correspondence between the Institution and the
General Land Office, the further removal of fossil trees has been
prohibited.

Prof. Lester F. Ward visited the region in November, 1899, and
the results of his examination have been published by the Department
of the Interior.

The Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution received the following
letter from the honorable Commissioner of the General Land Office:

PETRIFIED FOREST, ARIZONA.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,
GENERAL LAnp OFFIcE,
Washington, D. C., June 17, 1899.

Str: Iam in receipt of a certified copy of a memorial by the legis-
lature of Arizona praying that certain lands in Apache County, Aviz.,
in the vicinity of the town of Holbrook, known as the ‘‘ Petrified For-
est,” be withdrawn from entry with a view to creating a reservation
or national park for the purpose of preserving the natural wonders
and curiosities of the same.

I have the honor to request that you will kindly inform me whether
the records of the Smithsonian Institution furnish any information
respecting this locality indicating that the scenic features of the same
are of such a nature as to render it desirable, in the interest of the
public, to set these lands apart as a national park. I will be pleased
to receive a full expression of your views on this subject, and also as
to the importance of preserving the mineralized formations in that
region.

Very respectfully, BinGER HERMANN,
Commissioner.
The SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

To this letter the following reply was made:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, D. C., July 7, 1899.

Str: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communi-
cation of the 17th ultimo requesting information concerning the Petri-
fied Forest near Holbrook, in Arizona, as well as an expression of
opinion concerning the desir ability of setting aside these lands as a
national park, and beg to furnish the following statement:

The region near Holbr ook, Apache County, Arizona, known as the
‘*Petrified Forest,” ‘*Chalcedony Park,” and ‘‘ Lithodendron (stone
trees) Valley,” is of great interest because of the abundance of its
beautiful petrified coniferous trees, as well as of its scenic features.
The trees lie scattered about in great profusion, but none stand erect
in their original place of erowth as do many in the Yellowstone
National Park. The National Museum possesses three splendid trunks
collected there by Lieutenant Hegewald at the request of General
Sherman.

The best popular account of this region is given by Mr. George F.
Kunz, and is as follows:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

‘* Among the great American wonders is the silicified forest, known
as Chalcedony Park, situated about 8 miles south of Carrizo, a station
on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in Apache County, Arizona.
* * * The locality was noticed in 1853 by the Pacific Railroad
Exploring Survey. * * * There is every evidence to show that
the trees grew beside some inland sea. After falling they became
water-logged, and during decomposition the cell structure of the wood
was entirely replaced by silica from sandstone in the walls surround-
ing this great inland sea.

“Over the entire area trees lie scattered in all conceivable positions
and in fragments of all sizes, the broken sections sometimes resem-
bling a pile of cart wheels. * * * A phenomenon perhaps unpar-
alleled and the most remarkable feature of the park is a natural bridge
formed by a tree of agatized wood spanning a canyon 45 feet in width.
In addition to the span, fully 50 feet of the tree rests on one side,
making it visible for a length over 100 feet.”

Lieutenant Hegewald writes:

‘*T rode down the valley to examine the thousands of specimens that
lay scattered on each side of the valley along the slopes, which were
perhaps 50 feet high; the valley of the Lithodendron, at its widest
part, being scarcely a half mile. Along the slopes no vegetation what-
ever was to be seen, wood being very scarce; the soil was composed
of clay and sand mostly, and these petrifactions, broken into raion
of pieces, lay scattered all adown these slopes. Some of the large
fossil trees were well preserved, though the action of heat and cold
had broken most of Aisi in sections from 2 to 20 feet long, and
some of these must have been immense trees; measuring the exposed
parts of several, they varied from 150 to 200 feet in leneth, and from
2 to 43 feet in diameter, the centers often containing most beautiful
quartz crystals.”

Dr. Walter Hough, of the Smithsonian Institution, who has visited
the park, writes as follows:

‘In the celebrated Petrified Forest, which is some 18 miles from
Holbrook, Arizona, on the picturesque Santa Fe Railroad, there are
fuitis of several ancient Indian villages. These villages are small, in
some cases having merely a few houses, but what gives sthema peculiar
interest is that they were built of logs of beautiful fossil wood. * * #
The prehistoric dwellers of the land selected cylinders of uniform size,
which were seemingly determined by the carrying strength of a man.
It is probable that prehistoric builders never chose more beautiful
stones for the construction of their habitations than the trunks of the
trees which flourished ages before man appeared on the earth.

** This wood agate also furnished material for stone hammers, arrow-
heads, and knives, which are often found in ruins hundreds of miles
from the forest.”

This ‘‘ wood agate” or ‘“‘wood opal” is now cut and polished into
floor tiling, mantels, clock cases, table tops, paper weights, ete. The
silver testimonial to the French sculptor Bartholdi, made by Tiffany
& Co., had for its base a section of this wood agate.

Prof. Lester F. Ward, an eminent paleo obotanist, who, while officially
attached to the staff of the United States Geological Survey, also holds
the position of associate curator in the National Museum, expects to
visit the Pacific coast this summer, and may return by the southern
route. He tells me that if you so desire he would be pleased to visit
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the region in question for the special purpose of procuring further
information regarding the features covered by your inquiry.
in conclusion I would say that all with whom I have consulted are
agreed that the ‘* Petrified Forest,” or ‘‘ Chalcedony Park,” of Apache
County, Arizona, should be preserved as a public park for the benefit
of the American people. In no other area is there such a profusion of
highly colored stone trees. Fossil wood is scattered over a very great
area of Arizona, but the densest portion and chief place of: interest is
‘*Chaleedony Park,” an area of less than 5 miles square. This region
is about 20 miles south of Carrizo station.
A list of papers relating to the Arizona forest trees is appended.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Gifts.—Among the gifts to the Institution during the year may be
mentioned an extensive and valuable collection of archeological
objects presented to the Institution by Mr. Joseph D. McGuire, of
Washington.

Smithson tablet.—The bronze tablet affixed, by the direction of the
Regents, to the tomb of Smithson in Genoa, having been stolen, it has
been ordered to be replaced by one in Carrara marble.

Foreign institutions.—Dr. Andrew D. White, ambassador to Ger-
many and a Regent of the Institution, was designated to represent the
latter at the celebration of the two hundredth anniversary of the Royal
Prussian Academy of Sciences, at Berlin, on March 19 and 20, 1900.

Dr. White attended, and, in his report of the ceremonies, suggested
that the formal congratulations of the Institution should he suitably
engrossed and forwarded to the Royal Academy. This was done
through the Department of State.

The congratulations of the Institution were also sent to the Kaiser-
lich-K6nigliche Geologische Reichsanstalt, on the occasion of its fif-
tieth anniversary, and to the Kéniglich Sachsischen Altertumsverein
on the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Of the several bureaus of the Smithsonian Institution the National
Museum is of most general interest, and the administration of its busi-
ness has demanded most care.

The primary object of the Museum is the acquisition, preserva-
ty

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. PAL

tion, and classification of the collections of the Institution and the Goy-
ernment, which relate to nearly every branch of human knowledge.
The placing of these, when arranged by their curators, on public exhi-
bition in such a manner as best to afford to visitors an opportunity
to acquire accurate general information concerning them may be
regarded as a necessary adjunct, and serves not only as a means of
instruction but also as a source of entertainment to the public.

The foundation of the Museum collections was the number of ethno
logical and biological objects brought to the United States more than
half a century ago by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, and the collee-
tions made by explorers for the Smithsonian Institution, to whose care
these materials and every other object of natural history were later
transferred.’ The preservation and classification of these objects was
the work of those who for a number of years had charge of the Goy-
ernment collections in the United States Patent Office, and when these
were transferred to the custody of the Smithsonian Institution and were
placed on exhibition, and as other large collections were added to the
Museum, there came gradually into existence a store of valuable objects,
which were, however, unconsecutive and not only often duplicated, but
frequently unrelated owing to the mode of their acquisition.

At the close of the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 at Philadelphia a
great number of collections, chiefly of industrial interest, became the
property of the Smithsonian Museum. For the accommodation of
these objects, a one-story building was begun in 1879 and completed in
1881, containing an area of about 80,000 square feet, and built in the
cheapest manner. This structure was so entirely inadequate to the
object for which a building of five or six stories over the same area
would have barely sufficed, that within two years from its completion
it was found to be too limited for the display of the exhibits then actually
on hand.

It was proposed as early as 1882 to provide additional quarters for
the Museum, with the object of giving accommodation also to the Geo-
logical Survey, there being a BEevieo in Lae bill, BOCRTES oe the Be

a fy henever suitable arrangements can be me, from time to time for ae recep-

States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody they may be,
shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to
receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified in the building erected for the
Institution as best to facilitate the examination and study of them; and whenever
new specimens in natural history, geology, or mineralogy are obtained for the
Museum of the Institution, by exchanges of duplicate specimens, which the Regents
may in their discretion make, or by donation, which they may receive, or other-
wise, the Regents shall cause such new specimens to be appropriately classed and
arranged.”’ (Sec. 5586, U. 8. Revised Statutes. )
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

posed building should always remain under the absolute direction of
the Regents.’

The Secretary, in his report for 1888, represented to the Regents the
insufficiency of the existing accommodations for the collections already
in the possession of the Museum, which at that time, within seven years
after the completion of the present Museum building, was already found
to be wholly inadequate. The history of the Museum since then has
been a uniform one of representations to Congress by the Regents of
the increasing insufficiency of its building and lately its intolerable
inadequacy.”

Tn 1899 the Secretary took occasion to say to the Regents:

“The nation has given an adequate house to its great collection of
books. Has not the time come to finally ask of Congress the provision
of an adequate home for this greater collection of specimens, a project
which was dear to the heart of your late colleague, Senator Morrill,
and one which he urged with almost his last breath?”

It has already been observed that by far the greater portion of the
treasures of the Museum have been acquired by Government explora-

1'The proposition was not viewed favorably by the Board, the Chancellor stating
‘‘that it was desirable that new Museum buildings should be erected in any case,
but that since by an act of Congress a certain part of the public grounds had been
set apart and appropriated absolutely and exclusively to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, he for one did not want to see anything else placed on these grounds.”’

He further said: ‘‘If the Smithsonian Institution is to grow, it will need them
all, and whatever is put upon them should be under our exclusive control.’’? (Jour-
nal Proceedings of Regents, page xv, Report 1888.)

The remarks of the Regents in discussing this proposition indicated clearly that
the view of the Chancellor had their unanimous approval.

2 A bill was introduced by Senator Morrill on June 12, 1888, for the erection of an
additional Museum building, and the measure was favorably acted upon by the
Senate, but failed in the House. On June 21 of the same year Senator Morrill moved
the provisions of the bill in the form of an amendment to the sundry civil bill for
1889, and at the following session (January 17, 1889) he again introduced this pro-
vision as an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1890.

In the Fifty-first Congress Senator Morrill again reported, from the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, the bill for a new Museum building, which bill was
passed by the Senate April 5, 1890, and not being reported in the House, was, on
June 24, 1890, as in previous sessions, again reported by Senator Morrill as an
amendment to the sundry civil bill (for 1891), which amendment was agreed to by
the Senate, but failed in conference, as before. On January 9, 1891, Mr. Milliken, of
the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, reported a bill with these same
provisions in the House and Senator Morrill again introduced it into the Senate as
an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1892. The provisions were repeated in the
bill introduced in the Fifty-second Congress by Senator Morrill, when the bill was
agreed to by the Senate, but no action was taken in the House. In the Fifty-third
Congress the same bill was introduced by Senator Morrill into the Senate, but not
reported. It was again introduced into the Fifty-fourth Congress and later as an
amendment. In the latter Congress Senator Morrill offered the identical provision
as an amendment to the sundry civil bill for 1897. This was again agreed to by the
Senate, ret failed tn the House and was eliminated in conference.

tions or by gifts from the people of the United States and foreign
countries, but while the people may take just pride in what they feel
is their own, collections gathered in this way are, as has just been
observed, not only partially duplicated or triplicated, but are at the
sume time fragmentary and lacking in that completeness that comes by
systematic work in bringing similar classes of objects together under
a well-considered system.

The filling of the gaps just alluded to can only be brought about by
the application of a purchasing fund. After repeated requests to
Congress, a small appropriation was made at the last session for the
special purpose of purchasing specimens, but the amount thus ayail-
able is so limited and the deficiencies in the present collections are so
great that it will be impracticable to add any entirely new series of
objects at present, and the fund will be devoted to filling the gaps in
existing series. It is hoped that Congress may hereafter grant larger
sums for the acquisition of specimens.

The curators of the several departments of the Museum have con-
tinued during the past year the classification and arrangement of old
and new material preparatory to its exhibition. The information gath-
ered by the curators while examining and arranging specimens has in
many cases been printed in the form of descriptive catalogues contain-
ing scientific information expressed in such untechnical language that
visitors uninformed in the subject may readily understand the collec-
tions. The Secretary has constantly had in view the importance of the
comprehensive labeling of objects placed on exhibition and he is grati-
fied that much progress has been made in this direction, the museum
having been well defined as a collection of instructive labels each illus-
trated by a well-selected specimen.

In the Appendix will be found a report giving details in regard to
Museum work during the year, with reference to many important
accessions. Mention may be made here of a few additions of special
public interest, among which are a considerable number of memorials
of the war with Spain and the Philippine insurrection. To the geo-
logical collections were added some interesting fossil animals secured
from the fields of Wyoming, and a large amount of zoological
material was collected in Cuba and Porto Rico. There has also been
transferred to the Museum the extensive and very valuable series of
vertebrate fossils collected by the late Professor Marsh during his con-
nection with the United States Geological Survey. This collection
ageregated five car-loads, and is particularly rich in specimens of the
gigantic Dinosaurs, besides fifty skulls of Titanotherium, probably the
best specimens in existence.

The general appearance of several of the Museum halls has been
improved by replacing the old wooden floors by terrazzo pavements,
and appropriation has been made for the completion of this much-
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

needed improvement. Progress has also been made in furnishing with
suitable exhibition cases the new galleries, which temporarily relieve
a part of the congestion, and some interesting collections heretofore
crowded into narrow limits have thus been less inadequately displayed,
though the general aspect may yet be said with truth to be rather that
of a storehouse than a museum.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The operations of the Bureau of American Ethnology were continued
under the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell and his efficient assistants.
The field work of the regular corps extended into Maine, New York,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indian Territory, Oklahoma, California, Ari-
zona, New Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, while
special work was done in other districts. The explorations and
researches continue to yield valuable results in the form of contri-
butions to the science of ethnology, while the collections made in con-
nection with the work form an important tributary to the National
Museum.

One of the reconnoissances of the year extended to the Antillean
islands, which are supposed by students to have lain in the pathway
of important aboriginal migrations, and data of consequence were
obtained in the course of the work.

Among the recent acquisitions of the Bureau are two aboriginal
vocabularies, both famed among students. One of these is the Trum-
bull Dictionary of the Natick (Massachusetts) Indian language, which
was conveyed to the Bureau for publication through the intervention
of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, vice-president of the American Anti-
quarian Society, the custodian of the manuscript. The other is a dic-
tionary of the Maya language, known as the Diccionario de Motul,
which has been in existence in manuscript form for centuries, and
which is finally to be published through the agency of the Bureau.

Some practical importance attaches to the recent work of the Bureau
in connection with aboriginal agriculture and crop plants. The inves-
tigation of the wild-rice industry, of the northern lake region espe-
cially, brings out a neglected phase of aboriginal industry, and at the
same time directs attention to a promising natural resource.

One of the collaborators of the Bureau was detailed to the Govern-
ment Board of the Pan-American Exposition, and made important
collections in the Philippine Islands, some of which are designed for
ultimate deposit in the Museum.

The details of the work of the Bureau are set forth fully in the
Appendix to this report.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The free interchange of Government and scientific publications
between this country and the governments and learned societies of
other lands has grown to be one of the most important functions of
the Smithsonian Institution. Great numbers of books are annually
transmitted abroad and great quantities are received in exchange each
year, the quantity handled during the past fiscal year aggregating
113,563 packages, weighing 409,991 pounds, an increase in weight of
more than one-fourth over the previous year.

These exchanges are in no sense of a commercial nature, for no
publications for sale are allowed transmission. More than one-half of
the exchanges consist of Government documents, while the other half
are publications exchanged between learned societies and men through-
outthe world. The International Exchange Bureau has salaried resident
agents in London, Leipzig, and Budapest, and a large number of agents
in various parts of the world who lend their services gratuitously. The
correspondents who more or less regularly exchange publications
through the Smithsonian Institution now aggregate 33,951, of which
7,721 are in the United States and the rest in foreign lands, extending
even to the remotest corners of the world.

The expenses of the Exchange Service were for thirty years met
entirely from the income of the Smithsonian Institution, but when
public documents began to form so large a part of the transmissions
as to become an unbearable drain on its resources, Congress began to
make appropriations for the work, and the entire service, through
international treaties, has since become chiefly (though not entirely)
dependent on annual appropriations by Congress.

Publications from societies in this country intended for trans-
mission abroad must be delivered at the Institution free of expense,
and they are transmitted to foreign societies or individuals without
charge. Packages received from abroad are distributed in this
country under frank by registered mail.

The liberal policy of the United States Government in providing for
the service is not, however, reciprocated abroad except by a few of
the smaller countries. Great Britain, Germany, and Austria have
never, while continuing the exchange service, subscribed to the
Brussels treaty,' while France and Russia have contributed very mea-

'The treaty concluded at Brussels, March 15, 1886, ratified by the President of the
United States July 19, 1888, and of which ratifications were exchanged January 14,
1889, consists of ten articles, in which it is stipulated that there shall be established
in each of the contracting States a bureau charged with the duty of exchanges, which
shall embrace the official documents, parliamentary and administrative, which are
published in the country of their origin, and works executed by order and at the

gerly toward the service. The United States, it will be observed, is
the only first-class power which became a party to it, and it may per-
haps be suggested as a not improbable reason for the abstention of such
powers as England, France, Germany, or Russia, that the treaty would
bind them to an exchange system chiefly with smaller powers who could
not return as much as they received. This is an assumption only, but
it refers to a condition which the writer was obliged to have in mind
in his attempted negotiations.

The distribution of packages after they reach Europe and other for-
eign countries is, owing to the conditions just stated, slow and uncer-
tain, except where the Institution has found it expedient to establish
and maintain agencies for promoting its own interests. The returns
from these countries, especially in the way of official documents, has
moreover always been inadequate, due mainly, it would appear, to the
lack of appreciation of the benefits to be gained thereby, but in part
also to indifference. Efforts have constantly been made by the Insti-
tution to stimulate a greater interest in the subject among foreign
countries, and representatives have been dispatched from time to time
to explain the exchange methods and solicit a more liberal participation,
but though something has been accomplished in this way, the relations
have remained until recently practically as they were in the beginning.

In 1870 Professor Henry went to England and while there testified
before an English Government scientific commission regarding the
international exchange system, as it was then constituted in the exclusive
charge of the Smithsonian Institution and carried on at its private
expense.’

Later, Secretary Baird sent Mr. George H. Boehmer, in immediate
charge of the Exchanges, to Europe on a similar errand, and twelve
years after, the present Secretary sent Mr. William C. Winlock,.
curator of the Exchanges, to Leipsic to endeavor to improve the

cations that it is able to place at the disposal of the contracting States, these several
bureaus of exchange to arrange between themselves the number of copies which they
may be able to demand and furnish; transmission shall be made direct from bureau
to bureay; each State assumes the expense of packing and transportation to the place
of destination, but when transmission shall be made by sea, special arrangements may
be made as to the share of the expense that each State shall bear for transportation;
the several bureaus shall serve in an officious capacity as intermediaries between the
learned bodies and literary and scientific societies of the contracting States for the
reception and transmission of their publications. The duties of the exchange will be
confined to the mere transmission of the works of exchanges and will not in any
manner take the initiative to bring about the establishment of reciprocai relations
among correspondents.

The governments subscribing to this treaty are the United States of America,
Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal and the Algarves, Servia, Spain, and the Swiss Con-
federation. The representative of France subscribed to the treaty, but his action was
not confirmed by the French Chambers.

exchange relations with Germany. On the occasion of Mr. Winlock’s
visit the Secretary was in Europe and called personally, with Mr.
Eustis, the American minister, on the minister of public instruction
in Paris, and secured from him a promise that he would endeavor to
obtain from the Chambers something more than the inadequate sum,
approximately $2,000, then provided for the French exchanges.

All these missions having proved only partially successful, however,
and the condition of affairs with France having grown worse rather
than better, the Secretary decided to give the matter his personal
attention in an otherwise unofficial trip he was making to Europe for
rest; a purpose with which this business interfered more than he had
anticipated.

The endeavor to improve the relations with the exchanges in Eng-
land, France and Germany commenced in the fiscal year covered by
the present report, but extended in its latter portion into the present
year. Inorder toavoid discontinuity, however, the Secretary presents
the whole subject at this time.

On the 5th of June the Secretary wrote as follows:

JUNE 5, 1900.

Str: I beg to bring to your attention a matter which has been the
subject of much correspondence between the Department of State and
the Smithsonian Institution during the past twenty years, and which
is still in a most unsatisfactory condition. I allude to the system of
international exchanges, which rests upon a treaty concluded at Brus-
eels March 15, 1886, and which was signed by the President July 19,
1888.

To this treaty some of the most important nations of Europe have
never agreed. England and Germany are not parties to it at all,
while France and Russia conformed to a previous convention on the
subject, but have never bound themselves to abide by the terms of the
treaty. This works unfairly to this country, for whereas this Gov
ernment presents one copy of every document published at the Govern-
ment Printing Office to the national or legislative libraries of foreign
countries, a most inadequate return is made; more especially from the
countries of which I speak. Representatives of the Institution have
been sent abroad on repeated occasions by my predecessors in this
office, and by me, to try to regularize our exchanges. They have all
failed, perhaps because as subordinate officers and not working with the
advice of the Department, they could not exercise a proper influence.

Complaints are frequently made through bureaus of this Govern-
ment of failures of the Exchange Service, due in reality wholly to its
inability to control the actions of foreign Governments, and these at
times are transmitted through the Department of State, which I have
accordingly had occasion to already advise that the relations which
exist with the principal foreign countries in this respect are not only
unsatisfactory, but tend to grow worse.

T should be glad to know whether the Department deems it expedi-
ent at this time to obtain the adherence of England, Germany, and
France to the Brussels treaty or to negotiate separate treaties, or
whether any other step could be suggested to bring about a result so

eminently desirable to the Government service, to the Library of
Congress, and to this Institution.

If the Department deem it expedient to take up the matter this
summer, I am prepared to go abroad without cost to the Department,
and if I could be useful by furnishing any ambassador or minister at
the posts mentioned with any detailed information he may desire I
should be very glad to put my services at its disposal.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
S. P. Lanerny, Secretary.

The SECRETARY OF STATE,

Washington, D. C.

To the above communication the following reply was received:

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, June 20, 1900.

Str: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
June 5, in which you bring to the attention of this Department the
unsatisfactory condition of the system of international exchanges
which rests upon a treaty concluded at Brussels March 15, 1886. You
state that some of the most important nations of Europe have never
agreed to this treaty, England and Germany not being parties to it at
all, while France and Russia conform to the provisions of the conven-
tion on the subject but have never bound themselves to abide by the
terms of the treaty. You point out that this works unfairly to this
country, which receives an inadequate return for the documents which
it sends out. You call attention to the failure of previous attempts
to ameliorate the existing state of things. You inquire whether or
not it seems expedient to this Department at this time to obtain the
adherence of England, Germany, and France to the provisions of the
treaty or to negotiate separate treaties, or whether or not any other
system could be suggested to bring about a result so eminently desir-
able to the Government service, to the Library of Congress, and the
Smithsonian Institution.

You state that you are about to proceed abroad, and that you would
be disposed to place your services at the disposal of the Department
for the execution of plans for the improvement of the Exchange Serv-
ice. In reply to your generous proposition I have the honor to say
that it does not seem expedient to endeavor to urge upon England,
Germany, and France adhesion to the Brussels treaty, as it is probable
that they have what appear to them sufticient reasons for not becoming
signatories to this convention. It is possible that one of their objec-
tions is that adherence to the convention would require them to furnish
complete sets of valuable publications to the smaller and less important
governments in exchange for publications which they may deem of
inconsiderable value. At all events it does not seem practicable to
endeaver to overcome their disinclination to become participants in the
arrangements of the treaty.

It is, however, eminently proper that during your contemplated
visit to Europe you should lay this matter clearly before the diplo-
matic representatives of the United States in the capitals where your
Journey may call you, and perhaps have personal conversations with
those officers of the foreign governments to which reference has been
made, who may be able to facilitate the sending of publications of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

those governments in exchange for those sent from the United States.
Such arrangements as will secure to this country the full benefits which
might be secured through the adherence of England, Germany, and
France to the Brussels tre aty may doubtless be obtained in’ this
manner, which would be found, perhaps, less objectionable to them
than a formal adherence to the convention, against which, for some
reason, they seem to entertain a prejudice.

‘I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

Joun Hay.
Hon. 8. P. Lanewry,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C.

The results of the Secretary’s labors are summarized under the head
of each country separately, as follows:

ENGLAND.

On July 18 the Secretary presented to the embassy a written state-
ment concerning the condition of exchange matters between the
United States and Great Britain, a copy of which follows:

Lonpvon, Eneiann, July 18, 1900.

Str: The Smithsonian Institution, consisting of an establishment
composed of the President of the United States, the Vice-President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the Departments, was founded by
an act of Congress in the year 1846, with functions rather general
aa local in their character, it being described in the words of the act

s ‘for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.’

ae has, as a part of these functions, at all times pr omoted the inter-
communication of literary and scientific matter between the United
States and Great Britain, as well as with other nations, and this sys-
tem of literary and scientific exchange, while officially promoted by
the Government of the United States since the first-half of the pres-
ent century, has more recently been extended by the legislation of
which I now speak.

With the approval of the Secretary of State, I have then the honor
to address you the following memoranda concerning the exchange of
official and other publications between the United States and Great
Britain, and to respectfully ask your interest in concluding a long-
needed arrangement which shall provide on the part of the British
Government for action reciprocal to that of the United States, regard-
ing, first, exchanges of official publications of the Government, | and,
second, for scientific and literar y exchanges.

MEMORANDA CONCERNING EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT BRITAIN.
1. Government exchanges.

On March 2, 1867, the following joint resolution of Congress was
approved by the President:

* Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the l nited
States of America in Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all docu-
ments hereafter printed by order of either House of C ongress, and
fifty copies additional of all documents printed in excess of the usual
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

number, together with fifty copies of each publication issued by any
department or bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal
of the Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same,
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works
published i in fore eign countries, and especially by foreion governments,
as may be deemed by said committee e an equive alent: said works to be
deposited in the Library of Congress.’

In accordance with this, the United States has since that time
presented, through the Smithsonian Institution, a complete set of
all its official publications to the British Museum, for the British
Government.

In 1886, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Servia, and Spain entered
into a convention at Brussels, to which the United States was a party,
by which they agreed to reciprocal arrangements as to the manner of
exchanging both official and liter: ary and scientific publications, as well
as to the expenses of shipment and the establishment of offices.

To this convention Great Britain did not become a party.

On October 1, 1875, the Institution addressed, through the proper
channel, a request to the English Government to arrange for an ade-
quate return on its part of its own publications for those sent by the
United States Government. Lord Derby, however, in a letter of
March 1, 1877, requested the American minister to ‘*inform Pro-
fessor Henry, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, that Her
Majesty is crateful for the offer made by the Smithsonian Institution,
but are not prepared to enter into an arrangement for the unlimited
exchange of documents suggested in his letter to you.”

Various departments and offices of the British Government have
since sent in exchange British Government publications, but only
lately in a systematic manner and in quantity that would be deemed
an equivalent for those of the United States.

In the twenty-three years which have elapsed since Lord Derby’s
letter was written the alre ady considerable sendings of the United
States Government to England have been increased more than three-
fold, and it seems now desirable that the British Government snall
(if it does not wish to become a party to the Brussels treaty) estab-
lish some suitable bureau or office charged with the duty of collecting
all publications not confidential, issued by Her Majesty’s Government,
to be transmitted to the United States in exchange for the set of pub-
lieations now forwarded to the British Museum. The Institution
has of late received British official publications from Her Majesty's
stationery office.

2. Scientific and literary exchanges.

Since its foundation the Smithsonian Institution has conducted a
system of the exchange of literary and scientific publications volun-
tarily presented by institutions or individuals in the United States to
others in Great Britain and her colonies, and reciprocally. This inter-
national system has proven itself of the greatest value to literary
and scientific men everywhere, and it has been conducted through the
established agencies and correspondents of the Institution free of cost
to such institutions and individuals in Great Britain and her colonies.

This system was formally recognized in convention in Brussels
with regard to the participation above referred to, but in this case
Great Britain has taken no steps to reciprocate.
‘ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot

Up to the present time, nevertheless, the Smithsonian Institution,
ether than interrupt this useful work, and while still acting for the
United States Government, has maintained in London an agency
transacting all the business for scientific institutions and individuals
within Great Britain that it could be expected the English Govern-
ment itself would transact.

It is desired that, in addition to the arrangement for conducting the
exchange of Government official publications above referred to, or as
a part of it, the Government of Great Britain shall establish such a
_ bureau to receive such literary and scientific exchanges within the
British Empire as the Smithsonian Institution does for “Great Britain.
within the United States, and that the British Government shall agree
to pay the cost of delivery at the port of New York or San Francisco
onall matter of this kind, the United States Government agreeing to
pay all the costs of delivery on similar matter either at the ports of
Liverpool or Southampton.

I beg to add, in anticipation of any possible inquiry, that as regards
the literary and scientific exchanges, not only are those of a mercantile
character not admitted, but that such are rarely tendered even, and
that, so far as can be oathered from an experience of somewhat over
fifty years, the great advantag es that this system offers to literary and,
scientific men are unlikely to ‘be abused.

I beg to inclose with this, for your convenience, a copy of a recent
letter from the honorable the Secretar y of State,a copy of the Brussels
treaty referred to, and a copy of the History of the Smithsonian
Exchange System between the years 1849 and 1881.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. P. LAaneciey,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The Hon. JosEpH H. CHoare,
American Ambassador to the Court of St. James,
London, England.

The ambassador, Mr. Choate, and the first secretary of the embassy,
Mr. White, used every available means to bring the matter to the
attention of the foreign office, but it was not until October 9, after
the Secretary’s return from France and Germany, that he was able to
arrange an interview with Mr. Villiers, the under secretary for foreign
affairs. In the course of this conversation, Mr. Oakes and Mr. Plow-
man, the assistant comptroller of the Secretary’s office, were called in
for consultation. Mr. Villiers and his associates seemed to doubt if
the English Government would undertake to act as a medium for the
forwarding and distribution of scientific exchanges, and stated that
the matter had already been referred to the treasury. The Secretary
represented that we did not want to involve them in an expenditure, as
they seemed to apprehend, but to have them meet us halfway, and
recognize the utility of the work which was now being carried on by
affording it an official sanction, such as our Government had already
done, thus giving to them something which they were not giving to
us. The Secretary laid stress upon the fact that we were not asking
them to enter on anything resembling the general reciprocity of the
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Brussels treaty, but to arrange for the exchange of such things with
the United States alone.

The Secretary found them disposed to hesitate as to recommending
their Government to take up the subject of the scientific exchanges,
or to undertake to furnish a complete series of its publications, embrac-
ing all such works as are published by booksellers with the aid of
grants or subscriptions from the Government.

This last provision was objected to, but it seems to be easily modifi-
able. The interview was unproductive of immediate results, but the
matter was held open for further consideration, and the Secretary
stated that it was the intention of the Institution to write more particu-
larly as to exactly what it desired, and to propose only such terms as
reciprocal justice seemed to call for.

FRANCE.

As an introduction to my efforts to bring the subject of my visit to
France before the ministry, I addressed a letter to the United States
embassy, setting forth the facts and the objects which it was my pur-
pose to accomplish. A copy of this letter follows:

JULY 28, 1900.

Str: The Smithsonian Institution, consisting of an establishment
composed of the President of the United States, the Vice-President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of departments, was founded by an
act of Congress in the year 1846, with functions rather general than
local in their character, it being described in the words of the act as
‘*for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

It has as a part of these functions at all times promoted the inter-
communication of literary and scientific matter between the United
States and France, as well as with other nations, and this system of
literary and scientific exchange, while officially promoted by the Gov-
ernment of the United States since the first half of the present century,
has more recently been extended by the legislation of which I now
speak.

With the approval of the Secretary of State, I have the honor to
address you the following memoranda concerning the exchange of
official and other publications between the United States and France,
and to specially ask your interest in concluding a long-needed arrange-
ment which shall provide, on the part of the French Government, for
action reciprocal to that of the United States concerning these two
classes, and regarding, first, exchanges of official publications of the
Government, and, second, for scientific and literary exchanges con-
ducted by the Government.

MEMORANDA CONCERNING EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE.
1. Exchange of Government publications.

On March 2, 1867, the following joint resolution was approved by
the President:

** Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That fifty copies of all doc-
uments hereafter printed by order of either House of Congress and

‘
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

fifty copies additional of all documents printed in excess of the usual
number, together with fifty copies of each publication issued by any
department or bureau of the Gs eeeincnt, be placed at the disposal
of the Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same,
through the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works
published in foreign countries, and especially by foreign governments,
as may be deemed by said committee an equivalent; said works to be
deposited in the Library of Congress.”

In accordance with this the United States has since that time presented,
through the Smithsonian Institution, a complete set of its official pub-
lications to the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, through the Bureau des
Echanges Internationaux.

In 1886, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Servia, and Spain entered
into a convention at Brussels to which the United States was a party,
by which they agreed to reciprocal arrangements as to the manner of
exchanging both official and literary and scientific publications as well
as the expenses of shipment and the establishment of offices.

To this convention France was a signatory, but did not eventually
become a party.

The French Government, however, appears to have established a
bureau, *‘des Echanges Internationaux.”

On February 8, 1879, the Smithsonian Institution addressed a request
to Baron de Vatteville, Commissionaire des Echanges Internationaux,
requesting * * * *‘not merely the special publications of some of
the scientific bureaus, but a series of everything published by the
State, as complete as that which we send, to aad the records of the
legislature of the Republic, its reports upon education, statistics, com-
merce, navigation, topographical and geological explorations, etc.”

The returns made on account of this appeal have never been satis-
factory, and while the various departments and offices of the French
Government have from time to time sent in exchange some French
Government publications, the receipts have been wholly inadequate,
being less than one-fifth of the amount sent by the United States, and
consisting of ordinary reports, with few publications of intrinsic
value.

In this connection, I beg to state that in June, 1895, accompanied
by the then American minister, Mr. Eustis, 1 visited the Ministre
de Instruction Publique et des Beaux Arts to obtain an improvement
of the International Exchange System in this particular, and also with
regard to the scientific and literary exchanges mentioned. He then
promised the American minister that he would apply to the French
Chambers for an additional grant for this bureau. He-also promised
that he would demand an act for the better doing of this aa to pro-
vide means of sending these publications more frequently, at least
every month. Healso promised that a separate set would be sent to
the library of the Institution.

I have received an official and written statement from Mr. Eustis
to the same effect.

You will see from the inclosed copy of a letter written on the part
of the minister of foreign affairs by the minister plenipotentiary on
July 29, 1895, that it is officially stated that the Ministre de ’Instruc-
tion Publique et des Beaux Arts has resolved to ask of Parliament a
**majoration” of credit for the International Exchanges, and, further
than this, that he intends to have an arrangement with the different
AO REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ministerial departments in order that everything that the Government
publishes shall be sent.

I particularly call your attention to this expression of intended offi-
cial action, which, so far as I know, has had no result.

It has been understood that this was due primarily to the wholly
inadequate appropriation of 10,000 franes, which appears to be all that
is given by the French Government for this ser vice, as compared with
120,000 frances ($24,000) appropriated by our own Government for ¢
similar service.

It seems, then, desirable that the French Government shall, if it does
not desire to become a party to the Brussels treaty, undertake to make,
through some designated channel, delivery of all its official publications
thr ough the bureau in question in exchange for the set of publications
now forwarded to the Bibliotheque Nationale.

2. Scientific and literary exchanges.

Since its foundation the Smithsonian Institution has conducted a
system for the exchange of literary and scientific publications volun-
tarily presented by institutions and individuals in the United States
to others in France and her colonies, and ree iprocally. This interna-
tional system has proved itself of the greatest value to literary and
scientific men everywhere, and it has been conducted on the part of
the United States Government by the Smithsonian Institution with
the understood cooperation of the French Government, the Institution
delivering the publications in question at the port of Havre at the
cost of the United States Government. There has, however, been
much complaint from the correspondents of the institution of the
delay of the delivery of publications forwarded from America to
France and from France to America, a delay which arises in French
territory and from causes beyond our control. The French Govern-
ment now delivers French literary and scientific publications at the
port of New York, and the naanne punctually distributes these at
its own cost.

I beg to add, in anticipation of any possible inquiry, that as regards
the literary and scientific exchanges, not only are those of a mercan-
tile character not admitted, but that such are rarely tendered even;
and that so far as can be eather ed from an experience of somewhat
over fifty years, the great adv antages that this system offers to literary
and scientific men are unlikely to ‘be abused.

I beg to inclose with this for your convenience a copy of a recent
letter from the honorable the Secretary of State, a copy of the Brus-
sels treaty referred to, and a copy ‘of History of the Smithsonian
Exchange System between the years 1849 and 1881.

T have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Henry Vienaup, Esa.,
Chargé @ Affaires, United States Embassy,
Avenue Kleber, Paris.

In spite of the good will of the embassy, the Secretary found it impos-
sible to secure an immediate interview with the minister of public
instruction, and as he did not wish to remain in Paris indefinitely he

proceeded to Germany, and upon his return to Paris in September it
was finally arranged that he should call on the representative of the
minister, as the minister himself was absent. The Secretary did so in
company with Mr. Henry Vignaud, the first secretary of the embassy,
but in the continued absence of the minister the Secretary was referred
to Monsieur Louis Liard, chief of the libraries of France, to whose
charge has recently been transferred the matter of the Exchanges,
and on whose recommendation the minister of public instruction, the
Secretary was assured, would almost certainly act.

The Secretary saw Monsieur Liard, who stated that the exchange
affairs had only recently come into his own department, and while
looking up the matter of appropriations the Secretary told him that
at a time when the French appropriation for the exchanges was
10,000 francs per annum the minister had explicitly promised him,
in the presence of the American minister, Mr. Eustis, that he would
ask the Chambers to increase the amount, instead of which, Mr. Liard
informed the Secretary, the appropriation had been reduced to 6,000
-franes. He then promised that there would be no further reduction, but,
on the contrary, that there would be an increase. The Secretary spoke
to him privately about the Smithsonian Institution, and told him the
difficulties that were experienced in France about the delay in trans-
mitting parcels to the interior, which he promised should be looked
after.

Asaresult of the conversation above noted, the Secretary believes
that there is a better prospect of an ultimate improvement in the
French exchange service than he has ever previously allowed him-
self to feel.

GERMANY.

A letter of similar tenor to that already cited to the American
ambassador at Paris was written to the United States ambassador in
Berlin, in which it was stated, however, that the United States Goy-
ernment was sending through the Smithsonian Institution six entire
sets of its publications to the German Empire, and that various depart-
ments and offices of the German Government have sent their publi-
cations in exchange, but not in quantity that would be deemed an
equivalent for those of the United States. It was further stated that
it seemed desirable that the German Government should, if it did not
wish to become a party to the Brussels treaty, establish some suitable
bureau or office, charged with the duty of collecting all publications,
not confidential, issued by the Imperial Government, or by the govern-
ments of Baden, Bavaria, Saxony, and Wiirttemberg, to be transmitted
to the United States in exchange for the six sets of publications now
forwarded to Germany for those countries.
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The embassy acknowledged the receipt of the Secretary’s letter in the
following terms:

Empassy OF THE UNITED STATES oF AMERICA,”
Berlin, July 25, 1900.

Str: Before going on leave Mr. White turned over to me your letter
of the 20th instant, the receipt of which has, I believe, already been
acknowledged. Mr. White did not, however, inform meas to what he
had written you, and now that he will not be here I do not know if it
is still your intention to come to Berlin. I therefore write to say that
I shall be here through the summer, and will gladly do anything in
my power to be of service in the matter in question. The Department
of State, under date of the 21st ultimo, had already instructed the
Embassy in regard to its assisting you.

As you are no doubt aware, German (Imperial, Prussian, Bavarian,
Saxon, Wiirttemberg, or Baden) public documents are not distributed
gratuitously as freely as are similar documents in the United States,
and that if any ministry or other similar office wishes to have more
than the limited number of such documents as are regularly placed at
its disposal it must purchase them from the publisher. You also, of
course, know that as yet Germany has no central distributing office
similar to that of the Smithsonian Institution, nor does any such oflice
exist in any of the several federated states. Moreover, I have not
heard of any intention to establish any such office or offices, and I do
not know of any central authority who (which) might be interested in
maintaining an exchange of public documents with all six of the insti-
tutions with which you now exchange. Would it not be practicable to
correspond with the heads of each of these six institutions, making
each one responsible for your receiving a proper return of the docu-
ments of the Empire or the individual State which you consider him
to represent ‘

Awaiting a further communication from you before taking any
action, I am, sir, your obedient servant,

JoHN B. JACKSON,
Chargé @ Affaires.
‘Hon. 8. P. Lane ier,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
Care of American Embassy, London.

Upon the Secretery’s arrival at Berlin he found a note at the
embassy from Mr. Herbert Putnam, the Librarian of Congress, which,
as it bears an important part in the work, is quoted in full:

Hotei BrisTou,

Berlin, August 11, 1900.
My Dear Dr. Lanetry: I brought to Berlin notes of introduction
from the German ambassador at Washington to the imperial minister
of the interior and to the Prussian Kultus-Minister and had intended

to approach these officials in the matter of international exchanges.
Learning, however, at the American embassy that you are to visit
Berlin on a similar mission, I have contented myself with the mere
delivery of my credentials, accompanying them, however, with a note,
in which I intimated the probability of your visit and urged the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

importance of your mission to the interests which I represent, includ-
ing the Congress of the United States.

I brought with me a memorandum (incomplete doubtless, yet sug-
gestive) of the German imperial and of the Prussian serial documents
issued, witha note of those now in the Library of Congress. These lists
have been left at the embassy for you to use in case they may seem cal-
culated to be of service. They may, if you think best, be left with the
authorities here. If this seem inadvisable, they will be forwarded
from the embassy to the Library of Congress. In such lists I am
careful to disclaim accuracy or completeness.

With best wishes, faithfully yours,
HerBert Putnam,
Librarian of Congress.
Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary, ete.

Upon reviewing the matter carefully with Mr. Jackson, the Secretary
was informed that there was no central authority in Germany, not
even the chancellor of the Empire, who could deal with the exchange
question. Each of the different States must be appealed to separately,
and the minor ones are jealous of any appearance of interference from
federal authorities. There seems to be positively no way to get ofli-
cial action short of the Reichstag, which could only provide the money,
but could not insure that the matter would be accepted by the sepa-
rate states any more than the action of the United States Congress in
appropriating for our exchanges can bind the separate States of the
Union.

After my interview, Mr. Jackson kindly called on an official who
represented Prince Hohenlohe in his absence. This officer, however,
could not take upon himself to make even a suggestion in the eee
of Prince Hohenlohe as to what action might be taken.

The Secretary called at the Parliament House and consulted at length
with Dr. Muller, the librarian, who agreed that the only official who
it could be even remotely hoped would do anything with regard to
exchanges would be the chancellor. The only power that could act
authoritatively is the German Parliament itself, and Dr. Muller prom-
ised to interest himself in having the matter presented before it in
November, in the hope of some effectual action.

In this connection the Secretary may state that he arrived in Berlin
at a most inopportune time to transact the business he had in hand,
inasmuch as only two out of the sixteen ministers were in the city, but
that the kindness of the embassy represented by Mr. Jackson did
everything for him that could be done under such condition.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The act of Congress establishing the National Zoological Park placed
it under the direction of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.
It occupies about 170 acres in a region along Rock Creek valley, which
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

is probably the most beautiful in its diversified natural features of any
similar park in any capital of the world. The objects of the park
have been abundantly set forth at other times. Though essentially
national and not local, it is intended to have, in connection with other
and remote national parks in the West, a representation of all our
North American animals which can be safely transported here, and it
is situated in the national capital to serve as a constant object lesson
of what Congress may do.

In addition to this, its primary function, the park receives animals
which are sent from various parts of the world by the officers of the
Army and Navy and other agents of the Government, and an extremely
limited number is added to its collection by purchase.

The present Secretary, who was instrumental in asking the interest
of Congress in originally securing the fine tract of land embraced
within the park, has taken a continued interest in personally superin-
tending the details of its embellishment, always having it as a guiding
principle in his treatment of its features to leave nature largely to
herself, and not to attempt to beautify what is already beautiful, but
to expend the means at his command in providing the necessary build-
ings for holding the collections and in making good roads which shall
make every part of this beautiful region accessible.

The extremely limited appropriations allowed by Congress have
made it almost impossible to carry out the original programme of pro-
curing a large collection of specimens of our native animals. Even
as it is, however, the collection is believed to be an extremely interest-
ing one, notwithstanding the limited means.

The present value of buildings, roadways, and other improvements
is estimated at about $150,000, and there are 839 animals, small and
great, in the collection. The Superintendent’s report, on another page,
mentions a number of improvements made during the year, including
the completion of the antelope house, new paddocks and sheds for
moose, caribou, fallow deer, and arctic foxes, fence for buffalo pad-
docks, temporary house for birds, and the continuation of the drive-
way along Rock Creek.

The western boundary of the park, for some years past unsettled
owing to the provisions of the highway act, has “been finally deter-
mined during the year. The terms of the legislation concerning this
boundary will be found in the superintendent’s report, accompanied
by an illustrative map. Its effect may be stated briefly as running an
avenue 90 feet wide through the highest portion of the land of the
park, where it is objectionable as disfiguring the landscape. It takes
away for this purpose about 46,000 square feet, and the change in-
volves the addition of 66,500 feet of lower lying and less desirable
land. So far, it is not in the interest of the park that this change
should have been made, but the legislation was not opposed, for rea-
sons of general public interest, and also because, if any avenue was to

‘

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

be here, it had better be of this width to move back the buildings
which will doubtless eventually be placed here, so that they may not
immediately dominate that portion of the park which was especially
intended to be secluded.

By act of Congress, March 3, 1899, provision was made for widening
the Adams Mill road entrance to the park and placing under the con-
trol of the park, not only the portion of the road within the park, but
that exterior to it. As regards the portion exterior to the park, its
control as a residential street presented serious difficulties, and the
Secretary was willing to see this part placed by subsequent legislation
under the control of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia.

As a result of the circular sent abroad to officers of the United
States, mentioned in the last report of the Secretary, the Zoological
Park has secured some valuable additions and has arranged for future
acquisitions. An account of these will be found in the report of the
superintendent.

Among the imperative needs of the park are a suitable bird and
reptile house, a house for small mammals, and a building for the
aquarium.

Earnest efforts have been made to obtain from Alaska one or more
specimens of the great Kodiak bear, but so far without success, and
unless Congress furnish means to do so within a very brief time, this,

the largest carnivorous animal of the world, will become extinct.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

It is gratifying to be able to state that the first and long-delayed
volume of Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory is now about to be
issued. This volume is devoted primarily, though not exclusively, to
the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum, its absorption lines,
and its variations in terrestrial absorption. This research, and the
development of the sensitive bolographic apparatus with y, aich it has
been carried on, have largely occupied the Astrophysical Observatory
since its foundation, and are a continuation of researches in which the
writer was engaged for many years at the Allegheny Observatory.
The high degree of sensitiveness and accuracy which have now been
reached in the bolometric apparatus of the Astrophysical Observatory,
and the still greater progress in this direction which, as will be seen
in the detailed report of the aid acting in charge, is now being
achieved, place the Observatory in a position to enter new fields
of work from which it has hitherto been barred by the lack of sufti-
ciently sensitive appliances.

At the close of last year an application was made to Congress for a
special appropriation to observe the total solar eclipse of May 28,
1900, in this country.
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In view of the fact that the Observatory possessed a considerable
quantity of apparatus which could be usefully employed in the expe-
dition, and that the money could be chiefly allotted to the direct obser-
vations, the amount asked for was only $4,000, and this, which was
granted by Congress, has been found, with strict economy, to be
sufficient.

The appropriation was made on February 9, and preparations were
immediately commenced for a rehearsal of the actual observations,
which were to take place later. In doing this the Institution, which
had borrowed, through the great kindness of Prof. E. C. Pickering,
Director of the Harvard University Observatory, an achromatic lens of
12 inches aperture and 135 feet focus, installed this with numerous other
pieces of apparatus in the open space immediately south and west of
the Astrophysical Observatory, and all the material of the future

_camp was placed in position there and the observers accustomed to
such portions of the work as could be undertaken in rehearsal.

The chief object of the expedition was intended to be the securing
of a number of photographs of the corona on different scales, and
especially on the unprecedentedly large scale afforded by the lunar
image of the 135-foot lens, which was about 15 inches in diameter.
This lens was, of course, placed so as to direct its beams horizontally,
the light being fed into it by a ‘‘coelostat,” the only considerable instru-
ment ordered specially for the expedition.

A lens of 5 inches aperture and 38 feet focus, kindly lent by Pro-
fessor Young, of Princeton, was placed in position to point at the sun,
and the equatorial portion of the coelostat was made to carry a photo-
graphic telescope of 6 inches aperture and 7 feet focus for obtaining
photographs of the portion of the corona near the sun. In addition
to this, special preparation was made for a photographic search for
intramercurial planets, which will be described later.

The question of the heat of the inner corona is an interesting one,
about which testimony differs, for although numerous attempts have
been made to measure it, they have been insufficient to give assurances
of any positive result having been reached, particularly as some of them
have been in comparatively inexperienced hands. The task of secur-
ing some authentic record of this with the bolometer the Secretary
assigned to Mr. C. G. Abbot, who has had long experience in the
use of the instrument and who was liberally supplied with every
accessory that could be transported to the field, includiny the great
siderostat made by Grubb, which alone weighs many thousand pounds.

It had at first been intended to establish the camp at Winton, North
Carolina, but after anxious consideration, Wadesboro, in the same
State, was substituted, and Mr. Abbot, with some of his immediate
assistants, and all the heavier apparatus, left for that place on the
3d of May. Owing to the kindness of the United States Coast and

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

Geodetic Suryey, Mr. G. R. Putnam was detailed to make the requi-
site determinations of latitude and longitude and also to determine the
position of the great horizontal telescope and the like accessory fea-
tures, and most acceptable service was rendered by him.

So full an account of the eclipse is given in Mr. Abbot’s report that
itis only necessary to say here that the observations were almost
uniformly successful. A considerable number of photographs of the
corona were secured, some of which are upon an unprecedentedly
large scale, and these, it is believed, will be of value in investiga-
tions of the nature of this still enigmatical solar appendage. A
photographic search for hitherto unrecognized objects near the sun
developed the fact that even in an ordinary sky, in an eclipse in which
the reflected sunlight was brighter than usual, stars as small as the
8.3 magnitude could be secured.

The apparatus was designed not so much for this, however, as for
the obtaining evidence of possible intramercurial plarets, but upon
this latter point we have not yet obtained any certainty. Certain Sus-
picious objects are found on the plates, but unfortunately observa-
tions of the same kind at other stations were unsuccessful, so that
there is nothing with which to compare them. Studies are still going
on, however, and it is possible that this part of the observations may
yet yield results of interest.

The delicate and difficult observations upon the heat of the inner
corona were made by means of the bolometer, and appear to have
been quite successful, being perhaps the first trustworthy observations
of the kind; and, as will be seen in the more detailed report, these
lend some additional weight to the view that the corona is something
analogous to an electric phenomenon.

WILLIAM PRESTON JOHNSTON. »

Ata meeting of the Regents on January 24, 1900, Dr. Angell sub-
mitted the following minute to go upon the records in regard to the
death of William Preston Johnston, president of Tulane Univ ersity:

President Johnston died at Lexington, Virginia, on July 16, 1899;
in the sixty-ninth year of his age. He was born in Louisy ille, Ken-
tucky, January 5, 1831. His father, the distinguished officer, Gen-
eral Albert Sidney Johnston, was of New Engl: und descent; his mother
‘was of the Preston family, long conspicuous in Virginia and Ken-
tucky. Our late colleague, ‘while a student in school and college, gave
promise of his future eminence. After graduation at Yale Colleg e he
studied law and entered on the practice e of his profession at Louisville.
But his dominant taste even then was for letters rather than for law.
On the outbreak of the civil war, like his father, he entered the
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Southern army. Most of his service was rendered on staff duty, and
was regarded by his superiors as of the highest value.

Soon after General Lee was called to the presidency of Washington
and Lee University, he assigned to Mr. Johnston the chair of litera-
ture and history in that institution. The duties were most congenial
to him, and with marked success he held the position for ten years.
While there he wrote the well-known biog graphy of his father.

In 1880 he was called to the presidency “of the University of Louisi-
ana at Baton Rouge. With characteristic vigor he set about the task
of lifting it from its apparently moribund condition. When in 1883
Paul Tulane set apart a most generous sum for the endowment of the
institution which now bears his name, Colonel Johnston was asked to
organize the new university. With much tact and wisdom, he, with
others, made a successtul endeavor to merge the State U niversity and
the Tulane Univ ersity in one institution, over which he presided with
signal efficiency to the day of his death. Tulane University comprises
several departme nts, and holds a most conspicuous position among
the universities of the South. It is the general verdict of those most
familiar with its history that its success has been largely, if not mainly,
due to the wisdom, learning, and influence of our lamented colleague.

President Johnston was not only a successful administrator, but he
was also a writer of decided literary merit. His essays on literary
subjects and his occasional addresses are of a high type of excellence.
He has also printed at least two volumes of poems that breathe the
deeply religious spirit which was one of the marked characteristics of
the author.

President Johnston was held in the highest esteem by all who knew
him on account of his dignity, sincerity, and elevation of spirit.

For several years past ‘he has had to contend in the discharge of his
important official duties with a serious bronchial affection which was
very debilitating. But his fidelity to his trusts and his invincible
energy held him firmly at his post until the end of his days.

He was deeply interested in the work of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. We wish hereby to record the expression of our sense of the
great loss we have sustained in his death.

The following resolutions were then adopted by the Board:

Wuereas the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are called upon
to mourn the death, on July 16, 1899, of William Preston Johnston,
| Wi Dia Bs pees of Tulane Univ ersity, and a member of this board
since 1892,

Be it resolve d, That the Regents desire to place on record an expres-
sion of their sense of the gr eat. loss they have suffered in the decease
of their esteemed colleague, their high appreciation of his profound
scholarship and literary “eifts, of his wise and conspicuous influence
in the promotion of sound lear ning, of his brilliant and useful career
as a teacher and as an administrator of universities, of his sincere
devotion to the interests of this Institution, and of his pure and noble
character, which commanded the respect and affection of all who knew
him.

Resolved, That these resolutions be placed upon the records of the
Institution, that a copy be communicated to the family of President
Johnston, and that we, the Regents, convey the assurance of deep
sympathy with them in their affliction.

GARRET A. HOBART,

Regent of the Smithsonian Institution. Born 1844, died 1899.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49
GARRET A. HOBART.

At the same meeting of the Regents Senator Platt announced the
death on November 21, 1899, of Vice-President Garret A. Hobart, a
Regent of the istinatiod: and said:

As an associate and friend of the deceased Vice-President, Garret A.
Hobart, I wish to speak briefly of him and of his life.

He was taken away from us, from the country which honored him
and which he greatly honored, in the prime of his manhood and the
height of his usefulness. Though born without the accessory of for-
tune, his ancestry was of the best and his blood the purest. A poor
boy, "facing the world alone, he wrought out a career indeed enviable,
furnishing one more of the many examples of what a boy may become
in the estimation of all under our republican institutions. He pos-
sessed ina large degree the only ambition worth cherishing—the ambi-
tion to make the most of himself, that he might be most useful. Like
other self-made men, he struggled for an ‘education and fora place
among his fellow-men. Nature endowed him with its most generous
gifts—sagacity, manly force, cordiality, charity, intellectual and moral
attributes. Few men have possessed i in a greater degree the capacity
to make and retain friends, ready to serve him and to promote and
advance his purposes.

It is often said that to sueceed one must make enemies. Garret A.
Hobart was an exception to this rule. He had no enemies, but ‘** troops
of friends.” Of him it can be said more truly than of anyone I have
ever known—

None knew thee but to love thee
Nor named thee but to praise.

Office and honor sought him more than he sought them. He brought
to the office of Vice-President a new dignity and new usefulness. He
achieved wealth only to bestow the blessings which wealth gives the
opportunity to scatter. In the life of such a man we are all ennobled;
in his death we are all bereaved.

He seems like one lent to our social, political, and business life as
an uplifting force and as an example to be emulated. Such men do
not really die; they live, because they have impressed themselves upon
the history of their age.

I think it most proper that resolutions expressing our unstinted
admiration of our departed associate should be placed upon the rec-
ords, and that we communicate to his widow and family our most
sincere and heartfelt sympathy.

The following resolutions were adopted by the Board:

Resolved, That in the death of Garret A. Hobart, Vice-President of
the United States, and ex officio a member of the Board of Regents,
the Institution has sustained a severe loss and the members of the
Board a personal bereavement.

Lesolved, That we desire to place on record our appreciation of his
services as « Regent of the Smithsonian Institution and our tribute of
regard for his personal character and worth, as well as our intense
sympathy for his widow and family, to whom his loss is most irrepara-
ble. Mr. Hobart was a man of rarest quality, a typical and thorough

American, successful in all that he undertook, characteristically of a
broad and generous nature, a self-made man in the best sense of the

United States most loved and honored and most conspicuous in the dis-
charge of official duties, enjoying the friendship of the President, of
the Senate, of all with whom he associated, and of the people of the
United States. While we mourn his loss we admire his life and his
character.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sm: I have the honor to report as follows regarding the condition and operations
of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1900:

Organization and staff.—The organization of the Museum remains the same as
during the past two years, comprising, beside the administrative offices, three scien-
tific departments—anthropology, biology, and geology, each in charge of a head
curator and each composed of several divisions, anthropology having 8, biology 9,
and geology 3. There are also 17 minor divisions, known as sections.

The scientific staff at the close of the year consisted of 3 head curators, 17 curators,
13 assistant curators, 15 custodians, 11 aids, 4 associates, and 1 collaborator, a total
of 64 persons, but of these only 33 were under pay from the Museum, the remainder,
nearly one-half of the scientific personnel, serving as volunteers or in an honorary
capacity. —

The executive office continued in the immediate charge of the Executive Curator,
Dr. Frederick W. True, the Assistant Secretary exercising only a general supervision
over the work, under the direction of the Secretary, who is the keeper ex officio of
the Museum.

But few changes occurred in connection with the scientific staff. In the death of
Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing on April 10, 1900, the Museum, as well as the Bureau
of Ethnology, lost one of its most active and distinguished workers, whose services
with the Institution began nearly a quarter of a century ago. Medical Director
James M. Flint, U.S. N., under whose charge the Division of Materia Medica was
established in 1881, and who has been its Honorary Curator under detail by the
Secretary of the Navy for three separate periods, aggregating about thirteen years, was
placed on the retired list of the Navy in February, 1900. Proposing to continue his
residence in Washington, however, Dr. Flint has volunteered his further services in
the same capacity, and they have been gladly accepted. Mr. W.R. Maxon was
appointed an aid in the Division of Plants in November, 1899.

Buildings.—The collections, laboratories, and offices are mainly provided for in the
Museum and Smithsonian buildings, but the workshops are now housed in separate
structures, two on the Smithsonian grounds and three in rented quarters south of B
street S.W. A largeamount of material still remains in storage in the large sheds on
Ninth street and on Armory Square because of the lack of accommodations.

The need for additional quarters, which was long ago evident, has now become so
urgent that unless relief is soon obtained it will be difficult to properly administer
the affairs of the Museum or to fulfill its most important function as the custodian of
all material objects resulting from Government explorations. Under the conditions
as they now exist, some of the most valuable of the collections have to be kept in
insecure buildings in the shipping cases in which they were received; they can not
be arranged, classified, and made available to investigators as the law provides; the
exhibition halls are overcrowded, preventing that enlargement in the display series
which the public is led to expect; and the laboratory accommodations are greatly
cramped, besides being in most cases very poorly adapted to their purpose.

51
52. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The only noteworthy building alterations during the year were the substitution of
a terrazzo payement for wood in two of the halls and the flooring over one of the
ranges, so as to obtain a second-story room for laboratory use by the Divisions of Mam-
mals and Plants. The furniture acquired consisted of 40 exhibition cases and 250
storage cases, many of these being for the new galleries built during the preceding
year.

Collections.—The increase in the collections has amounted to 206,617 specimens,
bringing the total number now in the Museum up to 4,819,836. The additions, com-
prised in 1,467 different lots or accessions, represent the results of Government and
other explorations, gifts, exchanges, purchases, and deposits.

The acquisitions by the Department of Anthropology have been especially numerous
and important. Admiral Dewey has presented two antique brass cannon from the
Spanish armament captured at Manila, and among other historical contributions have
been the following: Many objects relating to the Spanish-American war, including
uniforms, small arms, and cannon, from the Navy Department; military and personal
relics of the Ord family, from Lieut. James T. Ord, U. 8. A.; personal relics of Gen.
Thomas Sword, from Miss E. H. Cotheal; a collection of cuttings from 33 flags of
historic interest, from the Library of Congress; a series of autograph letters of men
prominent in the civil war, from Mrs. L. O. Mason, and additions to the deposits of
the Society of Colonial Dames and the Daughters of the American Revolution.

During the cruise of the U. 8. Fish Commission steamer Albatross among the islands
of the South Pacific Ocean, Mr. C. H. Townsend and Mr. H. F. Moore kindly gave
attention on behalf of the Museum to the utensils and costumes of the natives, of
which they secured a large collection. Many relics of the ancient peoples of Cuba
and Jamaica were obtained by Maj. J. W. Powell and Mr. W. H. Holmes during a
visit to those islands, and Dr. Walter Hough brought back from Mexico an interesting
ethno-botanical collection, including many plants used in the native arts, ancient and
modern, specimens of native handiwork, and a series of photographs.

The Hon. Perry M. de Leon, United States consul-general at Guayaquil, presented
two ancient stone chairs from Ecuador, which, with other chairs surrounding a large
stone table, were found in what appeared to be an ancient council chamber, brought
to light about thirty years ago by the action of a freshet. A mummy from the
valley of Cuzco, Peru, was contributed by Dr. C. H. Russell, U. 8. N., of the U. 8. S.
Newark, and a collection of weapons of Australian aborigines, by the Hon. F. W.
Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New South Wales.

The Bureau of Ethnology has transmitted a collection of Indian skulls and other
ethnological material obtained by Prof. J. B. Hatcher in Tierra del Fuego, Patago-
nia; aseries of copper implements from Houghton County, Michigan; many stone
implements from the West Indies, and a collection of baskets of the Washoe Indians.
A collection of stone implements was deposited by Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grove-
town, Georgia, and a collection of vases by the Grueby-Faience Company, of Boston,
Massachusetts.

The following were obtained by purchase: A large series of objects illustrating the
arts of the peoples of the Congo Valley of Africa, from the Rev. Samuel Phillips
Verner, and a collection of ethnological specimens from the tribes of Angola, Africa,
from the Rey. W. P. Dodson.

In the Department of Biology practically every branch has received additions of
greater or less value. Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose explorations have enriched the
Museum for many years, presented a large and important collection of zoological and
ethnological material from the Malay Archipelago and other eastern localities, including
Trong, Lower Siam, and Singapore, the zoological specimens comprising mammals,
birds, batrachians, insects, and other groups of invertebrates.

From the Harriman Alaskan Expedition of 1899 the Museum has received the
collections made in three groups, as follows: The birds by Mr. Robert Ridgway, the

os
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Den

mollusks by Dr. William H. Dall, and the insects by Mr. Trevor Kincaid, of Seattle.
The collection of insects is supposed to be the most complete one for Alaska that has
yet been obtained, and was presented to the Museum by Mr. Harriman.

Extensive additions have been made to the collection of bats from Trinidad, Bar-
bados, Cuba, and the Philippine Islands by Mr. E. T. Giers, Mr. P. Donough, Lieut.
J. W. Daniel, jr., and Mr. L. M. McCormick. <A skeleton of the recently discovered
marsupial mole, Notoryctes, was received from University College, Dundee; an Afri-
ean rhinoceros was presented by the Forepaugh & Sells Brothers Menagerie, and
many European mammals were acquired by purchase.

The Division of Birds has received the Goodfellow collection of humming birds,
comprising about 1,200 specimens; 300 specimens of the birds of the United States of
Colombia, from Mr. Outram Bangs; 500 specimens of Hawaiian birds, from Mr. H. W.
Henshaw; a specimen of the Cuban Macaw (Ara tricolor), now believed to be extinct,
from Maj. W. A. Glassford, U. 8. A., and a skeleton of the rare Harris’s Cormorant,
from Leland Stanford Junior University.

Of fishes Dr. David 8. Jordan has contributed a collection from Japan, including
the types of 14 new species; the Museo Civico of Milan, Italy, a collection from the
Red Sea and the Mediterranean; and the U.S. Fish Commission, specimens from
Japan, Alaska, Hawaii, and California.

Many additions have been made to the Division of Insects, some of the most note-
worthy being the following: The very important collection of spiders brought
together by the late George Marx, containing several thousand specimens, among
which were many types and cotypes; a large collection of Coleoptera from the late
Hugo Soltau, of Louisville, Kentucky; many types and cotypes of species described
by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell, received from the New Mexico Agricultural Experiment
Station; a series of insects collected in Porto Rico by Mr. August Busck, from the
Department of Agriculture, and collections of Mexican Hymenoptera and South
American Lepidoptera, obtained by purchase. Mr. E. A. Schwarz has continued to
make important additions to the Hubbard and Schwarz collection of Coleoptera,
presented to the Museum in 1898.

The Division of Mollusks has been enriched by collections made in Samoa by Sir
Charles Eliot, the British representative on the Samoan Commission, and in Alaska
and Hawaii by Dr. William H. Dall and others; by a series of South Australian
shells received from Mr. Walter B. Reed, of Adelaide, and by a valuable lot of land
shells from the Galapagos Islands, presented by the Leland Stanford Junior Uni-
versity. Through the addition last mentioned the National Museum is supposed
to have acquired the most complete representation of Galapagos land shells now
existing.

The more important acquisitions among the other groups of marine invertebrates
have been as follows: From Dr. J. C. Branner, the crustaceans collected on the Bra-
zilian coast by the Agassiz-Branner expedition of 1899; from Mr. H. W. Henshaw,
Hawaiian crustaceans; from the U. 8. Fish Commission, crustaceans and corals from
Porto Rico; from the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, crusta-
ceans from Texas and Mexico; from Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, cotypes of an isopod
crustacean from Izels Cave, Texas; from Dr. C. A. Kofoid, cotypes of a new genus
of Volvocide; from Rey. George W. Taylor, of Nanaimo, British Columbia, cotypes
of two species of British Columbia sponges.

The Herbarium is constantly in receipt of material from all parts of the world.
Its most important addition last year was the private collection of plants belonging
to Dr. Charles Mohr, of Mobile, Alabama, which he has generously presented to the
Institution. This contribution, comprising upward of 3,000 specimens from the
Southern States, is of especial value, as this region has heretofore been poorly repre-
sented in the National Museum. Mrs. Marie de Chalmot, of Holcomb Rock, Vir-
ginia, has donated 3,000 specimens of European and American plants, and Mr. A. H.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Curtiss, of Jacksonville, Florida, 1,100 specimens from the United States. Dr. J. N.
Rose made a large collection of plants on his expedition to Mexico during the early
part of the year, as mentioned elsewhere. The Department of Agriculture has trans-
mitted 2,500 plants collected in Alaska by Mr. F. V. Coville and Mr. T. H. Kearney;
807 plants collected in the State of Washington by Mr. Kirk Whitead, and 2,300
plants collected in Virginia and North Carolina by Mr. T. H. Kearney. Four hun-
dred and thirteen plants from Oregon have been received from the U. 8. Geological
Survey.

The principal addition to the Department of Geology was the extensive and unique
collection of vertebrate fossils made for the U. 8. Geological Survey by, or under the
direction of, the late Prof. O. C. Marsh, and which was in the possession of the latter
at Yale University at the time of his death, in 1899. A part of this collection, com-
prising two carloads, had been transferred to the Museum several years before. The
remainder, filling 600 boxes and requiring 5 cars for its transportation, was received
during the past year. This collection is the most important of its kind ever brought
together, being exceedingly rich in large Dinosaurs, especially of the genera Tricera-
tops and Stegosaurus. Of Titanotherium there are nearly 50 complete skulls. Forty
or more species of Dinosaurs and of Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary mammals are
represented by type specimens.

A nearly complete femur of a large Dinosaur, a fine specimen of the fossil gar
(Lepidosteus atrox) , aseries of Mesozoic invertebrate fossils, and many lithological speci-
mens were obtained in Wyoming by Mr. Charles Schuchert, and an interesting series
of cycads was collected in the same State by Prof. Lester F. Ward and Mr. Schuchert.

A fine skull of an Elotherium and another of a Diceratherium were obtained by
purchase; a series of Jurassic fishes, recently described by Mr. C. R. Eastman, was
transmitted by the Geological Survey, and a well-preserved specimen of fossil gar
( Lepidosteus simplex) was secured through exchange from the Glen Island Museum,
New York.

An important collection of Texas Jurassic invertebrate fossils, described by Prof.
F. W. Cragin, was received from the Geological Survey; a large number of Lower
Helderberg fossils from New York, containing several new species, were obtained
from Mr. John M. Clarke, and many Guelph (Upper Silurian) fossils were acquired
by purchase.

A series of specimens showing the twenty stages in development of the Cambrian
trilobite (Sao hirsuta) was received in exchange from the National Museum at Prag,
Bohemia, through Dr. Anton Fritsch, and a restoration by. Prof. C. E. Beecher of
the fossil Crustacean, Stylonurus, from Yale University.

Many fossil corals were presented by the Hon. Delos Arnold, Prof. J. C. Merriam,
Mr. T. W. Vaughan, and Mr. J. A. Singley, and a specimen of the rare echinoid
Oligoporus nobilis was donated by Mr. W. L. Woods.

Collections of Cambrian brachiopods, of Rocky Mountain, Ordovician, Silurian, and
Devonian fossils, and of fossil plants from a number of localities, as well as about
2,000 rock specimens representing areas recently examined by the Survey, including
the Little Belt Mountains, the Uvalde, Anthracite and Crested Butte, and Big Trees
quadrangles, and the’Silver Cliff and Rosita districts of Colorado, were transferred
by the Geological Survey to the keeping of the Museum.

A meteorite weighing about 64 pounds, which fell at Allegan, Michigan, on July
10, 1899, was purchased, and other meteorites were secured by exchange from the
following localities: Jerome, Gove County, Kansas; Bishopville, South Carolina;
Indarka, Augustinowka, and Bischtube in Russia; Lissa, Bohemia, and Schénenberg
in Bavaria.

A large number of specimens of voleanic material collected in Hawaii by Prof.
C. H. Hitchcock, and a series of orbicular granites from Finland, Sweden, and
Rhode Island were added to the collections.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

Prof. C. U. Shepard, of Summerville, South Carolina, has deposited the private
collection of minerals which had belonged to his father, containing about 5,000 speci-
‘mens, some of which are very choice. This collection was accompanied by a number
of books, pamphlets, and manuscript notes.

Three fine opals have been added to the gem collection, and three Japanese beryls
have been cut from rough specimens belonging to the Museum.

Explorations.—Although having very limited means for field investigations, at least
afew members of the scientific staff spend a month or more during every year in
adding to the collections, making their trips independently or in connection with
expeditions sent out by other Government bureaus or under private auspices. Much
important material is obtained in this way.

Dr. F. W. True spent several weeks of the summer of 1899 at the station of the
Cabot Steam Whaling Company, in Newfoundland, studying the finback and hump-
back whales, which are the objects of the fishery in that locality. Anthropological
researches were carried on in Cuba and Jamaica during the spring of 1900 by Maj.
J. W. Powell and Mr. W. H. Holmes. Extensive zoological and botanical collec-
tions were made in Cuba and Porto Rico for the Pan-American Exposition by Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Charles W. Richmond, Mr. William Palmer, and Mr. J. H.
Riley, of the Museum staff. The Philippine Islands were visited by Col. H. H.
Hilder, of the Bureau of American Ethnology, in the interests of the same exposition.

_ The expedition to Mexico by Dr. J. N. Rose and Dr. Walter Hough, which started
in the spring of 1899, as noted in the last report, continued during a part of the sum-
mer and was very successful. Its object was the collection of both botanical and
ethno-botanical specimens. At the close of the year Mr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., was
in Venezuela, haying been detailed to accompany Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A.,
for the purpose of making collections of the higher vertebrates.

During the summer of 1899 Mr. Charles Schuchert accompanied an expedition
under the auspices of the Union Pacific Railroad Company to the fossil beds of
Wyoming, and he was also associated with Prof. Lester F. Ward in an examination
of the region in Wyoming where fossil cycads abound.

On the Harriman expedition to Alaska, which was absent during June and July,
1899, the National Museum was represented by Dr. William H. Dall, Mr. Robert
Ridgway, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and Mr. F. V. Coville. Before returning to Wash-
ington Dr. Dall visited Hawaii for the purpose of studying its molluscan fauna.

The Government explorations which contribute most constantly and most exten-
sively to the Museum are those conducted by the Geological Survey, the Fish Com-
mission, and the scientific bureaus of the Department of Agriculture, in all of which
there was much activity during the past year. The cruise of the Fish Commission
steamer Albatross to the South Pacific Ocean offered an opportunity for securing eth-
nological objects from many interesting islands, and, through the courtesy of the
Commissioner, two of the naturalists attached to the expedition, Mr. C. H. Townsend
and Mr. H. F. Moore, were authorized to collect in this field.

Exchanges.—The exchange of duplicate specimens as a means of acquiring new
material for its collections, authorized by the fundamental act establishing the Insti-
tution, has been carried on from the beginning and with much profit. The exchange
may have reference to any number of specimens from one upward, and may be
conducted with an individual, a museum of natural history, or any other character
of establishment, provided, only, that a proper equivalent be sent in return. The
domestic exchanges were many during the past year, though none was of large extent.
The parties to exchanges from abroad were as follows: Great Britain—the British
Museum of Natural History at London, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, Uni-
versity College at Dundee, the Horniman Museum at London, Mr. G. E. Mason, of
Fulham, and Mr, E. Lovett, of Croydon; France—the Museum of Natural History at
Paris, and Mr. Jean Miguel, of Barrubio, Hérault; Germany—the Royal Zoological

Museum at Dresden, the Royal Botanical Museum at Berlin, and the Geological-
Paleontological Institute at Munich; Bohemia—the National Museum at Prag, and
Dr. K. Urba, of the same city; Italy—the museums of Natural History at Milan and
Genoa, and Dr. Paolo Magretti, of Milan; Switzerland—Mr. Paul Narbel, of Cour
Lausanne; Belgium—Baron R. de Vriére, of Phem, Zedelghem; Denmark—Dr. E.
Warming, of the University of Copenhagen; Sweden—Prof. A. M. Fries, of Upsala;
Russia—M. Melnikof, of St. Petersburg; India—the Indian Museum and the Royal
Botanical Garden at Calcutta; South Africa—the Botanical Gardens at Durban, Natal;
New Zealand—Canterbury Museum at Christchurch and the Public Museum at Wan-
ganui; Australia—Mr. F. H. McK.Grant, at Melbourne, Victoria; Canada—Mr. Eugene
Coubeaux, of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; Mexico—the National Museum in the
City of Mexico; Brazil—the Museo Paulista at Sao Paulo.

Installation.—Very considerable progress has been made in the work of installa-
tion, which comprises, besides the placing of specimens on exhibition, the arrange-
ment of the reserve or study series and the packing away in storage of such material
as can not be provided for in the overcrowded Museum and Smithsonian buildings.
There is now on hand so large an amount of this material as to entirely fill a number
of outside storehouses, and the quantity is being constantly increased. During the
year it was thoroughly overhauled, the packing cases were relabeled as to their con-
tents and sytematically arranged, and a complete catalogue was prepared to facili-
tate the finding of collections as desired. Among these stores are hidden away many
thousands of valuable and interesting specimens, liable at any time to destruction by
fire and pests—a silent but forcible reminder of the necessity for a new Museum
building.

That part of the installation which interests the general public receives naturally
the greatest amount of attention and involves by far the greatest expenditure of money.
The exhibition cases must present a finished and artistic appearance; the collections,
selected with due reference to the instruction of the visitor, must be suitably pre-
pared and tastefully mounted, and each specimen, each grouping of specimens, and
each case must have a label, tersely worded and easily decipherable. The reorgan-
ization of the exhibition halls is rapidly progressing. Some are being newly fitted
up, while in others there is simply such a rearrangement, more or less extensive, as
may be deemed necessary or as the circumstances permit. The lack of means to
provide sufficient cases of a suitable character, however, interposes a serious difficulty
in carrying on this work. A large proportion of the cases now in use are of anti-
quated pattern, and not adapted to modern methods of installation. Very many
have been defaced or worn-out in connection with the different expositions, and
until these can be replaced there must be much incongruity in the appearance of the
exhibition halls.

Among the things accomplished in this direction by the Department of Anthro-
pology has been the arrangement of the ceramic collection in a handsome, new, ebon-
ized case, which extends around the entire gallery of the Northeast Court, producing
one of the most attractive features in the Museum. The extensive basketry collec-
tion and the ethnological exhibits illustrative of Latin America have been installed
in the corresponding gallery of the Northwest Court. The exhibits in the West North
Range, which contains the Indian groups and the Catlin paintings, have been as
nearly completed as is now possible, and many additions and improvements have
been made in connection with the exhibits of American History, the Graphic Arts,
Land Transportation, and Materia Medica. No changes have been made in the large
hall so long occupied by the Division of Prehistoric Archzology, nor does any
rearrangement there seem advisable until means shall be provided for a thorough
renovation of the room, which is now in every respect quite unpresentable.

For the Department of Biology one large wall-case has been built along the east
side of the South Hall, to receive the specimens of North American carnivores, and

a a ar al
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

the installation in this hall has been otherwise much improved. The Southeast
Range has been cleared of storage, and entirely assigned to the exhibition of reptiles
and fishes, of which a partial display is now in place. The rearrangement of the
bird collection has been nearly completed, and a system of lighting the central dark
cases by means of electric lamps has been devised.

The condition of both the exhibition and reserve collections in the Department of
Geology has been greatly improved, and, except as to labeling, many parts of the
display series are now in a practically finished state.. The two galleries in the south-
ern ranges have been fitted up as storerooms and laboratories for the Divisions of
Paleobotany and Vertebrate Paleontology, the collections of which have been trans-
ferred to the racks and drawers provided for the purpose. Much of the activity of
the Department of Geology has been directed toward unpacking and arranging the
Marsh Collection of vertebrate fossils, to which reference is made elsewhere.

Public benefits —While the principal function of the Museum is to care for and
classify the Government collections, it is best known to the public through its educa-
tional features and as a place where information may be sought on many scientific
topics. Being one of the chief points of interest at the national capital, it is visited
by large numbers of persons from all parts of the country, the annual attendance
during the past twenty years haying averaged about 220,000, though in years of
Presidential inauguration it has sometimes exceeded 300,000. During the past year
the number recorded was above 225,000.

In the matter of supplying information the Museum is called upon from all parts
of the country and to some extent from abroad. Specimens are sent to it for identifi-
cation and analysis, and inquiries are received bearing upon every subject coming
within its scope, as well as upon many with which it has no relation. Every com-
munication is answered, and so far as possible the writer’s wishes are complied with,
though requests for chemical analyses can not be met, as the Museum is not equipped
for work of that character. Over 700 lots of objects were received for examination
during the year, while of letters asking information there was an average of not less
than 100 weekly. As will be realized, the time of both the scientific and the clerical
staff was heavily drawn upon in preparing the necessary replies.

A number of students have been given facilities and allowed the use of collections
for carrying on researches at the Museum, and a large amount of material has been
sent to specialists in different parts of the country and abroad for working up. While
the latter has mainly been done under agreement to prepare reports for the use of
the Museum, yet specimens are constantly being lent to institutions and individuals
to aid in investigations conducted in their own behalf.

The distribution of duplicate specimens among educational establishments through-
out the United States has come to be regarded as one of the important features in the
work of the Museum. It can only be carried on, however, upon a very limited
scale with the funds now available, as entire collections have first to be identified,
and the expenditure of a relatively large amount of labor and material is required for
assorting, labeling, and preparing the specimens for shipment. During the last year
39 sets of such duplicates, containing about 7,000 specimens in all, were sent out.
The principal subjects represented were marine invertebrates, geology, and prehis-
toric archeology.

Pan-American Exposition.—The preparation of the exhibits for the Pan-American
Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, as authorized by the Fifty-fifth Congress, was begun
during the year under the immediate direction of Dr. F. W. True, who has been desig-
nated as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus on the
Government Board of Management.

Publications.—Volume 21 of the Proceedings was issued early in the year, and 24
papers of Volume 22 have been printed and distributed in separate form. Volume 1
of the Annual Report for 1897 was received from the Government Printing Office in

58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

December. The second volume of this Report, still in course of printing, will con-
tain a biographical account of Dr. George Brown Goode, the late Assistant Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the National Museum, and reprints of sey-
eral of his most important papers on museums and on the history of scientifie progress
in the United States. It is expected that the Report for 1898 will be ready for distri-
bution early in the coming fiscal year. The appendix to this Report will consist of
only one paper—a monographic treatise on the Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of
North America, by the late Prof. Edward Drinker Cope. Part 4 of Bulletin No. 47,
entitled ‘‘The Fishes of North and Middle America,’’ by Dr. David Starr Jordan and
Dr. Barton W. Evermann, was issued just before the close of the year. This volume,
consisting of 392 plates, with their explanations and a general table of contents, com-
pletes one of the most important works thus far published by the Museum. Three
additional pamphlets containing instructions to collectors, etc., were issued during
the year as parts M, N, and O, of Bulletin 39. The titles of these are: ‘‘The meth-
ods employed at the Naples Zoological Station for the preservation of marine ani-
mals,’’ by Dr. Salvatore Lo Bianco (translated by E. O. Hovey, of the American
Museum of Natural History); ‘‘ Directions for preparing study specimens of small
mammals,’’ by Gerrit S. Miller, jr., and. ‘‘Directions for collecting and rearing
dragon flies, stone flies, and May flies,’’ by James G. Needham.

LTibrary.—Three hundred and thirty-seven books, 728 pamphlets, and 4,298 parts
of periodicals have been added to the library, which now contains over 15,000
bound volumes and 27,000 unbound papers.

APPENDIX IT.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETH-
NOLOGY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900.

Sm: I have the honor to tender the following report of operations conducted by
the Bureau of American Ethnology during the year ending June 30, 1900, in accord-
ance with the act of Congress making provision ‘‘for continuing researches relating
to the American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution,’’
approved March 3, 1899.

The work of the year has been carried forward in accordance with a formal plan
of operations submitted on May 13, 1899, and approved by the Secretary under date
of June 16, 1899.

The field operations of the regular corps have extended into Arizona, California,
Cuba, Indian Territory, Jamaica, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Nova
Scotia, Oklahoma, Ontario, and Wisconsin; while operations have been conducted
by special agents in Alaska, Argentina, and Porto Rico. The office work has com-
prised the collection and preparation of material from most of the States and Terri-
tories, as well as from various other parts of the Western Hemisphere.

As during previous years, the researches have been carried forward in accordance
with a scientific system developed largely in this Bureau. This system is outlined
in the classification adopted in previous reports and continued in the present one.

FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION.

The Director, aided by Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, spent the earlier months of
the fiscal year in an investigation of the middens and tumuli representing the work
of the aborigines in northeastern United States, especially in Maine. A considerable
number of both classes of accumulations were excavated, with instructive results.
Among the relics brought to light were many of customary types, together with a
smaller number of much significance in that they represent early stages of accultura-
tion through contact with Caucasian pioneers; and in addition to the aboriginal and
accultural artifacts, the explorers were rewarded by finding the remains of a metallic
armor, of European make, in such associations as to throw light on the beginning of
warfare between red men and white. .

Later in the year the Director, accompanied by Prof. W. H. Holmes, of the United
States National Museum, repaired to Cuba and Jamaica for the purpose of tracing
lines of cultural migration between the great continents of the Western Hemisphere.
The researches of the last two decades have shown clearly that the customs of the
aborigines in what is now southeastern United States were affected by extraneous
motives and devices; the phenomena have suggested importation of objects and
ideas belonging to what is commonly styled ‘‘Caribbean art’’ from South America
by way of the Antilles; and it was thought desirable to seize the opportunity offered
by recent political changes for special studies in the Antillean islands. Although the
trip was a reconnaissance merely, it yielded useful data on which to base further
researches, including a small collection for the Museum.

A noteworthy trip was made early in the fiscal year by Mr. F. W. Hodge, with a
party of volunteer assistants comprising Dr. Elliott Coues, of Washington, Dr. George
Parker Winship, of Providence, and Mr. A. C. Vroman, of Pasadena. The journey

59
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was so planned as to touch the less known pueblos of the plateau country and val-
leys of New Mexico and Arizona and to obtain data relating to social organization,
migrations, and customs, as well as typical photographs of individuals, habitations,
etc. All of the existing pueblos of New Mexico were visited and many of the ruins,
The trip yielded a large body of data for incorporation in the reports and especially
in the Cyclopedia of Native Tribes.

About the middle of September Dr. J. Walter Fewkes proceeded to New Mexico
for the purpose of completing his investigation of the mythology and ceremonies of
the Hopi Indians, his trip being so timed as to permit observation of the autumn
and winter ceremonies not previously observed by ethnologic students. He remained
in the pueblo throughout the winter, and his studies proved eminently fruitful.
Toward the end of March he repaired to Arizona for the purpose of locating aborigi-
nal ruins near Rio Colorado Chiquito, concerning which vague rumors were afloat;
and this work, also, was quite successful, as noted in another paragraph.

During the early autumn Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet visited several groups of survivors
of Algonquian tribes on Cape Breton Island for the purpose of extending the studies
of the previous year in New Brunswick; he succeeded in obtaining considerable
linguistic material, in addition to other data pertaining to the northeasternmost rep-
resentatives of that great Algonquian-speaking people neighboring the Eskimo on
their north and extending thence southward more than halfway across the present
territory of the United States.

Early in the winter Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt revisited the remnants of several Iroquoian
tribes in New York and Ontario and continued the collection and comparison of the
tribal traditions. Finding the conditions favorable for recording some of the more
noteworthy traditions, he spent several weeks in an Indian village near Hamilton,
Ontario, returning to the office in April.

Toward the end of the calendar year Mr. J. B. Hatcher, who had been operating
in Patagonia and Terra del Fuego as a special agent of the Bureau, returned to the
country with a considerable collection for the Museum, as well as a large number of
photographs illustrating the physical characteristics, costumery, habitations, and
occupations of the Tehuelche and Yahgan tribes. He also brought in an extended
vocabulary collected among the natives of the former tribe and useful notes relating
to the social organization and other characteristics of the two tribes.

Toward the end of the fiscal year Miss Alice C. Fletcher was commissioned as a
special agent to visit Indian Territory and Oklahoma for the purpose of obtaining cer-
tain esoteric rituals of the Pawnee tribe. Her work was notably successful, as is indi-
cated in other paragraphs.

Dr. Willis E. Everett remained in Alaska throughout the fiscal year, pursuing his
vocation as a mining engineer, but incidentally collecting, for the use of the Bureau,
linguistic and other data pertaining to the native tribes.

About the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Robert Stein, formerly of the United States
Geological Survey, accompanied a Peary expedition northward as far as Elsmereland,
where he planned to spend the winter in geographic and related researches. He
sarried instructions from the Bureau for such archzeologic and ethnologic observations
as he might be able to make, together with photographic apparatus and materials
needed in the work. Elsmereland is not known to be now inhabited, nor to have
been inhabited in the past, by the aborigines, but the situation of the island is such
as to indicate that it was probably occupied at least temporarily by Eskimauan tribes
in some of the migrations attested by their wide distribution; hence it is thought
probable that archzeologic work on the island may throw light on the early history of
this widely dispersed orarian people. A brief report of progress was received after
the close of the fiscal year.

During the autumn Mr. Robert T. Hill, of the United States Geological Survey,
visited Porto Rico in the interests of that Bureau and of the Department of Agricul-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ture; and the opportunity was seized to arrange for obtaining through his cooperation
such photographs and other data of ethnologic character as he might be able to dis-
cover in connection with his other duties. The arrangement yielded material of
value.

OrricE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

In the course of a reconnoissance of the Greater Antilles, the Director and Profes-
sor Holmes enjoyed moderate opportunities for observing (chiefly in local collections)
artifacts of the class commonly regarded as displaying traces of Caribbean influence;
and while neither time nor opportunity permitted exhaustive study, a few interesting
generalizations were made. One of these relates to the relative abundance of sesthetic
and industrial motives among those artifacts displaying traces of a Southern influ-
ence. On comparing the objects and special features in connection with those from
Florida and other portions of southern United States, it was noted that the presum-
ably imported or accultural features are predominantly esthetic, and only subordi-
nately of technical or industrial character—i. e., it would appear from the collections
that esthetic motives travel more freely, or are interchanged more readily, than
_ purely utilitarian motives among primitive peoples. The relation is of course com-
plicated by the relative abundance of fiducial or other sophic motives, which often
blend with both esthetic and industrial motives in puzzling fashion; but even after
these motives are weighed or eliminated, the general relation remains unchanged.
The generalization promises to be of service as a guide in the study of that affiliation
of tribes, or integration of peoples, which complicates every ethnologic problem. The
inquiries were greatly facilitated by Professor Holmes’s artistic training and his
extended familiarity with both the esthetic and the industrial motives of aboriginal
artifacts; nor could the generalization have been made without the aid of Mr. Cush-
ing, and the opportunity of examining his remarkable collection of artifacts of wood
and shell from the muck beds of western Florida, of which a considerable part is now
in the National Museum. The details of the work are reserved for later reports.

Throughout the fiscal year Mr. W J McGee was occupied primarily with adminis-
trative duties as Ethnologist in Charge in the office, but partly in the preparation of
reports on field researches of previous years. One of his subjects of study was the
esthetic status of the Seri Indians of Tiburon Island and adjacent territory. The
tribe is notably primitive in several respects, as indicated in previous reports, and
this primitive character is well displayed in their meager esthetic. One of the con-
spicuous customs of the tribe is that of face painting, the paint being applied uni-
formly in definite patterns, of which nearly a dozen were observed. The custom is
practically limited to the women, though male children are sometimes painted with
their mothers’ devices. On inquiry into the’uses and purposes of the designs it was
found that each pertains to and denotes a matronymic group or clan, and that the
more prominent designs, at least, are symbols of zoic tutelaries—e. g., Turtle, Peli-
can, etc. It thus appears that the painted devices are primarily symbolic rather
than decorative, though comparison of the devices used by different members of the
same clan or by the same female at different times, indicates that the sematic func-
tion does not stand in the way of minor modification or embellishment of the device
through the exercise of a personal feeling for decoration. The investigation is of
interest in that it establishes the symbolic basis of «sthetic concepts along a new line,
and it is of even deeper interest in that it seems to reveal nascent notions of decora-
tion, and thus aids to define the beginning of purely artistic activities. The sym-
bolic devices themselves are of much significance as indices to the social organization
on the one hand, and to the prevailing belief of the tribe on the other hand. The
restriction of the painted symbols to the females and the especially conspicuous use
of them by matrons betoken the strength and exclusiveness of that sense of maternal
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

descent which is normal to the lowest stage of culture; the devices are at once blood-
signs, definite as the face-marks of gregarious animals, and clan-standards, significant
as tartan or pibroch; and the confaement of their display to the recognized blood-
carriers of the clan attests, perhaps more clearly than any other phenomena thus far
noted, the strength of that semi-instinctive feeling expressed in maternal organiza-
tion. In like manner, the representation of local tutelaries in the painted devices
attests the intensity and dominance of that zootheistic faith which seems to be nor-
mal to the lowest stage of intellectual development. The details of the investigation
are incorporated in a memoir appended to an earlier report.

In the course of his work among the Hopi Indians, Dr. Fewkes succeeded in defin-
ing certain steps in the development of the drama. The ceremonies of the folk, like
those of other primitive peoples, are primarily fiducial, and involve representation,
or even personation, of the deified potencies forming the tribal pantheon. The
motive of one of the dramatic—or rather dramaturgic—pieces is the growth of corn;
and the mise en scéne comprises realistic representations of both the maleficent and
the beneficent agencies connected with the making of the crop and the development
of the plant in general. The performance is designed primarily to invoke the favor
of the mysteries by appropriate symbols of both being and action, but an ancillary,
or perhaps coordinate, design of this ceremony is the edification (combining instruc-
tion and diversion) of the-tribe at large; accordingly a portion of the interior is set
apart as a stage, while the greater portion is reserved as an auditorium. Both the
mystical and the human powers are represented or personified by actors, who, with
their properties, occupy the stage; and since that part of the mechanism connected
with the portrayal of the mysteries is esoteric, a screen is provided to conceal it and
give an air of realism to the performance. The screen is painted with appropriate
symbols tending to heighten the illusion to the childlike minds of the audience, and
it is perforated to permit the passage of masked effigies representing the mystical
potencies, which are operated by shamans hidden behind the screen, something after
the fashion of marionettes. The front of the stage is occupied by a symbolized field
of corn; it is the rdle of the symbolized potencies representing storm and drought
to emerge from their respective apertures in the screen and destroy the symbolic
cornfield; but they are opposed, in part by musical and other incanations of a group
of shamans occupying one side of the stage, and in part by human actors who wrestle
with and finally overcome the evil marionettes. The entire dramatization stands on
a higher plane than that prevalent among most of the tribes of the territory of the
United States, though lower than that reached among the Nahuatlan and Mayan peo-
ples and reveals various connecting links between primitive dramaturgy and theatrical
representation proper. A specially significant feature of the performance is the rdéle
assigned to human actors in boldly defying, and eventually overcoming, the powers
of darkness and evil; for this esthetic feature reflects a noteworthy aspect of industrial
development. Dr. Fewkes’s detailed descriptions, with the attendant photographs
and drawings, are in preparation for an early report.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

As indicated in earlier reports, the researches of the last decade have shown that
the esthetic motives of primitive peoples arise in symbolism; and, as noted in one or
two recent reports on the work, various indications have been found that industrial
motives similarly arise in symbolism connected with zootheistic faith. The suggest-
ive phase of industrial development is that in which teeth, horns, claws, mandibles,
and other animal organs are used as implements or weapons in a manner imitating
more or less closely the natural functions of the organisms. In completing his studies
of Seri technic during the year, Mr. W J McGee has discovered definite survivals
of this stage of industrial development. The favorite Seri awl is the mandible of a
bird, and even when the material is hard wood the implement is shaped in imita-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

tion of the natural organ; the war shield is a turtle-shell or pelican pelt; similarly
the arrows and turtle harpoons of the tribe are fitted with a foreshaft usually of hard
wood, though there are linguistic and other indications that the use of wood is a
vestige of a former use of teeth, probably of the local sea lion while many of the
‘manual operations are evidently imitative of normal movements of local animals,
most of which hold place in the Seri pantheon. These features of the Seri technic
throw light on the use of zoic motives in the decoration of primitive weapons, and
hence permit the solution of some of the most puzzling problems of American arche-
ology; at the same time they serve to define a stage in industrial development in a
manner which appears to be applicable to all primitive peoples. In general, the
stage would seem to be antecedent to that defined by the chance-dominated use of
stone, which has already been characterized as protolithic; it corresponds with the
stage provisionally outlined by Cushing as prelithic; but, taking due account of the
materials, processes, and motives characteristic of the stage, it may be distinguished
as hylozoic, or perhaps better as zoomimic. Accordingly the earlier stages of indus-
trial development may be defined as (1) zoomimic, in which the predominant imple-
_ ments are beast organs, used largely in mimicry of animal movements; (2) protolithic,
in which the prevailing implements are stones selected at random and used in ways
determined by mechanical chance; and (3) technolithic, in which the prevailing
implements are of stone shaped by preconceived designs and used in accordance with
the teachings of mechanical experience. This classification of the industries is elabo-
rated in an earlier report, the material for which was revised during the year.

In continuing the preparation of his memoir on the contents of the Florida shell
mounds and muck beds, Mr. Cushing brought out many new examples of that
ideative association which forms the basis of zoomimic industry. Several of these
examples were found in the muck-preserved implements and weapons of wood from
Florida; others were found in various museums in the form of artifacts of stone, and
even of metal, shaped in imitation of animals, or furnished with symbols of animals
and animal organs; still others were found in the hieroglyphics and hieratic codices
of Mexico and Yucatan. The assemblage of objects seems clearly to indicate that
while the zoomimic motive was the primary one and stood nearly alone at and long
after its inception, it was not completely displaced by the protolithic or even by the
technolithic motives of higher stages, but persisted in connection with these quite
up to the time of Caucasian invasion—indeed, it would appear that the zoomimic
motive in handicraft was the correlative and concomitant of that zootheism out of
which none of the tribes had completely risen up to the time of the discovery.

In the course of his reconnaissance of the inhabited and ruined pueblos in New
Mexico and Arizona, Mr. F. W. Hodge, with his companions, brought to light a
number of notable examples of stone work. Two types are especially instructive.
The first of these is represented by the ruins in Cebollita Valley. The stones used
in the walls were cleft with great regularity and laid, after carefully facing by peck-
ing, in such manner as to produce a practically smooth surface, with corners squared
almost as neatly as those of a well-laid brick structure. The second type, also repre-
sented by ruins in the Cebollita Valley, is similar, save that the corners were rounded
apparently on a uniform radius, while the stones were dressed in such manner as to
conform to the curve about as closely as does metal-wrought masonry. The perfec-
tion of the stone work of both types suggests Caucasian skill; but the indications of
great antiquity, coupled with the absence of binding mortar, and especially the
laying of the stones in such manner as to reveal ignorance of the principle of breaking
joints, prove that the work was primitive.

In his reconnaissance of the ruins of Rio Colorado Chiquito, Dr. Fewkes reex-
amined critically the ancient structure discovered by Sitgreaves in 1851, which is of
much interest as one of the earliest known ruins of the pueblo country. His observa-
tions on the subject are of interest, partly in that they afford a basis for estimating
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the duration of such ruins when protected from vandalism either by inaccessibility,

as in this case, or by such legislative or executive action as is frequently contemplated |
by governmental authorities. The detailed measurements and comparisons will be

incorporated in a later report. During the same trip Dr. Fewkes discovered a num-

ber of additional ruins including those of cavate dwellings located in the softer layers

of heterogeneous volcanic deposit. Some of his observations throw useful light on

the methods of excavating such deposits employed by the aborigines, as well as on

their general modes of life.

During the autumn it was ascertained that Dr. A. E. Jenks, of the University of
Wisconsin, was engaged in a study of the wild-rice industry of the aborigines, and it
was thought well to take advantage of the opportunity to systemize and place on per-
manent record the considerable body of material brought together through his
researches. Accordingly provision was made to have Dr. Jenks visit various locali-
ties in Wisconsin and Minnesota in which the wild-rice industry is still carried for-
ward by the Indians; and provision was also made for photographing the various
operations connected with the harvesting, preserving, and cooking of the produce.
The inquiry derives importance primarily from the large use of wild rice among the
aboriginal tribes and incidentally from the possible utility of the product in enlight-
ened agriculture. The world is indebted to the natives of the Western Hemisphere
for several important commodities. Among these corn, i. e., maize, occupies the first
place; others are the turkey, two or three varieties of beans, certain squashes, besides
the remarkable paratriptic tobacco, whose use has spread throughout the world since
the time of Raleigh; and there are indications that the wild rice (Zizania) of the
region of glacial lakes may constitute a notable addition to the list. Led to the subject
by the work of the Bureau, the Department of Agriculture has instituted inquiries
concerning the extent of the wild rice area and concerning the possibilities of utiliza-
tion of the resource. Dr. Jenks’ memoir is incorporated in the Nineteenth Annual
Report.

WORK IN SOCIOLOGY.

Except when occupied in field work, the Director continued the synthetic study of
demotic activities, and during the year he completed the preliminary outline of the
activities expressed in institutions. The science of institutions is commonly desig-
nated sociology, after Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, and other European writers;
and though the term is sometimes loosely used it fairly meets the requirements of scien-
tific exposition. The branch of knowledge which it is used to designate is one of the
five coordinate sciences (esthetology, technology, sociology, philology, and sophi-
ology) constituting demonomy, or the system of knowledge pertaining to the human
activities. Viewed in its activital aspect, sociology combines several subordinate
branches. The first of these is statistics (sometimes called demography ), which deals
with the units of social organization; the second is economics, which deals espe-
cially with the forces and values involved in, or controlled by, human organization.
The third branch of sociology is civics, which may be defined as the science of meth-
ods in governmental action, or in the regulation of the conduct of associates—methods
which have for their normal objects peace, equity, equality, liberty, and charity
among the associates. The means of attaining these ends in primitive society have
been ascertained almost wholly through the researches in American ethnology; they
have been indicated ina brief outline of regimentation appended to an earlier report.
The fourth branch of sociology may be noted as historics; it deals with the methods
adopted for the maintenance and perpetuation of social organization. Coordinate
with these branches is the science of ethics, which deals with the ideal bases and the
practical objects of associate organization. The ethics of primitive life have been
ascertained almost wholly through observation among the aborigines of America; the
ethical relations existing among the tribesmen have been a revelation to students;
and no line of ethnologic inquiry has yielded richer results than that pertaining to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

this subject. An outline of the definition of sociology has been printed for the use
of students, and for the benefit of such suggestions as may be offered by other inquir-
ers; and it is planned to expand the discussion and incorporate it in a later report.

The primary purpose of the trip by Mr. Hodge and his companions was to ascer-
tain and record the details of social organization as now maintained among the
pueblo tribes. As indicated in various publications of the Bureau, the aborigines of
America belong in approximately equal proportions to two of the culture stages
defined by social organization—i. e., (1) savagery, in which the institutions are based
on consanguinity reckoned in the female line, and (2) barbarism, in which the insti-
tutions are founded on consanguinity reckoned in the male line. In some cases a
transitional condition has been found, as, for example, among the Muskwaki Indians,
who give a patronymic to the first-born child, but, in case of its death in infancy,
revert to the matronymic system; sometimes, again, the basis of the organization
is so well concealed as to be obscured, as among the Kiowa Indians (noted in the
last report); or, again, the consanguinity may be practically concealed by the over-
placement of some other factor, as among the California tribes, who regard language
as the ostensibly dominant factor of their institutions (also noted in the last report);
but the fortuitous relations may commonly be reduced without serious difficulty, and
shown not to affect the general fact that the American aborigines belong to the cul-
ture stages of savagery and barbarism in about equal proportions, reckoned on the
basis of population—though it is to be remembered that the tribes belonging to the
higher stage are uch the larger and fewer. Now a recent line of inquiry relates
to the causes and conditions of the transition from the first great stage to the
second. In the Old World the transition has been fairly correlated with the gradual
passage from hunting to herding—there the initial phase of agriculture; but in
the Western Hemisphere the characteristics of the native fauna were not such as to
place herding in the van of agricultural development. Accordingly it has been
thought desirable to trace the influence of harvesting and planting, when pursued for
generations, on social organization; and the most favorable opportunity for such
research was that afforded by the Pueblos. Morever, it seemed desirable to inquire
into the rate of the transition, as indicated by records covering a considerable period;
and for this purpose also the Pueblos seemed to be admirably adapted, partly since
the customs of the people have been subjects of record for three and a half centuries,
and partly because their arid habitat is so uninviting as to have practically repelled
the invasion of revolutionary methods. It was by reason of his intimate acquaint-
ance with the early records, and also in the hope that he might be able to discover
unpublished manuscripts among the ancient archives of the missions, that Dr. Elliott
Coues, compiler of the American Explorers’ Series, was attached to the party.
Although no noteworthy discoveries of manuscripts were made, a considerable body
of data essential to the discussion of social organization in the pueblo region was
obtained. Portions of the material are in preparation for prospective reports, while
Mr. Hodge is incorporating the data relating to the clans and gentes of the Pueblo
peoples in a Cyclopedia of Native Tribes.

During his stay among the Hopi, Dr. Fewkes’ atterition was directed to the inter-
relation between the tribesmen and certain feral creatures, notably eagles. The eagles
are of much consequence to the folk, chiefly as a source of feathers, which are exten-
sively used in ceremonies for symbolic representation, etc.; and it appears from the
recent observations that particular clans claim and exercise a sort of collective owner-
ship in certain families of eagles, perhaps homing in distant mountains; and that
this right is commonly recognized by other clans,and even by neighboring tribes.
Thus the relation affords a striking example of that condition of toleration between
animals and men which normally precedes domestication, and forms the first step in
zooculture, as has been set forth in preceding reports. These relations, together
with the methods of capture, ete., will be described in a prospective paper.

66 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY,

During the later months of the fiscal year the Director resumed the synthesis of
the native American languages, and the comparison of these with other tongues, with
the view of defining the principles of philology on a comprehensive basis. The task
is one of magnitude; the records in the Bureau archives comprise more or less com-
plete vocabularies and grammars of several hundred dialects representing the sixty
or more linguistic stocks of North America; and the study necessarily extends not
only over this material but over a considerable part of the published records of other
languages, both primitive and advanced. Accordingly, while satisfactory progress
was made in the work, definite announcement of results must be held for later reports,

In connection with the general linguistic researches it was deemed necessary to
extend the classification of stocks southward over Mexico and Central America; and
this extension was undertaken with the aid of Dr Cyrus Thomas, whose researches
concerning the native codices of Mexico and Yucatan have familiarized him with
the literature of these and neighboring regions, and to some extent with the aboriginal
languages. Dr. Thomas devoted several months to the work; and about the close of
the fiscal year he had completed a provisional classification and map of native lin-
guistic stocks in Mexico and Central America, designed to supplement the classifica-
tion and map of the American Indians north of Mexico published in the Seventh
Annual Report. The material remains in the hands of the Director for use in gen-
eral study and for revision for publication.

As noted above, Dr. Albert 8. Gatschet visited Nova Scotia early in the fiscal year
for the purpose of completing his collections of the northeasternmost Algonquian
tongues—his work on Cape Breton Island was especially fruitful—and his collections
will enable him to round out the comparative vocabulary of Algonquian dialects so
far as the tribes of northeastern United States and contiguous territory are concerned.
On returning to the office he resumed the extraction of lexic and grammatic material,
and pushed forward the preparation of the comparative vocabulary, and in connec-
tion with the work he prepared synthetic characterizations of the principal elements
of several typical dialects, including the Kataba of the Siouan stock.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt continued the preparation of his memoir on the comparative
mythology of the Iroquoian tribes. On juxtaposing the principal cosmogonic myths
of the several tribes, various indications of incompleteness were found; and it was
chiefly for the purpose of verifying certain of the versions that he revisited Ontario,
as has been already noted. He succeeded in obtaining a considerable body of new
data, and after his return from the field he made good progress in the preparation of
his memoir, which is designed for incorporation in an early report. Early in the
fiscal year Mr. Hewitt made a notable comparison between the Seri language, as
recorded recently by Mr. McGee (and as previously obtained from an expatriated
Seri man at Hermosillo by M. Pinart, Commissioner Bartlett, and Sefor Tenochio),
with the Yuman, Piman, and other southwestern dialects recorded by various
explorers. For atime the language of the Seri was supposed to be related to the
tongues of the Yuman stock; but Mr. Hewitt’s exhaustive study of the extensive
body of material now preserved in the Bureau archives seems to demonstrate the
absence of such relation, and to indicate that the language of the tribe represents a
distinct stock. Accordingly the classification of Orozco y Berra and other Mexican
scholars of the middle of the century is revived; and in conformity with the princi-
ples of nomenclature and classification announced in the Seventh Annual Report,
the definition of the language, dialects, and tribes is as follows:

Stock. Dialects and tribes.
Seri (extant).

Tepoka (recently extinct).
Guayma (long extinct).
Upanguayma (long extinct).

Serian.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

In the course of his stay in the Hopi Village, Dr. Fewkes was so fortunate as to
discover a series of hieratic paintings, primarily representing the tribal pantheon,
but connected incidentally with the tribal history. The paintings were executed by
an aged shaman as a sort of personal record akin to the calendars, or winter-counts,
which play so large, yet so obscure, a role in Indian life; and they would doubtless
have been sacrificed on the death of the artist had not Dr. Fewkes discovered them
and succeeded, after much difficulty, in securing them. The series comprises some
four hundred representations, mostly on separate sheets; the pictures partake of the
characteristics of the petroglyphs and calendaric inscriptions such as those described
by the late Colonel Mallery; they also present suggestive similarities to the codices
of more southerly regions. It is the design to incorporate the entire series, repro-
duced in facsimile, in an early report.

One of the best known contributions to American aboriginal linguistics is the
Elliot Bible, published in the Natick language in 1685. This contribution was sup-
plemented in a highly notable way during the present century through the labors of
the late James Hammond Trumbull, who compiled from the Bible, with the aid of
other sources of information at his command, a vocabulary of the Natick tongue.
Unfortunately for students, this compilation was not published, but on the death of
Dr. Trumbull, in 1897, it passed into the custody of the American Antiquarian
Society, at Worcester, Massachusetts. Here it attracted the attention of scholars
and publicists, including Dr. Edward Everett Hale; and it was proposed by Dr. Hale,
with others, to offer the manuscript to the Bureau for publication. Among the
scholars interested in this and cognate publications relating to the aborigines was
the Hon. Ernest W. Roberts, Representative of the Seventh Massachusetts district
in the Congress; and at his instance authority was granted for resuming the publica-
tion of bulletins by the Bureau. Accordingly, when Dr. Hale, early in 1900, brought
the valuable manuscript of the Trumbull Dictionary to Washington it was assigned
for publication as the first of the new series of bulletins. Before the close of the
fiscal year the compositon was well under way, while Dr. Hale was engaged in the
preparation of a historical introduction.

Another contribution of the first importance to knowledge of the aboriginal Ameri-
can languages is the vocabulary of the Maya tongue, compiled during the earlier
decades of Spanish occupation and well known to scholars (though never printed)
as the Diccionario de Motul. Two or three copies of the work are extant in manu-
script; one of these passed into the possession of the late Dr. Carlos H. Berendt about
the middle of the present century, and in the course of a lengthy stay in Yucatan
he undertook to revise and complete the vocabulary and to bring it up to date by
the introduction of all Maya terms in modern use. Dr. Berendt’s additions nearly
doubled the volume of the original manuscript, and greatly enhanced its value;
unfortunately he died before his plan for publication was carried out. Before his
death, however, he turned the manuscript over to the late Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, of
Philadelphia, in order that it might be published in that ethnologist’s Library of
Aboriginal American Literature. Finding the work too extensive for his facilities,
Dr. Brinton made a provisional arrangement, before his death, in July, 1899, to trans-
fer the manuscript to the Bureau; and after his decease the arrangement was carried
out by his legatees and executors, including the University of Pennsylvania, to which
institution his valuable library was bequeathed. Both the original vocabulary and
Dr. Berendt’s supplement are in Maya-Spanish and Spanish-Maya; and, as a neces-
sary preliminary to publication by the Bureau, a transcription was begun by Miss
Jessie E. Thomas, assistant librarian, a student of the Maya language. Toward the
close of the fiscal year Sefor Andonaro Molina, of Merida, Yucatan, an eminent
student of the Maya language, visited this country, and, learning of the proposal to
publish the Diccionario de Motul, came to Washington to proffer his services in any
further revision of the material that might seem desirable. His offer was gladly
68 REPORT OF THE SECKETARY.

accepted and provision was made for supplying him with copies of the transcript of
the vocabulary.

During the year Dr. Franz Boas made additional contributions of importance to the
linguistic collections of the Bureau. He also completed a second volume of Chinook
texts, which would have been sent to press before the close of the fiscal year except
for his prospective absence in field work and consequent delay in proof revision.
The matter will be incorporated in an early report or bulletin.

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

In pursuing his investigation of the time-concept of Papago Indians as noted in the
last report, Mr. McGee was led to a study of the relations existing between this nota-
bly altruistic tribe and their hard physical environment; and clear indications were
found that with the degree of cultural development possessed by the Papago, tbe
tendency of a severe environment is to develop altruism. At the same time it was
noted that the neighboring Seri tribe, surrounded by an environment of similar char-
acteristics in many respects, are notably egoistic and inimical toward contemporaries;
and the striking differences led to further research concerning the interrelations
between human groups and their physical surroundings—interrelations which may
conveniently be styled adaptions. Now, when the study was extended to other tribes
it became manifest that such adaptions may be arranged in serial order, and that when
so arranged the Seri stand at the end of the series marking the most intimate inter-
action between mind and externals, while the Papago stand in the front rank of
aboriginal tribes as graded by power of nature-conquest; and from this point it is
easy to extend the scale into civilization and enlightenment, in which men control
rather than submit to control by their physical surroundings. The serial arrange-
ment of peoples in terms of relative capacity in nature-conquest can hardly be deemed
new, though the special examples (particularly the notably primitive Seri) are
peculiarly instructive; but the successive adaptions thus defined were found unex-
pectedly significant in measuring various degrees of interdependence between envi-
ronment and thought, for it became evident in the light of specific examples that
the habitual thought, like the habitual action of an isolated and primitive folk is a
continuous and continuously integrated reflection of environment. On pursuing the
relations it was found that the Seri, habitually submitting to a harsh environment
as they do, merely reflect its harshness in their conduct, and that the Papago, seek-
ing habitually to control environment in the interests of their kind as they do, are
raised by their efforts to higher planes of humanity. The general relation between
thought and surroundings was found to be of exceeding broad application, extending
far beyond the local tribes. Indeed, it finds most definite expression in the current
scientific teaching that knowledge arises in experience, and it seemed desirable to
formulate the relation as a principle of knowledge which may appropriately be styled
the responsivity of mind. The principle promises to be especially useful to ethnolo-
gists confronted with those suggestive similarities in artifacts, habits, and even lan-
guages, which were interpreted as evidences of former contact until their incongruity
with geographic and other facts proved them to be coincidental merely, for the inter-
dependence of thought and environment offers an adequate explanation of the coin-
cidences, while the diminishing dependence of thought on environment with cultural
advancement equally explains the preponderance of such coincidences among lowly
peoples. A preliminary announcement of the results of the study has been made,
but full publication is withheld pending further field work.

Mr. James Mooney spent the greater part of the fiscal year in elaborating for pub-
lication the extensive collection of material made by him among the Cherokee
Indians several years ago. The collection comprises a nearly complete series of the
myths and traditions of the tribe, cosmogonic, historical, interpretative, and trivial;
for among the Cherokee, as among other primitive peoples, the traditions vary widely

a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

in character and purpose. Mr. Mooney’s collections are peculiarly valuable in that
they are so complete as to indicate the genesis and development of the tribal tradi-
tions. It would appear that the parent myth usually begins as a trivial story or
fable, perhaps carrying a moral and thus introducing and fixing some precept for the
guidance of conduct; the great majority of these fables drop out of the current lore
within the generation in which they are born, but those chancing to touch the local
life strongly or happening to glow with local genius survive and are handed down
to later generations. The transmitted fables form a part of the lore repeated by the
eldermen and elderwomen night after night to while away the long evenings by the
camp fire, and in this way they become impressed on the memory and imagination
of the younger associates; for under the conditions of prescriptorial life they come to
take the place of learning and literature in the growing mind of the youth. In the
successive repetitions the weaker fables are eliminated, while the more vigorous are
gradually combined and eventually strung together in an order made definite by
custom; at the same time they acquire sacredness with age, and some of them
become so far esoteric that they may not be repeated by youths, or perhaps even by
laymen, when they are the exclusive property of sages or shamans. Now the fable,
per se, is seldom vigorous enough to pass unaided into the esoteric lore of the tribe;
but when it serves to interpret some interesting natural phenomenon, either in its
original form or in its subsequent association, it is thereby fertilized, and, with the
combined vitality of fable and interpretation, enjoys greatly increased chance of sur-
vival. Sometimes the historical element is also added, when the composite intel-
lectual structure is still further strengthened, and may persist until history blends
with fancy painted prehistory, and the story becomes a full-fledged cosmogonic
myth. Accordingly, the character and the age of myths are correlated in significant
fashion. Mr. Mooney’s memoir is incorporated in the Nineteenth Annual Report,
which was sent to the printer on March 28, and proofs were in hand before the close
of the fiscal year. Since it is the first of a series of memoirs on the Cherokee by the
same author, it was thought well to preface the publication with an extended review
of the history of the Cherokee Indians from the time of discovery up to the removal
of a portion of the tribe to Indian Territory, and in collecting material for this his-
torical sketch Mr. Mooney was able to throw new light, not only on the moyements
of the tribesmen themselves, but on the routes of travel taken by various explorers
from De Soto down.

Although handicapped by illness, Mrs. Matilda C. Stevenson continued the prepa-
ration of the final chapters in her monograph on Zui mythology. The work was so
nearly completed at the end of the fiscal year that it was assigned a definite place in
the Twenty-first Annual Report.

Dr. Fewkes’s observations on the winter ceremonies of the Hopi Indians yielded
important data of the nature suggested in previous paragraphs, and on his return
from the field he at once took up the preparation of a memoir designed for incorpo-
ration in an early report.

A notable acquisition of the year was the Pawnee ritual, known as the Hako,
obtained by Miss Alice C. Fletcher. Its basis is one of those house ceremonies which
hold so large a place in aboriginal thought; and it is so exceptionally full as to at once
reveal some of the most strictly characteristic phases of primitive thought and illu-
mine the simpler house rituals already recorded. It is cosmogonic in import, and
thus reflects the faith of the tribe. At the same time its details indicate the tribal
migrations for many generations. It reveals primitive notions concerning the origin
of fire and the relations of this agency to deified animals. It comprises a partially
archaic vocabulary which promises to throw light on tribal affinities, and it includes
rhythmic and fundamental melodic features which contribute in important degree
to knowledge of aboriginal music. The entire ritual, including the musical accom-
paniment, is well advanced in preparation for the Twentieth Report.
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. Cyrus Thomas continued the examination of Mayan and Mexican aboriginal
number systems, with special reference to the Mayan and Mexican calendar systems.
Early in 1900 he completed a memoir on the subject, entitled ‘‘ Mayan Calendar Sys-
tems,’’ which was incorporated in the Nineteenth Annual Report. Later in the
fiscal year he continued in cognate work, making gratifying progress. One of the
most interesting features of aboriginal culture to the scholars of the world is the
series of highly developed calendaric systems extending from Mexico on the north to
Peru on the south; these systems reflect a knowledge of astronomy considerably less
advanced than that prevailing in Chaldea and Egypt at the beginning of written
history, yet sufficiently advanced to indicate the beginnings of astronomic observa-
tion and generalization, and thus define a stage of scientific development of which
the Old World record is practically lost. Accordingly Dr. Thomas’s researches are
deemed especially valuable to scholars.

As already noted, Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has applied the comparative method to the
study of aboriginal traditions with excellent results. During the closing months of
the fiscal year he was occupied in revising his memoir on Iroquoian mythology, and
incorporating certain important data obtained during his winter trip. The material
is nearly ready for the press.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

Except during the time spent in field work, Mr. F. W. Hodge was occupied in
arranging material for the Cyclopedia of Native Tribes and in editorial work. In the
former task he was aided during a part of the year by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, and in the
latter by Col. F. F. Hilder, ethnologic translator, and Mr. H. 8. Wood, assistant
editor. Dr. Thomas finished the revision of the Cyclopedia cards pertaining to the
Siouan stock early in the fiscal year; accordingly this portion of the work is ready
for publication save for the requisite editorial scrutiny. The plan for the Cyclopedia
has bee. set forth in some detail in earlier reports and need not be repeated.

’ COLLECTIONS.

The collaborators engaged in field work made more or less extensive collections
for use in their researches, and for subsequent transfer to the National Museum;
and, in addition, a number of special collections were acquired. Conspicuous among
these was the Hudson basketry collection, from California, for which negotiations
were opened during the last fiscal year, though the material was received and installed
during the current year; it is regarded as one of the most instructive collections
of American aboriginal basketry extant, and its possession, in connection with the
very considerable collections of corresponding ware already in the Institution, places
the National Museum in a foremost position among the museums of the world so
far as opportunities for study of primitive basketry are concerned. Another note-
worthy collection was that of Mr. J. B. Hatcher in Patagonia, of which the final
portions were received during the fiscal year, together with a good series of photo-
graphs illustrating the uses of artifacts, the construction of habitations, ete.; while
various collections of objects required to complete series, ete., were acquired by
purchase. Among the minor collections was an exceptionally fine one of copper
implements from the Lake Superior region; these implements were noteworthy in
that while of aboriginal design, the material was wrought with metal tools in such
wise as to show the influence of Caucasian contact; so that the collection forms an
instructive example of acculturation, and serves as a useful guide in the classification
of other copper objects in the Museum. A particularly useful series of stone imple-
ments, known as the Steiner collection, was also among the acquisitions of the year.

Although collateral to the work of the Bureau, it is proper to report that Col. F.
F. Hilder, ethnologic translator and acting chief clerk of the Bureau, was, on Janu-
ary 16, 1900, detailed to the Government Board of the Pan-American Exposition,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. vis

and that under a commission from that Board he visited the Philippine Islands and
made extensive collections of ethnologic and archzologic material, with the under-
standing that, after use during the exposition, a considerable portion of it should be
transferred to the National Museum. Toward the close of the’ year Colonel Hilder
reported the shipment of extensive collections, together with a good series of photo-
graphs, drawings, etc., designed for use in the installation. Incidentally he availed
himself of opportunities to obtain certain useful ethnologic literature required for the
library of the Bureau.

PROPERTY.

As explained in previous reports, the property of the Bureau is practically limited
to (1) office furniture and other appurtenances to office work, (2) ethnologic manu-
scripts and other records of original work, (3) photographs and drawings of Indian
subjects, (4) a small working library, (5) collections held temporarily by collabora-
tors for use in research, and (6) undistributed residua of the editions of the Bureau
publications. During the fiscal year there has been no noteworthy change in the
amount or value of the office property; a considerable number of manuscripts (includ-
ing two of special value noted in earlier paragraphs) have been added to the archives,
either temporarily or permanently; over a thousand photographic negatives and
several hundred prints and drawings have been added to the collection of illus-
trative material, while the library has maintained normal growth, chiefly through
exchanges. There was no considerable accumulation or transfer of objective mate-
rial required for study during the year, while there was a considerable reduction in
the number of back Reports through the constantly increasing public demand for
ethnologic literature.

PUBLICATION.

Mr. F. W. Hodge remained in charge of the editorial work, with the assistance of
Col. F. F. Hilder during the earlier part of the year and of Mr. H. 8. Wood during
Colonel Hilder’s absence in the Philippines. The second part of the Seventeenth
Annual Report was received from the Government Printing Office during the year,
though the first part was unfortunately delayed. The printing of the Eighteenth
Report was practically completed. The Nineteenth Report was transmitted for
publication on March 28, and the composition of this Report and also of the first
bulletin of the new series was under way before the close of the fiscal year.

Mr. DeLancey Gill, the illustrator of the Bureau, remained in charge of the photo-
graphic work and of the preparation of copy for the frequently elaborate illustrations
required in presenting adequately the results of the researches.

LIBRARY.

The work in the library of the Bureau was maintained under the supervision of
Mr. Hodge. During the greater part of the fiscal year he had the assistance of Mrs.
Lucretia M. Waring, who made good progress in the cataloguing of the books and
pamphlets in accordance with the classification of anthropic science developed in the
Bureau. The number of books and pamphlets on hand at the close of the fiscal year
is about 12,000 and 4,000, respectively.

NECROLOGY.

It is with much sorrow that I have to report the death of Frank Hamilton Cush-
ing, ethnologist in the Bureau, on April 10, 1900. Mr. Cushing was one of the most
enthusiastic students of ethnology ever produced in America, and the spark of his
genius illumined many problems of the science. His death was a blow to the
Bureau and a loss to the world. A more extended obituary will be transmitted
later.
72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

On December 25, 1899, Dr. Elliott Coues died suddenly. While he was not an
officer of the Bureau, he had frequently cooperated with the Director and the col-
laborators, especially during the earlier portion of the fiscal year, when he was
attached to a party engaged in work in the pueblo region. An enthusiastic student
of early American history, he was brought in frequent touch with ethnologists and
ethnologic problems, thereby acquiring extended and accurate knowledge of the
aborigines; hence his death was a serious loss to the science.

Dr. Walter J. Hoffman, for many years an attaché of the Bureau, died November
8, 1899. He entered the Bureau in its earlier years as an assistant to the late Col.
Garrick Mallery, and spent some years in the collection of petroglyphs and other
aboriginal records. Subsequently he made independent studies in different tribes,
notably the Menominee of Wisconsin. His principal publications in the Bureau
Reports are ‘‘The Midewiwin, or Grand Medicine Society of the Ojibwa,’’ in the
Seventh Report, and ‘‘The Menominee Indians,’’ in the Fourteenth Report. His
connection with the Bureau was temporarily severed in 1895, when he undertook
certain special work for the United States National Museum; in 1897 he was
appointed United States consul at Mannheim, Germany, where he availed himself
of opportunities for study of aboriginal American collections and records. His
health failing, he returned to his home near Reading, Pa., in the autumn of 1899,
where his death occurred. Although he was but 53 years of age at the time of his
death, he was one of the pioneers in American ethnology.

I have the honor to be, yours, with respect,
J. W. PowE.., Director.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the operations of the
International Exchange Service for the year ending June 30, 1900.

About seven years ago extensive improvements were made in the basement of the
eastern wing of the Smithsonian Building, and five communicating rooms were
arranged expressly for the use of the ExchangeServiceand havesince been so occupied.
The general equipment of these offices consists of sorting and folding tables; bins for
the geographical classification of exchanges contributed in the United States for distri-
bution abroad; book cases for directories of the principal cities of the world, college
year books, and other publications for ready reference; filing cases for index cata-
logues and cases for correspondence, exchange ledger accounts, and receipt cards for
exchange packages, both foreign and domestic; necessary desks with customary
equipments, a typewriter, copying press, ete. The property acquired during the
year has consisted almost exclusively of boxes, packing materials, stationery, and
other expendable supplies, the cost of which was $1,322.

The space originally assigned to the International Exchanges has not since been
enlarged, although the work of late has materially increased. The duties of the sery-
ice require the constant handling of heavy boxes and packages, necessitating frequent
repairs to the floors, walls, and furniture, the expense of which is invariably borne
by the Smithsonian Institution and not from the Congressional appropriations for
the support of the Exchange Service.

Losses of exchanges occurred during the year by the burning and subsequent sink-
ing of the steamship Patria, of the Hamburg-American Line, off the English coast on
November 4, 1899, while en route from New York to Hamburg, the consignment
consisting of three cases for Russia, three for Sweden, three for Austria, and one for
Hungary. All contained miscellaneous publications for correspondents in those
countries. Two cases of miscellaneous exchanges for Switzerland and one case of
United States Government publications destined for the Bibliotheque Fédérale, Bern,
were destroyed by fire while on the docks of the North German Lloyd Steamship
Company at Hoboken, N. J., on June 30, 1900. All available duplicate publications
to replace those destroyed by the burning of the steamship Patria were forwarded to
the original addresses, and an attempt will be made to secure duplicates of those
burned on the Hoboken docks. It is assumed that there will be no difficulty in
procuring all contributions by individuals and societies, but a special act of Congress
may be necessary in order to obtain the Congressional documents, inasmuch as their
distribution is specific and no provision is made for replacing duplicates when
losses occur in the manner above mentioned.

The comparative statements which follow in this report show in the aggregate a
marked increase in the extent of transmissions during the year ending June 30, 1900,
over those of the previous twelve months. The number of correspondents has been
increased during the year by 2,982, and now aggregates 33,951. Of this number,
7,721 are in the United States. Fifteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight
packages, or 92,108 pounds in weight, represent the increase in transmissions during
the past year. Thisis equivalent to 16 percent and 29 percent, respectively. During

73
V4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

this time 1,768 cases, representing 687 separate transmissions, or an average of more
than 13 transmissions each week, were shipped abroad. Notwithstanding the increase
in the number of shipments, the office routine has of late been so simplified as to
enable the regular foree employed in the Exchange office to distribute packages
immediately after their receipt at the Institution, and, with the exception of the
record division, in which the work has occasionally been behind, no part of the
service has suffered.

The Government appropriation for the support of the International Exchanges
during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, was $3,000 above that for the previous
year. This increase, which has been applied mainly to transportation charges, has
enabled the Institution to make use of the most expeditious carriers of freight and
express from New York to the principal ports of all other countries, whereby its
packages now reach their destination in much less time than formerly. This is a
most decided improvement over the previous conditions, under which, with wholly
insufficient means, the Institution was obliged to avail itself of the privileges so gen-
erously granted by such of the steamship companies as were willing to take its
freight gratuitously or at greatly reduced rates, and to accept such service as the
companies could afford to give on these terms. While the railroad service could be
improved both in this country and in Europe by a somewhat increased expenditure.
which, however, it is as yet impossible to make, the arrangements so far consum-
mated by the Institution, both as to ocean transportation and the distribution of
packages received from abroad for the United States, are fairly satisfactory.

Exchange relations with Spain, which were suspended during the continuance of
the recent war with that country, have been reestablished, and by direction of
the Spanish secretary of state, under date of September 30, 1899, the Ministerio de
Fomento at Madrid has been designated to receive and distribute all parcels sent from
the United States through the Smithsonian Institution, thus becoming the recognized
medium of exchange in Spain.

Since the last report full exchange relations have been established between the
United States and Costa Rica; but all efforts in the direction of inaugurating an official
bureau for handling miscellaneous exchanges in Japan have so far failed, although the
government of that country bears the expense of distributing such publications as are
sent to the various governmental institutions and to individuals officially connected
therewith.

For the past six months China, with a single exception, has been the only country
in the world in which there have not been some means of distributing exchanges.
Formerly the Zi-ka-wei Observatory at Shanghai attended to the matter, but it has
lately been forced to decline further service. The Chinese minister at Washington has
taken much interest in the International Exchange Service and has expressed him-
self not only in favor of sending regularly to this country the official publications of
his government in exchange for the congressional and departmental documents of
the United States, but also of establishing in China an official bureau through which
exchanges could be distributed to institutions and individuals throughout the Empire.
Until recently it was thought that negotiations were progressing favorably to this
end, but the present condition of the Chinese Government will, it is feared, indefi-
nitely postpone the consummation of this plan.

Messrs. William Wesley & Son, at London, Dr. Felix Fligel, at Leipsic, and Dr.
Joseph von Ko6résy, at Budapest, continue in the service of the International
Exchanges as salaried agents, and to them, as well as.to the large number of agents
who gratuitously serve the Institution in the distribution of exchanges, grateful
acknowledgments are due.

The cost for purchase, collection, and transportation of these accessions has been
$4,400. Besides this there has been spent for books, photographs, apparatus, and
office furniture the sum of $1,100. :

The following improvements have been made in the buildings during the year:

Principal animal house.—The floor, hastily constructed of cheap material in 1891,
has been relaid throughout, a new boiler and an enlarged heating plant suitable for
maintaining the temperature necessary for tender tropical animals has been installed,

85
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and the stairway at the eastern end has been rebuilt so as to offer more convenient
access to the boiler room. Cost, $1,400.

Antelope house.—The east wing of this structure, left unfinished for want of funds,
has been completed and furnished with suitable cages. The cages along the western
front have also been fitted with steel bars and a series of open-air paddocks built
along the west side. A cement floor has been laid, extending under the cages. Total
cost, $2,500.

Aquarium.—The old pumps received from the Fish Commission with the general
plant being worn out, new salt-water pumps with hydraulic motors were supplied.
A steam boiler with coil for heating salt water was put in, a tank for cooling the
water also constructed, and a thermostat installed that controls the temperature of
the water within 2° F. For transporting salt water a new outfit of cans was pur-
chased. The supply is brought from Norfolk by steamer. Total cost, $900.

Temporary house for birds.—There being no suitable house for birds in the park,
the small frame building formerly used for dogs was fitted up with outside cages and
bathing pools. It is far from being satisfactory, as there is no means for heating it.
The hardier species of birds, together with some that should be supplied with better
protection, were housed here for the winter. Cost, $650.

New paddocks and sheds for moose, caribou, fallow deer, and arctic fowes.—The acces-
sion of these new species made it necessary to construct paddocks and shelters near
the western entrance of the park, each provided with a pool or other water supply.
Cost, $1,400.

Cage for harpy eagle.—A commodious open-air cage was built for this fine bird ata
cost of $150.

Fence for buffalo paddocks.—The strong iron fence built for the bison was unsatis-
factory as it has been much bent and injured by the frequent plunging and butting
of these powerful animals. It has been replaced by a Page wire fence stretched
between iron posts. The resiliency of this structure makes it much less liable to
injury, and the animals attack it much less frequently than they do a stiff resisting
fence. Cost, $1,000.

Driveway along Rock Creek.—This road, provided for by a special clause in the act
appropriating funds for the park, has been continued by making a short connecting
branch under the Klingle bridge, by repairing the damage done by the ice jam in the
winter of 1898-99, by completing the masonry dam required for the protection of the
roadway at the lower ford near the site where formerly stood the Adams mill,
and by making the ford practicable for carriages. As several serious accidents have
oecurred through attempts to cross at the fords on this road during high water, posts
and chains have been placed on either bank near the fords and access to them is
prevented during a dangerous condition of the stream. The cost of the extension of
this driveway was equal to the amount appropriated, viz, $5,000.

Main driveway.—This was resurfaced with gravel from Quarry Road bridge to the
concourse, at a cost of $400.

Walks.—In front of the new outer yards at the antelope house a crushed-stone walk
was made connecting with the general system, at a cost of $300.

Repairing damages of storm.—On June 2, 1900, there occurred a remarkable and
unprecedented rainfall, nearly 3$ inches falling during two hours. This did much
damage to the roads and waterways in the park, especially on the eastern side, where
the raw condition of the banks of earth made for the grading of the contiguous city
roads caused hundreds of tons of gravel and débris to be precipitated upon the park,
filling up the pelican pond, tearing down fences, destroying gutters and drain pipes, ete.
The repair of this damage and the resurfacing of the roadways and walks cost $1,400.

Care of grounds.—The general care of the grounds, including the trimming of forest
growth, removal of dead and injured trees, thinning and pruning, the care and trans-
portation of nursery stock, etc., cost $700.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 87
BOUNDARY OF THE PARK.

The following legislation has been enacted affecting the boundaries of the park:

For the purpose of opening Cathedral avenue in accordance with the highway
extension plans, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to
convey all right and title of the United States in and to a parcel of land bounded on
the north by block two of the subdivision called Meridian Hill, and on the east by the
east line of said block two extended southward, and on the west by the east line of
Sixteenth street west, as said line is now extended and laid down through said block
two, and on the south by a line parallel to W street of the city of Washington and
distant ninety feet north from the south line of said W street, to the parties owning
a good and unincumbered title in fee simple to lots numbered twenty-two to twenty-
nine, both inclusive, in block numbered five of the subdivision called Woodley Park,
in the District of Columbia, containing about one hundred and three thousand five
hundred square feet of land, and adjoining the land of the United States embracing
the Zoological Park, upon the conveyance by said parties of the said lots to the
United States: Provided, That said lots in said Woodley Park, when so conveyed
to the United States, as aforesaid, shall become a part of the said Zoological Park and
shall be subject to the inclusion of so much of the same on said Cathedral avenue as
may be necessary for the purpose of opening the said avenue. (Sundry civil act,
July 1, 1898. )

For grading and regulating Cathedral avenue from Connecticut avenue to Woodley
road and the highway along the west border of the Zoological Park from Woodley
road to Cathedral avenue, as shown on the plan of the permanent system of high-
ways, third section, twenty-one thousand dollars: Provided, That parties interested
first deposit with the collector of taxes of the District of Columbia an equal sum to
be used toward defraying the cost of the work: And provided, That the full width of
the highway bordering the Zoological Park be donated to the District of Columbia
whenever it lies within the limits of Woodley Park. And the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia are hereby authorized to use as a highway so much of the Zoo-
logical Park as lies within the lines of said proposed highway. (District act, June 6,
1900. )

A sketch map showing the several successive alterations of the boundary of the
park in this region is herewith appended.

Removal of trees from Cathedral avenue.—It will be noted that the most recent legisla-
tion cedes to the District of Columbiaa strip of ground required for Cathedral avenue.
This strip was planted during 1891 and 1892 with fine evergreen trees, which have
grown well and are now large and very valuable specimens. These have been care-
fully removed by special apparatus so as to disturb the roots as little as possible, and
replanted in various situations throughout the park where needed, at a cost of $1,100.

The amount appropriated for the park during the year was $75,000, of which $5,000
was for continuing the driveway along Rock Creek already mentioned and $5,000 for
widening the Adams Mill road near the entrance to the park. It will be remembered
that this road is partly without, partly within, the park. The terms of the act refer
to the portion without the park and are as follows:

And five thousand dollars shall be expended in widening the Adams Mill road
entrance to the Zoological Park from the corner of Eighteenth street and Columbia
road, by acquiring by purchase or condemnation of land sufficient to widen the same
to a width of one hundred feet, and such road, so widened, shall farm a parkway under
the control of the Zoological Park. (Sundry civil act, March 3, 1899.)

An estimated valuation of the property affected by the widening prescribed by

this act showed that the sum appropriated was far from adequate for its purchase.

It was also found that there would necessarily be some difficulty in placing a resi-
dential street under the control of the Zoological Park owing to the municipal regu-
lations concerning water, gas, sewers, etc. It was therefore deemed best to defer
action until the sense of Congress could be had concerning the matter. During the
last session the law was changed by the following legislation:

The unexpended balance of the amounts, aggregating eight thousand dollars, here-

tofore appropriated for widening, grading and regulating Adams Mill road from
Columbia road to the Zoological Park entrance is hereby reappropriated, to be
88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

expended under the direction of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia; and
the control of Adams Mill road is hereby vested in the said Commissioners of the
District of Columbia and all proceedings necessary to purchase or condemn the land
necessary to widen said road as authorized by act approved March third, eighteen
hundred and ninety-nine, providing for sundry civil expenses of the Government for
the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, nineteen hundred, and for other purposes, shall
be taken by said Commissioners. (Sundry civil act, June 6, 1900. )

It is hoped that the provisions of this act may result in an improyement of the city
roads giving access to the park. At present they are far from satisfactory.

The improvement of the Adams Mill road (without the park) has been necessarily
delayed owing to the advance of property and the above-mentioned difficulties. A
similar condition has prevailed at the western entrance to the park, near Con-
necticut avenue extended. An appropriation was made some years ago for the
widening and improvement of this street, but it appears to have been insufficient
as the work has never been completed. Its unfinished aspect greatly mars the
approach to the park, and during wet weather the road, which has not been macad-
amized, becomes very muddy and unpleasant for carriages. As the roads within
the park are among the best in the District and give access to beautiful drives in
the upper park along Rock Creek, it seems highly desirable that this condition
should not continue.

It should be noted that the act appropriating funds for the District of Columbia
has this year provided for a road to be led along the left bank of the creek, finally
abutting upon the park at the situation shown upon the annexed map. The exact
terms of this act are as follows:

To construct,a masonry retaining wall between Cincinnati street and Woodley road
to define the limits of a new driveway, which the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia are hereby authorized to lay out along the east side of Rock Creek from
Connecticut avenue to Zoological Park, four thousand dollars: Provided, That all land
within the limits of said highway between Cincinnati street and Woodley road shall
first be dedicated to the District of*Columbia. (District act June 6, 1900. )

In the report of two years ago it was mentioned that the bridge over Rock Creek
near the Quarry road entrance had begun to show signs of decay. This has increased
alarmingly, and it was thought best to have the structure examined by an expert
engineer. Mr. H. R. Leonard, of Philadelphia, a civil engineer recommended by the
bridge department of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, made a report on the struc-
ture to the effect that it was unsafe and should be immediately replaced by a new
one. Heavy traffic over the bridge was at once stopped and Congress was asked to
appropriate the sum of $10,000 for an iron bridge. Afterwards, owing to the advance
in price of iron, it was asked that this amount be increased to $12,000. It was finally
determined by Congress that a bridge either of natural or artificial stone should
be constructed, and the sum of $22,000 was appropriated for the purpose. The con-
struction will be conducted under the direction of the engineer Commissioner of the
District of Columbia.

The question of completely inclosing the park with a boundary fence has been
considered during the year. The fence built in 1890 was not completed at the lower
portion along the banks of Rock Creek, and was never extended across the roads at
the various entrances. Besides this, successive changes of boundary and the con-
struction of roads along the boundary line at the lower end of the park have made
it necessary to remove the fence in that region. It should also be noted that even
where the fence is complete it affords no effective barrier against predatory dogs and
cats. In consequence of this, several accidents to animals have occurred. The
number of attacks of dogs up to June 30, 1900, is as follows:

August, 1891, Virginia deer seriously injured by dogs.

October 10, 1891, prong-horn antelope, frightened by dogs, ran into fence of pad-
dock and broke its neck.

October 3, 1892, two South American deer killed by three dogs.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 8

March 31, 1896, three goats killed by dogs.

December, 1897, mule deer buck, frightened by dogs, ran into fence, broke its
horns, tore off one hoof, and was otherwise so badly injured that it never recovered.

January, 1900, pack of dogs killed two deer and injured four, three of which
died in consequence.

The cats prey upon the wild birds, squirrels, and other small animals, and are
eyen asource of danger for some of the captive colonies of ground squirrels and
prairie dogs. Attempts have been made to remedy this by increasing the force of
watchmen, by strewing poisoned meat near the deer pens, and by removing from
the park all domestic dogs which attract their kind. The most effectual remedy
would of course be a dog and cat tight fence with guarded gates. An appropriation
of $20,000 for a fence of this character was asked of Congress, but has not yet been
granted.

It should be noted, moreover, that the maintenance of guarded entrance gates
involves an increase in the number of watchmen and the advantage gained seems
hardly commensurate with the annual expense required, for even with the best
repairs the old fence will not prove an effective barrier.

The expense of a thoroughly protective fence inclosing the entire park is undoubt-
edly an obstacle to its erection. If it is impracticable to make so large an inclosure,
T would still recommend that a considerable section of the more secluded portion of
the grounds be thus fenced off. This would be of the greatest value for the exhibi-
tion of game birds of all species, for deer, antelope, rabbits, squirrels, ete.

The situation of the park at the bottom of a deep valley, while it adds to its seclusion,
entails some disadvantages. The city roads that lead into it are steep in grade, and
during great storms like that of June 2, 1900, the storm water is precipitated in tor-
rents upon the park, bringing down tons of débris that clog the pipes and overwhelm
the roads. The only effective remedy for this is the construction of culverts of suffi-
cient size to readily carry into the creek all the water that may fall. The raw slopes
of the city streets that lie on a higher level than the park to the eastward continue to
be a great source of annoyance, as large quantities of red mud wash down from them
upon the park grounds after every heavy rain.

During the year the District Commissioners constructed a sewer from Ontario
avenue through the park, connecting with the intercepting sewer formerly constructed
by them. The point where this sewer enters the park at Ontario avenue should be
protected by a proper retaining wall. Such a wall should also be built along Klingle
road, where the little stream that follows the park boundary for a short distance has
cut into the road.

The circular sent to officers abroad with reference to collecting animals for the
National Zoological Park has elicited some very satisfactory responses. Mr. E. 8.
Cunningham, United States consul at Aden, Arabia, states that wild animals can be
procured in that vicinity at low rates and that transportation to New York can be had
without great difficulty. Two young lions and two beautiful young leopards have
already been secured by his efforts. The consul at Maracaibo has secured free trans-
portation for his animals and has offered to attend to procuring them. The consul
at Singapore sends a list of animals that may be procured at that port, with prices of
the same, which are far below those at which the same animals can be obtained here.
Other officers abroad have also offered to procure animals.

Mr. M. W. Gibbs, the consul at Madagascar, collected some of the rare animals of
that region, expecting to deliver them to the U.S. 8. Chicago, whose commanding officer
had been instructed by the Navy Department to transport them for the park.
However, for some reason not clearly understood, the officer in command of the
Chicago refused to take the animals. The bubonic plague shortly appeared in Mada-
gascar, the shipment of animals then became impracticable, and it therefore became
necessary to release them.
90 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Through the good offices of the consul at Winnipeg, Manitoba, a fine pair of
young moose was procured for the park, and the consul at St. Johns, Newfound-
land, has undertaken to procure a pair of the little-known Newfoundland caribou
(Rangifer terrx-nove). Mr. K. K. Kenneday, consul at Para, Brazil, secured a
valuable collection of eighteen small mammals and birds from his excellency the
governor of the province. A large female tapir belonging to this collection died en
route.

Other contributors have been as follows:

Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, U. 8. V., commanding the Department of Matanzas
and Santa Clara, Cuba: Ten flamingoes, and on behalf of Gen. Dantin y Feliz, a
pair of jutia-conga.

Lieut. Commander W. H. H. Southerland, U. 8. N., commanding U. S. S. Scor-
pion: Two crab-eating raccoons, obtained off the mouth of the Orinoco River.

Lieut. William A. Lieber, jr., U.S. A.: A black ape and a moor macaque, obtained
by him while serving in the Philippines.

Lieut. Roger Welles, jr., U.S. N.: A young Baird’s tapir, obtained on the Isthmus
of Panama.

Capt. George F. Chase, U.S. A.: A Philippine deer.

Alfred Benitz, Calchaqui, Argentine Republic, through James M. Ayers, United
States consul at Rosario, a very fine female white-lipped peccary.

Maj. Charles A. P. Hatfield, U. S. A., Puerto Principe, Cuba, on behalf of his
daughter, Miss Helen Hatfield, two jutia-conga and one sandhill crane.

The advent of these specimens and of others from domestic sources has taxed the
park very severely to supply the necessary quarters. In several preceding reports
attention has been drawn to the fact that there is not at present in the park any
adequate housing provided for birds, reptiles, or small mammals. The larger cats
are well housed, but for other classes the accommodations are insufficient. Animals
from widely different regions, accustomed to different surroundings, temperature,
and protection, are crowded together in a single building with the same conditions
of heating, lighting, ventilation, and shelter. While the park has the nucleus of an
excellent collection of aquatic birds, there are no suitable quarters for them during
winter and they are then deprived of the proper bathing facilities. In consequence
of this the whole of the fine group of flamingoes received from Cuba was lost. The
parrots and macaws are necessarily placed during winter on top of the other cages
within the principal animal house. In this situation they are not properly protected
and the mortality is consequently far above what it should be.

The reptiles of the park are in no better case. The rare and curious specimens of
the giant tortoise from the Galapagos Islands are housed in an office room wholly
unsuited for them, with but little sun and insufficiently ventilated. Many visitors
never see these strange and remarkable animals. The alligators are unreasonably
crowded, and often injure each other in consequence. There being no room for
tanks for other amphibious creatures, no attempt has been made to obtain the rapidly
disappearing American crocodile or any of the large sea turtles of our coast. The
collection of snakes is very badly crowded, one case sufficing for the great tree
snakes—pythons, boas, and anacondas being crowded together in a manner that is ©
uncomfortable for the animals and confusing to the public. All this is in marked
contrast to the practice in the best zoological gardens elsewhere, which have reptile
houses with glass cages, in which the animals can receive proper attention and have
earth, water, and sunlight. The recently constructed reptile house at the New York
Zoological Park cost $48,000, and is one of the chief attractions of the place.

The small mammals are so inadequately housed that visitors have complained of
certain cases. Many of them have no outside yards, and nothing can be done toward
providing them with natural surroundings or with secluded breeding cages. In this
the cardinal principle that was in view at the establishment of the park is violated,

and something must be done to remedy these defects if any proper results are
expected.

Immediate steps should be taken for the erection of a suitable bird and reptile
house, as well as a house for small mammals, these being the most important needs
of the park at the present time.

Some attempts have been made during the year to collect rare and valuable
American animals by organizing special expeditions on a limited scale. ,

The great Kodiak bear of Alaska, of which mention has been made in former
reports, is especially desired, not only because of its great size, but also because it is
rapidly disappearing. Persistent but fruitless efforts have been made to procure this
animal through the various fur-trading agencies that have posts in the country it
inhabits. It was finally determined to send out Mr. Elwood Hofer, a well-known
guide and hunter of the Yellowstone Park, who has served the Smithsonian well on
many occasions. Mr. Hofer went to the Alaskan coast and Kodiak Island in April,
but he did not succeed in capturing any bears nor even in taking cubs. Mr. Hofer
was also commissioned to procure other Alaskan animals. The extent of country
over which he was obliged to travel and the exingencies of transportation did not
permit him to do much in this way. His total collections amounted toa grizzly bear
cub, three black bear cubs, a young porcupine, and some ground squirrels. None of
these, with the possible exception of the grizzly bear cub, whose specific characters
have not yet been determined, are characteristic of Alaska, and could have been
readily procured much nearer to the park. The expedition must be considered as a
failure, owing to the difficulty of carrying on extended operations in that country
and the scarcity of the animals.

Another animal that has been especially desired is the mountain sheep. . Several
attempts have previously been made to obtain specimens of this animal by offering
definite prices to hunters. These have been unsuccessful, probably because the men
have not been able to procure the necessary outfit and supplies for a long and arduous
expedition. Finally a contract was made with Mr. C. 8. Jones to make a special
expedition for the purpose. Through the intervention of Senator Wolcott the goy-
ernor of Colorado kindly accorded permission to collect in that State for the United
States Government. It was hoped to procure three pairs of animals, but only two
young lambs, both males, were captured, and these have since died.

An attempt was made to collect the California condor, the largest flying bird in
North America, now rapidly becoming extinct. The park has procured one young
specimen of this fine bird by purchase.

The aquarium has been an object of considerable interest to visitors during the

year. Acknowledgment should be made of the courtesy shown by Mr. J. E. Jones,
the director of the public aquarium at Battery Park, New York City, who has greatly
added to the interest of the collection here by exchange of valuable specimens, among
which were several of the beautifully colored tropical fishes from the Bermudas.
Considerable attention has been paid during the year to the preparation of plans and
estimates for a new aquarium building suitable for the permanent installation of an
attractive exhibit, but Congress has made no appropriation for the purpose.
- Besides the service rendered by the Park to the schools, which was commented on
in a previous report, the value of its collections has received recognition from another
source. Well-known illustrators, including Messrs. Charles R. Knight, J. M. Gleeson,
and L. A. Fuertes, have worked here during the year for considerable periods, and
some of Mr. Ernest Seton-Thompson’s charming pictures are based on studies made
in the park.

Of the more important photographic work may be mentioned that of Mr. A. Rad-
clyffe Dugmore, the author of “‘ Bird Homes,” whose picture of a beaver is shown here-
with, and that of Mr. E. F. Keller, of New York City, whose photographs of mule
deer, bear, moose, and antelope are also reproduced.

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1900.

Sm: The kinds and amounts of the Observatory property are approximately as
follows:

ELLIS Se OS Ae ES he eS $6, 300. 00

During the past year the acquisitions of property of the kinds just enumerated
have been as follows:

(a) Apparatus.—Astronomical and physical apparatus has been purchased at an
expenditure of $2,100.'| The main separate items are an equatorial mounting for 8-inch
telescope, with clock and with coelostat attachment; a 10-inch concave mirror of 75
centimeters focus, and a special tremor reducing support and magnetic shielding
device designed for use with a new galyanometer of extraordinary sensitiveness. A
12-horse power motor with connection to the city electric service, for use in running
the cooling plant, has been installed at a cost of $200.

(b) Library and records.—The usual periodicals have been continued, and additional
photographie star and moon maps have been purchased, the total expenditure for
these purposes being $200.

Total accessions of property, $2,500.

No alterations of consequence have been made in the Observatory buildings and
grounds. The cost of repairs to buildings has aggregated $200.

Losses of property have been inconsiderable, from a monetary point of view, but I
regret that a box of bolographs containing the originals of some of the illustrations of
the forthcoming Volume I of the Annals was injured by water during my absence on
the eclipse expedition, and the bolographs (about 20in number) were much damaged.
It is fortunate, however, that negatives of them are preserved.

THr WorK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

Two objects have principally occupied the Observatory staff during the past year—
first, the publication of Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, Volume I, and,
second, the observation of the total solar eclipse of May 28, 1900. Considerable time
was, however, devoted to the design and construction of the sensitive galvanometer,
with magnetic shielding and steady support above alluded to.

It will be most convenient to describe the work of the year under three headings,
as follows:

1. Publication.

2. Progress of the usual work of the Observatory.

3. Observation of the solar eclipse.

(1) Publication.—Volume I of Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, now being
issued, containing an account of the research on the infra-red solar spectrum and the

"I here include only such apparatus as is of permanent value to the Observatory,
and not such as served a merely temporary purpose in connection with the recent
total solar eclipse.

100 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mapping of the absorption lines in this region, and of subsidiary investigations con-
nected with these, comprises nearly 300 pages, uniform in size with Smithsonian
Contributions. It is illustrated by abort thirty-five full-page or folded plates and
numerous text figures. The text contains full descriptions of the apparatus and
methods employed in mapping the infra-red solar spectrum by the aid of the bolom-
eter, and gives as a result of research the positions in deviation and in wave length,
as well as the relative intensities of over 700 absorption lines or bands between the
visible limit of the red at A (0.76 sc) and what is practically the limit of the solar
spectrum for terrestrial purposes at 6 /.

A chapter is devoted to a discussion of the seasonal and other variations in terres-
trial absorption, which have been noted at many points in the infra-red spectrum.
These variations, and especially those of a seasonal character, to which attention has
been drawn in several of my earlier reports, form an extremely interesting and per-
haps important feature of these studies.

It is greatly to be regretted that the very best photo-mechanical processes are
inadequate to justly reproduce the bolographs, upon whose evidence the spectrum
lines are determined, and this I fear will prove a still more serious hindrance to the
publication of the photographic results of the eclipse expedition shortly to be
described. This unavoidable inadequacy of representation is a very considerable
obstacle to the satisfactory publication of astronomical and, to a lesser extent, other
scientific results, in these days when the advance of science is increasingly connected
with the interpretation of delicate photographie detail.

(2) Progress of the usual work of the Observatory.—The ordinary operations of the
Observatory have been much restricted by the two special lines of work already
alluded to, for it must be recalled that the present observing force consists of but two
persons, so that the long preparations for the eclipse and the reading and rereading
of the proof sheets of the Annals left little time for other work.

As mentioned in my last report, designs were then entertained for constructing a
new galyanometer of the highest sensitiveness, with a support calculated to reduce to
the lowest limits the earth tremors which are so prejudicial in the use of such sensi-
tive instruments, and with a thorough system of magnetic shielding to enable the
galyanometer to escape the fluctuations of the magnetic field. This apparatus has
been finished, excepting the needle system of the galvanometer, and was tried in
January of this year with a temporary needle system of only 1.9 milligrams weight.
The result appears to be promising. As thus tried, with the galvanometer case par-
tially exhausted and a time of swing of about three seconds, no fluctuations of the
spot of light reflected from the galvanometer mirror exceeding 0.1™ could be
observed on the scale 2 meters distant. The system of support and the magnetic
shielding appear, therefore, to be very perfect, and a few words describing them may
be appropriate here.

System of support.—A massive pier rises through the basement room of the new
laboratory to the level of the ground floor. Upon this is a four-legged table 8 feet
high, whose top is a flat iron ring of about 500 pounds weight. Four iron cylinders
are fastened upon the top of the ring, and in these float on mercury smaller iron
cylinders supporting a second iron ring. From the floating ring descend three steel
wires, each 15 feet long, passing through holes in the capstone of the pier and sup-
porting a heavy cage of iron, in which is the galvanometer. The points of support
are at the plane of the center of gravity of the iron cage, and also in the plane of
the support of the galvanometer-needle system. Four dampers in glycerin baths
prevent torsional vibration of the cage. Thus the whole is a combination of four
methods of reducing the effects of earth tremors. First, a deep solid pier; second,
a ‘‘rickety table,’ supporting a weight of 1,600 pounds; third, a mercury flotation
of 1,000 pounds, whose center of gravity is below the mercury itself; fourth, a long
‘Julius three-wire suspension,’’ supporting 700 pounds.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 101

System of magnetic shielding.—Three magnetic shields are employed. The outer is
a square iron box without top or bottom and of about 2 tons weight. Within this,
and supported on the swinging iron cage, are two concentric iron cylinders, of which
the inner is only 3 inches in diameter and immediately incloses the galvanometer,
No side openings are made in the shields, the galvanometer being read by means of
a spot of light reflected vertically through a glass in the capstone of the pier.

It will be noticed from this description that all observations will be conducted in
the upper room, while the galvanometer itself is below the level of the ground in a
room of very constant temperature. It is hoped shortly to continue work on this
apparatus, and to provide the galvanometer with a needle system of great sensitive-
ness, which it is thought from the experiments already made may be used without
prejudicial tremors in a vacuum and at ten seconds (single) vibration. If these
expectations should be realized the useful or working sensitiveness of the new
galvanometer will be several hundred times that customarily employed in mapping
the infra-red solar spectrum, and a large new field of work will be practicable.

(3) Observation of the solar eclipse-—Considering the near approach of the path of
totality of the total eclipse of May 28, 1900, you deemed it desirable for this Observa-
tory to take part in the observation of this important astrophysical phenomenon, and
this view having recommended itself to Congress, an appropriation of $4,000 was
made immediately available for the purpose in February. The use of the special
apparatus already belonging to the Observatory, the very generous offer by Prof.
E. C. Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory, of the loan of the
new 12-inch lens of 135 feet focus belonging to the Harvard College Observatory, and
of several other valuable pieces of optical apparatus, together with loans of a 5-inch
lens of 38 feet focus by Princeton University, and of a 5-inch equatorial by the Naval
Observatory, enabled the expedition to take larger proportions than this modest
appropriation might otherwise have justified.

This apparatus with many other adjuncts was temporarily installed in Washington
in the Smithsonian grounds, and placed in the position each piece would occupy in
the actual eclipse. This was with the view of familiarizing the observers with them,
by successive rehearsals, which went on with assiduous practice during two months
before all was taken down for shipment to the proposed site.

Choice of site—Three successive years of special observations had enabled the
Weather Bureau to determine the relative chances of cloudiness at various points
along the eclipse track, and from these results it appeared that the interior of the
country was more favorably situated in this respect than those parts of the path lying
near the coasts. Certain towns appeared more favorable than others, owing to local
conditions, although such special results were less trustworthy than the broad indica-
tions already cited. However, as the Eastern stations were to have both a higher
solar altitude and a longer duration of totality, and as personal inspection of the
- ground by me, together with a careful consideration of the Weather Bureau results,
seemed to justify the selection, the town of Wadesboro, N. C., was approved by you
in preference to stations more remote from Washington. The actual grounds
occupied formed a nearly level plat of several acres extent, sheltered from the wind
by knolls, buildings, and trees, but being almost the highest land thereabouts, and
indeed about 600 feet above sea level. These grounds were freely offered by John
Leak, esq., of Wadesboro. A shed and the necessary piers for instruments were
erected in the latter part of April.

Plate No. VIII gives a ground plan of the Smithsonian camp, showing the canvas
covers of the two 135-foot tubes, the sheds containing the bolometric apparatus and
its accessories, and the photographic cameras for the 40-inch and 11-foot lenses, with
numerous other pieces; and also on the left a portion of that of the Yerkes Observa-
tory.

Plate No. IX gives a general view of the camp as finally occupied. The equipment of
the Smithsonian expedition is shown at the right of the wagon track, while on the

left is a portion of that of the Yerkes Observatory. The 135-foot horizontal telescope
is under the canvas seen on the right. Its companion tube is hidden by it. On its
left extremity is seen, though on a very diminished scale, the ccelostat mirror which
‘‘fed”’ it (this is shown on an enlarged scale in the next illustration), and also the
box of the 6-inch aperture camera equatorially mounted. Immediately in front of the
tube and cutting off a portion of the view are the sheds containing the apparatus for
the bolometric study of the corona and that for the large cameras for the 11-foot and
other lenses. The great Grubb siderostat and other pieces of apparatus are hidden
from view by the sheds. On the right of the sheds and immediately in the fore-
ground is the 5-inch achromatic loaned by the United States Naval Observatory.
At the right hand extremity of the long tube is seen the photographic house, which
serves equally for the 135-foot lens and for that of the 38-foot focus lens, which latter
is in the tube inclined upward.

Nature of the observations.—The chief aim of the observations was the investigation
of the corona, and of this especially the inner portions. This investigation was three-
fold—photographic, bolometric, and visual. In addition to these main objects there
was included the photography of the sky near the sun for the discovery of possible
unknown bodies, an attempt to photograph the ‘‘flash spectrum’’ with an automatic
‘amera, and the observation of times of contact both by the ordinary visual methods
and by photography.

Pieces of apparatus employed.—(a) Apparatus for photographic purposes: For the
- direct photography of the inner corona the 12-inch lens of 135 feet focus was used as
a horizontal telescope in connection with a ccelostat carrying an 18-inch plane mirror.
(Plate X.) Here are shown on a large scale the lens in question, the extremity of
its canyas tube, and the ccelostat and equatorially mounted camera described in the
preceding plate. It was also arranged to use with this lens just before second con-
tact an objective prism forming a spectrum upon a plate moved each second by clock-
work, and thus suited to catch the ‘flash spectrum,”’ so called. This necessitated a
second tube 135 feet long, inclined at about 8° to that used for the direct photographs
of the corona. Both tubes were made of black canton flannel and were 42 inches
square with diaphragms of progressively increasing size 10 feet apart. The two tubes
were fastened to trestlework and were covered by long canyas A tents. Nearly 1,000
yards of canvas and flannel were thus made up. The direct tube ended in a small
photographic house which had been prepared in sections and was transported from
Washington. Plates 30 inches square were here exposed.

The direction of the long tubes was necessarily a matter of care, as they had to be
placed beforehand where calculation showed the sun would be, and were incapable
of adjustment.

Besides this great horizontal telescope, the 5-inch 38-foot lens was also used for
obtaining inner coronal photographs. This lens was mounted upon a pole in such a
way as to be in line with the sun from the east window of the photographic house at
the moment of totality. A conical tube of white canvas, well blackened within, and
36 inches square at its lower end, ran from the house to the lens, but was not attached
to the lens or its mounting. There being thus no provision for following the appar-
ent motion of the sun with the lens, a suitable motion was given to the photographic
plates by means of a water clock. With this instrument 11 by 14 inch plates were
employed.

Upon the same instrument which carried the 18-inch mirror of the horizontal tele-
scope (shown in Plate X) was mounted equatorially a 6-inch photographie lens of
7% feet focus, provided with a conical tube, so that a considerable field was covered.!

' The focal curve of this lens was determined and it was intended to use a nest of
small plates so arranged as to be in focus over a large field. On the night before the
eclipse, however, it was so warm that the wax used to fasten the plates softened
repeatedly, and after several trials it was found necessary to use a flat plate, on which
the focus was good for perhaps 6° from the center.

THE BOLOMETRIC APPARATUS.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1038

A shade glass opaque to violet light was placed over this lens. The purpose of
the shade glass was to enable a comparison to be made between the form of the outer
corona as photographed with yellow and green light and as photographed with the
complete coronal radiations by other lenses shortly to be described.

Within the eastern part of the shed there was mounted upon an improvised polar
axis a collection of four cameras, quite ponderous in appearance, as indicated in
Plate XI, but really not very heavy, and well provided as to moving gear by being
connected with the very accurate spectrobolometer clock. These cameras were two
similar pairs, one with short-focus, the other with long-focus lenses. The former
were two landscape lenses of 43 inches aperture and 40 inches focus, each provided
with a 30-inch square plate. In front of one lens was placed a shade glass opaque to
violet light. The two long-focus lenses were of 3 inches aperture and 11 feet focus,
and were thus like those recommended in the Harvard College Observatory Circular
No. 48 as most suitable for a photographic search for a possible intramercurial planet.
The axes of these two cameras were inclined so that together they covered a space
east and west of the sun about 12° by 28° in extent. Their fields were found to be
so nearly flat as to make it undesirable to use a nest of plates arranged upon acuryed
surface, as recommended in the Harvard circular above alluded to, and each camera
had a single plate 24 by 30 inches.

All the photographs with the seven lenses above described were taken upon Cramer
double coated isochromatic plates of great rapidity.

An automatic camera, giving exposures from a break-circuit chronometer beating
seconds, was provided for the purpose of securing the times of contacts. This camera
had a 22-inch lens with pin-hole aperture, and the exposures were made upon very
slow nonhalation celluloid plates 15 inches in diameter, rotated slightly after each
exposure by an electrical escapement. One plate was provided for first contact, one
for both second and third, and one for fourth contact. Asno clockwork was applied
to moye this camera, the successive exposures made a spiral series of images of the
sun, from the appearance of which the gradual encroaching of the moon could be
observed.

(b) Apparatus for bolometric purposes: This consisted of a complete bolographic
outfit, including not only the great Grubb siderostat with supplementary mirror,
but also a double-walled chamber of nearly uniform temperature. The view of it is
shown in Plate XII, and its purpose was to enable the total radiation of the inner corona
to be observed, and in addition, if practicable, to determine the distribution of these
radiations in the spectrum. The latter observation it was hoped would throw light
on the composition of the corona, for it is well known that different substances and
different temperatures have each its characteristic energy spectrum. A beam of
light from the 17-inch mirror of the great siderostat, reflected due south into the shed,
passed through a cat’s-eye diaphragm whose aperture was controlled by the observer
at the galvanometer, thence to a condensing mirror, which reflected the rays directly
back to the focus at 1 meter distance, where was a slit 1 centimeter high and 1 milli-
meter wide. From the slit the rays were reflected out of the optic axis of the con-
densing mirror by two parallel plane mirrors, and fell upon a collimating mirror
of 75 centimeters focus. Thence they were reflected upon a prism 8 inches in dia-
meter, one of whose surfaces was silvered, so that the prism might be used either
to refract or reflect the rays, according as the glass or silvered face was turned
toward the collimator. From the prism the rays passed to an image-forming mir-
ror, in the focus of which, at 75 centimeters distance, was the bolometer strip 1 centi-
meter high and 1 millimeter wide. The bolometer and galvanometer with their
accessories were essentially as used for solar spectrum work in Washington, and
while the optical train, with its seven reflections and small slit, greatly reduced the
radiations, the sensitiveness of the bolometer was yet such that subsequent observa-
tions on the full moon gave a deflection of 85 divisions when the aperture of the dia-
phragm was but 17 centimeters square.
104 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Nevertheless it was found that no ‘‘drift’’ or ‘‘ wiggle’’? was noticed when the glass
plate in front of the bolometer case was removed. Accordingly there was no plate
in front of the bolometer at the time of the eclipse, and of course none was interposed
during the observation just recorded.

The expedition was strengthened by the presence of Professor Hale, of Yerkes
Observatory, who used a second beam from the 18-inch coelostat mirror, also driven
by the great siderostat, in connection with bolometric apparatus for the purpose of
observing if a difference in radiation could be detected between the coronal rifts and
streamers.

(c) Apparatus for visual observations. Four visual telescopes were employed for
observing the coronal structure and the times of contact. These were:

A 5-inch of about 6 feet focus (shown in Plate XIII), loaned by the United States
Naval Observatory, haying an equatorial stand and clock.

A 6-inch of 74 feet focus with equatorial stand, but no clock.

A 33-inch of 8% feet focus with rough alt-azimuth stand.

A Coast Survey meridian transit instrument of about 23 inches aperture and 23 feet
focus used as an alt-azimuth telescope to observe contacts.

THE PERSONNEL OF THE EXPEDITION.

The Director, Mr. 8. P. Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, observed
with the 5-inch equatorial; and the other members of the expedition were assigned
as follows:

Mr. C. G. Abbot, aid acting in charge, with Mr. C. IK. Mendenhall to the bolo-
metric apparatus.

Mr. T. W. Smillie, photographer of the National Museum (in general charge of
photography, including the development of all plates), specially to the direct 135-
foot focus camera.

Mr. F. E. Fowle, jr., junior assistant, to the 38-foot focus camera.

Mr. G. R. Putnam (detailed from the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey)
to the determination of latitude and longitude, the observation of times of contact,
and the direction of signals.

The Rey. Father Searle, C. 8. P., together with Mr. Paul A. Draper and Mr. C. W. B.
Smith, to the combination of che wide field cameras.

Mr. De Lancey Gill to the 6-inch photographie telescope and the objective ash

Mr. R. C. Child to the 6-inch visual telescope, the electrical circuits of the chrono-
graph, the prismatic camera, and the contact camera.

The Rey. Father Woodman, C. 8. P., to the 33-inch telescope.

Mr. A. Kramer, instrument maker, to the movements of the siderostat and 5-inch
equatorial. z

Besides these there volunteered for the day of the eclipse Mr. Little, of Wadesboro,
and Mr. Hoxie, assigned, respectively, to strike signals and to record contacts for Mr.
Putnam.

Prof. George E. Hale was connected, as already said, with the Smithsonian party,
while at the same time in general charge of the Yerkes Observatory expedition, whose

camp adjoined ours.
THE EXPEDITION.

After the preparation of the apparatus and the preliminary rehearsal for the eclipse
on the Smithsonian grounds, a freight car was completely filled with the apparatus,
and left Washington May 2.

The first four members of the expedition, Messrs. Abbot, Fowle, Kramer, and
Smith, left Washington May 3, and were followed in a few days by two more, Messrs.
Putnam and Draper, the former of whom, however, returned after determining the
latitude and longitude and helping to adjust several polar axes. Messrs. Smillie,
Mendenhall, Child, and Gill reached Wadesboro May 16, and the other members of
the party arrived about two days before the time of the eclipse. Pleasant accommo-

dations were found in the town, only about a quarter of a mile from camp, and the
greatest courtesy was shown to the eclipse expedition at all times by the townspeople.
A pleasant feature was the presence of large parties from Yerkes Observatory, Prince-
ton Observatory, and from the British Astronomical Association. The days and—
toward the last—a considerable portion of the nights were busily occupied in adjust-
ing and trying the apparatus. On May 26 and 27 full rehearsals took place in prep-
aration for the final event.

The day of the eclipse was cloudless and clearer than is usual in the Eastern States,
though the sky was not exceptionally blue. All the programme was carried out suc-
cessfully, except only that Professor Hale’s bolometer suffered an accident which pre-
vented him from obtaining bolometric evidence of rifts and streamers, but not from
securing other interesting data.

After the eclipse the members of the expedition returned home in nearly the same
order as they came, and the last members to leave reached Washington June 1.

THE RESULTS.

1. With the 135-foot direct camera.—Mr. Smillie secured five negatives during the
eclipse, all good. Three others which he exposed after totality were of much less
value, as was to be expected. The enormous scale of these photographs (the moon’s
disk measures 153 inches in diameter), together with the excellent detail in the promi-
nences and inner corona, make them most interesting.

Plates XIV! and XV! show, respectively, the south polar streamers and a group of
prominences on the southwest limb. As remarked at an earlier page, it has proved
impossible to adequately reproduce the delicate detail of the originals. In the two
illustrations given the subjects are so marked that a still interesting result is shown
even after the loss of the finer structure. But the equatorial coronal streamers,
though in the original clearly shown to be finely subdivided, curiously curved and
even recurved, interlocked and arched, are so delicate that it was hopeless to attempt
their reproduction. Even contact prints fail to show their structure unless made on
glass plates, and thus viewed by transmitted light.

Some, but I think not all the prominences, appear to be set each within its little
coronal arch, and thus present the so-called ‘‘hooded’’ appearance which was
noted in photographs of the Indian eclipse of 1898. I am quite sure, however, that
this feature is much less marked than was then the case.

Tt would hardly seem possible that the directions of the curved equatorial streamers
can be assigned to such a simple system of foci as has been sometimes supposed,
for their arrangement appears to be complicated to the last degree. Nothing final
can yet be said on this point pending a thorough examination, and this it is hoped
will yield many interesting results. :

2. With the 135-foot prismatic camera.—Nothing of value was secured with this
instrument. The plate appears to have been exposed at successive intervals, but was
completely fogged over, no spectrum appearing.

3. With the 38-foot camera.—Mr. Fowle obtained seven negatives during totality,
all good. Others taken after third contact were of little value. What has been
said as regards the results with the 135-foot camera applies very well here, except
that not quite equal detail was secured, owing to the lesser power of the apparatus.
Somewhat greater coronal extension was, however, obtained in the longer exposures,
because of the greater focal ratio of the lens, and Plate XVI is given to illustrate this
part of the corona.

4. With the 6-inch photographic telescope.—Mr. Gill obtained an excellent negative of
eighty-two seconds’ exposure, showing the longest extension of the coronal streams
obtained with any of the instruments. It seems probable, however, that a some-
what better result would have been reached with a less exposure or a less aperture.

}These are not enlarged, but are portions of the original focal images of over 15
inches diameter already referred to as obtained in the 135-foot focus camera.
106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The greatest extension obtained exceeds three diameters from the moon’s limb,
Here the streamers fade away into the background of sky, as if overpowered by
skylight rather than as here ending.

5. The combination of four wide-field cameras.—These cameras were all in a measure
successful, though not in equal measure, for one of the long-focus and one of the
short-focus negatives was better than its mate, the former being on a better plate
and in better focus, while the short-focus camera with screen showed unaccountable
effects of motion not found in any others.

Comparing the long-focus with the short-focus negatives, the former were far supe-
rior both as corona pictures and as showing faint stars. One of the 11-foot focus
negatives has probably the best general view of the corona secured by the expedi-
tion. (See Plate XVII.) On this plate the corona is seen asawhole. It hardly shows
the full extent of the corona, which, as seen by the naked eye, extended to nearly
three solar diameters, but it exhibits most clearly the curves on either side of the
solar streamers, although perhaps not showing quite as great extension as that
obtained with the 6-inch photographic telescope.

As regards faint stars and new objects, the better of the two 11-foot focus negatives
covering the region west of the sun shows 114 stars, the faintest being of the 8.4
magnitude as given in Argelander’s Durchmusterung, a result which, considering the
amount of diffused light during the eclipse and the milkiness of the sky, is almost
surprising. Six uncharted objects were found upon this plate, which appeared star-
like and may conceivably be intra-mercurial planets, though nothing is to be under-
stood as here predicated of them until a later and careful examination of the plates.

This photograph was unsuited for purposes of direct reproduction for the reason
that the fainter stars required the best of conditions for seeing even on the original
and would inevitably have been lost. It was nevertheless thought interesting to give
an accurate map showing all the stars and suspects found, and this is done in Plate
XVIII. The general reader will perhaps gain a better idea of the value of photog-
raphy as an aid to investigation when he sees in this map, obtained in eighty-two
seconds exposure, in a brighter than moonlit sky, not only the corona and the planet
Mercury just beyond its rays, but more stars near the Pleiades than he can see with
the unaided eye in the darkest night. Astronomers are invited to compare this map
with the Durchmusterung charts, to see both the strong and the weak points of
the plate. It will be recognized that the outer portions of the map show fainter
stars than the middle part, and thus it is indicated that advantage in focus would
have come if the plate had been slightly concave.

The negative covering the region east of the sun was much less satisfactory, and
showed but 13 stars, the faintest being of the 6.3 magnitude. Two uncharted objects
were found, but of their starlike character there is less certainty than in the case of
four of the six discovered on the western plate.

The positions of these objects as interpolated on the Durchmusterung charts for
the epoch 1855 and their approximate position for 1900 are as follows:
