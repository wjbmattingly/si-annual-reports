UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1901,

BY

RicHarp RatTHsBunN,

Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U.S. National Museum.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Through the munificence of James Smithson, an Englishman, the
United States came into possession in 1838 of about half a million
dollars, to be used ** for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” The wise counsels that prevailed in interpreting the provisions
of this bequest, a large one for that time, led to the employment of a
portion of the fund for founding a museum for the nation, universal
in its scope and usefulness.

The authority for carrying out this purpose was embodied in the
Congressional act of 1846 establishing the Smithsonian Institution,
which directed that there be delivered to it, whenever suitable arrange-
ments could be made from time to time for their reception, ‘‘all
objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects
of natural history, plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens
belonging to the United States.” Provision was also made for the
growth of the collections by exchange, donation, or otherwise, and
for the arrangement and classification of the specimens in a manner
best to facilitate their examination and study. The first Board of
Regents, upon which devolved the task of effecting a definite plan of
organization for the Institution, expressed its concurrence in this
feature in the following resolution, passed in January, 1847:

Resolved, That it is the intention of the act of Congress, and in accordance with the
design of Mr. Smithson, as expressed in his will, that one of the principal modes of
executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and
objects of natural history and of elegant art, and the gradual formation of a library
of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge, to the end that
a copious storehouse of materials of science, literature, and art may be provided,
which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men, and shall assist the

original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves to the pursuit

of any branch of knowledge.

4 REPORT OF NATIONAZ MUSEUM, 1901.

Thus were taken the initial steps that have resulted in the building
up of the National Museum of to-day, the largest branch of the
Smithsonian Institution, and already endowed with resources which
‘n extent. variety, and richness are surpassed, if at all, by only a very
few of the older museums of the world. The actual] nucleus of the
Museum, however, was formed a few years earlier by a society first
known as the National Institution and afterwards as the National
Institute, organized for the avowed purpose of directing the Smithson
bequest and of engaging in the pursuit of objects in consonance with
the terms of that foundation.

One of these objects was the gathering of historical and natural
history specimens from both official and private sources, among the
former haying been the important United States Exploring Expedi-
tion around the world, from 1838 to 1842. The museum of the society,
which occupied rooms in the Patent Office building, came virtually to
be recognized as the proper place for the deposit and care of all Gov-
ernment collections held in Washington. Another important service
rendered by the society, as pointed out by Dr. Goode, was in the
direction of educating public opinion ‘‘ to consider the establishment of
such an institution worthy of the attention of the Government of the
United States.” Failing, however, to secure the public recognition
at which it aimed, the National Institute became inactive as early as
1846, though it was not until 1861 that it finally passed out of exist-
ence. The Government collections in its possession, which were
among those covered by the fundamental act of 1846, remained practi-
cally in the custody of the Commissioner of Patents up to 1858, when
they were turned over to the Smithsonian Institution. Other material
directly under the control of the National Institute was retained at the
Patent Office until 1862, and a portion of the historical collection
until 1883. .

At the time of the foundation of the Institution probably not more
than one or two universities or learned establishments in America had
so large an endowment, and it was apparently the idea of Congress
that the fund left by Smithson was ample to meet the needs of the
multifarious operations then proposed. These included, besides the
custody of the national and other collections confided to its care,
whereby the Museum was made an integral part of the Institution, the
accumulation and maintenance of a large library, the conduct of sci-
entific investigations, and the dissemination of useful knowledge, for
all of which purposes the construction of an adequate building was
primarily required and immediately determined upon. Inthe absence
of any stated limitations as to the time when the transfer of the Gov-
ernment collections should take place, the date for accepting the obli-
gation rested with the Regents, who, while confronted with the man-
datory language of the law, were still forced to recognize the inadequacy

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 5

of the fund at their disposal for the support of so large an undertaking.
The cost of the extensive and elaborate building, designed mainly for the
accommodation of the Museum and Library, would have drawn heavily
upon the principal of the fund, had nota policy of delay prevailed, nine
years being allowed to elapse between the laying of the corner stone,
in 1846, and the completion of the structure. This delay gave oppor-
tunity for influencing a change of sentiment, so that when, in 1857, the
necessary arrangement became possible, Congress was prepared to vote
means for building cases, for transferring the specimens from the
Patent Office, and, to a certain extent, for the care and preservation
of the collections. So inadequate, however, were the sums granted
that for many years the slender income of the Institution was heavily
drawn upon to insure the maintenance of what was then called the
Smithsonian Museum, and justly enough, since the building was paid
for out of the Smithson fund, and considerable portions of the collec-
tions were and still are the actual property of the Institution, through
exploration, gift,and purchase, and a number of the officials in charge
of the collections were employed at its expense.

While the collections in the custody of the National Institute
remained at the Patent Office, as before stated, until 1858, material
for a museum was in the meantime being accumulated at the Smith-
sonian Institution. The first scientific collection to come into its pos-
session, and, in fact, it accompanied the bequest, was the small but
valuable mineralogical cabinet of James Smithson, the founder, who
was himself,a chemist and mineralogist of repute and a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London. This collection was unfortunately destroyed
by fire in 1865, The personal bent of Professor Baird, who became
an assistant secretary of the Institution in 1850, was toward the col-
lection of natural-history specimens for purposes of study. With the
approval of Secretary Henry he put into operation plans for accom-
plishing this object, which, fostered and encouraged, were soon yield-
ing regular and abundant returns. Professor Baird’s own vacations
were spent in field work. Officers of the Army and Navy and of
other branches of the Government service, fishermen, fur traders,
private explorers, and such powerful commercial organizations as the
Hudson’s Bay Company and the Western Union Telegraph Company
were enlisted in the cause and rendered valuable assistance. The
influence exerted by these beginnings has been lasting and widespread,
as shown in the extensive natural-history operations of subsequent
national and State surveys, the organization of the United States Fish
Commission, and the support given to scientific collecting by many
other bureaus of the Government.

The title ‘‘ National Museum,” first recognized by Congress in 1875,
came into general use through the display of the Government collee-
tions at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876. This was
6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

the first exposition in this country in which the Government partici-
pated, and the first to make known to vast numbers of the people of
the United States the existence of national collections at Washington,
as well as new methods of installing and exhibiting museum materials,
differing radically from the older cabinets of college or local museums
which prevailed up to that time. After its close the material brought
back belonging to the Government, together with the extensive gifts
made to the United States by private persons and foreign govern-
ments, forced the erection of a separate building, which brought the
name ** National Museum” into greater prominence. Since that time
Congress has in the main provided for the maintenance of the Museum,
but its management remains, by the fundamental act, under the
authority of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, administered
through their Secretary, who is ex officio the keeper—a form of goy-
ernment insuring a consistent and uniform policy and a nonpartisan
administration of its affairs. The greater part of the Smithsonian
building is still used for museum purposes, and the Institution, as
well as all the scientific bureaus at Washington, cooperate, both
through men and material, in enlarging and caring for the national
collections. |

With the primary object of preserving the collections in anthro-
pology, biology, and geology obtained by the national surveys, every
effort is being made, through exchange, donation, purchase, and the
encouragement of exploration, to so increase its possessions that the
Museum of the Government may in time contain the fullest possible
representation of all branches of science and the arts capable of being
illustrated in a material way. The specimens are classified in two
series, one comprising the bulk of the material, being arranged for
the purposes of scientific research and reference in laboratories and
storerooms, to which students are freely admitted; the other, selected
with regard to their general educational value and popular interest,
and accompanied by descriptive labels, being displayed in e@lass-ecoy-
ered cases in the publie halls. The duplicate speciinens not required
for exchanges are made up into sets for distribution to schools and
colleges throughout the country. Papers descriptive of the collee-
tions, both technical and popular, are published for gratuitous cireu-
lation to the extent of three or more volumes yearly; and, finally, the
Museum has come to be regarded as a sort of bureau of information
in respect to all subjects with which it is concerned even in the
remotest degree, the correspondence which this involves now consti-
tuting one of its heaviest tasks,

The history of the Museum, as pointed out by the late Dr. Goode,
may he divided into three epochs, which he characterized as follows:

First, the ]

eriod from the foundation of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, dur-
ing which time specimens were collected solely to serve as materials for research.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 7
No special effort was made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize them, except
as a foundation for scientific description and theory.

Second, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of the
‘National Cabinet of Curiosities,’ to 1876. During this period the Museum became
a place of deposit for scientific collections which had already been studied, these col-
lections, so far as convenient, being exhibited to the public and, so far as practicable,
made to serve an educational purpose.

Third, the present period (beginning in the year 1876), in which the Museum has
undertaken more fully the additional task of gathering collections and exhibiting
them on account of their value from an educational standpoint.

During the first period the main object of the Museum was scientific research; in
the second, the establishment became a museum of record as well as of research;
while in the third period has been added the idea of public education. The three
ideas—record, research, and education—cooperative and mutually helpful asthey are,
are essential to the development of every great museum. The National Museum
endeavors to promote them all.

In the same connection, Dr. Goode also defined the scope and objects
of the Museum in the following concise manner:

It is a museum of record, in which are preserved the material foundations of an
enormous amount of scientific knowledge—the types of numerous past investigations.
This is especially the case with those materials that have served as a foundation for
the reports upon the resources of the United States.

It is a museum of research, which aims to make its contents serve in the highest
degree asa stimulus to inquiry and a foundation for scientific investigation. Research
is necessary in order to identify and group the objects in the most philosophical and
instructive relations, and its officers are therefore selected for their ability as investi-
gators, as well as for their trustworthiness as custodians.

It is an educational museum, through its policy of illustrating by specimens every
kind of natural object and every manifestation of human thought and activity, of
cisplaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and of distributing its
publications and its named series of duplicates.

AS A MUSEUM OF RECORD.

In its function as a museum of record the growth of the National
Museum has been unprecedented, due mainly to the rapid exploration
and development of a rich and extensive country under the liberal
and progressive policy of the Government. From scientific institu-
tions throughout the world, from foreign governments, and from
individuals abundant stores of great value have been received, either
as gifts or through the medium of exchange of specimens, and a small
fund in recent years has permitted of some purchases to supply
desiderata.

The principal sources of the collections may be briefly summarized
as follows:

1. The explorations carried on more or less directly under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, or by the Institution in con-
nection with educational institutions or commercial establishments, and
the efforts, since 1850, of its officers and correspondents toward the
accumulation of natural history and anthropological material.
S REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

2. The United States Exploring Expedition around the world from
[888 to 1842. the North Pacific, or Perry, Exploring Expedition from
1858 to 1856, and many subsequent naval expeditions down to and
including the recent operations in the West Indian and Philippine
waters.

2° The activities of members of the United States diplomatic and
consular service abroad.

4. The Government surveys at home, such as the Pacific Railroad
survey. the Mexican and Canadian boundary surveys, and the surveys
carried on by the Engineer Corps of the U. S. Army; and the activi-
ties of officers of the Signal Corps, and other branches of the Army
stationed in remote regions.

5. The explorations of the United States Geological Survey, the
United States Fish Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the
Bureau of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution, and
other scientific branches of the Government.

6. Donations and purchases in connection with the several exposi-
tions at home and abroad in which the Museum and Fish Commission
have participated, among these having been the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia in 1876, the international fisheries exhibitions at Berlin
in 1880 and at London in 1883, the New Orleans Cotton Centennial
Exposition in 1884 and 1885, the Cincinnati Exposition of 1888, the
World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and the expositions
at Atlanta in 1895, at Nashville in 1897, and at Omaha in 1898. The
returns from the World’s Fair in Philadelphia were of greatest extent,
comprising, besides the collections displayed by the United States in
illustration of the animal and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the
ethnology of the native races of the country, valuable gifts from thirty
of the foreign governments which participated, as well as the indus-
trial collections of numerous manufacturing and commercial houses of
Europe and America.

7. Exchanges with foreign and domestic museums and with indi-
viduals. :

Immediately preceding the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, when the
collections were entirely provided for in the Smithsonian building,
the number of entries of specimens in the Museum record books was
about 235,000, In 1884, when the additional room afforded by the
new building gave opportunity for taking a provisional census of the
large accessions received from Philadelphia, and from other sources,
the number had grown to 1,471,000. Now. at the close of 1901, it
amounts to nearly 5,000,000,

While these figures convey no impression of the bulk of the collec-
tions, when it is considered that in 1885 all of the space in both build-
Ings was completely filled, and in fact was so overcrowded that a third
building was already being asked of Congress, some conception may
be had of the conditions now existing. The storerooms are packed to
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 9

their utmost capacity, making it difficult to gain access to the speci-
mens or to provide adequately for their safety. For many years most
of the objects received have had to be stored in outside and unsafe
structures where they are mainly piled up in the original packing
boxes, and where has already accumulated enough material of great
intrinsic and scientific value to fill an additional building as large as
that now occupied by the main collections.

AS A MUSEUM OF RESEARCH.

Tn order to permit of their examination and study, as provided in
the act of establishment, the collections of the Museum are, to the
extent of its accommodations, arranged systematically and in a manner
convenient for reference. Access to the reserve or study series, so
called, consisting of the main body of the collections and as complete
in all the groups as the accessions haye made possible, is given to all
properly qualified persons engaged in original research. The oppor-
tunities thus afforded are widely availed of, the Museum being visited
every year by many investigators, some of world-wide distinction,
coming from the scientific centers of European and other foreign
countries as well as from all parts of the United States. Material is
also occasionally sent out to representatives of other institutions
having the means of providing for its safekeeping, when required in
the working up of special subjects, or for comparison in connection
with their own collections.

The custodianship of the collections being the first and most
imperative duty devolving upon the scientific staff of the National
Museum, its members find comparatively little time during office hours
for advancing knowledge, though they are mostly well qualified for
such work, being selected with special reference to their ability to
identify and classify the specimens under their charge in accordance
with the latest researches. As a matter of fact, however, the staff
does produce every year a large number of papers descriptive of the
collections, which together constitute an important contribution to
scientific literature.

Among the honorary officers having their laboratories at the Museum
are a number of assistants employed by other scientific bureaus to con-
duct investigations on material kept here in their charge, and in whose
results the Museum shares.

Many collections have, from time to time, been transferred by the
Geological Survey, the Fish Commission, the Department of Agricul-
ture, and other branches of the Government to the custody of the
Museum in advance of their final working up, in order to provide for
their safe storage and to secure the better facilities for study here
afforded. Under this arrancement the amount of research work car-
ried on in the Museum building has been greatly increased.

Though having little means to expend for field work, members of
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

the Museum staff are occasionally given opportunities to participate in
the explorations of other Government bureaus or of private expedi-
tions. in connection with which special researches may be carried on,
though the chief advantage results from the acquisition of new ane
valuable material and a knowledge of the conditions under which it
occurred.

AS AN EDUCATIONAL MUSEUM.

The educational side of the Museum is intended to consist mainly of
an exhibition of all the classes of objects which it represents, so
mounted, installed, and labeled as to directly interest and instruct the
general public. The principal difficulty incident to the proper installa-
tion of such a collection, conceding all the space required, lies in the
selection of its parts, so that while enough is displayed to convey the
amount of information which it is intended to impart, the visitor shall
not be overburdened or confused with details. While this policy is
being followed in the National Museum so far as its means permit, the
lack of room has always prevented a complete or satisfactory develop-
ment of the plan, and every succeeding year the conditions in this
respect grow worse instead of better through the increased crowding
of the halls. The advances in recent years have been chiefly in the
methods of display, in the character of individual and group mountings,
and in the labeling, in all of which directions exceptional progress has
been made.

A year ago it was announced that all of the halls designed for pub-
lic use were then for the first time permanently open, though none
were above addition or improvement, while in some the arrangement
was entirely provisional. This was only accomplished by the transfer
of large quantities of material to outside storage, but during the past
year it has unfortunately been again necessary to shut off one of the
most attractive halls in order to furnish increased space for work-
rooms.

In this connection it seems appropriate to refer to the work of Dr.
Goode, than whom no museum administrator ever had a better under-
standing of the public needs. He labored earnestly and conseien-
tiously to make this a museum for, as well as of, the people, and the
plans now being carried out are, in all their essential features, of his
making. While the assistants might be relied upon to arrange and
maintain the study series in a manner accept able to the specialist, the
interests of the public always remained in his immediate charge. He
Was ever occupied in devising ways for so presenting the features of
nature and the activities of mankind that by the very force of his sur-
roundings the visitor was bound to receive and carry with him some
definite impressions, some new bit of know ledge. Dr. Goode’s labors
in this field ranged from the planning of the general scheme to the most
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 11

minute details of case architecture and fittings. His official connec-
tion with nearly all the important expositions of the past quarter of a
century and his exhaustive studies of all the principal museums of
Europe and the United States gave him exceptional opportunities for
observation and experiment. Though a young man when he died, none
other had acquired so ripe an experience and none is more worthy
of being followed.

An incidental though very popular educational feature of the
Museum, having for its purpose the promotion of scientific teaching
throughout the country, has been the distribution to schools and col-
leges of its duplicate specimens, properly identified and labeled, and
put up in carefully selected sets. Inadequate means have prevented
this measure from being carried out on the scale which the resources
of the Museum would admit of, but many hundreds of such sets have
already been given away.

Searcely a year passes that some exposition, either at home or
abroad, is not occupying the attention of the Museum, and through
this means its existence and aims are brought constantly and promi-
nently before the public. These expositions have of late followed one
another so closely and have required so extensive preparations as to
interfere greatly with the ordinary work of the Museum, but the
practice of introducing new and varied features, of showing a fresh
series of objects or improved groupings in connection with each one,
insures a substantial gain, as the collections are returned to Wash-
ington, besides fulfilling the important function of making museum
methods known to the people of the United States and stimulating
the growth of museums in many quarters.

Though mainly technical and most useful to the investigator, the
publications of the Museum can be classed, ina general way, as belong-
ing to its educational side, being the medium through which the nature
and extent of its collections are made known. The Annual Report,
first printed as a separate volume of the Smithsonian Report in L884,
and now in its eighteenth volume, consists, besides the administrative
part, mainly of semipopular papers on interesting portions of the col-
lections. ‘The Proceedings and Bulletins are almost exclusively tech-
nical, the shorter papers being assigned to the former and the larger
and more exhaustive works to the latter. Of the Proceedings twenty-
two complete volumes have been issued and of the Bulletins fifty
numbers.

PRESENT CONDITIONS AND NEEDS.

Attention has repeatedly been called to the inadequacy of the pres-
ent accommodations for the national collections. The Smithsonian
building had become fully occupied some twenty-five years ago, when
the large contributions to the Government from exhibitors at the
12 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition led to the erection of the Museum
building, completed in 1881. By 1885 this structure was also filled, and
though numerous efforts have since been made to secure more ample
quarters, all have met with failure. In 1888, 1890, and 1892, the
Senate yoted $500,000 for a new building, and in 1896, $250,000, but
none of these measures was even considered in the House of Repre-
sentatives.

There has been no abatement in the number of collections received
annually, but, in fact, a general increase from year to year, and a
severe task has thus devolved upon the Museum authorities in arrang-
ing for their disposition. New specimens have constantly been added
to the exhibition halls and storage rooms until both are overcrowded
to the extent that in the one the objects, as a rule, can not be properly
viewed by visitors, and in the other their classification has become
impossible, and they are for the most part practically inaccessible for
study. But so extensive have been the accessions that only a part
could be disposed of in this manner, and it became necessary, several
years ago, to resort to outside storage, which is now provided for in
an old wooden shed upon the Mall and in several rented buildings.
None of these buildings is of fireproof construction, though they con-
tain collections of great value and in large part not replaceable. They
also lack facilities for the classification and arrangement of the speci-
mens, which are packed away in shipping boxes and, for the time,
serve no purpose of any kind.

The collections made by the Government surveys, of which the
Museum is the legal custodian, can continue to be received and housed,
as additional storage buildings may be leased, if necessary, though
the further provision of the law to make them at all times available
for study and examination can no longer be carried out. The same
upplies to specimens obtained by purchase or exchange and to such
donations as are given without condition. The Museum is, in fact,
being resolved into a mere storehouse of material which comes to it
mainly without solicitation, and its larger purpose, while never lost
sight of, is becoming more and more difficult to maintain. Its reserve
or record collections in every branch should be so systematically
‘arranged that any specimens desired for study could immediately be
round; the public exhibition should comprise the entire ‘ange of
Museum subjects, and be installed effectively and without crowding,
and there should be ample and well-appointed working quarters, in
which all the activities of the establishment could be conveniently
carried on.

With the conditions as they now are, it is not to be wondered at that
the National Museum lacks that character of support which has done
so much for many other museums. Its donations are generally small
and relatively unimportant. The possessors of large and valuable
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

collections will not present them where they can not be at once dis-
played or well arranged. Such inducements can now rarely be offered
here, but many of the larger museums elsewhere owe their principal
growth to generous gifts from wealthy patrons of science and the arts.
Specific mention could be made of several large collections which their
owners would have preferred to place at the national capital, but which
have been given to or deposited in other museums, because in Wash-
ington they would have to be packed away for an indefinite period, at
great risk of injury and destruction.

The amount of floor space ocgupied by the national collections is
very much smaller than would appear to the casual visitor. The two
main buildings contain, in fact, only 195,486 square feet, to which the
outside buildings, mostly rented, add 43,203 square feet, making a
total of 238,689 square feet. The latter are partly occupied by work-
shops, but are mainly used for the gross storage of specimens, and in
no case for exhibition or for the arrangement in classified order of the
reserve series.

In London the subjects represented by the United States National
Museum are distributed among several museums, such as the British
Museum, leaving out the Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum,
andthe Museum of Practical Geology, which now have anagegregate of
989,388 square feet of floor space, soon to be increased by 400,000 to
500,000 square feet in the new addition to the Victoria and Albert
Museum. In Berlin seven of the national museums relating to natural
history and the industrial arts possess some 575,000 square feet of area,
and the new National History Museumof Vienna has over 350,000 square
feet alone. In our own country, the American Museum of Natural
History in New York City, which, when completed, will cover a ground
area of over 53 acres, already has 356,800 square feet of floor space
avaliable.

A study of the conditions in Washington has shown that to prop-
erly arrange the national collections and provide for the growth of
perhaps fifteen or twenty years would require additional floor space to
the extent of something like 400,000 or 500,000 square feet. If this
were obtained through the construction of a new building having that
amount of room, it would still be necessary to utilize both of the pres-
ent buildings, and this seems the preferable course to pursue.

SUMMARY OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE YEAR.
APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

The total amount appropriated by Congress for the maintenance of
the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1901, was
$263,540, that for the previous year having been $238,540. The prin-
cipal changes as compared with 1900 were an increase of $10,000 for
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

preservation of collections, an increase of $9,000 for repairs to build-
ings, and a separate appropriation of $10,000 for the purchase of

specimens. The appropriation for furniture and fixtures included

$2,500 for furnishing a lecture hall, and that for heating, lighting,
and electrical service $3,500 for beginning the installation of an
electric-lighting system.

The expenditures from the appropriations for 1900-1901 amounted
to $246,824.67 up to the close of the year, leaving a balance of
$16,715.33 to meet outstanding liabilities. During the same year
$11,026.06 were disbursed from the balance of $11,400.81 of the appro-
priations for 1899-1900 on hand June 30, 1900.

The following tables show the expenditures during the year 1900-

BUILDINGS.

The principal alterations and repairs to buildings comprised the
fitting up of a lecture hall, the strengthening of the roof of the
Museum building, the substitution of terrazzo pavement for the last
of the old wooden floors in the same building, and the starting of a
comprehensive system of electric wiring for the exhibition halls and
offices of the Museum building.

The old lecture hall, first established in the north west range and sub-
sequently occupying the west north range, was a few years ago liter-
ally crowded out of existence through the encroachment of collections.
By the transfer of certain materials and workrooms to outside
buildings it has been possible during the past year to restore this
important feature, and with the small sum specifically appropriated by
Congress the east north range, at the left of the main entrance, has been
adapted to the purpose. The walls and ceiling were tastefully painted
in shades of green and the windows provided with shutters for dark-
ening the room when the stereopticon is used. The platform, seats,
lantern stage, and other furnishings are of the simplest character, and
are also removable to permit of installing collections for exhibition at
any time. The four large Flemish tapestries depicting scenes in the
life of Alexander the Great, deposited in the Museum by Gen. P. H.
Sheridan in 1886, are now hung in this room, and it is proposed to
add other objects, requiring only wall space for their installation, to
complete its decoration.

A number of years ago a small electric plant, including a dynamo
and gas engine, was installed to meet the requirements of that time
for lighting the storerooms, workrooms, offices, and dark passages.
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Proving inadequate for the growing needs of the Museum, it has
become necessary to arrange for taking current from one of the elec-
tric companies and for enlarging and extending the system of wiring.
Under authority of Congress the new installation has been planned on
a scale ample for also lighting the exhibition halls in the Museum
building, thus providing the possibility for opening them at night,
should the requisite means be provided. The work was carried on
during the last year under an initial appropriation of $3,500, since
supplemented by one of $5,000, which should insure its completion
before the close of 1902.

The roof of the Museum building, never entirely satisfactory and
developing many weak points during recent years, has been repatred
and strengthened, under the advice of a competent engineer, to the
extent that its character warrants, and it is hoped that it can be made
to answer for a few years longer.

Taking advantage of the necessity for replacing the steam boilers
in the Museum building, which are now worn out beyond repair, and
for the renewal of which an appropriation of $12,500 was made at the
last session of Congress, plans were completed before the end of the
year for an entire revision of the heating system. It is proposed to
install in the Museum building a battery of two boilers of sufficient
power to heat both buildings, as well as the adjacent Museum shops, for
which heretofore additional boilers in the Smithsonian building and
a furnace in the stable building have been required. By this means
it is expected to obtain a better service with greater economy of fuel
and labor. ;

ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTIONS.

The additions to the collections during the year, received in 1,470
separate lots or accessions, amounted to 178,987 specimens, or about’
27,000 less than the previous year. The total number of specimens
in the possession of the Museum, as indicated by the records, has
thereby been increased to 4,994,672, though the actual number is
much greater, for the reason that, while thousands of very small
objects are often contained in a single package, it has been customary *
to estimate the contents of such packages at a small nominal figure.

The decrease in the receipts as compared with 1900 was confined to a
few divisions. In most divisions there was an increase, and in some
the Increase was very marked. The scientific value of the additions
Was, Moreover, especially noteworthy.

The most extensive and important accessions as a whole were
ioe as usual, from the bureaus of the Government which are
engaged In scientific explorations, chiefly the Geolocical Survey

logical Survey, the Division of Entomology and the Division of Plants
of the Department of Agriculture. The receipts from private estab-
lishments and from individuals, by donation and exchange, were also
large and of great value, and through the deposit of objects by their
owners many interesting features have been added to the exhibition
series. Field investigations by members of the Museum staff, which
might be made an important means of building up the collections in
directions not otherwise covered, have, from lack of funds, only been
possible on a very limited scale. In fact, except for the opportunities
occasionally afforded to join with the field parties from other bureaus,
the Museum assistants could seldom engage in work of this character.
During last year, however, as elsewhere explained, they participated
in several such expeditions, which were exceedingly fruitful in results.

While the prominent museums throughout the world have generally
the means of adding largely to their collections by purchase, this
method of acquiring specimens has always been a very minor resource
of the National Museum. For the past year Congress has appro-
priated $10,000 for this purpose, and though this sum is altogether
too small to be effective, the amounts previously available were even
much less. Disbursements are almost entirely limited to the purchase
of objects not previously represented, and many important desiderata
are thus supplied from year to year, but the requirements in this
regard can never be at all adequately satisfied without a considerable
increase in the size of the appropriation.

Reference will be made in this connection to only a few of the more
important accessions of the year, the subject being fully covered in
the reports of the head curators and in Appendix II.

In the Department of Anthropology the total number of specimens
received was 31,155, of which 26,644 specimens, or about 85 per cent,
belonged to prehistoric archeology and were mainly derived from two
sources. The largest accession, consisting of over 18,000 stone imple-
ments from an ancient village site in Columbia County, Ga., was pur-
chased of the collector, Dr. Roland Steiner. The second in. size,
comprising over 7,000 similar implements and other objects princi-
pally from Maryland, the generous gift of Mr. J. D. McGuire, con-
stitutes the most important collection eyer made in the Chesapeake
region by a single individual. Two other noteworthy additions in the
same line were collections of flint implements and rejectage of manu-
facture, one secured by the head curator, Mr. W. H. Holmes, during
an investigation of an ancient quarry site in Union County, IIL, the
other, presented by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of London, Eneland,
illustrating the quarrying and stone shaping arts of the primitive
Keyptians.

While the number of specimens added in the Division of Ethnology

NAT Mus 1901 2)

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

was relatively much smaller, several of the accessions were of unusual
interest. Micronesia, Polynesia, and Melanesia were represented by
a collection of native implements, costumes, etc., made by Mr. C. H.
Townsend and Dr. H. F. Moore, naturalists on the U. 8. Fish Com-
mission steamer A/batross during the extended cruise of that steamer
in 1899-1900. Material illustrating the Pamamary and other Indian
tribes of the Upper Purus River and the Bororo Indians of Matto-
Grosso, Brazil, was received as the result of explorations by Prof. J.
B. Steere. of Ann Arbor, Mich., and from the Rey. William A. Cook,
the latter through the favor of Dr. Orville A. Derby, of Sao Paulo,
Brazil. By exchange with the Field Columbian Museum the depart-
ment came into possession of a share of the great collection made by
Dr. Emil Hassler in connection with his important investigations
among the various tribes inhabiting the region of the Upper Paraguay
River in South America and exhibited by him at the World’s Colum-
bian Exposition of 1898. The remaining accessions in ethnology and
archeology, as will be seen by reference to the list, relate to countries
all oyer the world and to many parts of the United States. The
Division of History has also been greatly enriched through several
donations.

In the Department of Biology the additions numbered 115,767
specimens, of which 78,767 were zoological and 37,000 botanical. The
Division of Insects shows the greatest increase in zoology, 37,000
specimens, followed by Marine Invertebrates with 11,889, Mollusks
with 10,500, Mammals with 7,976, and Birds with 6,478.

One of the most noteworthy accessions was a large amount of valuable
material resulting from recent explorations in the East Indies by Dr.
W. L. Abbott, including mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, mollusks,
and other groups of marine invertebrates, of which a large proportion
of the species represented are probably new to science. The generosity
shown by Dr. Abbott in continuing to make the National Museum the
depository for the many treasures secured during his extended labors
in the little-known regions of the Eastern Tropics is exceedingly grati-
fying. About 300 mammals, 600 birds, and many birds’ eggs and
reptiles were the outcome of Dr. E. A. Mearns’s work in Blorida:
while the expedition to Venezuela of Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. S.
Avmy, and Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was productive of a large collection
of mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, ete., including a valuable series
of bats. The extensive collection of mammals made in Southern
K surope by Mr. Dane Coolidge comprises what is probably the best
series of Italian rodents now contained in any museum in the world.

From a eae trip to Madison County, New York, Mr. G. 8.
Miller, jr., brought back about 200 mammals.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 19

Among the acquisitions in ornithology were many rare and valuable
specimens. The most important single accession was the private col-
lection of Mr. Robert Ridgway, containing about 1,100 North and
Central American birds, many in the first plumage and all exceedingly
perfect preparations. The most valuable additions to the collection
of birds’ eggs were received as gifts from Dr. William L. Ralph, who
is in charge of the section, but some rarities were also contributed by
the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture.

The expedition made to the Amazon River, Brazil, by Prof. J. B.
Steere, on behalf of the Pan-American Exposition, furnished a large
series of characteristic reptiles and fishes. Other noteworthy additions
of reptiles were a collection from the Polynesian Islands made by the
Fish Commission steamer A/bafross, and another from St. Kitts, West
Indies, presented by Mr. W. H. Alexander, United States weather
observer. Among fishes the important accessions were the types of
new species and other specimens obtained about Porto Rico by the
Fish Commission steamer /%sh Hawk in 1899, the types of Hawaiian
fishes collected by Dr. O. P. Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior Uni-
versity, and Mr. T. D. Wood, and a series of Japanese fishes presented
by the same university.

Especially prominent among the additions to the Division of Mol-
lusks was a donation from Dr. W. Eastlake, of Tokyo, Japan, compris-
ing about 500 species of Oriental shells, which have heretofore been
poorly represented in the National Museum. Over 200 species and
3,000 specimens were received from the collecting trip made to Haiti
and Jamaica by Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., and Mr. C. T. Simpson.
Other noteworthy accessions were 225 species of Naiades from South
and Central America, and a large series of Australian shells.

In the Division of Insects the number of accessions reached 297, and
the important ones among them are so many that they can scarcely be
summarized in this connection. Of greatest value was the collection
of Kuropean Lepidoptera brought together by the late Dr. O. Hof-
mann and obtained by purchase. It comprises 15,626 specimens and
is especially rich in the smaller moths.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received six important collec-
tions from the Fish Commission, namely: The ophiurans of the A/da-
tross cruise to the Galapagos Islands and the west coast of Central and
South America in 1891, and described by Drs. Liitken and Mortensen;
the crustaceans from dredgings and shore collecting on the coast of
Japan by the steamer Albatross and Dr. H. F. Moore in 1900; the
corals from the South Sea expedition of the steamer Albatross in
1899-1900, and from Porto Rican waters collected by the steamer /7s/
Hawk: in 1899; a large collection of crayfishes from West Viginia; and
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

the crustaceans and echinoderms collected by the Princeton University
Arctic Expedition of 1899. Other accessions which may be mentioned
are the types of the Oligochete worms collected by the E. W. Harri-
man Alaskan Expedition of 1899, a fine series of the marine and fresh-
water crustaceans of Hawaii, presented by Mr. H. W. Henshaw; and
the specimens of ocean bottom obtained by the U.S. S. ero in its
surveys for cable routes in the Pacitie Ocean.

In botany the most prominent accession was the collection of 10,000
specimens of lichens, from various parts of the world, which had
belonged to the late Henry Willey, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, a
well-known specialist in the group, and which was purchased from his
estate. Next in importance by reason of their size were a collection
of 5,400 plants made in Oregon by Mr. E. P. Seldon and transferred
by the Department of Agriculture, and 1,600 specimens collected in
Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee by Mr. Charles L. Pollard and Mr.
William R. Maxon, of the Museum.

In the Department of Geology by far the greater bulk of the acces-
sions was received from the U. S. Geological Survey, the more impor-
tant contributions from this source comprising a type series of 386
specimens of asphalt and associated rocks from various parts of the
United States; a large number of rocks and ores from the Ten Mile
district, and Silverton, Pikes Peak, and Cripple Creek quadrangles of
Colorado; 375 specimens of Pre-Cambrian marine invertebrate fossils,
including material figured and described by Dr. Charles D. Walcott;
2,370 fossils, mainly brachiopods, from the Cambrian, 2,425 from the
Ordovician of southern Nevada and near El Paso, Texas, and 114
Silurian and 1,550 Devonian fossils from the Helderbergian and
Oriskanian beds of Indian Territory, and the higher Devonian of
Colorado and New Mexico. Other noteworthy additions were exten-
sive and valuable collections of Cambrian fossils made by and under
the direction of Dr. Waleott in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Russia,
Norway, and Sweden; the private collection of Mr. F. A. Randall, of
Warren, Pennsylvania, comprising upward of 3,600 specimens of Upper
Devonian and Lower Carboniferous fossil plants; a remarkably fine
slab of the floating crinoid, Uintacrinus socialis, the gift of Mr. Frank
Springer; a skeleton of the gigantic toothed bird, [lesperornis regalis,
one of the most complete in existence, and of especial value as throw-
ing new light upon the structure of this somewhat anomalous form; a
complete but composite skeleton of the New Zealand meus crassus,;
a fairly complete skeleton of an adult female mastodon, unearthed at
Church, Michigan; an exceptionally fine nugget of native platinum,
weighing 444 grams, from the Nijni-Tagilsk district in the Russian
Urals and some fine clusters of distorted crystals of native silver, in
dendritic and fern-like forms, from the Lake Superior district,

EXPLORATIONS.

The limited appropriations given the Museum have never permitted
more than a very small amount of field work by the members of its
staff, and their efforts in this respect have necessarily been restricted
to expeditions undertaken with the object of securing additions to the
collections or of further elucidating the materials already in its posses-
sion. Most of these explorations have in fact only been rendered
possible through cooperation with other scientific bureaus of the Goy-
ernment or with private establishments and individuals. The extent of
the field work during the past year was, however, above the average,
and its results were of exceeding value.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, under the auspices of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, and in company with Dr. W. A. Phillips, of the Field
Columbian Museum, madea detailed examination of the extensive and
important flint quarries in the vicinity of Mill Creek, Union County,
Illinois, where prehistoric implements occur in great abundance. In
June, 1901, ethnological investigations were begun in the pueblo coun-
try by Dr. Walter Hough, in conjunction w ith Mr. Peter G. Gates,
of Pasadena, California, and chiefly at the latter’s expense. The
work was to be continued during the entire summer. In preparation
primarily for the anthropological exhibit at the Pan-American Expo-
sition, partly at the expense of the Exposition and partly at that of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 23

the Museum, collecting trips were made to Sonora, Mexico, by Mr.
W J McGee, of the Bureau of Ethnology; to the Philippine Islands
by Col. F. F. Hilder, of the same Bureau; to the Indian tribes on the
Upper Purus River, Brazil, by Prof. J. B. Steere, of Ann Arbor,
Michigan; to the Bororo Indians, a 'Tupian tribe dwelling near the head-
waters of the Paraguay River, Brazil, by the Rev. William A. Cook,
and to British Columbia and Alaska by Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. 8.
Navy. Dr. Roland Steiner, of Georgia, continued his investigations
of the quarries, workshops, and village sites of his own neighbor-
hood, near and at the mouth of Shoulderbone Creek and on Little
Kiokee River, and the large collection made there during the year is
now deposited in the Museum.

Through the courtesy of the U.S. Fish Commissioner, Mr. W. H.
Ashmead was detailed in the spring of 1901 to accompany an expedi-
tion to the Hawaiian Islands, where at the close of the year he was
engaged in making extensive entomologiecal collections. Dr. J. E.
Benedict was also permitted to join the Fish Commission steamer /7s/
Hawk during an exploration of the fishing banks in the Gulf of
Mexico opposite Anclote River, Florida, for the purpose of making
preparations of marine invertebrates.

During November and December, 1900, Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr.,
of Washington, to whom the Museum is indebted for many previous
favors, made in the interest of the Division of Mollusks and entirely
at his own expense an important collecting trip to the islands of Haiti
and Jamaica, lasting about six weeks. He was accompanied by Mr.
C. T. Simpson. During the summer of 1900 Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr.,
participated with Capt. Wirt Robinson, U. S. Army, in an expedition
to Venezuela, with the principal object of securing specimens of the
mammals and birds of that region, though attention was also given to
other groups of animals. For collecting mammals, Mr. Dane Coolidge,
by special arrangement, visited Italy, Sicily, and southern France,
and Mr. Gerrit 5. Miller, jr., spent some time in the neighborhood of
Peterboro, New York. Fishes were collected at Key West, Florida,
by Mr. Barton A. Bean and Mr. William H. King. The expedition to
Cuba for the Pan-American Exposition, begun by Messrs. Palmer and
Riley in 1500 and referred to in the last report, was completed early
in the year.

The only important botanical field work was conducted in the States
of Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee by Mr. C. L. Pollard and Mr.
W. R. Maxon.

Under the Department of Geology, Mr. Frederic A. Lucas and Mr.
Alban Stewart visited several localities where mastodon bones had
been reported, with the object of securing a skeleton for the Pan-
American Exposition. A single fairly preserved one was obtained in
a locality in southern Michigan. Mr. Charles Schuchert spent consid-
24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

erable time in collecting fossils in Canada, in the vicinity of Buffalo,
New York, in Maryland, and in eastern Pennsylvania, his inquiries
being specially directed toward fixing more definitely the line separating
the Silurian and Devonian systems in America. Examinations of the
Cambrian fossiliferous deposits of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Russia,
and Sweden were conducted in the interest of the Museum by Dr.
Charles D. Walcott, Director of the U. 8. Geclogical Survey, and
under his direction by Mr. S. Ward Loper and Mr. M. Schmalensee.

Collecting outfits have been furnished to the following persons who
have offered to collect material for the Museum: Commander Frederic
Singer, U. 8. Navy, light-house inspector, Key West, Florida; Dr. 8.
P. Craver, Montevideo, Uruguay; Mr. R. T. Young, Boulder, Colo-
rado; Mr. Selwyn Branch, Roseau, Dominica, British West Indies; Dr.
E. A. Mearns, U. S. Army, Newport, Rhode Island; Mr. Leon J.
Guthrie, United States weather observer, Willemstad, Curacao; Prof.
J. B. Steere, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Mr. Percy W. Shufeldt, Wash-
ington, District of Columbia; Mr. Frank E. Read, Newport News,
Virginia; Mr. Howard W. North, Culver, Indiana; the Baldwin-Ziegler
Polar Expedition; Mr. C. B. Adams, Macon, Georgia; Mr. William C.
Peterson, Canaveral, Florida; Mr. M. L. Robb, Manila, Philippine
Islands.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE OF SPECIMENS.

Ten thousand and sixty-five specimens have been sent out as gifts to
educational establishments and in the conduct of exchanges, and 9,683
specimens have been lent for study. The gifts, which have been com-
paratively few, as little material has been available for the purpose
during the year, consisted mainly of marine invertebrates and casts
of prehistoric implements. A new series of marine invertebrates and
a series illustrating rock weathering and soil formation are in course
of preparation.

Appendix ITT contains a detailed statement of all the distributions.

RESEARCHES.

Research work by members of the Museum staff is necessarily sub-
ordinated to the care of the collections and the development of its edu-
cational features as exemplified in the exhibition halls, leaving them
comparatively little time for original investigations. Notwithstanding
this fact, however, they have contributed extensively each year toward
the advancement of science, as will be seen by reference to the Pro-
ceedings, Bulletins, and Annual Reports of the Museum, in which their
productions are mainly published. The services of scientific men not
connected with the Museum have also been availed of in working up
and reporting upon special groups of objects, but as such assistance can
rarely be paid for, the results accomplished through this means have
been relatively inconsiderable. There is frequent demand for the use
of specimens in conducting researches at the various scientific estab-
lishments throughout the country, and such requests are always com-
pled with so far as possible. It is insisted, however, that the exam-
inations be made in Washington when practicable, and type specimens
or choice objects are only allowed to be taken from the city in excep-
tional cases and when their safety can be absolutely assured. In its
present crowded condition the Museum has very scanty accommoda-
tions for visiting students who desire to work upon its collections,
though a year never passes without a number being given such facili-
ties as exist, and the addition of commodious laboratories would serve
an important purpose in the advancement of research as well as of

‘scientific education in general.

In the Department of Anthropology the head curator, Mr. Holmes,
has completed a report based on his own ethnological and archeolog-
ical observations in the far West during several years past; he has also
nearly finished the manuscript and illustrations for a large work on
the ancient pottery of the United States, begun some time ago, and has
commenced an exhaustive report on the industries of mining and
quarrying among the native tribes. The Curator of Ethnology, Prof.
O. T. Mason, has continued his investigations on the basketry tech-

ee ee oe ee ee a
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. radi

nique of the American Indians, publishing one short paper on the sub-
ject. He has also completed a study on American aboriginal harpoons,
and has given much time to the ethnology of the Philippine Islands,
in this connection having arranged and labeled, primarily for the Pan-
American Exposition, the large Philippine collection brought back by
the late Col. F. F. Hilder. The range of studies conducted by the
Curator of Prehistoric Archeology, Dr. Thomas Wilson, may be indi-
rated by the papers published or presented by him during the year,
which were as follows: ** Prehistoric archeology in America,” ‘SA
classification of arrow points, spearheads and knives of prehistoric
times,” ‘‘ Jade in America,” ** Criminology,” and ‘* Prehistoric tre-
panation.” Dr. Wilson has also made an extensive examination of
prehistoric tools and implements in furtherance of the inquiry as to
whether prehistoric man was ambidextrous or not.

In Biology the number of investigations under way was especially
large. The first volume of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s exhaustive work on
the birds of North and Central America, mentioned in the last report,
was put in type, and the manuscript of the second volume was nearly
completed. Some new genera and species of tanagers and orioles
were also described by Mr. Ridgway. The preparation of a card cat-
alogue of the genera and species of recent and fossil birds was contin-
ued, and three papers on the nomenclature of birds were published by
Dr. Charles W. Richmond. The work of completing Bendire’s Life
Histories of North American Birds, of which two parts were issued
a few years ago as Special Bulletins No. 1 and 3, has been taken up
by Dr. W. L. Ralph, Honorary Curator of the Section of Birds’ Eggs.
The researches on mammals by Mr. G. 8. Miller, jr., have resulted in
twenty published papers, mainly descriptive of new species in the
Kast Indian collection of Dr. W. L. Abbott, and of new European,
African, and South American forms. Among them, however, were a
revision of the red-back mice of Europe, and a key to the land mam-
mals of eastern North America. Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., completed a
study of the osteology of the Jerboas and jumping mice. The investi-
gations of Dr. L. Stejneger related mainly to the reptiles of Japan,
Porto Rico, and Cuba, on which he has papers in course of prepara-
tion, the illustrations being already made. Dr. Stejneger also reported
on the reptiles collected in Venezuela by Messrs. Robinson and Lyon,
and published two papers on the group of birds known as Wheatears.
Flightless birds and the osteology of the tile fish and its allies were
among the subjects investigated by Mr. F. A. Lucas.

The publications of Mr. William H. Dall comprised synopses of the
molluscan families Telliriidse, Cardiidee, and Lucinacea, eleven shorter
papers on mollusks, and a report, in conjunction with Mr. Charles T.
Simpson, on the mollusks collected in Porto Rican waters by the Fish
Commission steamer /7%sh //awh: in 1899. Mr. Simpson continued his
28 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

studies on the Naiades, which he is engaged in monographing, and
completed three short papers on these fresh-water mussels. The
Pacitic Pyramidellidee were the principal subject of the investigations
of Mr. Paul Bartsch.

Besides his studies on the crustacean family Galatheide, begun some
time avo, Dr. James E. Benedict reported on the Anomouran crusta-
eeans of the Fish Commission expedition of 1899 to Porto Rico and
published papers descriptive of four new species of the symmetrical
Paguride, and of the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus and its allies.
The work completed by Miss M. J. Rathbun included a synopsis of
the Grapsoid crabs of North America, a report on the Decapod and
Stomatopod crustaceans collected by the Branner-Agassiz expedition
to Brazil, keys to the various groups of North American crabs, a
report on the Brachyuran and Macruran crustaceans collected by
the Leland Stanford Junior University expedition of 1898-99 to the
Galapagos Islands, and a report on the crustaceans of the same
groups collected in Porto Rican waters by the Fish Commission expe-
dition of 1899. In reporting upon the Decapod crustaceans obtained
by the Harriman Alaskan expedition of 1899, Miss Rathbun has
undertaken to prepare a complete review of the Decapods of the west
coast of North America based upon all the material from that region
now in the Museum. Miss Harriet Richardson, collaborator in the
Division of Marine Invertebrates, has reported on the Isopod crusta-
ceans of the Stanford University and the Branner-A gassiz expeditions
above mentioned, and has published a key to the Isopods of the east
coast of North America.

Of the insects collected on the Harriman Alaskan expedition of 1899,
many of the groups were worked up by assistants in the Division of
Insects of the Museum, as follows: The Diptera by Mr. Coquillett, the
Coleoptera and Psyllidee by Mr. Schwarz, the Hymenoptera by Mr.
Ashmead, the Lepidoptera by Dr. Dyar (with the assistance of several
specialists), the Arachnida and Neuroptera by Mr. Banks, the Myria-
poda by Professor Cook, and the Odonata by Mr. Currie. Of material
collected at the Galapagos Islands by Mr. R. E. Snodgrass, Mr. Banks
has reported upon the Arachnida, Mr. Ashmead upon the Hymenop-
tera, Mr. Coquillett upon the Diptera, Dr. Dyar upon the Lepidoptera,
Mr. Currie upon the Odonata, and Mr. Heidemann, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, upon the Hemiptera. Besides the above, Mr.
Ashmead has conducted studies upon the Ichneumonoidea and Bombidee
in the general collection, has completed a report upon the Hymenoptera
Parasitica of the Hawaiian Islands, and has continued his researches
upon exotic material from Africa, Siam, Japan, Australia, and New
Zealand. Mr. Currie has continued work upon the Myrmeleonide,
and is preparing a synonymical card catalogue of the North American
Neuropteroid insects. Much progress has also been naade on catalogues
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 29

of Lepidoptera by Dr. Dyar, and of Hymenoptera by Mr. Ashmead.
Mr. Caudell has published a synopsis of the hemipterous genus S/nea
and has identified considerable material in the group Orthoptera. The
total number of papers by members of the staff of the Division of
Insects issued during the year amounted to 78.

The publications from the Division of Plants included five papers by
Mr. F. V. Coville, a monograph of the North American Umbelliferee
by Mr. J. N. Rose, in conjunction with Prof. John Coulter, a descrip-
tion of a new /7elianthus and a series of popular articles on the fami-
lies of flowering plants by Mr. C. L. Pollard, and a list of the ferns of
North America and eight other papers relating to them by Mr. William
R. Maxon. Investigations in progress in the same division comprised
researches on the flora of Mexico by Mr. Rose, who has in preparation
an extensive work on that subject; studies of the violets by Mr. Pol-
lard, and studies of the ferns and their allies by Mr. Maxon.

Under arrangements with specialists connected with other establish-
ments, the collections in several zoological groups were being worked
up for the National Museum, as follows: The sertularian and cam-
panularian hydroids by Prof. C. C. Nutting, of Iowa University,
whose monograph on the Plumularidz was recently issued as a special
bulletin; the holothurians by Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity
College, Hartford, Conn., and Prof. Hubert Lyman Clark, of Olivet
College, Michigan, the former having the Pedata, the latter the
Apoda; the parasitic copepod crustaceans by Prof. Charles B. Wilson,
of the State Normal School, Westfield, Mass.; the recent corals by
Mr. ¥. Wayland Vaughan, of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
crayfishes by Prof. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, Washing-
ton, District of Columbia.

In the Department of Geology the head curator, Dr. Merrill, inves-
tigated a series of nepheline-melilite rocks collected by Prof. C. H.
Hitchcock in Oahu, Hawaii, and completed a study of the stony
meteorite which fell in Felix, Alabama, in 1900. His publications
include a paper in conjunction with Dr. H. N. Stokes on a stony
meteorite which fell at Allegan, Michigan, in 1899, and a meteorite from
Mart, Texas, and a ‘‘Guide to the study of the collections in the section
of applied geology of the National Museum,” printed in the Appendix
to the Annual Report for 1899. Mr. Tassin’s researches related to the
analysis of a damourite from California and the dehydration: of the
metallic hydrates, with special reference to the hydration of ferric and
ferrous sulphates and the dehydration of the resultant hydrates and
basic salts. He also completed a handbook on the gem collection of
the Museum. Mr. Schuchert has continued his preparation of a mon-
ograph on the American fossil starfishes and his studies relative to the
zones separating the Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian faunas in
America, and he also published a paper on the Helderbergian fossils
350 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

occurring near Montreal, Canada. Mr. Lucas has begun upon the
text for the volume on Stegosaurs projected by the late Prof. O. C.
Marsh, and has given some attention to the study of the mastodons of
North America. The following papers by him have also been pub-
lished: ‘‘’The lachrymal bone in Pinnipeds;” ‘* The characters and rela-
tions of Gallinuloides, a fossil gallinaceous bird from the Green River
Shales of Wyoming;” ‘‘ Description of the skull of Lepidosteus atrow,”
“A new rhinoceros, 7rigondas osborii, from the Miocene of South
Dakota;” ‘*The pelvic girdle of Zeuglodon, Basilosaurus cetoides
(Owen);” ‘A new fossil cyprinoid, Leuciscus turner’, from the Miocene
of Nevada.” and ‘‘A new dinosaur, Stegoswurus marshi, from the
Lower Cretaceous of South Dakota.”

The collections in the Museum are constantly referred to by the
scientific assistants of the Department of Agriculture, the United
States Fish Commission, and the Geological Survey. Among persons
otherwise connected who have visited the Museum during the past year
for the purpose of study the following may be mentioned: Mr. Ernest
Thompson Seton, the well-known artist and writer on natural history
subjects, spent some time in an examination of the specimens of Ameri-
‘an deer, in connection with a contemplated work on the large game
of the country. Dr. KE. A. Mearns, U.S. Army, continued for a short
period his work on the zoology of the Mexican boundary survey,
studying the American cats, and also giving some attention to the
pocket and white-footed mice. Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, brought
a large series of birds from Panama, and Mr. Frank M. Chapman, of
the American Museum of Natural History, some Peruvian birds, for
identification with the aid of Museum specimens. The committee on
nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union made use, as
heretofore, of the excellent facilities afforded by the Division of Birds
in determining the status of various newly described species and sub-
species of birds.

The collections of the Division of Mollusks were consulted by Prof.
L. C. Glenn and Mr, A. P. Martin, of the Maryland geological sur-
vey, In connection with their work on the Maryland Tertiary forma-
tions, and by Mr. F. N. Balch, of Boston, for the identification of cer-
tain arctic shells. In the Division of Insects, investigations were con-
ducted by Dr. A. Fenyes, Prof. W. L. Tower, of Harvard University,
Miss M. M. Enteman, of Chicago University, Prof. J. B. Smith, of
Rutgers College, Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, of the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences, and Sir Gilbert Carter, of Nassau, Bahamas.

Among those who made use of the botanical collections were Prof.
K. L. Greene, of the Catholic University, and Mr. E. L. Morris, of
the Western High School, Washington, District of Columbia; Mr.
Stewardson Brown and Mr. Joseph Crawford, of the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences; Dr. N. L. Britton, of the New York

Botanical Garden; Prof. E. 5. Burgess, of the New York Normal
College, and Dr. R. H. True, of Harvard University.

In his work upon the fossil Titanotheres for the United States
Geological Survey, Prof. Henry F. Osborn, of the American Museum
of Natural History, has utilized the extensive series of remains of this
reptilian group contained in the Marsh collection recently transferred
to the Museum by the Geological Survey.

In the Department of Anthropology investigations were carried on
by Hon. A. D. Tompkins, of the Industrial Commission, relative to
the African races, in connection with studies upon the negro population
of the Southern States, and by Miss Woolson, of Columbia University,
New York, regarding primitive weaving.

The number of loans made to specialists to aid them in researches
was quite large. In the field of anthropology much material relating
to primitive games was sent to Mr. Stewart Culin, director of the
Museum of Science and Art of the University of Pennsylvania; various
articles bearing upon Asiatic contact with the west coast of America
were supplied to Dr. Franz Boas, of the American Museum of Natural
History, New York; and a series of spindle whorls was lent to Mrs.
H. Newell Wardle, of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia.
Among smaller sendings were a Cufic tombstone to Mrs. Alexander
McD. Lee, of Frederick, Maryland, and a relief map of Palestine in
New Testament times to Mr. F. Burgi, of Rochester, New York.

The principal loans of zoological material were as follows: Twenty-
eight specimens of Hutia rats (Capromys) to Mr. F. M. Chapman, of
the American Museum of Natural History; 35 bats to Mr. James A. G.
Rehn, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences; 185 skins
of chicadees, nuthatches, and creepers to Mr. Francis J. Birtwell, of
Albuquerque, New Mexico; 28 skins of Acgzalites to Dr. Jonathan
Dwight, jr., of the American Museum of Natural History; 68 skins of
Macrochamphus to Mr. Reginald H. Howe, of Brookline, Massachusetts;

PROGRESS IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

The exhibition halls of the Department of Anthropology are now so
completely filled, or rather so overcrowded, as to prevent any further
additions except of small objects or as older parts of the collection
may be removed to storage. This condition prevails in practically
every branch of the department, and is especially embarrassing in
respect to that class of objects, of which many are received from time
to time, that must be at once provided for in the display cases to insure
their safety. The work of the year upon the exhibition series has,
therefore, been confined mainly to the rearrangement of material, to
the substitution of new and better prepared specimens for less desir-
able ones, and to perfecting the system of labeling. Owing to the lack
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 33

of laboratory space, it has, moreover, been necessary to close the gal-
leries in one court and from time to time to shut off temporarily from
public use other parts of the exhibition halls.

The crowding which probably strikes the visitor as most objection-
able occurs in the Section of American History, which occupies the
hall first entered from the main doorway. While the collections here
installed were entirely rearranged during the year and only await the

- addition of printed labels to put the section in as satisfactory a condi-
tion as the circumstances permit, it has been necessary to place the
cases so close together as to leave exceedingly narrow passageways
between them. <A large number of very important historical objects
are unfortunately still in storage, and the further development of the
collection is hindered by the fact that persons having desirable material
which they would gladly donate or loan, will only do so on the assur-
ance that their contributions will be immediately displayed. The use
of the wall cases along the sides of this hall would afford some relief,
but these are now filled with the very valuable collection of musical
instruments, for which no other place is available. The Museum has
also a large and noteworthy collection of coins and medals, of which
only a small fraction is now on exhibition, and which should soon be
made accessible to the public.

The exhibits prepared by the department for the Pan-American
Exposition, consisting chiefly of large ethnographical groups of lay
figures, will, upon their return to the Museum at the close of the
exposition, necessitate the clearing out of at least one of the halls for
their reception or the dismantling and storage of the groups, which
would be almost equivalent to their destruction.

While the halls assigned to the Department of Biology are mainly
filled, some to overflowing, in a few instances the completion of the
displays has been delayed awaiting the results of further experiments.

The south east range in the Museum building, allotted to the reptiles ”
and fishes, was repainted and furnished with a new floor of terrazzo
pavement. Upright cases have been arranged along the walls for the
fishes, and floor cases with sloping tops in the middle space for the
reptiles and batrachians. The exhibit consists at present of casts of
North American species, with a small alcoholic series of deep-sea
fishes, accompanied by colored figures, which it is intended to supple-
ment by collections of South American and Old World species in some
preservative fluid. No entirely satisfactory method of representing
these groups to the public has yet been found. Painted casts can
never be made to look like the animals as they appear in life, and no
method of retaining the life colors in specimens preserved in liquids
has been discovered. The painting of actual specimens has been tried

22

54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

in certain European museums with some success, and experiments are
now under wav here with a view to utilizing this method or devising
some other which shall render a display of the lower vertebrates more
presentable.

Some progress has been made toward perfecting the collection of
eame birds, fishes, and large mammal heads now temporarily displayed
in the lower stairway hall at the main entrance to the Smithsonian —
building, the walls of which have been repainted in appropriate colors.
It is contemplated to replace the individual mountings, at least among
birds, by groups of specimens with accessories representing the species
in their native surroundings, and several such groups have already
been completed.

The finely mounted specimens of large mammals, prepared for the
Pan-American Exposition, will ultimately be added to the collections
of this group in the South Museum hall. The only work done directly
for this hall was the relabeling of the American carnivora. The
exhibition of insects, to which a hall in the Smithsonian building was
recently assigned, is still only partially and imperfectly installed,
owing to the fact that the working up of certain proposed improve-
ments in the manner of mounting and arranging the specimens has
not been completed. It is expected, however, to settle upon some
definite plan during the present year, after which little delay should
ensue in placing this group in a thoroughly presentable condition.

One of the most interesting installations of the year, so nearly com-
pleted as to permit of its being thrown open to the public, was that in
the so-called ** Children’s Room,” which occupies the main floor in the
south tower of the Smithsonian building. This novel feature is fully
described in the Report of the Secretary, and also in that of the Head
Curator of Biology, on page 63 of this volume. It was instituted by
_the Secretary for the benefit of the very young people, their enter-
tainment rather than instruction, as an attractive means of inculeating
a love for nature. The room, a small one, is richly painted and deco-
rated in a prevailing tint of green, and has a white mosaic floor with
celtic border. The cases, which follow the walls, are framed with
light-colored wood, but consist mainly of large panes of plate glass,
and are so low that even a small child can see the contents of the upper
shelyes. The subjects represented are mainly zoological; familiar
American birds, common European birds, large birds of prey, inter-
esting water birds, curious birds, brilliantly colored birds, illustra-
tions of protective mimicry among birds and insects, and curious shells,
corals, sponges, etc. There are also some minerals and fossils, two
aquaria with living fishes, and a number of bird pictures on the walls.
The labels are all in simple language and printed in large type. Much
remains to be done before the exhibit can be regarded as entirely

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 35

complete, but even in its present shape it justifies the ambition of its
originator, as testified by its countless number of little visitors.

All of the exhibition halls in geology are open to the public, and,
except in the sections of paleobotony and vertebrate paleontology, the
collections are well arranged and to a large extent quite fully labeled.
With the receipt of new material many changes in and additions to
these exhibits will naturally be made from time to time. The sections
in arrears are those which have been most recently established and in
which, moreover, much preparatory work is necessary.

The cases in the west south range, containing the voleanic, geyser,
hot spring, and rock-weathering series, have been repainted and the
exhibits rearranged. About two-thirds of the building stone collection
in the southwest court has been thoroughly overhauled and cleaned.

Owing to the employment of the preparators in connection with the
Pan-American Exposition little progress was made toward increasing
the exhibition of vertebrate fossils, though the skeleton of a Plesiosaur
and a large and fine skeleton of a Triceratops, received with the Marsh
collection, were installed. It is proposed to work out and mount, as
rapidly as possible, other specimens from this interesting series of large
extinct vertebrates. Of invertebrate fossils specimens to the number
of over 3,000 were added to the display series.

Work is in progress on a geological section across the United States
from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, which is to be made a feature
of one of the exhibition halls. It is being drawn on a horizontal scale
of 2 miles and a vertical scale of 4,000 feet to the inch.

As practically all the available exhibition space assigned to the
Department is now occupied, further development under existing con-
ditions must be mainly along the lines already laid down. The section
of practical geology could be strengthened by building up certain
special exhibits showing the occurrence and association of the ores of
some of the more interesting mining regions, and in the event of the
construction of a new building with sufficient space provided for the
purpose this section can readily be expanded into a thoroughly com-
prehensive department of practical geology, for which there has long
been an urgent demand.

The growth of the meteorite collection will make it necessary to rele-
gate many specimens to the drawer series in order to accommodate
some of the more important recent acquisitions and give amore attrac-
tive setting to the exhibit as a whole.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 37
CORRESPONDENCE.

The Museum correspondence, which has always been very heavy,
Increases in volume from year to year. Outside of ordinary routine
matters, it is occasioned for the most part by requests for informa-
tion, coming from all parts of the world and relating to a wide range
of subjects. Specimens, often in large lots, are transmitted for
identification, and questions are submitted in regard to all branches
of knowledge falling within the Museum’s scope. The requests also
have reference to Museum administration, the building up and main-
tenance of collections, the construction of cases, the installation, label-
ing, and cataloguing of specimens, and, in fact, no topic connected
with a great museum or suggested by its existence escapes notice. In
accordance with the time-honored custom of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, every communication made in good faith and appropriate to be
considered is fully answered, even though this necessitates incessant
demands upon the scientific staff, whose regular duties are quite sufli-
cient to occupy their entire time. The number of lots of specimens
determined and reported upon during the year at the request of
correspondents was nearly 700.

A considerable proportion of the work of furnishing information is
accomplished through the medium of Museum publications, of which
more than 30,000 volumes and pamphlets were distributed during the
year, about one-third of these having been sent in compliance with
special applications.

As the Museum has no facilities for making chemical analyses,
requests for work of this kind have to be refused.

PUBLICATIONS.

The publications issued during the year comprised the second vol-
ume of the Annual Report for 1897, the Annual Reports for 1898 and
1899, volume 22 of the Proceedings, and part 1 of Special Bulletin
No. 4, besides reprints in separate form of a large number of papers
from the Reports and Proceedings.

Volume II of the Report for 1897 contains a biographical account
of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the late assistant secretary of the Smith.
sonian Institution in charge of the National Museum, together with
reprints of several of his more important papers on museums and on
the history of scientific progress in America. It is illustrated with
portraits of more than 100 men who have been prominent in the sei-
entific advancement of the country. The appendix to the Report for
1898 consists of a single paper, by the late Prof. E. D. Cope, on the
crocodilians, lizards, and snakes of North America, comprising 1,100
pages of text, with 37 full-page plates and 347 text figures. The
Report for 1899 contains five scientific papers based upon collections
in the Museum.
35 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Volume 22 of the Proceedings includes papers numbered from 1179
to 1205, the ‘‘Synopsis of the Naiades,” by Mr. Charles T. Simpson,
being especially worthy of note.

Part I of Special Bulletin No. 4 is the first of a series of papers on
the American Hydroids, by Prof. C. C. Nutting, professor of zoology
in the University of Iowa. It treats of the Plumularide, is in quarto
form, and contains 34 plates. This volume was issued early in the
autumn.

Dr. W. L. Ralph has undertaken to continue the extensive work on
the Life Histories of North American Birds, begun some years ago
by the late Maj. Charles Bendire, U. 8. Army, and of which two vol-
umes have been printed as special bulletins. A circular (No. 50)
soliciting new and unpublished information on the subject has been
prepared and distributed to correspondents.

With the permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, twenty-five papers prepared during the year by members of the
Museum staff, and based on Museum material, have been printed in
publications other than those of the. Museum. The titles of these
papers will be found in the Bibliography. The authors were Dr. T.
H. Bean, Mr. Charles Schuchert, Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., Mr. J. N.
Rose, Mr. Charles L. Pollard, and Mr. W. R. Maxon.

The number of publications, including bound volumes and pamph-
lets, distributed during the year amounted to about 31,000.

In Appendix IV will be found a list of the publications by the mem-
bers of the Museum staff. In the table given below these papers are
classified by subjects. The number of authors represented is 78.

LIBRARY.

During the past year the work of the Museum Library has increased
in volume, although, unfortunately, no relief could be afforded either
in the way of additional space or of assistance. A considerable por-
tion of the new gallery in the west north, and north west ranges will,
when completed, be employed for library purposes, and this makes
the greatest possible limit of expansion in the present building. The
accessions to the library numbered 12,267 books, pamphlets, and
periodicals, of which 4,942 were retained out of the Smithsonian
deposit. It is the policy of the Smithsonian Institution in library
matters to give its first care to the strengthening of the Smithsonian
deposit in the Library of Congress, and many sets heretofore retained
in the Museum are now being gradually turned over to that Library.
This policy will in the future require an increase in the appropriation
for books for the Museum, as otherwise its interests must suffer. It
should be said, however, that the service of the Library of Congress
is more prompt and efficient than ever before, books being sent to the
Museum twice a day, and the Librarian and his assistants have cor-
dially cooperated with the Institution and Museum in supplying their
needs.

The Library has had during the year four students in cataloguing
and library practice generally, and is glad to afford such facilities as
its limited space renders possible.

Twenty-five thousand one hundred and forty-one books were lent;
8,986 periodicals were entered; 262 volumes, 147 parts of periodicals,
and 536 pamphlets of the Goode library accessioned, and 4,811 cards
added to the authors’ catalogue.

PHOTOGRAPHY.

The photographic laboratory, under Mr. T. W. Smillie, has produced
more than the usual amount of work, which consisted chiefly in pho-
tographing important objects in the collections for use in illustrating
the publications of the Museum, and the high standard of excellence
demanded for this purpose has been fully maintained. The laboratory
is also called upon for reproductions of plans and other drawings in
connection with the construction and repair work of the Museum, and
much other work of a miscellaneous character. An illustrated cata-
logue in blue print of the very large series of negatives dating back to
the first years of the Museum has been nearly completed. ‘The num-
ber of negatives made during the year was 902, of silver prints 1,818,
of platinum prints 448, of bromide prints 63, and of blue prints 12,144.

COOPERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Valuable assistance has continued to be received from various depart-
ments and bureaus of the Government. Officers of the Army and
40) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Navy stationed in the Philippine Islands and in other of the new pos-
sessions have made important contributions, having in some cases been
furnished with special outfits to facilitate their work of collecting.
Representatives of the Department of State abroad have also been
instrumental in securing interesting material. Special acknowledg-
ments are due to the Quartermaster’s Department of the Army for
many courtesies in connection with the transportation of specimens
and outfits to and from distant points. The relations of the Museum
to the U. S. Geological Survey, the U. 8. Fish Commission, the Bio-
logical Survey and the Divisions of Entomology and Botany of the
Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of American Ethnology
in regard to collections transmitted are referred to elsewhere.

EXPOSITIONS.

Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, N. Y.—This exposition opened
on May 1, 1901, and will continue until November 1. The Smith-
sonian Institution and National Museum are represented on the Goy-
ernment board of management by the head curator of biology, Dr.
Frederick W. True, with the chief clerk, Mr. W. V. Cox, acting as
chief special agent and also as secretary of the board. An account
of the collection exhibited by the Museum will be found in the Appen-
dix of this Report.

The participation by the Museum in the expositions held in different
parts of the country at such short intervals during recent years has
had both its advantages and disadvantages, the former undoubtedly
preponderating. Through the allotments from the special appropria-
tions made for these expositions the Museum has been able to secure,
indirectly, many important additions to its collections, material which
it might otherwise be long in obtaining; the development of its exhi-
bition or educational features has been greatly stimulated; its existence,
its objects, and its needs have been made widely known, and, what is
no less a part of the functions of a national institution, the formation
and growth of museums elsewhere have been promoted. The disad-
vantages arise chiefly from the haste necessary in preparing the exhib-
its, which causes serious interference with the regular work of the
Museum. The time available for all preparations seldom exceeds a
year or a year anda half. The display must, in greater part at least,
consist of novelties either as to the objects themselves or the manner
of presenting them, as the large expositions draw their attendance from
ull parts of the country and a repetition of the same exhibit would
interest but few. After the drawing up of the plans, the entire work
must be pushed forward with the utmost speed, and toward the close
often under high pressure, to insure its completion within the specified
limit. The collections must be overhauled for desirable specimens,
and new ones must be sought through the agency of field expeditions

and dealers. But, most important, the array of material thus assem-
bled, equal in quantity to the entire contents of a museum of no mean
proportions, must be suitably prepared, mounted, labeled, and adjusted
to the cases they will occupy before shipment to the objective point.
Most of the cases require to be specially constructed, and the boxing
and final installation take much time. All the classes of labor thus
involved demand experience and training as much for their perform-
ance as for their direction, qualifications seldom obtainable in the open
market. It therefore follows that nearly all of the technical work of
preparing for an exposition falls upon the employees of the Museum,
and consumes, while such work is in progress, a very large proportion
of their time. It is perhaps needless to say that each member of the
staff called into this service has performed his share with zeal and
enthusiasm, a sufficient explanation of the uniformly successful results
attained by the Museum at all of the expositions in which it has
participated.

The exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition is especially charac-
terized by an, exceptionally high grade of preparators’ work. In
anthropology it consists mainly of 12 life-sized lay-figure groups of
the type tribes of American aborigines and of 16 dwelling group
models; and in biology of mounted specimens of the larger American
mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, well illustrating the latest
advances in taxidermy. Conspicuous features in geology are skeletons
and restorations of several of the large fossil vertebrates from the
West, besides which are collections of minerals, native elements, inver-
tebrate fossils, etc. Nearly all of this material will be utilized in the
exhibition halls of the Museum on its return.

Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis. —An appropriation of
$250,000 was made at the last session of Congress for the erection of
a Government building at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition intended
to be held in St. Louis in 1904, but no money was then voted for the
preparation of an exhibit by the Government.

THE MUSEUM STAFF. ~

At the beginning of the year the Assistant Secretary was placed in
immediate charge of the Museum, the direction of which rests with
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, its keeper ex offic7o.

The scientific staff has consisted, besides the three head curators, of
18 curators, 12 assistant curators, 14 custodians, 10 aids, 4 associates,
and 2 collaborators, making a total of 63 persons, of whom, however,
only about one-half were under salary from the Museum, the remainder
serving in a volunteer or honorary capacity, though nearly all of the
latter were in the employ of other bureaus of the Government. The
principal changes in the staff during the year were as follows:

On September 15, 1900, the Museum lost by death its Honorary
42 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Curator of Graphic Arts, Mr. 8. R. Koehler, whose connection with
the Institution began in 1887, and who was also for many years the
curator of prints in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.

Dr. W. L. Ralph, Custodian of the Section of Birds’ Eggs since the
death of Maj. Charles Bendire, U. S. Army, and who has contributed
liberally of his time and means toward improving the collections under
his charge, has been made the honorary curator of that section. Mr.
F. A. Lucas, Curator of Comparative Anatomy, has also been designated
Acting Curator of Vertebrate Fossils; Mr. George C. Maynard has been
advanced from aid to assistant curator in the Division of Technology.
Mr. Peter Fireman has received a temporary appointment as chemical
geologist, and Miss Harriet Richardson has been made a collaborator
in the Division of Marine Invertebrates.

Mrs. F.Weinheimer, preparator in the Division of Plants, resigned
on January 1, 1901, and Mr. Joseph Sessford, long connected with
the Museum and for several years past serving as clerk in the Division
of Reptiles and Batrachians, died on March 8, 1901.

Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of Prehistoric Archeology, visited
Paris during the summer of 1900 as the representative of the Museum
to the Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology and the
Congress of Americanists, at both of which he presented papers else-
where referred to in this report. Before the close of the fiscal year
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger was appointed to represent the Museum at
the International Congress of Zoology, which was to meet at Berlin,
Germany, in August, 1901.

A list of the members of the scientific and administrative staffs will
be found in Appendix I.

NECROLOGY.

Mr. Sylvester R. Koehler, Honorary Curator of the Division of
Graphic Arts in the National Museum, died September 15, 1900. Mr.
Koehler was born in Leipsic, Germany, in 1837, but came to America
when he was 12 years of age. In 1868 he entered, as technical manager,
the establishment of L. Prang & Co., Boston, where he mastered the
processes used in the graphic arts. Gen. Charles G. Loring, Director
of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, states that the knowledge which
Mr. Koehler thus gained ‘* was supplemented by an artistic tempera-
ment, which showed itself also in his fondness for music, in his
love of verse, and his skill, though a moderate one, with the pencil.
Years of study, too, had given him an intimate acquaintance with the
history of his art and confirmed his judgment. He was an admirable
critic of work, both creative and technical. * * * He not only
became the ultimate authority in the land of his adoption, but his
knowledge and judgment were held in great esteem in the art centers
of Europe.”

Mr. Koehler was appointed curator of the print department in the

il et i eh oe Bb eel i ei
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 43

Boston Museum in 1888. One year earlier, in 1887, he became con-
nected with the U. S. National Museum, in which at that time the
collection of graphic arts was first formally organized. From a very
small beginning this collection grew rapidly under Mr. Koehler’s
supervision, and as a result of his well directed and persistent effort it
now comprises more than 7,000 specimens. Using his own words, he
aimed to ‘‘represent art as an industry,” and to this end he planned to
make the exhibit one which should illustrate all of the methods
employed in producing pictures by lines and masses, in black or in colors,
by hand or with the aid of machinery. His aim has been realized to such
an extent that a great many of these processes are adequately illus-
trated by the tools and materials used, as well as by examples showing
successive stages in the various methods from the date of their incep-
tion to the present time.

For many years Mr. Koehler was attached to the scientific staff of
the National Museum as curator. After his health failed and he was
unable to devote as much time to the work as formerly he was made
an honorary curator. The value of his services in building up the
graphic arts collection can not be overestimated.

In 1894 he delivered a course of nine lectures in the National Museum
on ‘Old and modern methods of engraving.” His most important
work was published in 1885 and was entitled *‘ Etching.” At the time
of his death he had in course of preparation a ‘‘ History of the art of
color printing.” He contributed many articles to the magazines of
America, England, and Germany. Among a large number of other
important works mention should be made of his **Catalogue of an
exhibition illustrating the technical methods of the reproductive arts
from the fifteenth century to the present time, with special reference
to the photo-mechanical processes,” and a ** Catalogue of the engray-
ings, dry points, and etchings of Albert Diirer.”

Mr. Ralph Dupuy Lacoe, whose benefactions have so greatly
enriched the national collections, was born in Luzerne County, Pa.,
November 14, 1824. His father, Anthony Desiré Lacoe, came from
his birthplace in the vicinity of Havre, France, to Philadelphia in
1792. From there he removed, in 1798, to the Wyoming Valley,
where, at Pittston, he died in 1883, at an age of only four days less
than 103 years. The mother of R. D. Lacoe was Emelié Magdaléne
Dupuy, daughter of Jean Frangois Dupuy, a native of Bordeaux, and
Jane Elizabeth Desiré, a member of a Huguenot family of Nantes.
For many years Jean Francois Dupuy resided in Santo Domingo,
where, in 1791, after the success of the negro insurrection, he escaped,
with the loss of his valuable estate, to the United States. In 1795 he
finally settled in Wilkesbarre, where, in 1812, his daughter married
Anthony Lacoe.

The subject of this sketch was the youngest of Anthony Lacoe’s five
+4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 190].

children. In his earlier years he had no educational advantages other
than those furnished by the country common schools, supplemented by
the home teaching of his talented mother, whose strength of character
and refinement were deeply impressed on the son. Before Ralph
Dupuy was of age he taught school one or more terms, having among ~
his pupils Bridget Clary, who, in 1860, became his wife. Mrs. Lacoe
died in 1872, and Mr. Lacoe at West Pittston, Pa., on February 5,
1901, in his seventy-seventh year. They had four children, of whom
two survive.

In his earlier years Lacoe followed the trade of his father, that of
carpenter. About 1850 he engaged with his brothers in cutting ties
on his grandfather’s farm to supply a railway then in construction.
The proceeds of this venture were fortunately invested in anthracite
coal lands in the vicinity of his home near Pittston, and this was the
beginning of his modest wealth. As the coal industry of the region
developed, he conducted a real estate business, later becoming promi-
nent as the head of several industrial enterprises, and as bank presi-
dent. In 1869 and 1870 he served as burgess of the borough of West
Pittston. 4

Under too great pressure of business responsibility Lacoe’s health
gave way about 1865, and the efforts toward its recovery resulted,
first, In an amateur interest in natural history collecting, and, later,
in a deep and steadfast devotion to the promotion of the v ale and
insect departments of paleontology. While seeking health in Florida,
he amused himself by collecting the marine alg and mollusca along
the beach. Under the influence of a strong, innate love of nature he
found both pleasure and recuperation in the occupation, and on
returning to his home in Pennsylvania he soon transferred his interest
to the fossil coal plants to be found at the numerous anthracite mines
in the region. It was not long before Lacoe was in touch with J. P.
Lesley, the State geologist, and Leo Lesquereux, the distinguished
paleobotanist, who was then engaged in the study of the paleozoic
plants of the State. The warm friendship between Lacoe and Lesque-
reux continued until the death of the latter, in 1889.

Although Lacoe never fully regained his health, he frequently re-
marked that he owed years of his life to the out-of-door recreation
which he found in collecting. Gradually, as he became more familiar
with the undeveloped status of paleobotany and paleoentomology
in this country, he engaged in the task of systematicaily securing
paleozoic plants and fossil insects over broader areas and ieee
a greater stratigraphical range, as well as from many foreign type

Edwin Hayden, published in the sixth volume of the Proceedings of the Wyoming

Geological and Historical Society, 1901, and in the American Geologist for December,

localities. He also became interested in the investigations of the floras
of the later epochs, and in fossil fishes, crustaceans, and myriapods.
His purpose was not merely to accumulate a great collection of fossils.
He chose for his task in the service to science to contribute to our
knowledge of the plant and animal life of the past by discovering,
systematically gathering, and bringing the fossil remains to the hand
of the paleontologist. This material, often difficult to obtain and
‘are, he submitted to the most distinguished specialists in the various
departments, and not infrequently he further assisted in the illustra-
tion and publication of the results of their investigations. Accord-
ingly, we find most of the specimens in his great collections labeled on
the authority of Lesquereux, Dawson; Scudder, Cope, Hall, or Packard.

In 1891 he determined to see his collections safely transferred to a
repository where they would be permanently cared for and preserved,
while at the same time made available for consultation or study. He
first tendered his magnificent collection of paleozoic plants, embracing
about 100,000 specimens, with nearly 600 types, to the National
Museum. Subsequently he added his collections of plants from the
younger epochs, insects (including a great number of types and unde-
_seribed species), myriapods, crustaceans, and fishes. The magnitude
and importance of these collections have already been referred to in
the Reports of the National Museum./

In the departments of paleozoic plants, fossil insects, and fishes the
Lacoe collection was not only far more extensive than the previous
collections in the Museum, but it also rendered the two sections first
named hardly inferior to any in the world. The number and biolog-
ical range of the types in the Lacoe collection will be shown in the
paleontological catalogue now in course of preparation.

The history of Lacoe’s gifts to the United States National Museum
has already been given by the assistant secretary and the curators, but
reference may well be made again to the simple and patriotic terms of
the gift—i. e., that it be kept entire, with such additions as might be
made to it by exchange or subsequent contributions by the donor; that
it be known as the Lacoe collection, and that it be accessible to scien-
tists and students without distinction, under such proper rules and
restrictions as may be deemed necessary for the preservation of the
specimens from loss or injury. These informal yet wise provisions,
attending the most important gift that the Museum has yet received,
afford, as Professor Ward has happily said,? ** just ground for national
scientific pride, while the liberal public spirit with which it was given
is worthy of imitation by all patrons of science.” They are typical of
Lacoe’s scientific spirit, generosity, and devotion to paleontology.

46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

In his quiet home life Lacoe was gentle, dignified, and somewhat
diffident. He was thoughtful, often serious, yet sympathetic and
keenly appreciative of the humorous. He was pure and upright in
all his life. He was esteemed by the entire community and beloved
by all who were so fortunate as to enjoy his acquaintance.

“Though having but a common-school education in his youth, he
later made himself well read, particularly in the general sciences. In
the literature relating to fossil plants and insects his library has few
equals in America. His knowledge of paleozoic plants was expert;
yet he was so modest and so lacking the ambition of authorship that
he preferred to have the materials of his collections described by
others. His own writings are confined to several pamphlets, chiefly
of the nature of catalogues.

During the later years of Lacoe’s life the purpose to aid in the
increase of knowledge by promoting the study of fossil plants and
insects became more clearly defined, and found expression in more
systematically and wisely directed efforts. In the field of fossil plants
he sought to gain material from the paleobotanically less known for-
mations whose fossils should throw greatest light on floras already
known. In the insect world, instead of collecting fossils at random,
and thus continuing the speculations as to the affinities of the older
forms, he had engaged in methodically and extensively collecting
insect remains from the later geological formations in order that they
might be studied in connection with their survivors among living
insects, his idea being that the insects of each scat le earlier
period dito be mutually studied and interpreted in the light of the
ascertained characters and relations of the later times, the result of
such studies being a more satisfactory elaboration of a genetic and
natural classification of both fossil and living types. Arrangements
were being made by Lacoe for carrying out these broad and philosoph-
ical plans when a brief but fatal illness cut short his great work.
The Lacoe collections in the National Museum form a most appropri-
ate and lasting monument to the memory of this noble and patriotic
patron of the sciences for which they stand.

Mr. George A. Boardman, for many years a correspondent of the
Smithsonian Institution and an intimate friend of Professor Baird,
died January 11, 1901, at his home in Calais, Maine, aged 83 years.
Mr. Boardman was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on February
5, 1818, his ancestors having come to that locality on May 10, 1637,
from Yorkshire, England. Removing to Calais, he became extensively
engaged in the lumber business, from which he retired with a compe-
tence in 1871, the subsequent years of his life being largely devoted to
travel and to the more active pursuit of his favorite study, ornithology.
From 1871 to about 1887, he spent the winters in Florida, going and
returning by way of Washington, and usually stopping, sometimes for

a week or more, in order to study the collections of the National
Museum, where he formed the acquaintance of the scientific staff and
preparators, to whom he was always a welcome visitor on account of
his genial, friendly manner, and interest in their occupations.

Mr. Boardman’s interest in ornithology was mainly from the point
of view of asportsman and lover of nature. He did little in the way of
collecting except to bring together a very complete and valuable series
of the birds of Calais and vicinity, consisting of specimens chiefly
mounted by himself, which is to be placed in one of the provincial
government buildings at Fredericton, New Brunswick. His principal
contribution to ornithological literature is his ‘* Catalogue of the birds
found in the vicinity of Calais, Me., and about the islands at the mouth
of the Bay of Fundy,” published in the Proceedings of the Boston
Society of Natural History (1862); but he also wrote many minor articles
on natural history for the American Naturalist, Forest and Stream, and
other periodicals of like character. His relations to the Smithsonian
Institution were rather as a correspondent and friend of Professor
Baird than as an extensive contributor to its collections, though many
interesting and valuable specimens were received from him at various
times.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901.

By Wrutiam H. Hormss,

Head Curator.

The year has been one of unusual activity, the volume of business
transacted by the Department far exceeding that of any previous year.
This condition is due in part to the fact that exhibits were collected
and prepared for the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. More than
half the force of the Department were engaged upon this work almost
exclusively for a period of six months. <A detailed account of the
exhibits displayed at Buffalo is appended to this report.

The accessions for the year are more numerous than usual and of
exceptional scientific value. Of those deserving special notice, received
by the Department and assigned to the various divisions and sections,
the following may be mentioned :

COLLECTED FOR THE MUSEUM.

Ethnological material from Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, etc.,
collected for the Museum by Mr. C. H. Townsend and Dr. H. F.
Moore, naturalists on the U.S. Fish Commission steamer A/batross
during the expedition of 1899-1900 to the Tropical Pacific, under the
direction of Alexander Agassiz. This is a second installment of the
collection made by these gentlemen, the larger part having been
received during the previous year. The total number of specimens
obtained is 330.

Ethnological material from the Pamamary Indians and other tribes
of the upper Purus River, in Brazil, collected by Prof. J. B. Steere, of
Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Implements and rejectamenta of manufacture from an ancient flint
quarry in Union County, Illinois, collected by W. H. Holmes, head
curator; 455 specimens.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY. 55

The specimens received during the year have been catalogued and
eared for in the usual way, but the available spaces are already so
fully occupied that new material can not be placed on view save by
storing the earlier collections. "The Department has not been able to
add to its case room, and storage facilities remain, as before, entirely
inadequate. Owing to the lack of laboratory space one or more of
the halls have been closed throughout the year as workrooms, and
no little confusion has resulted from this and the disturbance due to
the selection, mounting, labeling, and boxing of exhibits for the Pan-
American Exposition.

The work of labeling the Museum exhibits has been continued, and
very considerable advances have been made in the direction of print-
ing, framing, and placing case labels in various halls.

The following details with regard to progress made in preserving
and installing the collections of the Department are introduced from
the reports of the heads of divisions and sections:

Prof. Otis T. Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, says
that—

No hall or collection has been installed in the division during the fiscal year 1901.
Most of the time of my assistants has been taken up with the preparation of exhibits
for the Pan-American Exposition. For the preservation and installation of speci-
mens in my custody the space and resources are well-nigh exhausted, and I hail with
pleasure the announcement that new galleries are to be erected to relieve the
situation. :

The continued ill health of my clerk made it necessary to employ expert help
temporarily. I was fortunate in securing the services of Miss Harriet G. Fracker,
whose long connection with the Intercontinental Railway Commission fitted her for
the difficult task of preparing labels and of reading proof in Spanish, French, and
German.

Dr. Hough, assistant curator of this division, spent a good portion of the year in
getting together materials for the Pan-American Exposition and in cataloguing
accessions, and in May proceeded to New Mexico and Arizona for the purpose of
conducting explorations in conjunction with Mr. Peter G. Gates.

The following-named halls are used for exhibition:

(a) The west north range is devoted to North American tribes. Twice the area
here provided is required to show adequately the industrial life of our tribes. We
are rich in material of this sort and it should be displayed.

(b) The north west range. The Eskimo collections occupy about one-half of the
range, and might well take the entire space. ~ After the return of the Pan-American
material this whole collection should be reinstalled. The southeastern Alaskan col-
lection occupies only the north end of the range, a space entirely inadepuate to its
exhibition. The entire range should be either Eskimo or Indian.

(c) The northwest court is given up entirely to the tribes of the arid region of
southwestern United States. The rich pottery collection here crowds out other con-
siderations. It would require four times the space to install properly the collections
from this area.

(d) The northwest gallery is devoted to basketry on two sides, to the Republic of
Mexico on the north side, while the whole of Central and South America are crowded
into the cases on the south side. I do not know what I am going to do with the
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

large collections coming in from that region. Ten thousand feet of floor space would
not be too much at once for the installation of this fine material.

(e) The Indo-Pacific collections are displayed on the north gallery of the west
hall. The cases are now crowded and yet not all of the precious Wilkes exploring
expedition specimens are installed. What are we to do when the vast Philippine
collections arrive in November?

But the worst conditions, perhaps, exist in the west hall. As you enter it from
the rotunda you have the spoils of ancient classic art—Hamite, Semite, and Aryan—
in two alcoves. The rest of the space is devoted to modern Europe, Asia, and Africa,
a subject demanding 30,000 square feet, if not more.

Incidentally connected with the ethnological exhibits are many technical series in
which a single art or device is traced through its ethnic distribution and its historic
elaboration.

The study series of ethnology are to be found:

(a) In the tower rooms of the west balcony, which are inaccessible, crowded, and
dirty.

(b) In the drawers on the west balcony, where the specimens are quite accessible
and in good condition.

(c) In table and other cases all about the building, which is not satisfactory, as the
temptation to use this space for storage or stowage is very great.

(d@) Hidden away behind the pottery in pueblo court and piled up behind the
graphic arts exhibit.

Again, there is no place in which to study the specimens, excepting our own
public offices, where the student is subject to all sorts of interruptions, and I trust
that measures can be taken at once toward providing a laboratory of ethnology,
where those who desire to make wide comparisons of things may have opportunity
to spread them out.

Dr. Cyrus Adler, assistant curator, Division of Historic Archeol-
ogy, reports as follows:

Some changes and additions have been made in the Section of Biblical and Pales-
tinian Antiquities. Casts are being made of the collection of oriental seals and the
inscribed magic bowls are being photographed preparatory to a study of their
significance.

The collection is installed in the two alcoves west of the rotunda in the following
manner:

North alcove, Biblical and Palestinian antiquities (manuscripts and editions of
the Bible, musical instruments, mineralogical and botanical specimens, dress, orna-
ments, and utensils of the East), in a wall case; monuments found in Palestine
(Moabite stone, Siloam inscription, Temple stone), Assyrian statues and slabs, on
the floor, the walls, and screens.

The south alcove holds the collection of Egyptian antiquities (mummies, mummy
cases, and other funerary paraphernalia, statues, busts, reliefs, ornaments, ete.) in a
wall case, on the floor, and on screens; the mosaic from Carthage; the statues from
north Syria, and Hittite casts; the Persepolitan casts.

On the top of the wall cases of both alcoves the larger casts of Greek and Roman
mythologie subjects have a place.

As custodian of Historic Religious Ceremonials, Dr. Adler writes:

The two antique German altars recently acquired were restored and renovated,
with the addition of tables to both and a tabernacle to one of them. The larger
one was installed on the center baleony of west hall, facing the rotunda. Some
changes and additions were also made in the sections of the Jewish religion and
Brahmanism, and additional labels were prepared.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY. bY

The collections on exhibition are installed in the south gallery of the west hall, in
the following order, beginning at the entrance from the rotunda: Jewish religion in
two arch cases and three wing cases; Mohammedanism in one arch case and two bay
cases; Greco-Roman religion in one arch case and three wing cases; Brahmanism in
one arch case and one Kensington case; Buddhism in two arch cases, four wing cases,
and one special case; Shintoism in one wing case; objects of other east Asiatic relig-
ions in one wing case and one Kensington case; a collection of amulets in oné Ken-
sington case.

The entire collection of objects of Christian ceremonial, as well as a number of
objects belonging to other religions, are, on account of lack of space, for the present
in storage boxes.

A Bibliography of Assyriology from the beginning to 1900, inclusive, has been com-
menced by Dr. Adler, and in the Division of Religions the work on the Benguiat
collection of objects of Jewish ceremonial, with 36 plates, has been completed and
published.

Mr. A. H. Clark, custodian of the Section of American History,
reports as follows:

The collections of this section have all been rearranged and put in order so that
they are now in satisfactory condition except as to labels.

Typewritten labels accompany nearly every object exhibited. A large number of
valuable objects are in storage for want of exhibition room, and it is important that
the side cases now devoted to musical instruments be given up to objects of history.

There are large collections of medals and coins now of little public use for study
or for exhibition through lack of proper facilities for their arrangement and some
step should soon be taken to make these valuable collections available.

The portrait collection, now practically in storage, could be made accessible at
little expense by the erection of a gallery in the north tower office, as already recom-
mended.

The collections of this section are now catalogued, and it is believed that the con-
dition of the specimens is in every way as satisfactory as could possibly be expected.
Much credit is due to my assistant, Mr. Paul Beckwith, for his labors in this section. .

Dr. Thomas Wilson, curator of the Division of Prehistoric Arche-
ology, makes the following report:

The usual routine course in the reception, marking, and display of specimens was
pursued during the year. For details relating to these topics reference should be
made to my reports for the two preceding years.

We have continued our work in the rearrangement of specific displays, endeavoring
to bring together objects which there belong. The system adopted, of a geographical
subdivision, coupled with the immense mass of objects which we have, renders this
labor almost continuous. The objects are delivered to us en masse and have to be
segregated; this, with the same labor continued and applied to the 200,000 specimens
under our care, makes a task which can never be fully completed.

The objects on exhibition are becoming crowded, and with almost every accession
there must be a rearrangement to afford room for these new arrivals.

Special investigations conducted during the year by members of the
Department staff may be briefly summarized as follows:

The head curator has, as in preceding years, devoted most of his
time and energies to the work of the Department, transacting routine
business, perfecting its methods and facilities in caring for and install-
ing collections. He has found time to complete a report on ethnolog-
5S REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

ical and general archeological observations made in the far West
during previous years. This will appear in the Annual Report of the
Museum for 1901. In addition, he has spent much time in completing
the manuscript and illustrations for a large work on ancient pottery of
the United States, begun some years ago, and has entered upon the
work of preparing a full report on the great industries of mining and
quarrying among the native tribes.

As already mentioned, a large part of the year has been taken up
with the preparation of an exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition.
This work consisted of the construction of life-sized lay figure groups
of type tribes of our aborigines, comprising some 60 figures of men,
women, and children. The designing of the groups and the super-
vision of the work fell almost wholly to the lot of the head curator.
The same may be said of the preparation of 16 dwelling group models
described in connection with full accounts of the lay figure groups in
the appendix to this report.

Professor Mason, curator of the Division of Ethnology, has pub-
lished in The Anthropologist a paper on American basketry technic
and made investigations for enlarging this study for a monograph on
the subject. He had given much time to the ethnology of the Philip-
pine Islands, so as to be prepared for any questions that might arise,
and has, in association with the head curator, compiled a paper
embodying detailed instructions to collectors in the Philippines. He
translated for the Secretary, who has published tbem in his report,
the papers of Blumentritt and Virchow on this subject, and assisted,
as a member of the United States Board on Geographic Names, to fix
the nomenclature of the islands.

Professor Mason has also completed a study on American aboriginal
harpoons and has read the proof of the result, which will appear as ¢
paper in the Museum report for 1900.

On the return of Col, F. F. Hilder from the Philippines, Professor
Mason undertook the task of cataloguing the large collection made,
and the elaborate labels used on the collection at the Pan-American
Exposition were all prepared by him. During the winter much of
Professor Mason’s time was taken up in preparing labels for the exten-
sive ethnological exhibit made by the Department of Anthropology at
this exposition.

Dr. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Arche-
ology, was invited by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, at
the beginning of the present fiscal year, to attend a series of interna-
tional congresses to be held at Paris, France, during the exposition of
1900, and sailed for that country on the Netherlands steamer Maasdam
on August 4, arriving at Boulogne-sur-Mer on the 13th. He attended
the Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology, before
which he presented two papers: ‘t Prehistoric archeology in America”
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY. 59

and ‘A classification of arrowpoints, spearheads, and knives of pre-
historic times.” He was present at the Congress of Ethnology, and
was presiding officer during one day. At the Congress of American-
ists he presented a paper on ‘‘Jade in America.” These various com-
munications were translated into French, and left, with the necessary
illustrations, in custody of the proper committees for publication.

On his return from Paris he prepared a summary of the reports
of proceedings of the International Congresses of Anthropology and
Prehistoric Archeology and of the Congress of Americanists, which
were sent to Prof. J. H. Gore, commissioner, to be transmitted by him
in his formulation of the reports of Mr. Ferdinand Peck, United States
commissioner to the Paris Exposition of 1900.

Dr. Wilson has completed a translation into French of his paper on
‘*The antiquity of the red race in America,” which appeared in the
U.S. National Museum Report for 1895, and this translation has been
published in L’Anthropologie for the current year (p. 41), under the
title of ** L’?Antiquité des peaux-rouges en Amerique.”

A paper on ‘‘ Criminology” was read by him before the American
Association for the Advancement of Science at its forty-ninth meeting,
in New York, June, 1900, and has been published in the proceedings
of that association for 1900. ;

His investigations into prehistoric trepanation have been continued,
and his paper on that subject has been completed and presented for
publication by the Museum.

He was engaged during the year, at the request of Mr. H. R. Bishop,
of New York City, in the preparation of a paper on ‘‘ Jade,” which is
now completed and will shortly be ready for publication.

Dr. Wilson has been interested in determining, so far as possible,
the truth of the. allegation that prehistoric man was ambidextrous.
He has obtained from the Carlisle and Hampton schools reports as to
the proportion of right and left handedness among the tribes there
represented. In continuation of this subject he has made a considera-
ble examination of such prehistoric tools and implements as are con-
tained in the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, with a view of
determining the proportion each way. Nearly all of these tools were
adapted to either hand; but the hatchets or gouges made of the fulgur
shell and used with a handle which had been inserted afford a basis for
comparison, and the study of these has been nearly completed.

Explorations conducted for the purpose of enriching the collections
of the Museum have been made by members of the Museum staff and
other experienced collectors. The head curator visited the vicinity of
Mill Creek, Union County, Illinois, to join Dr. W. A. Phillips, of the
Field Columbian Museum, in the examination of the very extensive
and important flint quarries at that place. A large collection of imple-
ments and of quarry shop rejectamenta of numerous varieties was
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

secured. Dr. Walter Hough began work in connection with Mr. Peter
G. Gates in the Pueblo country, in June, and by the end of the fiscal
year had reported very flattering progress. Prof. J. B. Steere, of Ann
Arbor, Michigan, made collections on the Upper Purus River, in Brazil.
William A. Cook forwarded many valuable objects from the Borord, a
Tupian tribe dwelling near the headwaters of the Paraguay, in Brazil.
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U.S. Navy, secured much valuable material from
3ritish Columbia and Alaska; and of special interest and importance
is the outfit for a Chileat family, now utilized in one of the Pan-
American Exposition lay-figure groups.

Two expeditions sent out by the Government board of the Pan-
American Exposition secured most valuable accessions, now displayed
at Buffalo. These expeditions were conducted, one by Dr. W J
McGee, in Sonora, Mexico, and the other by Col. F. F. Hilder, in
the Philippines.

Dr. Roland Steiner, though not officially attached to the Museum,
continued his investigations and searches into quarries, workshops,
and village sites of his own neighborhood near and at the mouth of
Shoulderbone Creek and on Little Kiokee River, Georgia, and has
collected many thousands of specimens of prehistoric artifacts, all of
which are now deposited in this Museum.

Seven papers on anthropological subjects have been furnished dur-
ing the year by members of the staff of this department. Two are by
the head curator, Mr. W. H. Holmes. One of these relates to the
obsidian mines of Hidalgo, Mexico, while the other is a review of the
evidence relating to early man in California, as furnished by the aurif-
erous gravels.

The curator of ethnology, Prof. Otis T. Mason, prepared a paper
entitled ‘‘ Traps of the Amerinds,” which was published in the Pro-
ceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science;
also one relating to the pointed canoes of the Kootenai River in Wash-
ington and those used on the Amur, and a third, describing a primi-
tive heddle frame for weaving narrow fabrics, in use among the Indians
of the Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo region, and also throughout
the Eastern States and in Europe.

The full titles of all these papers will be found in the bibliography
(Appendix IV), arranged under the names of their respective authors.

Facilities for the study of museum collections have been afforded a
number of students. Much material relating to primitive games has
been forwarded to Dr. Stewart Culin, of the Museum of Science and
Art, in Philadelphia; and various articles bearing upon Asiatic con-
tact with the west coast of America have been placed at the disposal

of Dr. Franz Boas, of the American Museum of Natural History, New
York.

It has given curators of the Department much pleasure to aid post-
graduate students, journalists, teachers with their classes, public lec-
turers, and specialists in all branches of anthropology. The collections
have been made available to the fullest extent to all students.

The following objects from the marine architecture collection were
lent for exhibition at the Pan-American Exposition: The original
Francis life-saving car, to the U.S. Life-Saving Service, and seven
boat models to the U. S. Fish Commission.

The specimens of earliest electrical apparatus belonging to the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers and to Miss Sarah J.
Farmer, and deposited in the Museum, were forwarded, at the request
of the owners, to Mr. Francis E. Drake for exhibition at the Paris
Exposition, They have been returned, but many of the objects are in
such a badly damaged condition as to be entirely unsuited for further
exhibition.

A series of spindle whorls was lent to Miss H. Newall Wardle,
Academy of Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia, Pa., at the request of
Dr. Dixon, for purposes of study.

The demand for collections for exposition display has been unusu-
ally great, and objects aggregating in value many thousands of dollars
are now installed in the Government building at Buffalo. The wear
and tear upon many of these specimens is serious, and it may seem
wise in future for the Museum authorities to take steps toward coun-
teracting the deterioration that comes from exposure, use, and the
vicissitudes of shipment and reshipment.
i

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901.

By Freprerick W. True,
Head Curator.

The past year has been remarkable for the amount of scientific work
accomplished, and has been especially marked by the completion of
preparations for participation in the Pan-American Exposition and the
installation of the Children’s Room under the immediate direction of
the Secretary. The additions to the collections have been numerous
and as a whole compare favorably in scientific value with those of any
recent year.

THE EXHIBITION COLLECTIONS.

In those years in which the Museum participates in a large exposi-
tion or world’s fair, as has been the case this year, improvements in the
regular exhibition series advance slowly, for the reason that the prepa-
rators and mechanics are necessarily diverted from their regular duties.
Although large numbers of interesting objects were prepared for the
Pan-American Exposition, they can not, of course, be incorporated in
the regular exhibition series until after the close of the exposition.
The benefit of the work accomplished during the year covered by this
report will not, therefore, be felt until the ensuing year.

For reasons which will be explained elsewhere, the exhibit prepared
for Buffalo consists entirely of American vertebrates. It includes
many large, characteristic American animals, such as the Kodiak bear,
Glacier bear, Alaska moose, white sheep, musk ox, West Indian seal,
condor, rhea, bald eagle, boa constrictor, alligator snapper, Galapagos
turtle, various large fishes, ete. These are all of the highest grade as
regards taxidermy and for the most part unrepresented in the regu-
lar exhibition series. They will add materially to the effectiveness of
the exhibition halls when returned from Buffalo.

One of the most important operations of the year, as already stated,
was the installation of collections in the Children’s Room in the Smith-
sonian building. This room was assigned by the Secretary of the
Institution for a collection which should be in every respect suited to
the comprehension of children. The room was entirely refitted under
competent architectural advice and is now the handsomest room in

68
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

the Museum. The windows were reconstructed so as to give the maxi-_
mum amount of light, by inserting plate glass in the wall without the
intervention of sashes. The walls were painted a pleasing color and
the ceiling decorated in an elaborate manner with frescoes representing
a bower of vines, with birds perched at the various openings. The
floor was relaid in marble mosaic. The cases are of maple, finished
as light as possible and made low enough for a child to see on the
top shelves. The shelving is of glass. Two aquariums have been
placed in the center of the room, one furnished with a fountain and
intended for fresh-water animals, the other for salt-water animals. A
large bird cage containing bright-colored birds and songsters is sus-
pended from the ceiling.

The following series of objects selected by the Secretary have been
installed in the cases: (1) A series of familiar American birds; (2) com-
mon European birds; (8) large birds of prey; (4) interesting water
birds; (5) curious birds, such as the crocodile bird, kiwi, etc.; (6)
some brilliant-colored birds; (7) curious nests and eg@s; (8) a series of
specimens with accessories representing protective mimicry, under the
saption, ‘‘ How creatures hide;” (9) remarkable insects; (10) bright-
colored shells; (11) other interesting invertebrates; (12) remarkable
minerals. In addition, the bower of a bower bird is exhibited and a
number of Audubon pictures representing birds in action.

The labels are adapted to the comprehension of children, being in
untechnical language throughout. They are printed in large type and
contain interesting information regarding the habits of birds, ete. It
is confidently anticipated that the airiness and beauty of the room and
fittings and the beauty and brillianey of the exhibits will prove exceed-
ingly attractive to children and hardly less so to older persons.

At the beginning of the year a new terrazzo floor was laid in the
southeast range, containing the exhibition series of reptiles, batrach-
ians, and fishes, and the cases were reassorted and arranged with
special reference to the lighting and all extraneous objects removed.
Toward the close of the year two windows which were formerly
obscured by the roof of the restaurant outside were opened again, and
the hall, in spite of the rather low ceiling, is now one of the best
lighted in the building. The fishes occupy upright cases along the
walls, and the reptiles and batrachians a series of floor cases with slop-
ing tops. These latter are not the best that could be designed for this
purpose; but as no new ones could be built, it was necessary to make
use of them. The exhibit consists of casts of North American species.
[t is intended to supplement these by collections of South American
and Old World species in liquid.

The question of the best form of preparation for an exhibition series
of lower vertebrates is one which has occupied a good deal of attention.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. 65

Painted casts can never be actual facsimiles of the animals as they
appear in life, and for that reason are less valuable than preparations
of specimens. ‘The painting of casts in life colors by competent artists
involves very large expense. Furthermore, such casts are rather art
objects than natural history specimens. On the other hand, there is
no known method of retaining life colors in specimens preserved in
liquids, and such specimens are therefore less attractive to the public
than they should be. In certain European museums a method of
painting the actual specimens with pigments which resist the action of
the preservative liquids has been employed. This may prove a solution
of the difficulty. A number of experiments with this process and also
with formalin preparations were made during the year, and it is
expected that a conclusion will soon be reached as to the method or
methods which can be most profitably employed in the enlargement of
the exhibition series. At present it seems probable that for large and
medium sized species of North American fishes, batrachians, and reptiles
it will be best to continue to make painted casts, ignoring the fact that
the colors as represented are more or less diagrammatic; that for exotic
species, especially those inhabiting remote parts of the world, and for
all very small species, specimens in formalin or alcohol, painted or not,
will necessarily be employed.

The exhibit at present consists of 167 fish casts, 73 reptile casts, 11
batrachian casts, 2 large stuffed sharks, an alligator, and a group
illustrating the habitat of a species of goby.

Some highly successful experiments have been made in constructing
composite preparations of turtles by casting the head, tail, and limbs
and fitting them into the natural shell or carapace.

A small series of deep-sea fishes, about 25 or 30 in number, was
placed on exhibition. As these fish are almost invariably much
mutilated when dragged from the deep sea, they are not well suited
for public exhibition. To supplement them a series of colored
figures, chiefly from Garman’s ‘* Deep-Sea Fishes” and from Goode
and Bean’s ** Oceanic Ichthyology,” is exhibited with the specimens,
which they serve to explain. In connection with the exhibit for the
Pan-American Exposition an enlarged model of one of the luminous
deep-sea species was prepared, and a typical series of similar casts
will probably be prepared during the coming year.

The walls of the entrance hall of the Smithsonian building were
repainted during the year, and a better background obtained for the
game birds, fishes, and large mammal heads there exhibited. A plan
was perfected for reorganizing the exhibit of game birds and render-
ing it more effective by replacing single specimens by groups with
accessories representing the birds in their native wilds. <A series of

NAT mus 1901——d5d
66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

twenty groups, each about 2 by 3 feet, are in contemplation, four
of which have already been completed.

A laree amount of work was done by the taxidermists in remount-
ing old specimens of value in the regular faunal exhibition series of
hirds. and one taxidermist was continuously engaged in overhauling
the collection to keep it from deterioration. This is made necessary
on account of the imperfect condition of the cases which are now at
least twenty-five years old and far from being dust and vermin proof.

New labels were prepared for the American carnivorous mammals
in the large wall case on the east side of the south hall, completed
two years ago. It was found necessary to store a large lot of boxes
of mounted birds in the west side of the hall behind the detached
cases containing the groups of large mammals. As these were very
unsightly the back glass of the cases was painted and wooden parti-
tions were set up between them. This is only a temporary provision.
Nothing was done directly by way of adding to the series of mounted
mammals, on account of the preparations for the Buffalo Exposition,
as already explained.

Early in the autumn experiments were begun looking toward the
construction of exhibition boxes for insects. It was thought that this
seemingly trifling matter could be disposed of in a week or two, but,
in fact, to obtain an immaculate surface in the boxes on which the
insects could be pinned and which would not warp during changes in
the weather proved to be a task of no small magnitude and baffled the
ingenuity of the Museum mechanics for many months. Toward the
close of the year the desired background was at last obtained by
the use of specially prepared cork and blotting paper, and the few
boxes filled have proved quite satisfactory. It is expected that the
whole exhibition series will be reorganized and transferred to the new
boxes during the coming year.

A new series of enlarged models representing the structure of
feathers was placed on exhibition in the hall of comparative anatomy
during the year, and a part of the other models were transferred to
new cases with large glass.

EXPLORATIONS.

In the spring of 1901, by arrangement with the Museum, Mr. Dane
Coolidge made extensive collections of mammals in the mainland of
Italy and in Sicily and southern France. Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., engaged
in collecting operations in the vicinity of Peterboro, New York, in July
and August, 1900. An arrangement was made with Dr. E. A. Mearns,
U.S. Army, to engage in explorations in central Florida, and especially
to visit various type localities for mammals. He was in the field from
February to May, 1901, and made large collections, especially along
the Kissimee River, Toward the close of the year Mr. W. H. Ashmead

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. 67

was detailed to make entomological collections in the Hawaiian Islands,
taking advantage of the excellent opportunities for transportation, ete.,
afforded on account of the marine work being carried on from island
to island by the U.S. Fish Commission. Further advantage was taken
of the operations of the Commission by detailing Dr. J. E. Benedict to
accompany the steamer /7sh /Zavk, which was engaged in an investi-
gation of the offshore fishing banks in the Gulf of Mexico opposite
Anelote River, Florida. By invitation, Mr. Charles T. Simpson
accompanied Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., in conchological explorations
about the islands of Haitiand Jamaica. About six weeks in November
and December were spent in this work.

In addition to the collecting parties sent out last year in behalf of
the Pan-American Exposition, Prof. J. B. Steere made explorations
along the Amazon River, Brazil, in the spring of 1901, and Messrs.
Barton A. Bean and William H. King collected fishes at Key West,
Florida. Messrs. Palmer and Riley, who visited Cuba on behalf of
the Exposition, and Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., who made collections in
Venezuela, returned to the United States in August.

In July, 1900, Messrs. Charles L. Pollard and William R. Maxon
made botanical explorations in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee,
obtaining collections of much interest. In May, 1901, Mr. Pollard
visited the mountains of North Carolina and obtained a rich collection
of violets, as well as other plants.

ACCESSIONS.

In the majority of divisions of the Department the accessions sur-
passed those of last year in number and were of equal or greater
importance. The increase in mammals was 2,593 specimens, a very
large number. Of insects a smaller number was received—37,000, as
compared with 85,000 last year—but the value scientifically was not
inferior. The accessions of birds’ eggs far surpassed those of last
year in number and value. The importance of the accessions to the
Division of Marine Invertebrates was much greater than last year.
On the whole the year may be considered as more than ordinarily
prosperous.

Dr. W. L. Abbott continued his extensive natural history explora-
tions in the East Indies, and contributed large collections of mammals,
birds, reptiles, mollusks, insects, and marine invertebrates from the
Natuna Islands, the Mergui Archipelago, and the coast of’ Tringanu
(Malay Peninsula). About twenty new species of mammals have been
detected in these collections, and there are doubtless others, as well
as new birds, reptiles, etc. These collections constitute additions of
- great importance.

While stationed at Newport, Rhode Island, Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S.
Army, made extensive zoological collections in all classes, which he
65 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

presented to the Museum. Later, as already stated, arrangements
were made with him to collect small mammals from type localities in
Florida, especially along the Kissimmee River., He obtained about
200 mammals. some 600 birds, including many in plumages not previ-
ously represented in the Museum collections, such as the downy young
of the Florida Dusky duck, etc.; also many birds’ eggs, including five
eges of the Florida Dusky duck, Anas fulvigula, and large numbers
of reptiles, among which was a fine series of skulls and skeletons of
the soft-shelled turtle, Platypeltis spinifer.

Notice was taken in last year’s report of an expedition to Venezuela
by Capt. Wirt Robinson, U.S. Army, with whom was associated Mr.
M. W. Lyon, jr. The collectors succeeded in obtaining a considerable
quantity of material, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects.
The collection was rich in bats and included some beautifully preserved
reptiles, among which were two new species of snakes, /’seudoboa rob-
insoni and Phrynonaz lyons. :

In the spring of 1901, Prof. J. B. Steere was authorized to make
collections of characteristic reptiles and fish of the Amazon River for
exhibition at the Pan-American Exposition. He was successful in
this work, and obtained also a fine adult skeleton of the Amazon por-
poise, /n/a amazonica, some interesting wasps’ nests, and other objects.

The mammal collection from southern Europe obtained by Mr. Dane
Coolidge, already mentioned, included what is probably the best series
of Italian rodents now in existence. The collection of mammals made
by Mr. G. S. Miller, jr., in Madison County, New York, contains
about 200 specimens.

The Museum had the good fortune to obtain from Mrs. E. D. Cope,
by purchase, a specimen of the extinct Philip Island parrot, Vestor
productus. ‘There are now two specimens of this bird in the Museum.
Only about twelve specimens are known to be preserved.

In the middle of the year the Museum purchased the private collec-
tion of Mr. Robert Ridgway, containing about 1,100 North and Cen-
tral American birds, including many in the first plumages, and all
exceedingly perfect specimens. There were no duplicates in the
collections.

The type of a supposed new Mountain Chickadee, Parus gambeli
thayer’, was presented by the late F. J. Birtwell.

Mr. C. B. Kloss presented a representative series of 56 birds from
Singapore Island, Malay Peninsula. Capt. H. C. Benson, U.S. Army,
presented an excellent collection of nests and eggs of Philippine birds,
accompanied in the majority of cases by specimens of the birds. A
pair of the rare Stitch birds of New Zealand was purchased; also six

skins of the imperial parrot of Dominica Island, West Indies; and four,

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. 69

with extraordinary plumes. The last i entioned is exhibited in the
children’s room.

Dr. William L. Ralph continued his generous donation of rare birds’
eggs, included among which were eges of the Everglade kite and Hens-
low’ssparrow. Some small collections of eves from the western United
States and Mexico, received from the Biological Survey, Department
of Agriculture, were extremely rich in rarities.

The naturalist of the United States Fish Commission Steamer A/ha-
tross obtained for the Museum a collection of 55 reptiles from the Poly-
nesian Islands during the recent cruise of the vessel in the South Seas,
a welcome addition to the scant collections from that part of the world.
Thirty-seven reptiles from the island of St. Kitts, West Indies, were
presented by Mr. W. H. Alexander, United States weather observer.

The types of the new species of fish collected by the /7%sh /Taiwk:
expedition of 1899, to Porto Rico, were deposited in the Museum by
the United States Fish Commission, together with other specimens
from that island.

Dr. O. P. Jenkins, of Leland Stanford Junior University, presented
the type of Hawaiian fishes collected in the islands by himself and
Mr. T. D. Wood. The university also presented a series of Japanese
fishes.

Regarding important accessions of mollusks, Mr. William H. Dall,
honorary curator, writes as follows:

Scientifically the most interesting lot of material received was from Dr. W. East-
lake, of Tokyo, Japan (through Mr. H. F. Moore, of the Fish Commission), com-
prising about 500 species of oriental shells, a department in which we are
exceptionally weak and which this donation materially assisted.

Next, perhaps, comes the collection made by Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., and Mr.
Simpson, in Haiti and Jamaica, comprising over 200 species and 3,000 specimens,
which have not been fully administered upon, but which will add valuable and
needed material to the collection.

A collection of Naiades from South and Central America, sent by Dr. H. von
Ihering and comprising some 225 species, has proved especially valuable, filling
many gaps.

A collection of Australian shells, sent in exchange by the Australian Museum, is
among the more noteworthy additions.«

Other accessions worthy of special mention are those from the Malay Peninsula
and adjacent islands, sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott; the collections made in Mexico and
Yucatan by Mr. E. W. Nelson, of the Department of Agriculture, and a small col-
lection from the vicinity of Pernambuco, Brazil, received from Dr. J. C. Branner.

The accessions of insects are so numerous, amounting to 297, com-
prising 37,000 specimens, that it is impossible to mention even the
more important ones in detail in this place. Preeminent among them,
however, was the Hofmann collection of European Lepidoptera. This
collection was formed by the late Dr. O. Hofmann, and was purchased
by the Museum from Prof. A. R. Grote, of Hildesheim, Germany.
70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

It contains 15,626 specimens, a splendid series of European Lepidop-
tera, particularly rich in the smaller moths.

Other important accessions may be summarized as follows: From
the Philippine Islands, several accessions of insects of all orders, pre-
sented by Dr. P. L. Stangl, U.S. Army, and 100 butterflies, presented
by Mr. Samuel H. Adams; from Porto Rico, 30 dragon flies, presented
by Mr. G. N. Collins, United States Department of Agriculture; from
the Hawaiian Islands, 258 Hymenoptera, donated by the committee for
investigating the fauna and flora of these islands (through Dr. David
Sharpe), 3 lots given by Mr. H. W. Henshaw, together with the large
series collected by Mr. William H. Ashmead; from Cuba were
received the collections made by Messrs. Palmer and Riley of the
Museum; from New Mexico, several lots of insects of all orders,
including types of bees, presented by Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell; from
Utah, 5 vials containing types of Lithobiide, presented by Mr. Ralph
V. Chamberlain; from Paraguay, 1,665 butterflies and moths, together
with other insects, were purchased; from the Galapagos Islands, 216
Diptera, presented by Mr. Robert E. Snodgrass; from Venezuela, 174
insects, collected by Dr. M. J. Lyon; from South Africa, 63 Diptera,
representing 27 species, from C. P. Lounsbury, Government entomol-
ogist, Capetown; from the Malay Peninsula and the Natuna Islands, 3
lots of insects, collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott; from Australia, a col-
lection of parasitic Hymenoptera, presented by the department of
mines and agriculture, Sydney; from Germany, 545 Diptera and 48
galls ot Hlormomyta fag?, presented by Mr. Theo. Pergande.

In addition should be mentioned the following: Six thousand Mex- °

ican diptera from Prof. C. H. T. Townsend; a collection of 396 Diptera,
comprising 92 species, received in exchange from the Museum fiir
Naturkunde, Berlin, and 141 Diptera, presented by Mr. C. W. Johnson;
400 moths, presented by Dr. William Barnes; 15 types of Chambers’s
Tineide, presented by the Laville University; 202 moths, presented
by Dr. Ottolengui; 5 types and 1 cotype of species of Noctuide, pre-
sented by Prof. John B. Smith; 50 moths and 4 types, presented by
Dr. James Fletcher; 100 living cocoons of Monema flavescens and 100
moths, presented by Mr. A. E. Wileman; a collection of Mutillide
and Formicide received in exchange from Ernest André, esq., Gray,
France; 38 Orthoptera, together with some types and cotypes, pre-
sented by W. 5. Blatchley through the United States Department of
Agriculture; 22 rare Hydrocecia, presented by Mr. Henry Bird; types
of Jasside, presented by Prof. Herbert Osborn, Ohio State University.

The United States Fish Commission transferred to the Museum six
important collections of marine invertebrates, as follows:

(1) The ophiurans of the ‘tAgassiz” cruise of the Albatross, 1891,
to the Galapagos Islands, west coast of Mexico, etc., and determined
by Drs. Lutken and Mortensen.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. fal

(2) Japanese Crustacea collected by the A/batross, 1900. These
comprise specimens dredged in various depths as well as those col-
lected along shore by Dr. H. F. Moore, naturalist of the A/batross.

(8) Corals from the Albatross South Sea expedition, 1899-1900; to
be studied and reported upon by Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan.

(4) Corals collected in Porto Rican waters by the /7sh [awh, 1899.
Determined by Mr. Vaughan and results to be published in bulletin
of the United States Fish Commission.

(5) Large collection of crayfishes collected in West Virginia, 1899,
by a field party of the Fish Commission. Determined by Mr. W. P.
Hay.

(6) Arctic crustaceans and echinoderms collected by the Princeton
University expedition, 1899. These species were named when received.

Other collections of lower invertebrates which should be mentioned
in this place are the types of the oligochete worms (Enchytreide)
collected by the Harriman Alaska expedition and presented through
Dr. C. Hart Merriam; the types of Cambarus gallinus presented by
Prof. Theodore D. A. Cockerell; a collection of marine and fresh-
water crustaceans from the Hawaiian Islands, presented by Mr. H. W.
Henshaw; Philippine corals and sponges, received in exchange from
Father José Aleué; specimens of ocean bottom obtained in connection
with the Pacific cable survey made by the U. 8. S. Wero, and trans-
mitted by the Hydrographic Office, U. S. Navy.

A very important accession of the year was the Willey lichen her-
barium, comprising 10,000 specimens from all parts of the world,
constituting the entire private collection of the late Henry Willey, a
well-known specialist in this group of plants. The collection was
purchased by the Museum from the estate.

Other important accessions of plants, which were chiefly from the
Southern United States and Mexico, are as follows: From West Vir-
ginia, 465 specimens, collected by Mr. E. L. Morris and received through
the United States Fish Commission; from North Carolina, 200 speci-
mens, collected by Mr. C. L. Pollard, of the Museum; from Alabama,
Georgia, and Tennessee, 1,600 plants, collected by Messrs. Pollard and
Maxon, of the Museum staff; from Louisiana, 144 specimens, presented
by Mr. C. R. Ball, United States Department of Agriculture; from
Oregon, 5,400 plants, collected by Mr. E. P. Sheldon and received
through the United States Department of Agriculture; from Utah,
126 specimens, received in exchange; from Alaska, 174 specimens,
presented by Mrs. J. B. Flett, and 248 specimens received in exchange
from the New York Botanical Garden; also 100 specimens of arbo-
rescent plants, from various localities in the United States, presented
by Prof. C. 5. Sargent; and 887 specimens from various localities in
the United States and Mexico and Central America, received in
exchange from the Gray Herbarium.

a This is the first species of crayfish known from New Mexico,
72 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

The following were the principal purchases of plants made during the
year: 917 specimens from Georgia, 1,298 specimens from Florida and
Mississippi, 670 specimens from Missouri, 295 specimens from New
Mexico, 268 specimens from Mexico, and 100 specimens (Alge) from
various localities in the United States.

WORK ON THE STUDY COLLECTIONS.

In the Division of Mammals the work of renovating skins in danger
of destruction on account of their greasy condition or otherwise was
continued, special attention being paid to the medium-sized skins—
monkeys, small carnivores, ete. About 600 specimens were treated
during the year.

The collections of small mammals are now in good condition and for
the most part well arranged. The collections of large skins, on the
other hand, are still to a great extent in bad or even dangerous con-
dition, due to lack of cases, room, and taxidermic assistance. The
specimens in cases are overcrowded, and hundreds have remained for
several years without cases, exposed to dust and vermin. Still others
are in vats containing preservatives, where they have remained for a
number of years.

Considerable work has been done during the year in rearranging
the large skulls, a commodious storage space having been provided
behind the large wall case on the east side of the South Hall.

A considerable number of worthless mammal skins which had accu-
mulated were brought together, passed upon by a committee of inspec-
tion, and condemned.

In order to make room for headquarters for the Department, the
mamimal collections of the Biological Survey, Department of Agri-
culture, formerly in the south entrance of the Museum building, were
transferred to the north baleony. Some 3,000 small mammal skulls
belonging to the collection of the Survey were cleaned during the
year, a platform was built on the cases containing the collections in
the southeast range, and 12 new unit cases were constructed.

In the Division of Birds little work was done on the cabinet collec-
tions. ‘The assistant curator was alone, and being fully occupied by
the preparations for the Pan-American Exposition and the installation
of the children’s room, he found little time to devote to other than
routine work, such as answering correspondence, recording specimens,
attending to accessions, loans, ete. Toward the end of the year, how-
ever, 18 new half-unit cases were placed in the West basement, and a
beginning made in transferring the birds from the old and imperfect
cases previously used and arranging them in systematic order. ‘The
collections of birds’ eggs are in excellent condition, but the nests are
not properly housed, being still in cases not dust proof. The dupli-

cate eges were overhauled during the year and a considerable amount
of worthless material discarded.

In the Division of Reptiles the old trays containing the study collee-
tions were replaced at the beginning of the year by a new system of
shelving, doubling the storage capacity of the laboratory. The shelves
are movable and provided with simple runners, so that they can be
raised or lowered with the greatest ease and without loss of time. <A
rearrangement of the collections could not be undertaken during the
year, as the electric lighting of the laboratory was not completed.
The clerk of this division, the only assistant of the curator, was ill
for a considerable part of the year, and finally died.

The collections of fishes were thoroughly overhauled and provided
with new alcohol. Red labels were furnished for the type specimens
received during the year, and a considerable part of the regular series
relabeled.

One of the principal operations of the Division of Mollusks was a
thorough revision of the Lucinacea, the larger portion of which was
relabeled in accordance with the revised classification of the group.
The new accessions of the year were labeled and distributed to their
proper places in the collection.

The sets of lower marine invertebrates prepared for distribu-
tion to educational institutions having been exhausted, a new series of
100 sets was prepared during the year. Each set contains about 300
specimens, representing from 85 to 95 species. Ten special sets of
duplicate specimens were also made up and distributed to museums
and kindred institutions and 12 lots sent out for exchange purposes.
Accessions of the year were cared for as soon as received, and the
greater part of the crustaceans named, but for the lack of clerical assist-
ance it was impossible to catalogue specimens as fast as received.

The ophiurans received from the Agassiz Albatross expedition of
1891, and determined by Drs. Lutken and Mortensen, were catalogued
and the duplicates divided into seven sets and distributed to seven of
of the principal museums in Europe and America.

In the Division of Insects the work on the general collections is
reported upon by Dr. L. O. Howard, honorary curator, as follows:

The collections are probably as well cared for as the room at our disposal, the help
available, and the number of insect drawers obtainable will permit.

The Lepidoptera are well arranged in the standard insect drawers, and the large
and yaluable Hofmann collection of European moths has been incorporated. A card
catalogue of species of the entire collection of Lepidoptera has been prepared and
greatly facilitates the quick finding of specimens.

The collection of sawflies and part of the ichneumon flies have been transferred to
these same drawers and Mr. Schwarz has superintended the transfer of the North
American Cerambycidee to them, the Hubbard and Schwarz collection in this family
being at the same time incorporated with the regular museum series. A rearrange-
ment of some of the exotic collections of Coleoptera has also been made.
74 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Dr. Dyar has spent much time in the identification and arrangement of exotic
material, being assisted, particularly in the mounting and labeling of new material,
by Mr. A. N. Caudell, of the Department of Agriculture, Division of Entomology.

“Mr. Ci \quillett has done much work on the Diptera, Mr. Ashmead on the Hymen-
optera, and Mr. Schwarz, as far as his impaired health would permit, on the
Coleoptera.

Mr. Currie has worked on the Odonata and Myrmeleonidee, having named most of
the North American insects in these groups 4nd mounted and labeled a good series
for the systematic collection. Lack of room, however, has prevented their perma-
nent arrangement, most of the available space and drawers being taken up by the
Orthoptera.

The exotic and duplicate Coleoptera and the Arachnida and Myriapoda have been
removed to the east-south range gallery. Mr. Banks has rearranged much of the
Arachnida and has transferred the vials containing the Marx coilection and the reg-
ular collection to museum jars filled with alcohol, thus avoiding the danger of the
material drying up.

Work has also been done by Professor Cook on the Myriapoda and by Mr. Heide-
mann on the Hemiptera-Heteroptera.

Mr. F. V. Coville, honorary curator, Division of Plants, furnishes
the following report on the progress of work in the herbarium:

In the last annual report a description of the new insect-proof case was given, and
reference was made to the installation of 80 of these on the floor of the gallery over
the southern range. In accordance with the plan of gradual replacement outlined

-at that time, 14 of these cases have recently been set up along the west wall of the
main balcony, and 30 additional ones will shortly be installed on the exhibition
balcony. — It has been found that these cases, with their double doors, are well adapted
to the bisulphide treatment at any time, and that insect pests, when eradicated, may
be kept in control by a liberal use of naphthaline in the cases.

The systematic stamping of the sheets in the herbarium has been temporarily dis-
continued on account of the insufficiency of our force. All sheets of specimens,
however, which are loaned for study to persons outside of the Museum are stamped
and recorded before transmission, so that in this way the numbering of the herbarium
is slowly progressing.

During the last few months the work of rearranging the herbarium according to
the sequence established by Engler and Prantl in ‘‘ Die Nattirlichen Pflanzenfamilien”’
has progressed satisfactorily, the ‘‘ Index Generum Phanerogamorum”’ of De Dalla
Torre and Harms being taken asa guide. The ferns and fern allies, gymnosperms
and monocotyledons, are now arranged on the modern sequence.

Owing to the resignation of one of our three preparators on January 15, 1901, the
work of mounting was greatly delayed, and the services of three temporary prepara-
tors were secured by requisitions drawn for the purpose in April of the present year.
One has assisted Mr. Maxon in labeling and mounting the lichens of the Willey
collection; another has mounted miscellaneous plants,and the third has repaired
such sheets in the main herbarium as were found to be impaired by the attacks of
insect pests. The total number of specimens mounted during the year, exclusive of
the cryptogams, is 18,177. Owing to the fact that many of the latter are mounted on
a single sheet it is not possible to make even an approximate estimate of their num-
ber, but the collections.of mosses and lichens, in particular, have been carefully
labeled and all accumulations of material mounted. Our catalogue books show a
total of 24,647 mounted sheets that have been stamped and recorded during the year.
The great majority of these have been distributed into the general herbarium.

Mr. Roland M. Harper was engaged by contract to determine and label the large
collection of plants transmitted by the Fish Commission, to which reference is made
in another part of this report.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. 75

The alcoholics and rough skeletons belonging in the Division of
Comparative Anatomy, which are necessarily kept in one of the
annexes at present, were rearranged and put in order during the
year, and 1,100 skulls of mammals, many of them of large size, were
cleaned and added to the reserve series.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES AND PUBLICATIONS.

The activity of the scientific staff in research was one of the most
prominent and gratifying features of the year’s work, and the large
amount of important results published is shown by the Bibliography
(Appendix IV).

The systematic manual of the birds of North and Middle America, by
Mr. Robert Ridgway, of which mention was made in last year’s report,
progressed favorably in spite of serious interruptions, and the first
volume was put in type. The second volume is nearly ready for the
printer. It is expected that the work will be complete in seven vol-
umes. After careful consideration of all the circumstances in the
case, it was decided to recast the measurements of specimens, which
had been prepared for the first volume in English inches, into metric
measurements, and this system will be followed throughout the work.
Mr. Ridgway also prepared a paper on a new species and genera of
tanagers and orioles.

Dr. Charles W. Richmond continued work on a card catalogue of
genera and species of fossil and recent birds, and also published three
papers relating to the nomenclature of birds. The work of complet-
ing Bendire’s *‘ Life Histories of North American Birds” (Special
Bulletins, U. 5. National Museum, Nos. 1 and 3) was taken up by
Dr. W. L. Ralph, honorary curator of the Section of Birds’ Eges, and
in that connection a circular letter was issued to those interested in
collecting information. A gratifying number of responses has been
received from correspondents and friends of the Institution.

Mr. G. 8. Miller, jr., published twenty papers on mammals during
the year, chiefly noticing new forms in the East Indian collections of
Dr. W. L. Abbott, new European, African, and South American
mammals. Included among them, however, were a revision of the
Red-backed mice of Europe and a key to the land mammals of eastern
North America. Mr. M. W. Lyon, jr., published a study of the oste-
ology of the jerboas and jumping mice.

Papers on the reptiles of Japan and of Porto Rico were nearly com-
pleted by Dr. L. Stejneger during the year. A large series of out-
line illustrations for the former was prepared. Dr. Stejneger also
began a study of the reptiles of Cuba, and illustrations for a paper on
that subject were prepared. In addition he reported on the reptiles
collected by Messrs. Robinson and Lyon in Venezuela and published
two papers on the birds known as Wheatears (genus Sux/cold).
76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

The synopses of the Molluscan families Tellinidee and Cardiide by
Mr. William H. Dall, mentioned in the previous report, were pub-
lished during the year, together with a synopsis of the Lucinacea, the
fifth part of a treatise on the Tertiary mollusks of Florida, eleven
other shorter papers on mollusks, and several articles of a general
character. In conjunction with Mr. Charles 'T. Simpson he prepared
a report on the mollusks collected by the U. 5. Fish Commission
steamer /7sh [lak in Porto Rico. Mr. Simpson also published three
papers on river mussels and continued his studies of the naiades with
the view of publishing a monograph at some time in the future. Mr.
P. Bartsch continued studies on the Pacific Pyramidellidxe, and pub-
lished various short natural history papers in the ‘‘Osprey,” of which he
is associate editor.

In the Division of Marine Invertebrates, Dr. J. E. Benedict con-
tinued his studies of the crustaceans of the family Galatheide and pre-
pared a report on the anomuran crustaceans of the Fish Commission
expedition of 1899 to Porto Rico and a description of four new species
of symmetrical pagurid crustaceans. He also published a paper on
the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus, and its allies.

Miss M. J. Rathbun published a synopsis of the grapsoid crabs of
North America and a report on the decapod and stomatopod crusta-
ceans collected during the Branner-Agassiz expedition to Brazil. She
has also completed keys to the various groups of North American crabs
besides the grapsoids, a report of the brachyuran and macruran crus-
taceans collected during the Stanford University expedition to the
Galapagos Islands in 1898-99; a report on crustaceans of the same
groups collected in Porto Rican waters in 1899 by the U.S. Fish Com-
mission steamer /%sh [/awhk. In reporting on the decapod crustaceans
collected by the Harriman expedition in 1899, Miss Rathbun has under-
taken a review of the Decapoda of the west coast of North America,
making in that connection a study of the vast number of Macrura in
the Museum collected in years past by the naturalists of the steamer
Albatross and by Mr. William H. Dall and others.

Miss Harriet Richardson prepared a report on the isopods of the
Stanford University expedition and published a report on the isopods
of the Branner-Agassiz expedition anda key to the isopods of the east
coast of North America.

Regarding scientific researches in the Division of Insects, Dr. L. O.
Howard reports as follows:

All the material of the Harriman expedition has been worked up, and reports upon
the same are being published in the Proceedings of the Washington Academy of
Sciences. Mr. Coquillett reported upon the Diptera, Mr. Kincaid upon the Ten-
thredinoidea, Sphegoidea, Vespoidea, and metamorphoses of Coleoptera, Mr. Schwarz
upon the Coleoptera and Psyllidee, Mr. Ashmead upon the Hymenoptera asa whole,
Dr. Dyar upon the Lepidoptera (descriptions of the new species being furnished by
several specialists), Mr. Caudell upon the Orthoptera, Mr. Justus W. Folsom, of

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY. (OR

Champaign, Ill., upon the Thysanura, Mr. Heidemann upon the Hemiptera, Mr.
Banks upon the Arachnida and neuropteroid insects, Professor Cook upon the
Myriapoda, Mr. Pergande upon the Aphidide and Formicidee, and Mr. Currie upon
the Odonata.

During the year Mr. Coquillett has been at work monographing certain families of
the Diptera, while Mr. Ashmead has worked upon the Ichneumonoidea and Bombi-
die and has completed his report upon the Hymenoptera Parasitica of the Hawaiian
Islands. His work upon exatic material from Africa, Siam, Japan, Australia, and
New Zealand has aiso been continued.

The various specialists connected with the Division of Insects and the Division of
Entomology, in the Department of Agriculture, have identified material from the
Galapagos Islands collected by Mr. R. E. Snodgrass, and reports upon the same will
soon be published as follows: Mr. Banks upon the Arachnida, Mr. Ashmead upon
the Hymenoptera, Mr. Coquillett upon the Diptera, Dr. Dyar upon the Lepidoptera,
Mr. Currie upon the Odonata, and Mr. Heidemann upon the Hemiptera.

Mr. Currie has continued his work upon the Myrmeleonidie, and is preparing a
synonymical card catalogue of the North American neuropteroid insects which,
together with catalogues of the North American insects in other orders, it is pro-
posed to publish for the Museum. Much work has also been done on catalogues of
Lepidoptera by Dr. Dyar, and Hymenoptera by Mr. Ashmead.

Mr. Caudell has published a synopsis of the hemipterous genus Sinea, and has
identified considerable material in the Orthoptera.

The bibliography of the division shows 78 titles of papers on insects
by members of the staff published during the year. The honorary
curator, Dr. L. O. Howard, also published a popular book on habits
and classification of mosquitoes.

Mr. F. A. Lucas prosecuted studies on flightless birds and on the
osteology of the Tile-fish and its allies.

In the Division of Plants Mr. F. V. Coville published five botanical
papers during the year. Mr. Rose (with Prof. J. M. Coulter) published
a monograph of the North American Umbelliferze, and has continued
his studies of the flora of Mexico, with the view of ultimately pub-
lishing an extensive work on that subject. Mr. Pollard continued his
studies of the violets, and published a description of a new //e//anthus,
and a series of popular articles on the families of flowering plants.
Mr. William R. Maxon continued studies of the ferns and their allies
and published a list of these plants growing in North America and
eight other papers relating to them.

LOAN OF SPECIMENS.

The practice of lending collections to investigators for study con-
tinued as in previous years. While it is impossible in this place to
notice all these transactions in detail, mention will be made of the more
important instances.

Twenty-eight specimens of Hutia rats (Capromys) were lent to Mr.
F. M. Chapman, of the American Museum of Natural History, who is
engaged in a revision of the genus. Thirty-five bats were lent to Mr.
James A. G. Rehn, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.
78 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Mr. Francis J. Birtwell, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, received 60 skins
of the Mountain Chickadee, Parus gambeli, 50 skins of the Nuthatches,
Sitta carolinensis aculeata and mexicana, and 75 skins of various sub-
species of Creepers ( Certhia) for comparison with New Mexican speci-
mens. * To Dr. Jonathan Dwight, jr., were sent 28 skins of Zgzalztes
to aid him in determining the status of the subspecies 4. meloda cir-
cumcincta. Myr. Reginald H. Howe, of Brookline, Massachusetts,
received 68 skins of Macrorhamphus to assist him in determining the
relationships of two recognized forms. Messzs. Birtwell and Howe
published papers during the vear based partly on the material sent
them. ;

The type of the Chimera, //ariotta raleighana, and two other fishes
of the same species were lent to Dr. Samuel Garman, of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Prof. C. C. Nutting, of Iowa University, received the general col-
lection of hydoids of the families Sertularide, Campanularide, etc., to
be used in the second part of his monograph of the American Hydroids,
which forms a Special Builetin of the National Museum.

The general collection of parasitic copepod crustaceans was placed
in the hands of Prof. Charles B. Wilson, of the State Normal School,
Westfield, Massachusetts, to be worked up for the benefit of the
Museum.

Prof. S. J. Holmes, of the University of Michigan, received the
Museum collection of amphipod crustaceans from New England, to
be used in the preparation of a report for the United States Fish Com-
mission.

To the general collection of pedate holothurians, now in the hands
of Prof. Charles L. Edwards, of Trinity College, were added examples
of all the named species in the Museum.

Dr. Wesley R. Coe, of the Sheffield Scientific School, obtained the
loan of the nemerteans from the Pacific to assist him in preparing a
report on the collection of these animals obtained during-the recent
cruise of the A/batross in the South Pacific.

The general collection of Ostracoda was sent to Prof. R. W. Sharpe,
of Dubuque, lowa, for study.

Twelve lots of the Foraminifera, obtained during the various cruises
of the United States Fish Commission steamer A/batross, were sent to
B. W. Priest, esq., Keepham, England.

Prof. E. D. Ball, State Agricultural College, Colorado, who is pre-
paring a monograph of the Rhynchota, obtained from the Museum a
loan of 402 specimens of insects of that group.

A collection of fleas for monographic work was sent to Prof. Carl F.
Baker, of St. Louis, Missouri. Similar loans were made to Prof. E. S.
G. Titus, State Agricultural College, Fort Collins, Colorado (332 bees);
Prof. J. B. Smith, Rutgers College (192 butterflies); Prof. J. S. Hine,

Ohio State University (71 Mecoptera); Miss M. M. Enteman, Uni-
versity of Chicago (329 specimens of Hymenoptera); Prof. E. B. Wil
liamson, Vanderbilt University (199 dragon flies, genus Gomphus);
Mr. J. A. G. Rehn, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences (170 Mexican
and Central American Orthoptera); Mr. H. C. Toll, Pasadena, Cali-
fornia (400 specimens of beetles).

A number of skeletons of birds were loaned to Dr. R. W. Shufeldt
for use in connection with his work on the osteology of North Ameri-
ran birds.

A total number of 1,736 specimens of plants were lent to various
specialists during the year.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATES.

The demand for zoological material by educational institutions
increases every year, but during the year covered by this report no
large amount was distributed, for the reason that the sets made up some
years ago were practically exhausted. In the case of marine inverte-
brates, however, as already noted (see p. 73), one hundred new sets,
comprising in all about 30,000 specimens, were prepared. Three sets
of invertebrates and three of fishes were distributed, containing in all
1,092 specimens. In addition, 10 small special lots of marine inverte-
brates were also distributed, together with the duplicate ophiurans of
the Agassiz Albatross expedition of 1891, as already noted (see p. 73).

LABORATORY USE OF COLLECTIONS BY INVESTIGATORS.

As in previous years, the staff of the Biological Survey, Department
of Agriculture, made extensive use of the collections for purposes of
comparison, and especially mammals and birds.

Mr. Ernest Thompson-Seton spent some days in examining the col-
lection of American deer in connection with a work on the large game
ot North America which he has in contemplation. Dr. E. A. Mearns,
U. 8. Army, resumed for a time his work on the zoology .of the
Mexican boundary survey, and in that connection studied the speci-
mens of American cats in the collection of the Museum. A large series
of the birds of Panama was brought to the Division of Birds by Mr.
Outram Bangs, and compared with the Museum collections. The
committee of the American Ornithologists’ Union on nomenclature
spent some time in the Division of Birds, as in previous years, in
determining the status of various newly-described species and sub-
species of birds.

The ichthyologists of the U. S. Fish Commission consulted the col-
lection of fishes.

Prof. L. C. Glenn and Mr. G. C. Martin, of the Maryland Geolog-
ical Survey, consulted the collections of mollusks on many occasions
S50 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

in connection with their work on the Maryland Tertiary. Mr.
F. N. Balch, of Boston, compared Arctic shells.

Prot. W. P. Hay, of Howard University, continued studies of the
crayfish in the coilection, and Mr. T. Wayland Vaughan, U. 5. Geo-
logical Survey, continued work on the West Indian corals.

In the laboratory of the Division of Insects the following investi-
gators spent more or less time during the year: Dr. A. Fenyes, wife,
and niece (on Coleoptera); Prof. W. L. Tower, Harvard University
(on Coleoptera, particularly Chrysomelidee); Miss M. M. Entemann,
Chicago University (wasps of the genus /%/istes); Prof. J. B. Smith,
Rutgers College (various collections, especially Lepidoptera); Mr.
J. A. G. Rehn, Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences (on Orthop-
tera); Sir Gilbert Carter, of Nassau, Bahamas (on Lepidoptera).

Prof. E. L. Greene, of the Catholic University, and Mr. E. L. Morris,
of the Western High School, Washington, were frequent visitors to the
herbarium, the former making general comparisons, the latter contin-
uing his studies on the North American Plantaginacee.

Mr. Stewardson Brown and Mr. Joseph Crawford, of the Philadel-
phia Academy of Natural Sciences, made a brief visit to the herbarium
to look up some ancient types. Dr. N. L. Britton, of the New York
Botanical Garden, has made several trips to Washington to consult
the herbarium in connection with his forthcoming manual. Prof.

KE. 8. Burgess, of the New York Normal College, spent a few days here -

examining our Aster material. Dr. R. H. True, of Harvard Univer-
sity, visited the herbarium and studied specimens of the genus Décra-
num. A number of officials from the Department of Agriculture
made frequent use of the herbarium.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901.

By Grorce P. Merritt,
Head Curator.

The year just passed has been a busy one and has been characterized
by several changes which, when considered in the aggregate, are of
very great importance, placing the department as a whole in a better
condition to care for its collections than ever before.

ACCESSIONS.

The more important accessions of the year, including also some of
the material which was purchased for exhibition at the Pan-American
Exposition, were as follows:

From the United States Geological Survey, 375 specimens of Pre-
Cambrian invertebrate fossils, including material figured and described
by Dr. Charles D. Walcott in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of
America; 2,370 specimens, mainly brachiopods, from the Cambrian;
2,425 Ordovician fossils, being the first collections of considerable value
from this horizon, from southern Nevada and near El Paso, Texas; 114
Silurian and 1,550 Devonian specimens, from the Helderbergian and
Oriskanian beds of Indian Territory and the higher Devonian of Colo-
‘ado and New Mexico, a portion of which was described by Mr. G. H.
Girty in the Nineteenth Annual Report of the United States Geo-
logical Survey, and a very large number of duplicate Miocene and
Pliocene mollusca.

In addition to these should be mentioned the collections of Cambrian
fossils from Russia, Norway, Sweden, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland
made by Mr. Walcott and his assistants, Messrs. Schmalensee and 5S.
Ward Loper, and extensive Carboniferous, Silurian, and Devonian
collections made by Charles Schuchert in New Brunswick, the Gaspé
region in Quebec, and in western New York, Maryland, and eastern
Pennsylvania.

An excellent series of cephalopod mollusks, purchased from Messrs.
Krantz and Sturtz, of Bonn, Prussia.

A fine series of Oriskanian and Helderbergian fossils from near
Cumberland, Maryland, obtained by gift and exchange from Messrs.

REPORT ON THE. DEPARTMENT OF GEOLGGY. 83

A skull of Elotherium and other vertebrate fossils from the Bad
Lands of Dakota, gift of Dr. J. R. Walker, of the Pine Ridge Agency.

A fairly complete skeleton of an adult female mastodon, obtained
by purchase and excavating, from near Church, Michigan.

One hundred and fifty Carboniferous and Permian fossil plants from
Kansas, received in exchange from the University of Kansas, through
Mr. E. H. Sellards, of Lawrence, Kansas.

One hundred and seventy-three fossil plants of the Middle and
Upper Oligocene, Middle and Upper Miocene, and Upper Pliocene
of Germany, received in exchange from the Museum Senckenberg
National Scientific Society, of Frankfort, through Dr. F. Kinkelin, of
Frankfort-on-Main, Germany.

Thirty-three fossil plants from the Triassic of York County, Penn-
sylvania, received in exchange from Prof. A. Wanner, superintendent
of public instruction, of York, Pennsylvania.

One hundred and twenty-five specimens of fossil plants from Fern
Ledges, St. John, New Brunswick—the W. J. Wilson collection—gift
of Mr. RK. D. Lacoe.

Sixty-eight specimens of Devonian and sub-Carboniferous fossil
plants, part of the collection purchased from F. A. Randall, of War-
ren, Pennsylvania.

The meteorite collection has been increased by purchase and exchange
more than during any previous period of like duration within the
history of the Museum. The most important accession was a stony
meteorite which fell near Felix, Alabama, in May, 1900, and which was
obtained for the Museum mainly through the efforts of Mr. Coleman.
This stone, weighing 2,049 grams, is of more than ordinary interest
and has been made the subject of special study. In addition, there were
obtained by purchase a fine slab weighing 4,420 grams of the Sacra-
mento iron; a 38-gram fragment of the Agen stone, which fell in 1814;
a 3l-gram fragment of the Zavid stone, which fell in August, 1897,
and 490 grams of a stony meteorite from Ness County, Kansas. By
exchange there were obtained a 3,103-gram piece of the second-find
Fayette County stone; a 98-gram piece of the celebrated Carbona-
ceous Orgueil stone, which fell in 1864; 620 grams of the Bjurbole
stone of 1899; 10 grams of the Lancé stone of 1872, and 45 grams of
the Misshof stone of 1890.

SOURCES OF NEW MATERIAL.

As in years past, the U.S. Geological Survey has been the principal
contributor to the collection, though, as noted above, several valuable
specimens have been obtained by purchase and exchange.

In August, 1900, Mr. Frederic A. Lucas, in search of mastodon remains
for the Pan-American Exposition, visited several reported finds of bones
near Munroe, New York, Kimmswick, Missouri, and Culver, Indiana,
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

Mr. Stewart, on a similar errand, also visited Kimmswick and various
reported finds in adjacent States; but in none of these cases was mate-
rial sufticiently perfect for restoration secured, though some interest-
ing portions of skeletons were obtained. The latter part of May Mr.
Stewart was sent to investigate a reported find of bones near Church,
in southern Michigan, and was fortunate enough to secure a very well
preserved skeleton of a female Mastodon americanus. It is hoped we
may be able to mount this for exhibition some time during the coming
year.

~ Mr. Schuchert spent the month of July and the greater part of
August in collecting fossils from the Silurian along the Arisaig coast
in Nova Scotia, and from the Lower Devonian near Dalhousie, New
Brunswick, and the Gaspé region of eastern Quebec, Canada. In Sep-
tember he passed a few days near Cumberland, Maryland, gathering
Silurian and Devonian fossils, and after his work of installation at the
Pan-American Exposition in early May, a few days were devoted to
collecting Silurian fossils in the cement quarries at North Buffalo and
about Lewiston and New Bloomfield, in eastern Pennsylvania. During
May and June he was again occupied for nearly four weeks collecting
Silurian and Devonian fossils In eastern Pennsylvania and about Cum-
berland, Maryland. These collections, it may be said, were made with
a view to the more accurate fixation of the line separating the Silurian
from the Devonian systems in America, a problem upon which Mr.
Schuchert has been for some time engaged.

In February Mr.J.W. Coleman was sent to Selma, Alabama, where
he obtained the Felix meteorite already referred to, and others have
been obtained by exchange. Six polished spheres of pegmatite, onyx,
marble, serpentine, spheerosiderite, and satin spar have been prepared
from material in the reserve series and added to the gem series. -

ROUTINE.

In all divisions of the department there were received some 80,000
specimens which required entering in the Museum catalogues, num-
bering, and, in many instances, the preparation of cards for the card
catalogues, and perhaps labels for exhibition purposes as well. In
addition there still remains a large amount of old material needing
attention. Mrs. Jouy, who has been placed in charge of this line of
work, reports that for the Division of Geology and the sections of
paleobotany and vertebrate paleontology there have thus been made
7,351 entries in the Museum registers; that between 13,000 and
14,000 catalogue and reference cards, specimen slips, and temporary
labels have been prepared, and that 5,383 specimens have been num-
bered. These numbers are painted in oil on a hard-oil finished back-
ground and require four or five figures for each number, involving,
all told, therefore, some 25,000 figures.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY.

Mr. Schuchert reports the final installation during the year of
3,278 specimens. In all the divisions there have been prepared and
sent to the printer manuscript for 5,626 specimen labels.

The eases in the west-south range containing the volcanic, geyser
and hot spring, and rock-weathering series, have been repainted, and
the exhibit rearranged. About two-thirds of the building-stone col-
lection in the southwest court has been thoroughly overhauled and
cleansed from the dust and dirt that accumulated during the work of
the erection of the balconies. The work of labeling the non-metallic
series on the balcony of the southwest court has been practically
completed.

A large amount of work has been done in the way of cutting,
polishing, and otherwise preparing material for exhibition, particularly
in the divisions of geology. A 75-pound mass which was cut from
the prehistoric Casa Grande meteoric iron has been sawn into slices
and cubes, giving thus valuable material for etching, for exhibition,
and for exchange.

But little progress has been made in the way of increasing the exhibi-
tion series in the secticn of vertebrate fossils, owing to the employ-
ment of the preparators on work for the Pan-American Exposition, to
be noted later. A large Plesiosaur skeleton has, however, been placed
on exhibition in a special case, as has also a large and fine skull of
Triceratops, both of which were received from the Marsh collection.

Dr. Peale, when not occupied with the routine work of his division,
has been engag?d in the preliminary compilation of a ceological sec-
tion across the United States from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic
coast. The line upon which this section was made was drawn through
those parts of the country where the most geological data were avail-
able. The horizontal scale is 2 miles to the inch, as this coincides
with a large part of the topographic data available from the records of
the United States Geological Survey. The vertical scale of 4,000 feet
to the inch was adopted so that the relief might be apparent, especially
in those parts of the section where the elevation above sea level is not
very great. In order, also, to show the structure of these portions,
the section was carried to a line 5,000 feet below sea level. The work
of the Geological Survey in California and in the Appalachian region;
that of the survey of the fortieth parallel in Nevada, Utah, and W yo-
ming; of the Hayden survey of Colorado, and that of the Kansas,
Missouri, Hlinois, Kentucky, and North Carolina State surveys, where
the line crosses those States, have been utilized in making this section.
The section has been drawn in water color on rowgh manila paper.

Mr. Newhall, as in years past, has been engaged in the general work
of the details of the exhibition and study series of the division of
geology.
86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.
PAN-AVERICAN EXPOSITION.

The daily routine of the Museum has been greatly retarded by the
work of preparing for the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo. This
was begun early in the year, and, although not occupying all of our
time and attention, was continued until the opening of the exposition
in May. ‘The exhibits prepared by the various divisions of the depart-
ment consisted of:

A systematic collection of minerals, comprising 735 specimens and
occupying five slope-top cases.

Collections illustrating cave deposits, concretionary structures, hot
spring and geyser deposits, silicified woods, and the rocks and soils of
the Hawaiian Islands, occupying five wall cases.

A small case of native elements.

A systematic collection of invertebrate fossils illustrating the
developement and classification of the cephalopod mollusks, compris-
ing 450 specimens, and a synoptic collection of crinoids, comprising
some 300 specimens.

A mounted skeleton of the gigantic toothed diver, //esperornis
regalis, from the Cretaceous of Kansas. Z

A life-size restoration of the skeleton of the Cretaceous reptile,
Triceratops prorsus, from the Cretaceous of Wyoming.

A life-size restoration of the skeleton of the Zeuglodon, from the
Tertiary beds of Alabama.

The restoration of the Triceratops was accompanied by a small
model and painting of the animal as it was supposed to appear in life,
the work of Mr. Charles R. Knight. In addition to these, there were
two cases of mammoth remains from Indian Territory and Kimmswick,
Missouri, collected for the Museum by Mr. Stewart. It had been
hoped to include in the exhibit a mounted skeleton of the extinct mas-
todon, but a sufticiently perfect one was not found until too late for the
exposition.

The’installation of these exhibits at Buffalo required the presence
there of Messrs. Lucas, Schuchert, Stewart, Tassin, and the head
curator himself, for periods of from six to ten days, and naturally ths
ordinary work of the Museum was greatly interrupted thereby.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The department, as a whole, was never in better condition than it is
to-day. All of the halls are open to the public, and with-the excep-
tion of the sections of paleobotany and vertebrate paleontology the
collections are well arranged and quite completely labeled. A great
deal, naturally, remains to be done in the way of substituting new
material and rounding out the collections. The sections in arrears are
those which have been most recently established, and in which, more-
over, a great amount of preparatory work is necessary before the
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 87

specimens can be placed upon exhibition. It will be some years before
they can expect to compare favorably with those which have been
longer in existence.

RESEARCH AND PUBLICATION.

The head curator is engaged in investigations upon a series of
nepheline-melilite rocks, collected by C. H. Hitchcock in Oahu,
Hawaii, and has completed a study of the stony meteorite which fell
in Felix, Alabama, in 1900. He has published during the year, in con-
nection with Dr. H. N. Stokes, a paper on a stony meteorite which fell
at Allegan, Michigan, in 1899, and an iron meteorite from Mart, Texas.
The Guide to the Study of the Collections in the Section of Applied
Geology, which was mentioned in the last report as being in the hands
of the Government Printer, has been issued, and comprises pages 157
to 483, inclusive, of the Annual Report for 1899.

The transfer of the laboratory from the second to the third floor of

the southwest pavilion not merely gives better space for office pur-
poses on the second floor, but enables us to concentrate the work
of the geological and mineralogical divisions and make a considerable
saving in time and energy as well as expense for material and appa-
‘atus. Should Dr. Fireman continue in the department as chemist,
we may hope to see an important improvement, both in the quantity
and quality of the work done upon the collections. Mr. Tassin is at
present engaged in an analysis of a damourite from California, involving
the determination of boron, which, it is thought, may have an impor-
tant bearing upon the establishment of the formula for this mineral.
He is also continuing his work on the dehydration of the metallic
hydrates, with especial reference to the hydration of ferric and ferrous
sulphates and the dehydration of the resultant hydrates and basic salts.
The manuscript of a handbook on the Gem Collection, mentioned in
my last report as in process of preparation, has been completed and is
in the hands of the Government Printer.

Mr. Schuchert has continued his work ona Monograph of American
Fossil Starfishes, and hopes to complete Part I of the same during the
coming winter. He has also continued his studies relative to the zones
separating the Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian faunas in America,
and has published a paper on the Helderbergian fossils near Montreal,
Canada, in which he gives a corrected list of the fossils found on St.
Helens Island. This shows that two distinct faunas are there found,
one, the Helderbergian, older than the agglomerate, and another from
blocks in the agglomerate, of Middle Devonian age, the Helderbergian
fauna being not mixed with the Silurian nor Middle Devonian fossils,
as stated by previous workers.

Mr. Lucas has begun the work of preparing the text for the yolume
on Stegosaurs projected by the late Prof. O. C. Marsh. He has also
given some little time to the study of the mastodons of North America,
SS REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

and published papers on the Lachrymal Bone in Pinnipeds; on the
Characters and Relations of Gallinuloides, a Fossil Gallinaceous
Bird from the Green River Shales of Wyoming; a Description of
Skull of Lep/dosteus atrox; on a New Rhinoceros, 7rigonias osbhorni,
from the Miocene of South Dakota; on The Pelvic Girdle of Zeuglo-
don, Basilosaurus cetoides (Owen); on A New Fossil Cyprinoid, Leue/s-
eus turner’, from the Miocene of Nevada, and on A New Dinosaur,
Stegosaurus marshi, from the Lower Cretaceous of South Dakota,

ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS.

As in previous years, a very considerable amount of material has
been lent for study or sent out as exchanges or as direct gifts to
schools and colleges. Among the loans mention may be made of: the
following:

To Alexander Agassiz, Museum of Comparative Zoology of Harvard
University, 28 specimens and 4 thin sections of rocks, from the Gala-
pagos Islands.

To Charles Palache, Harvard University, 28 thin sections of Alas-
kan rocks.

To H. A. Robinson, Peabody Museum of Yale University, 7 speci-
mens of volcanic rock.

To the United States Geological Survey, specimens of minerals for
use in chemical and physical investigations.

To Dr. J. M. Clarke, of the States Museum, Albany, New York, 559
specimens of Oriskany fossils, collected by Mr. Schuchert in the Gaspé
region.

To Prof. James Perrin Smith, Leland Stanford Junior University,
California, 19 Texas ammonoids from the Carboniferous formation and
(7 Triassic ammonoids.

To Dr. O. P. Hay and J. W. Gidley, of the American Museum of
Natural History, New York City, material for use in the preparation
of papers on the chelonia and the horse.

In the way of exchanges material has been sent out as follows:

To Rev. Mark C. Hayford, Cape Coast, West Africa, 22 specimens
of rocks and ores.

To Dr. K. Ordonez, City of Mexico, 6 specimens of eruptive rocks.

To H. S. Washington, Locust, New Jersey, 2 specimens of eruptive
rocks.

series of Titanotherium bones and 43 specimens of invertebrates.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 89

Gifts of specimens have been made to schools and colleges, ete., as
follows:

To the Louisiana Industrial Institute, of Ruston, Louisiana, 32
specimens of rocks, minerals, ores, and fossils.

To the city school, Monroe, Louisiana, 31 specimens of rocks, min-
erals, ores, and fossils.

To A.V.S. Cochrane, Hudson, New York, 22 specimens of ores and
minerals.

To the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, 28 specimens of rocks
and 14 thin sections.

To the Wesleyan Female Seminary at Macon, Georgia, 45 specimens
of rocks.

To the Division of Soils, Department of Agriculture, a collection of
302 specimens of minerals.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.

A generalized geological section across the entire width of the
American continent has been attempted, and a preliminary sketch on
a horizontal scale of 2 miles to an inch has been prepared, as
already noted. This will give, when finished, a section some 125 feet
in length, to accompany the historical series now installed in a tempo-
rary case on the south wall of the west-south range. It is hoped that
another year will enable us to put this section into permanent form,
as well as to replace the temporary case with a new one better
adapted to the purpose.

As practically all the available exhibition space for the department
is now oceupied, further development must be mainly along the lines
already laid down. It has long been felt that the section of practical
geology could be strengthened by building up certain special exhibits
showing the occurrence and association of the ores of some few of the
more interesting mining regions. At present this has been attempted
only for the zine and lead regions of southwest Missouri. The work
is as yet incomplete.

The growth of the meteorite collection has been such that an entire
rearrangement is anticipated, Very many of the smaller specimens
will be relegated to the drawer series, and in the space thus gained an
attempt will be made to give the others a more attractive setting and
more comprehensive labels.

In the section of vertebrate paleontology it is desired to mount
for exhibition some of the abundant Dinosaur material, particularly
the limbs and pelvis of the Triceratops and the entire hind limb of
Morosaurus grand’s, as well as the remarkably fine series of Titanothe-
rium skulls. This, with the work of repairing and properly install-
ing material now in the cases, will alone occupy the attention of our
present force of preparators for the entire year.
GO REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

In the section of invertebrate paleontology Mr. Schuchert reports
the I. H. Harris collection of Cincinnati fossils as next to receive
attention, the available space for exhibition being so nearly occupied
that little more can be done in this direction.

In the section of paleobotany Dr. Peale will begin at once with an
entire readjustment of the exhibition series and the work of preparing
manuscript of the labels for the same.

From the manner in which the Museum collections have been built
up, it follows almost as a matter of course that they are unusually
rich in type material or material which has been the subject of special
study. It is my hope to be able to present with this report a catalogue
of such types, in order that their whereabouts may be more widely
known and incidentally to enhance their value. In this connection
it may be well to call attention to the large collections of unstudied
material which have accumulated, particularly in the section of inver-
tebrate paleontology. I would refer more especially to the fossil
insects, bryozoa, hydroids, sponges, etc. It is hoped that before
many years some arrangement can be made whereby these collections
may be worked up by competent specialists.

PERSONNEL.

Several changes in the personnel of the Department have occurred
during the year, and the additional assistance afforded has been of
great benefit. Miss Lucy M. Graves was appointed as stenographer
to succeed Miss Carrie V. Hurlbut, resigned; Mrs. M.S. F. Jouy was
promoted to the position of clerk in charge of the records, and Dr.
Peter Fireman was given a temporary appointment as chemical geol-
ogist. The employment of Mr. C. N. Cruikshank for the purpose of
numbering specimens and attending to other miscellaneous work, and
of Messrs. J. W. Coleman and Alban Stewart as skilled laborer and
preparator, respectively, should also be mentioned.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.

Noone but a specialist can fully realize how trying it is to be obliged
to lay aside systematic work on the collections or the consideration of
the many interesting problems which constantly present themselves,
for the work of preparing for the numerous expositions which have
been held during the past dozen or twenty years. It has been estimated
that an amount of time equal to three months, or one-fourth of the
entire year, was given by the head of each division or section to the
work of preparing and installing the exhibit now at Buffalo. While
recognizing that such work is to be regarded as an essential part of a
curator’s duties, nevertheless the amount of it that has devolved upon
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 9]

the department during the past few years is suflicient to test the
patience and endurance of the best.

Considerations such as those lead me to once more express My erati-
fication at the willingness always manifested on the part of the depart-
mental staff and the thoroughness with which any work is done which it
‘= believed will advance the interests of the Museum as a whole, regard-
less of personal considerations.

Through the death of Mr. R. D. Lacoe, which took place on Feb-
ruary 5, 1901, the department has met with asevere loss. It is doubtful
if any museum ever had a more disinterested friend than he—one who
considered himself last of all, and only asked that his collections might
be put where they would be of the greatest possible good in advancing
the cause of science. }

207-367.

Records the species of the Aculeata taken
on these islands by Mr. Herbert H. Smith,
gives additions to the Parasitica, and finishes
with a complete list of the Hymenoptera of
the West Indies. One hundred and three
new species are described and 1,291 West
Indian species are listed.

Classification of the Ichneumon
flies, or the superfamily Ichneumono-
idea.

Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxi11, No. 1206,

Oct. 13, 1900, pp. 1-220.

This vast superfamily is divided by the
author into 6 families (Evaniide, Agrioty-
pide, Ichneumonide, Alysiide, Braconide,

and Stephanide), 28 subfamilies, 64 tribes, -

and 1,146 genera, tables for all of which are
given. In his introduction he says that a
difference of opinion always has existed and,
in the nature of the case, always will exist,
as to what constitute sufficient characters for
the erection of genera and higher groups; in
consequence, he has recognized many genera
which are ignored by some authors. A high
tribute is paid to Dr. Arnold Forster’s work
on these insects, upon which, he states, his
own work is almost entirely based, he haying
restored most of Forster’s genera and recog-
nized his so-called families as either subfami-
lies or tribes. A table of the author’s super-
families in the Hymenoptera is reproduced
at the beginning of the work, and at the end
are tables for the separation of the 94 families
into which the order is divided. Eighty
genera are new. Lists, with references, are
given for the genera which are unknown to
the author, and for those which have been
incorrectly placed in the Ichneumonoidea.
A bibliography of genera, alphabetically ar-
ranged, is also included.

species are from the Chatham Islands, col-
lected by the director of the Bremen museum,
Dr. Hugo H. Schauinsland, and the assistant
entomologist, Prof. T. D. Alfken. Two new
genera of Braconide are described, Schau-

This is a continuation of the monographic
review of the Tertiary fossils (especially those
of the Oligocene and later beds) of the south-
eastern United States. The types of this work
are nearly all in the National Museum collec-
tion. The work includes, in most instances,
a thorough revision of the nomenclature of
each group, an enumeration of the known
Tertiary species in American beds, a descrip-
tion with figures of the new or unfigured
forms and comparisons with the Pacific coast
and other fossil faunas and with the now
existing fauna of the adjacent seas. The
Oligocene of the West Indian region being
practically the same as part of the Floridian
beds, is also included in the general revision.
The following groups are covered by the
present issue: Solenacea, Tellinacea, Isocar-
diacea, Cardiacea, Leptonacea, and the fam-

A brief review of the descriptive work
on lepidopterous larye from the middle of
the eighteenth to the beginning of the twen-
tieth century. The work done during the
last one hundred years is especially dealt
with, in order to show what has been accom-
plished in that time as evidenced in the very
greatly increased percentage of larval forms
known in Europe and North America, and in
the completeness and accuracy of their de-
scriptions. The various larval characters are
discussed with a view to determining their
value in classification. The paper concludes
with a list of the points which are usually
covered in the description of larve at the
present time and without which a larva
should not be considered as fully described.

The conclusion is reached from the evi-

River formerly flowed into the Coosa River
and into the Gulf of Mexico through the Ala-
bama system. Many of the species which are
abundant in the Tennessee system and that
do not occur in the Lower Mississippi are found
slightly changed in the Alabama and its
tributaries. A large number of species of the
genus Pleurobema of the Tennessee drainage
are closely related to those of the Alabama
drainage. There is also evidence, from the
present distribution. of the Unionide, point-

series of papers to be devoted to a compre-
hensive statement of the progress of the
development of the Mesozoic floras of the
United States.

The paper gives an historieal aceount of
the work thus far done on the Triassic and
Jurassic floras of the United States, and also
includes many new deseriptions, nearly 200
species or separate forms being described,
Prof. Atreus Wanner describes a new Triassic
flora from material collected by himself in
York County, Pa., which is also figured by
himself. Professor Fontaine redeseribes the
Emmons collection made 50 years ago in the
Trias of North Carolina. The whereabouts
of this collection was unknown for many
years. He also describes and illustrates the
Jurassic flora of Oroville, Cal. Professor Ward
deseribes and illustrates 20 species of Cyca-
della from 83 Jurassic eyeadean trunks from
Carbon County, Wyo., and Professor Knowl-
ton deseribes fossil wood from the Trias of
North Carolina and the Jurassic of the Black
Hills of Wyoming, and the Freezeout Hills
of Carbon County, in the same State. A new
genus of Jurassic conifers from South Dakota
is described as Pinoxylon. Professor Ward
gives a brief notice of the Triassic flora of
Virginia and points out its agreement with
the Triassic flora of Lunz in Austria, referred
by Stur to the Keuper.

This paper is based partly on Museum ma-
terial. The Pottsville formaticn is said to con-
stitute, lithologically and paleontologically,
a division of the Carboniferous coordinate
with the Lower Coal Measures, ‘‘Allegheny
Series,” ete., or the lowest member of what
in a broad sense the author terms the Meso-
earboniferous in the Appalachian province.
Its flora, so far, is said to be largely identical
in both its generic and specific composition
with that from the supposed Middle Devonian
beds at St. John, New Brunswick.

NEW YORK, 1901

SUMMARY.

By Freperick W. TRUE,

Representative, Smithsonian Institution and National Museum.

The Pan-American Exposition held at Buffalo, New York, opened
May 1,1901, and closed November 2, 1901. Anexhibit from the Smith-
sonian Institution and National Museum was provided for in the act of
Congress approved March 3, 1899. The total amount appropriated
for the Government exhibit was $300,000, and for a Government build-
ing, $200,000. Of the former amount the Smithsonian Institution
and National Museum were allotted $50,000, in addition to which
$2,500 was transferred from the allotment of the Interior Department
to allow for the construction of a model of the extinct American reptile
Triceratops, to be jointly exhibited by the National Museum and the
Geological Survey. The total amount allotted was considerably below
the estimate submitted to the board, which was $62,625.

On the gross sum originally available a pro rata assessment to pro-
vide for an exhibit from the outlying possessions of the United States,
amounting to $1,960.79, was made by the board, and $200 were trans-
ferred to the allotment of the War Department. The net Smithsonian
allotment was, therefore, $50,339.21.

The Goverment building (Plate 1) at Buffalo was on the west side of
the exposition grounds. It was oblong in shape and had a length of
418 feet and a breadth of 140 feet and was surmounted by a dome 235
feet high. Two pavilions were connected with the main building on
the east side by colonnades. The north pavilion was occupied by the
Fish Commission and the south pavilion conjointly by the Department
of Agriculture and the Philippine collection. The exterior of the
building was finished in staff and tinted yellow, except the dome, which

181
182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

was blue. The elaborate polychrome decoration of the other exposi-
tion buildings was not attempted.

The space in the Government building allotted to the Smithsonian
institution and National Museum was in the northwestern corner.
(Plate 2.) It originally amounted to 10,108 square feet, but the size
of the Governnent building being subsequently reduced the space was
contracted. From the extreme north and south ends and from the
west wall to the main aisle it measured 133 feet by 56 feet, comprising
anarea of about 7,500 square feet. A small area at the north end was
separated from the main space by a cross aisle 8 feet wide, leading to
one of the west entrances, and a similar aisle crossed the space near
the south end, though this was not originally proposed, but was found
necessary to allow convenient admission from the annexes. The sub-
division of the space and the arrangement of cases are shown in the
accompanying diagram. (Plate 3.)

The space was on the whole well lighted by a series of large win-
dows in the west wall, supplemented by the clearstory windows above
the main aisle. The west windows were stippled with white paint to
obstruct the direct rays of the sun, and a series of transparencies were
placed in front of them as embellishments.

As usual in most exposition buildings, the posts supporting the
clearstory and aisles caused more or less inconvenience in locating the
cases. In one instance it proved unavoidable to cut a standard case in
pieces and rebuild it about a post in order to maintain an important
aisle. In other instances posts stood immediately in front of the cases,
producing a most undesirable effect. These architectural inconyen-
iences can only be got rid of by supporting the roof by a series of
arches springing from the walls.

The interior decoration of the building, as a whole, was placed in
the hands of a committee of the Government board and was uniform
throughout, consisting of red and green bunting supplemented by
United States flags. To these, in the Museum space, were added large
signs bearing the name of the Institution and Museum and a trophy,
or coat of arms, with the seal and motto of the Smithsonian Institution.

The building had no basements, and empty packing cases were stored
in lofts in the various towers and in the parapets constructed by the
War Department to illustrate the mounting of large ordnance.

A good deal of inconvenience was experienced at the beginning by
the defects in the roof of the building, on account of which certain
parts of the space were flooded during heavy rains. By constant
watchfulness, however, serious damage was avoided. The weather
conditions immediately prior to the opening of the Exposition were
extremely unfavorable. The workmen suffered much from cold, and
the receipt and unloading of exhibits were greatly hampered. Never-
theless, by hard work the Museum display was opened to the public
EXHIBIT AT PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 185

and practically complete on the Ist of May, when many other parts of
the Exposition were in a backward condition.

As in the case of previous expositions, the exhibit of the National
Museum far exceeded that of the other bureaus under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution and of the Institution itself, and the greater
part of the total sum allotted was expended in its preparation. The
reason of this will be readily understood when it is recalled that the
Museum is continuously engaged in preparing permanent exhibits for
the public, and has greater responsibilities in this direction than any
other bureau of the Government. The proportion of the allotment
expended by the Museum can not be exactly stated, because the same
mechanics and preparators who were employed in connection with its
exhibits were also engaged for some time on the work of the other
bureaus of the Institution. No apportionment among the several
bureaus of the sum set aside by the Government board was necessary
or desirable, and none was made.

The Bureau of American Ethnology made no separate exhibit on
this occasion, those features of its work which lend themselves to
exhibition being shown through the agency of the Department of
Anthropology in the Museum.

As in previous instances, the permanent collections, cases, and fix-
tures of the Museum were drawn upon as far as circumstances would
permit, but some new cases were found indispensable, and numerous
specimens were purchased to fill out the various series which it was
finally determined to exhibit at Buffalo.

The temporary cases constructed for the Exposition were of pine,
painted black, and furnished with plate glass. ‘These comprised group
vases for the Department of Anthropology and wall cases and one or
two special cases for the Departments of Biology and Geology. The
regular mahogany Museum cases used were of the styles known as
** reconstructed door screens” and ** slope tops.”

As may be surmised, the regular staff of the Museum can not be
drawn upon beyond a certain limit to prepare collections for a tem-
porary exposition. The regular work of the Museum goes on hand
in hand with the special exposition work, and the principal officers of
the Museum devote a share of their time to each, but it is necessary
to augment the staff of preparators, taxidermists, etc., very consider-
ably or the exposition collections could never be got ready on time.
This necessity causes one of the principal difficulties in preparing for
an exposition, as expert preparators are few, and those whose services
are desirable are not always to be had at a specified time. ‘The Museum

yas especially fortunate in this matter in connection with the Pan-
American Exposition, and it is not too much to say that the work
turned out both by the regular and temporary preparators was supe-
rior as a whole to any previous effort. The temporary preparators
184 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

consisted of sculptors, model makers, taxidermists, colorists, paleon-
tological preparators, modelers, and preparators of **
such as artificial leaves, flowers, ete.

On June 23, 1899, Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the National
Museum, was designated chief special agent, Smithsonian Institution
and National Museum, for the Pan-American Exposition. Mr. Cox
was also elected secretary of the Government board June 13, 189%,
and with the consent of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
served in this capacity throughout the Exposition.

The work of preparing the exhibits was begun in July, 1899, at
which time a building on Tenth street S.W., Washington, was leased
for temporary workshops. Another workshop and Sore hone. No.
414 Tenth street N. W., was occupied from August, 1900, to April, 1901,
by the Museum conjointly with several of the Executive Departments.

One of the first operations engaged in was the overhauling of the
collections stored in the Museum annexes for material suitable for the
Exposition. This involved considerable time and expense on account
of the crowded condition of the storage quarters.

A considerable amount of field work was done in connection with the
exhibits. Drs. Stejneger and Richmond visited Porto Rico, and Messrs.
William Palmer and J. H. Riley explored western Cuba in February,
1900, and succeeding months in search of characteristic birds, reptiles,
and batrachians. By the courtesy of the War Department the col-
lectors were sent to their respective destinations on the transports
McPherson and Sedgwick, and the collections made in Cuba were also
transported to the United States through the Quartermaster’s Depart-
ment of the Army. Drs. Stejneger and Richmond returned April 29,
1900, and Messrs. Palmer and Riley August 14, 1900. Mr. Wirt
Tassin visited Philadelphia in July, 1899, to examine collections of
minerals, and a number of purchases were made. Mr. F. A. Lucas vis-
ited the vicinity of Plattekill, New York, in August, 1899, for the
purpose of examining a mastodon skeleton of which some information
had been received. The specimen did not, however, prove suitable
for the exhibit. Another endeavor was made in the autumn of 1899
to obtain a mastodon skeleton by excavating near Monroe, New York,
but this also proved unsuccessful. The same was the case with inves-
tigations in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Indian Territory in October,
1900. Mr. Lucas went to Kiminswick, Missouri, in August, 1900, on
the same mission, but without result. Dr. G. P. Merrill superintended
the sawing of some fine specimens of orbicular granite in Baltimore in
October, 1899. Dr. Merrill also visited several localities in North
Carolina in November, 1899, and New Haven, Connecticut, Chester,
Massae sates in March, 1901, and New York City in January, 1900,
for the purpose of obtaining geological specimens. Mr. W. H. New
hall visited Point of Rocks, Maryland, for the purpose of obtaining

accessor 1s,
EXHIBIT AT PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 185

specimens of the conglomerate rock of that locality. Mr. Adolph
Tuchband, who made an expedition to the Upper Amazon River in the
spring of 1900, undertook to obtain ethnological objects, models, cos-
tumes, utensils, ete., of the Indian tribes of that region. The Museum,
however, received nothing from this source.

Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, Bureau of American Eth-
nology, was granted a small sum to collect objects illustrating the
ethnology of the Tepoka Indians of Mexico. On visiting their country,
however, he found the tribe practically exterminated, and he turned
his attention to the Cocopa Indians, from whom he obtained a valuable
collection.

Additions to the various series which it was decided to exhibit were
also made by purchase from professional collectors and dealers both
in the United States and Europe.

Prof. J. B. Steere spent two months on the Amazon River in obtain-
ing characteristic fishes and other vertebrates of that part of South
America and objects illustrating the ethnology of the various Indian
tribes. Messrs. Barton A. Bean and W. H. King were detailed to go
to Key West, Florida, to collect fishes in formalin, for a special exhibit,
to which further reference will be found on page LS6.

THE EXHIBIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY.

By Freperick W. True,
Head Curator.

In planning an exhibit from the Department of Biology many points
have to be taken into consideration, such as the letter and spirit of
the law providing for a Government exhibit; the purpose of the expo
sition as a whole; the conditions existing as regards obtaining: speci-
mens suitable for exhibition; the relative significance and attractive-
ness of different exhibits to the general public.

In the case of the Pan-American Exposition the underlying idea
was so clearly defined that no difficulty was experienced in determin-
ing the proper scope of the exhibit. The Exposition, as its name
implies, was intended to represent America as a whole. It was fitting,
therefore, that the animals and plants of North, South, and Central
America should be represented, while a representation of the fauna
and flora of the rest of the world could with propriety be omitted.

The exhibit of the Department was thus limited and only American
objects were represented. From experience gained by participation
in other expositions it was felt that, generally speaking, large objects
would be more suitable and better appreciated than small ones, and it
was decided, therefore, to confine the zoological exhibit to the verte-
brates. There is no question that a representation of the invertebrate
186 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1901.

fauna of America would have proved interesting to the public, espe-
cially such classes of animals as the insects, corals, mollusks, ete., but
in proportion to the outlay of time involved in the preparation of a
thoroughly attractive exhibit the vertebrates appeared to offer the
best topic. A display of the flora of America was necessarily omitted
because the Museum is without resources in this direction, its botanical
collection consisting entirely of dried plants and specimens in alcohol,
which are unsuitable for a popular exhibit. To obtain a creditable
botanical exhibit by field work was impossible in the time allotted.

In order to make the exhibit of the vertebrate animals of America
as significant and attractive as possible the best specimens in every
class were withdrawn from the exhibition series of the Museum, and
these were supplemented by specimens purchased wherever obtainable.
In addition four field parties were sent out to gather material not
otherwise available. Dr. L. Stejneger, curator of the Divison of
Reptiles, and Dr. C. W. Richmond, assistant curator of the Division
of Birds, were sent to Porto Rico and the other West Indian Islands;
Mr. William Palmer, chief taxidermist, and Mr. J. H. Riley, aid in
the Section of Birds’ Eggs, were sent to Cuba; Mr. B. A. Bean,
assistant curator, Division of Fishes, and Mr. King, to Key West,
Florida, while Prof. J. B. Steere undertook to obtain fishes and other
vertebrates from the Amazon River.

Drs. Stejneger and Richmond did excellent work in Porto Rico,
obtaining a large collection of birds and reptiles, but were prevented
by sickness and the uncertainties of transportation from visiting other
West Indian Islands, as was originally intended. The operations of
Messrs. Palmer and Riley were confined to western Cuba, where large
collections of birds, reptiles, and mammals were made, but the col-
lectors were prevented by lack of time from visiting the eastern end
of the island.

In order to accomplish anything of importance it was necessary to
send these parties out early, while the general plans of the Govern-
ment board as regards buildings, allotment of space, and exhibits
from the outlying possessions of the United States were still incom-
plete. The original plans were considerably modified before being
adopted, the total amount of space in the Government building was
reduced, and endeavors to form general exhibits from Cuba and Porto
Rico under the Government board were abandoned on account of the
action of the governors of these islands in providing separate displays.
It resulted that only a portion of the material collected could be exhib-
ited, and this was incorporated with the general Museum exhibits.

The work of Professor Steere on the Amazon resulted in our obtain-
ing an excellent series of characteristic fresh-water fishes of this region,
together with characteristic tortoises and other reptiles.

In addition to the material obtained by these collecting parties the
EXHIBIT AT PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 187

Museum secured many fine, characteristic North American mammals,
birds, and reptiles through its correspondents and through various
dealers in natural-history material.

When completed the exhibit contained a very full outline series of
the vertebrate animals of North America and a smaller but still sig-
nificant series from South and Central America. (Plate 4.) Among
the mammals were such striking forms as the Kadiak bear, glacier
bear, Alaska moose, Dall’s white sheep, Stone’s sheep, musk ox; such
birds as the condor, California vulture, rhea or American ostrich, wild
turkey, harpy eagle, various gay-colored toucans, the ara, Carolina
paroquet, whooping crane, steamer duck, penguin (Plate 12), ete.,
together with rattlesnakes, boas, Gila monster, alligator snapper,
matamata, mud eel, Cuban toad, and other characteristic American
reptiles and batrachians, and a large series of useful, curious, and bril-
liantly colored American fishes. A more detailed account of the prin-
cipal features of the exhibit will be found on a later page.

TAXIDERMY.

In connection with the Buffalo exhibit a system of accessories was
.adopted which, so far as I am aware, has not been attempted hitherto
ona large scale. It was impracticable on account of limited space to
exhibit groups showing the habits and natural surroundings of vari-
ous species, while to display the specimens on plain wooden stands was
thought to deprive them to a certain extent of attractiveness. A com-
promise was therefore effected by using small stands and suggesting
the environment by the introduction of a few plants, a rock or two, a
little snow, a branch of a tree, ete. Thus, the Kadiak bear was placed
on a stand having on it a small section of rock, a little sloping area of
sand, and a dead salmon. The fish-eatine habit of this Alaskan bear
was thus suggested in a very small space. The indigo snake was
mounted on a base covered with sand, with a pine cone or two anda
bit of palmetto to indicate that it is a denizen of the pine barrens.
The condor was represented as perched on a pointed rock, suggesting
its mountain habitat. This treatment was not adopted for fishes, as
any endeavor to represent their environment would have caused a
greater expenditure of time and money than the circumstances per-
mitted. They were represented for the most part by painted plaster
casts drawn from the Museum exhibition series. These were supple-
mented by the Key West collection, and by Professor Steere’s collec-
tion from the Amazon River, preserved in formalin. The manner in
‘which these two series of fishes were prepared presented some novel
features and is deserving of a short explanation.

The collectors were provided with a number of shallow galvanized-
iron pans. having a uniform length of 2 feet, a quantity of formalin,
injecting syringes, etc. The fish were injected as soon as obtained

and placed in pans, with the fins carefully spread out in natural posi-
tions. A dilute solution of formalin was then poured into the pans
and allowed to remain until the specimens hardened properly. They
were then taken out and wrapped in cloth and packed with great care.
In the meantime a series of 80 square glass jars, each 2 feet long and

1 foot high, were purchased in Germany, and an equal number of plas-
ter of paris plaques provided, 1 inch thick and exactly long and high
enough to fit the jars. As soon as the fish and jars reached Buffalo
the fish were attached to the plaques and placed in the jars and dilute
formalin poured in. With one or two exceptions the specimens
remained in excellent condition throughout the exposition. (See Plate
21.) The form of the body and fins was exactly preserved, and the
color remained sufficiently to give a very good idea of the appearance
of the fish when alive, though the brighter tints of many of the species
were in most cases subdued or lost. No method of preserving the
life colors perfectly is yet known. Toa large extent they appear to
be physiological phenomena. ‘The experiment, as a whole, may be
considered very successful. At the end of six months’ exposure at
Buffalo the collection was apparently in as good condition as at the
beginning, and was transferred to the Charleston Exposition without.
any further preparation.

CASES AND INSTALLATION.

On account of the large size of some of the mammals, the exhibit of
the Department of Biology occupied the center of the space allotted
to the Museum. Two wall cases 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 4 feet
deep were constructed for the mammals at right angles with the main
aisle (Plate 5), and flanking them along the west wall was a similar but
shallower case for the fishes.

The birds occupied eight standard Museum screen cases, 8 feet 6
inches long, in front of the mammal cases, and in front of these were
four standard Museum slope-top cases, 8 feet 6 inches long, for the
reptiles and batrachians. A special case was occupied by the hum-
ming birds.

On account of the small space available, no attempt was made to
assemble the different species in faunal groups, an arrangement
which under proper conditions would have been very desirable. In
temporary expositions the refinements of classification adopted in
museums can seldom be carried out. The Government building at
such expositions is generally constructed on broad architectural lines’
to accommodate the diverse exhibits of the several executive depart-
ments and bureaus. The lighting and interior arrangements of the
portion allotted in such buildings to the National Museum rarely

permit the carrying out of any preconcerted plan rigorously. The
collections are fitted to the space rather than the space to the col-
lections. This limitation was experienced in Buffalo no less than at
previous expositions. The condition, as already stated, was met by
the abandonment of faunal lines and the mingling together of animals
from the northern and southern parts of the American continents. The
loss of faunal boundaries was probably not felt except by naturalists.
The eye rested everywhere on American species and only American,
and the labels indicated what particular region each animal inhabited.

All the larger mammals and all the birds, reptiles, batrachians, and
fishes were furnished with descriptive labels, containing in untechnical
language the most interesting facts in the natural history of the vari-
ous species. The preparation of these labels involved no little labor,
and amounted in effect to writing a popular treatise on the natural his-
tory of the more characteristic American vertebrates. The labels for
the reptiles and batrachians were prepared by Dr. L. Stejneger, those
for the birds by Dr. C. W. Richmond, for the mammals by Mr. G. S.
Miller, jr., and for the fishes by Mr. B. A. Bean. Specimens of these
labels are subjoined.
