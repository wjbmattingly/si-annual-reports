EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD-WORK OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN 1924

INTRODUCTION

Scientific exploration and field-work has from the beginning
formed an important phase of the Institution’s work in the “ increase
of knowledge.” This pamphlet serves as a preliminary announce-
ment of the work along these lines accomplished during the past
calendar year, 1924. The accounts are written and the photographs
taken for the most part by the field workers themselves, and the
scientific results of many of the expeditions will later be presented
fully in the various series of publications of the Institution and its
branches. With the very limited funds at its command, the Institu-
tion is unable to finance many major expeditions, but it endeavors to
cooperate in this work, whenever possible, with other institutions, by
furnishing men, materials, etc. The many expeditions initiated or
cooperated in by the Institution during the 79 years of its existence
have resulted in many important additions to knowledge as well as
in valuable and instructive material for exhibition to the public in the
U.S. National Museum.*

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

Secretary Charles D. Walcott continued geological field-work in
the Canadian Rockies of western Alberta for the purpose of com-
pleting his reconnaissance study of the pre-Devonian formations north
of the Bow Valley.

The field season was most unfavorable owing to cold and stormy
weather (see figs. 2, 3) that made it difficult and often impossible
to work on forty-two days of the season. Eighteen camps were made
while on the trail (see figs. 3, 10), and collections of fossils from
typical localities were obtained. Incidentally, the party succeeded in
getting a fine pair of mountain sheep and a black-tailed deer for the
National Museum. At a beautiful but stormy camp just below Baker
Lake the Lyell larches were scattered in clumps on the slopes a little
below tree line (fig. 4), and wild flowers occurred in profusion about
the small lakes south of the camp (figs. 18, 19). Mrs. Walcott made
water-color sketches of sixteen flowers new to her collection.

The main objective was to find fossils in the great Lyell lime-
stone * in order to determine its position in the scheme of classifica-
tion. Many attempts have been made during the past six years, but
without success, as the thick-bedded, coarse magnesian limestones
were uniformly unfossiliferous except for the presence of a few

casts of worm trails and the cylindrical structures supposedly built
up by the secretions of algal growth, both of which may occur in
sedimentary formations from the pre-Cambrian to the present day.
In measuring a section from Fossil Mountain (fig. 1) eastward
into Oyster Mountain, the Lyell limestones were found to form the
main north and south ridge, and in two large, glacial cirques cutting

deep into the ridge, the base of the Lyell was uncovered (fig. 1),
as well as the oolitic limestones and shales of the Bosworth forma-
tion* that are so finely exposed in Mt. Bosworth on the Conti-
nental Divide above Kicking Horse Pass near Wapta Lake. The
most northern cirque was named Cotton Grass from the presence of
large areas of the beautiful cotton grass tufted seed heads (figs.
5, 6). The southern cirque (fig. 7) almost cuts through Tilted
Mountain and bears its name. Mountain sheep have a trail up the

cirque and over into Douglas Lake Canyon valley and onto the north-
ern ice and snow fields of Bonnet Peak. In figure 7 the Lyell lime-
stones, with the more readily eroded Bosworth beds below, were
pushed eastward and the latter are tilted up against the horizontally-
bedded massive Devonian limestones, forming the broadly and
smoothly rounded mountain at the head of the cirque. We followed
the brook running out of the little glacial lake in the bottom of the
cirque in its course westward over the ledges of Lyell limestones to
the falls, where it slides and falls into the canyon valley of upper
Baker Creek (fig. 8) but everywhere the same hard, thick-bedded,

light gray limestone extended in all directions until near the edge of
the sloping cliffs above the canyon valley, where long narrow strips
of trees and grass covered spaces occurred between the north and
south ledges. Another approach was made from the south side of
the brook, and an outcrop of a few thin layers of bluish-gray lime-
stone was encountered on a small, rounded, glaciated ridge of the

in the Lyell, and contained fragments of Upper Cambrian trilobites.
Returning another day, the thin band of bluish-gray limestone was
traced to the brook and in a small narrow canyon two bands of shate
and bluish-gray limestone were found a little lower in the section.
The lowest band was rich in fragments of trilobites that later were
found to be closely related to Upper Cambrian Franconia trilobites

from Wisconsin, and the fauna of the upper band was found to be
of the same type as the fauna of the St. Lawrence member of the
Trempealeau formation of Wisconsin. With these two faunules
definitely located in the upper portion of the Lyell limestones, we now
know that the latter are of Upper Cambrian age, and thus is brought
to a successful conclusion a search conducted for four field seasons

to determine the position of Lyell limestones in the Upper Cam-

With the Lyell question out of the way, further collections were
made from the Ozarkian upper Mons limestones of Fossil Mountain
before going to Wild Flower Canyon. The latter is referred to in
the account of exploration in 1921.’ It heads on Johnston Creek Pass
and extends in a northwesterly direction to where it joins Baker
Creek Canyon. The gray limestones of the Mons formations form
the high ridge on its northeast side and in these were collected many

specimens of the upper Mons faunules, Early in September, the party
crossed to the head of the Red Deer River and followed it down to
where it breaks through the eastward-facing cliffs of Devonian lime-
stone which have been thrust eastward over onto the sandstones,
shales and limestones of the Cretaceous formations of the “ foot-
hills.” It was expected to secure some fine photographs of interesting
structural geology but the continuous cloudy and rainy weather pre-
vented. On the ridge between the Red Deer and Panther Rivers at
Snow Creek (fig. 9) a very fine pair of sheep was obtained and

unusually fine trout were caught below Eagle Pass north of the Red
Deer River, also in Baker Creek earlier in the season. As hunting and
fishing are only incidental to the geological work and Mrs. Walcott’s
wild flower studies, it is only on rainy days or after the day’s work is
over that the men indulge in sport. At a “lick” beside the Red Deer
River, many mountain sheep were seen (fig. 11) and on the trail,
moose, deer, goats, and smaller mammals were met with, especially
about Baker Lake and in the Red Deer Canyon.

Some progress has been made the past eight field seasons towards
a better understanding of the pre-Devonian geological formations and

opportunity for the young, vigorous geologist and paleontologist to
add to knowledge of them for many years to come, especially between

former generic name H'ungata, as a species referred to Hungaia was published
ina list of Upper Cambrian fossils in I9I14 as Hungata magnificus Billings.”
The genus Kainella is now proposed with the species billingst Walcott as the
genotype. Other species occur that will be described in a subsequent paper. The
name Kainella is derived from Mount Kain (09,3092 feet, 2,862.7 m.), which was
named after Conrad Kain, a noted Swiss guide and Alpine climber. It is located
southeast of Billings Butte and Robson Peak, British Columbia, Canada.

As in previous years, assistance was freely given by Commissioner
J. B. Harkin and the members of the Canadian National Parks Serv-
ice, and the officials and employees of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The expedition was greatly aided by grants from the O. C. Marsh
and Joseph Henry endowment funds’ of the National Academy of
Sciences.

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN TENNESSEE

In the field season of 1924, R. S. Bassler, curator of paleontology,
U. S. National Museum, continued geologic work in Tennessee
commenced several years ago in cooperation with the Geological
Survey of Tennessee under the direction of State Geologist Wilbur A.
Nelson. In previous seasons the geology and paleontology of the
Central Basin were studied, followed in 1923 by an investigation
of the eastern portion of the surrounding Highland Rim. In 1924
the Highland Rim work was carried northward to the Kentucky-
Tennessee boundary where an area of about 125 square miles com-
prised in the Lillydale quadrangle of the Cumberland River district
was mapped in detail. The primary object of this mapping was an
economic one for the geologic structure of the region gives it oil
possibilities. This area is far from railroad facilities and transporta-
tion is by the Cumberland River, when high enough, automobile some-
times, but most often by horseback. The method of transporting
gasoline is shown in figure 22.

The Highland Rim of Tennessee is the plateau area averaging a
thousand feet elevation surrounding the Central Basin. It is usually
so flat that the underlying rocks are seldom exposed but in the Lilly-
dale quadrangle the Cumberland River and its tributaries have cut
so deeply into the Rim that the topography is very rough and the
strata are exposed at frequent intervals. Here the exposed strata
range in age from the Catheys (Trenton) limestone of the Middle
Ordovician to the Cypress sandstone of the Chester group near the
close of the Mississippian. The Catheys limestone and the succeeding
Leipers limestone of Upper Ordovician age are followed directly by
the Chattanooga black shale of Early Mississippian time, all Silurian
and Devonian strata being absent. The black shale formation is only
20 feet thick in this area but it is so widely distributed that the geo-
logic structure of the region is best determined by its outcrops. All
of the strata here are essentially horizontal, but by plotting the eleva-
tion above sea level of the base of this black shale from outcrop to
outcrop and connecting the places of equal elevation, thereby forming
a structure contour map, no less than 20 small but distinct dome-like
uplifts were discovered in this quadrangle alone. The formations
above and below the black shale exhibit this same structure but the
dip is usually so slight as to be almost imperceptible (fig, 23). Some
of the domes formed by the uplifted strata (fig. 24) are known to be

oil reservoirs and drilling is being actively pursued on such areas
(fig. 25).

From a paleontological standpoint, the Mississippian formations
following the black shale were of highest interest. Usually in Ten-
nessee the rather unfossiliferous Fort Payne chert of Keokuk age
succeeds the Chattanooga black shale but in parts of the Lillydale
quadrangle two intervening formations were discovered. These were:
first, the Ridgetop shale of Kinderhook age reaching a thickness of
200 feet, and second, the richly fossiliferous New Providence shale

of Burlington age noted particularly for its crinoid fossils. Detailed
mapping showed that these two formations were not deposited over a
wide area but that they occupied ancient embayments of the sea
surrounding the Cincinnati anticline. The succeeding strata in the
quadrangle are of Keokuk, Warsaw, St. Louis and Chester age and
show a more uniform, widespread development. The Keokuk lime-
stone, however, exhibited different characteristics from its usual devel-
opment in Tennessee as the Fort Payne chert, but the relationships
between these strata will have to be determined from future studies
ot a more extended area. Paleontologically this formation in the
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 19

Lillydale quadrangle was of particular interest in that the basal beds
afforded a splendid fauna of crinoids many of which are new to
science. One of these new species, named in honor of the eminent
specialist, Dr. Frank Springer, is illustrated herewith (fig. 26).

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

During August and September, 1924, Dr. Charles E. Resser,
associate curator of paleontology, U. S. National Museum, under the
direction of Secretary Charles D. Walcott, continued the study of the
Cambrian formations in the Rocky Mountains, using the Ford truck
and camp equipment purchased the previous season. He was accom-
panied and ably assisted by Mr. Robert S. Bassler, of Washington,
Dp, G

At the invitation of Prof. L. A. Keyte, Colorado College, Colorado
Springs, Colorado, the first stop was at that place and several days
were spent studying the lower Paleozoic beds along the Rocky Moun-
tain front. Under Professor Keyte’s guidance and with his automo-
bile, no delay was experienced in locating fossiliferous outcrops and
securing good collections. During the past few years this region has
yielded many very excellent Ozarkian fossils, new to our study series.

Work was continued in Logan Canyon, Utah, to ascertain whether
any beds of Ozarkian age, which occur 30 miles to the south in Black-
smith Fork Canyon, outcrop at this place. A snowstorm prevented
the completion of this task the previous September, but this year it
was found that the lower beds sought are not present.

Camp was then moved by rapid stages to the Cooke City Ranger
station in the extreme northeastern corner of Yellowstone National
Park. A most excellent section exposing most of the Cambrian for-
mation present in this part of the Rocky Mountains (Absaroka Moun-
tains) was measured up Republic Creek, south of Cooke City,
Montana. Cooke City is a small community which came into existence
upon the discovery of silver ores in the surrounding mountains. It
can be reached by only one road which enters the Yellowstone Park
at Gardner, Montana, and branches off of the ‘“ Loop System”’ of
roads at Camp Roosevelt, following first the Lamar River past the
Buffalo Ranch, and then up Soda Butte Creek, a total distance of
more than 70 miles. On all other sides high mountains hem it in and
since the ores have never proven rich enough to compensate for the
town’s isolation, the mines are undeveloped and the population is
sparse. The road to Cooke City traverses the best of the mountain
20 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 77

scenery in Yellowstone Park. One member of the Cambrian series
of beds is always massive and since Soda Butte Creek has cut into a
gently dipping fold, this massive limestone rims the valley. Every
stream, permanent and temporary, falls over this layer, usually in a
very narrow canyon, adding very much to the picturesqueness of the
region. Indeed, Cooke City is coming to be a favored tourist resort.
Immediately above the massive limestone just mentioned, the beds
become shaly, and from these were secured an entire Cambrian crinoid
of which no complete individual had previously been discovered in
rocks as ancient as these. However, the fossils obtained from this

excellent section were few in number compared to what might be
expected from such a group of Cambrian beds, due to their deposi-
tion in shallow water. At many places the rocks are composed almost
entirely of fossil fragments which had been ground up by the waves
prior to preservation.

A brief trip was made into the south end of the Gallatin Range, to
secure a few fossils in order to determine the relationship of the
Cambrian beds present here to those in the Absaroka and Teton
Ranges.

Work was next continued in the Teton Mountains, which are in
many respects the most magnificent in the United States, rising as they
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 21

do into sharp, steep peaks more than 7,000 feet above the deep
Jackson Lake. A dam has been built at the former outlet of the lake,
impounding the flood waters to a depth of 39 feet, thus preserving
an enormous quantity of water for irrigation in the Snake River
Valley, 300 miles away. The Teton Mountains, due to their rugged-
ness, and the extensive lakes at their base, proved more than ordinarily
difficult to work from an automobile. They present, however, many
interesting and some unique geological problems. This range con-
sists of highly tilted Archaean rocks on the eastern face overlain from

the west by much less steeply inclined strata which include Cambrian,
Ordovician and younger series. A six-inch layer of relatively pure
iron ore was observed near the base of the Cambrian series. At all
points in the range visited this season it was found that the fossils had
also been broken before being buried.

The highway across Teton Pass, by which one leaves Jackson Hole,
going south and west proved exceedingly steep but highly interesting
and of great beauty. The drainage of Jackson Hole escapes through
the Grand Canyon of the Snake River, cut more than a half mile
deep into the mountain wall closing in the south end of the valley, for
which reason the road cannot follow along it.

The past season was the hottest and driest ever recorded for the
western part of our country, in consequence of which snow banks
that had never been known to disappear, melted away. Most of the
mountain streams had little more than a fourth or half of their
normal flow and the roads became almost impassable at places because
the soil, having turned to soft dust, was blown away leaving large
stones exposed. Difficult travel was consequently encountered at many
places.

The latter part of the season was spent in continuing the study ot
various parts of the great Wasatch Range, to determine the stratt-
graphic position of the beds from which some of the earliest collec-
tions of fossils were made by exploring parties sent out previous to
the settlement of the country.

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN MARYLAND AND CONNECTICUT

Mr. Earl V. Shannon, assistant curator, division of physical and
chemical geology, U. S. National Museum, made several short trips
into Maryland during the year to visit mineral localities in that state.
The most noteworthy was that made in May to Cecil County, where
several feldspar quarries and the historically famous locality known
as the State Line Chrome Mine were visited. Much material was
collected for study. The reopening of the Chrome Mine during the
war made available on the dump a quantity of freshly mined rock
and a fine series of specimens of chromite, magnesite, kammererite
and especially of the precious green serpentine known as williamsite
was obtained.

In October, Mr. Shannon made a beginning in the cooperative
work with the Geological and Natural History Survey of Connecticut
leading toward the publication of a work on the mineralogy of that
state. Between two and three weeks was spent in a highly successful
collecting trip. A beginning was made in the southeastern corner of
the area, including a visit to many of the quarries, mines, and road
cuts in Groton, Stonington and Waterford. At the Mason’s Island
quarry in Stonington, numerous pegmatite dikes occurring in the
gneiss were studied and some of them were found to contain notable
quantities of primary magnetite. In places biotite-rich streaks in this
quarry were found to contain golden-brown stilbite, and in one end
of the quarry a quartz vein was located which furnished associated
specimens of garnet, epidote, and stilbite. In Salter’s quarry in

Groton, specimens and notes on peculiar diorite-pegmatites, older
than the Westerly granite sills, were obtained and other pegmatites of
interest were observed intruding the Mamacoke gneiss which is
quarried in the Goos, Flatrock and other quarries in Waterford. One
day was spent in examining the various outcrops, cuts, and quarries
along the shore line branch of the New York, New Haven and Hart-
ford Railroad from Saybrook Junction to Nantic. Another was spent
at the Falls of the Yantic, in Norwich, a famous locality for minerals
obtained early in the last century and but little known since. No iolite
nor corundum were found, but sillimanite was located in quantity in

obtained from pegmatite blocks in fence walls in the neighborhood.
The latter part of the trip was spent at Branford as the guest of
Mr. Alfred E. Hammer, who is particularly well informed regarding
the local geology and mineralogy and the history of mining in his
vicinity. In company with Messrs. Hammer and Warren E. Mumford,
metallurgist for the Malleable Iron Fittings Company of Branford,
many of the important localities were visited. These included the
iolite and garnet-vesuvianite ledges in Guilford, the jail spar quarry,
the spessartite ledge and other feldspar quarries in Haddam, and the
Gillette quarry on Haddam Neck, where many remarkable minerals
26 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL.'77

were found. In Middletown the old lead mine, famous as a source of
metallic lead for bullets in Revolutionary days, was examined. The
Cheshire barite-copper mine and the trap quarry on Mt. Carmel
were visited, and the last trip of the season included a visit to the now
famous mineralogical locality of the tungsten mine at Long Hill in
Trumbull. On this trip the old Booth-Curtis bismuth mine in Monroe,
long a source of native bismuth specimens, was located, but too late
to secure extensive collections.

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN NEVADA

cooperation with one of the U. S. Geological Survey field parties in
the mapping of the Hawthorne quadrangle, western Nevada, making
a special study of the mineralogy and ore deposits of the area. Besides
Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, Cretaceous granites and
Tertiary lavas, the area embraced a number of interesting lake beds
of Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene age, in which were found the
remains of fishes, fresh water gastropods, plants, and the bones and
teeth of horses, camels, mastodon, and rhinoceros. A reported occur-

in age, was visited and examined in detail. Flakes of obsidian such
as are found in abundance throughout this area were noted but no
ancient artifacts or other evidence of Pleistocene man were found.

Some time was devoted to a study of ore deposits of the region
including those of the historic old camps of Candelaria and Aurora
and also those more recent. The mercury deposits of the Pilot Moun-
tains were studied in some detail and interesting collections made.
The quadrangle is unusually rich in minerals and much material was
collected for study. This came largely from the mines and prospects
of the region, but some unusually fine material was also recovered
from the muds of the “ playa ” lakes.

FIELD-WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY IN
CHILE, ARIZONA, AND CALIFORNIA

The Astrophysical Observatory continued its work on the sun's
heat and the variations of it. More and more interest is being
expressed in this work because it promises to be a basis for advances
in weather forecasting. At first sight, the problem is very simple.
As the temperature and rainfall of the earth depend on the sun’s heat,
a change in the sun’s heat must modify temperature and rainfall.
Actually, however, the effects are highly involved.

To explain the matter briefly, there are always certain regions of
high and others of low barometric pressure. These are centers of
atmospheric circulation. The word circulation is indeed more expres-
sive than we often think, for the wind directions bend around these
centers of circulation. Meteorologists speak of cyclones and anti-
cyclones, meaning the great rotary tendencies of the winds over areas
hundreds of miles in diameter, associated respectively with barometric
lows and highs. Such being the case it depends at least partly on the
observer’s position, relative to one of these atmospheric centers of
circulation, whether his weather is warm or cold. For winds from
warmer latitudes tend to make warm weather, and winds from colder
ones cold weather.

If, now, the effect of increase of the solar heating acting upon the
highly complex surface of the earth, with its mountains, deserts,
oceans, etc., should tend to displace an atmospheric action center
(toward the pole, for instance) a station which previously received
prevailingly tropical winds might afterwards receive prevailingly polar
winds, and thereby be cooled, not warmed, by the supposed increase
of solar heat. Another station, a few hundred miles away, might
experience the very opposite effect from the same cause.
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 29

On such grounds we have not to expect any simple or easy solution
of the problem of the influence of variations of the sun on our weather.
Apparently there is only one way to proceed. It is to observe dili-
gently and accurately for years the sun’s changes of radiation, and
then, with the basis of fact so laid, examine the behavior of atmos-
pheric pressure, temperature and rainfall at a great number of stations
over all the world, at all times of the year, in order to work out at
last the exact dependence of weather on solar changes.

This is a very large program. The Astrophysical Observatory
began with it in 1902, when it commenced to observe the solar radia-
tion in Washington. But the atmosphere in Washington was loaded
with clouds, smoke, dust and humidity. It was necessary to remove
to a purer sky. Since then stations have been occupied as follows:
Mt. Wilson, Calif., during summer and autumn, 1905 to 1920; Mt.
Whitney, Calif. (the highest mountain of the United States outside
Alaska) on several days in 1908, 1909, and 1910; Bassour, Algeria,
in summer and autumn 1911 and 1912; Hump Mountain, N. C.,
almost a full year beginning May, 1917; Calama, Chile, July, 1918, to
July, 1920; Montezuma, Chile, August, 1920, to the present time;
Mt. Harqua Hala, Ariz., October, 1920, to the present time.

During all this time better and better methods have been developed,
obstacles to accuracy overcome, and new sources of error recognized
and avoided. The body of experience which has thus come to the
members of the staff is unique, and a very great asset. There is,
indeed, the highest necessity for it. The results of Mr. H. H. Clayton,
who has attempted with much success to unravel the effects of solar
changes on the weather, indicate that variations of the sun as small
as 0.5 per cent, or 1/200 of the whole solar output, produce well
recognizable effects. Changes greater than 3 per cent do not oftea
occur, though once in a great while they go even higher than 5 per
cent. Observing, as we do, at the bottom of a sea of atmosphere,
loaded more or less with variable elements, like dust, water vapor,
etc., it is very difficult to reach a high enough standard of accuracy to
reveal surely changes as small as these.

During the past four years, with the newest methods of observation
and computation, our two observing stations in Arizona and Chile
each determined the sun’s heat on upwards of 70 per cent of all days.
Taking all fairly good days when both stations observed, the average
deviation of these independent measures, made over 4,000 miles apart
and reduced independently for atmospheric losses, is about 0.5 per
cent. During October, 1923, however, both stations reported almost
every day, and the average daily difference was less than 0.2 per cent.

It would be highly advantageous to have another pair of stations
located, if possible, in well separated cloudless regions where the
months December to March are more favorable.

On the whole, the solar heat appears to have been continuously
below the normal for the past 2} years. Of late months the tendency
to rise has become apparent, so that it seems likely that higher values
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 Gil

will soon prevail again. We had hitherto noted an association of
higher solar radiation with greater sun-spot activity. (See fig. 38.)
As we have now passed the minimum of sun-spots, and greater solar
activity is to be expected in the next years, the rising tendency of the
solar radiation is not surprising.

During the past year, the Institution has received each morning tele-
grams from Arizona and Chile giving the solar results of the preceding

Clayton in Massachusetts. Mr. Clayton has returned to the Institution
on the same afternoon a letter giving forecasts for the temperature
of New York City several days in advance. Mathematical methods,
independent of personal bias, show that these forecasts indicate some
degree of real prevision, based on the solar observations, even to
5 days in advance. These investigations are supported by Mr. John A.
Roebling. A continuation of them is intended.

Interesting results were secured in quite a different field. Dr. Abbot
employed a Nichols radiometer in connection with the 1oo-inch reflect-

colors, and even far into the infra-red. In this way curves were drawn

indicating the spectral distribution in the radiation of blue, white,
yellow and red stars, and estimates of their probable temperatures
were made. From these results and the results giving the total amounts
of heat they send compared to the sun, estimates were possible of the
diameters of the stars observed.

A summary of these results follows, in which the diameters he esti-
mated are compared with the values found in other ways by Michel-
son’s interferometry methods, and by Russell from photometry. It is
hoped to improve the sensitiveness of the radiometric devices suffi-
ciently to make possible a study of much fainter stars.

ZOOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN WESTERN CHINA

For several years the Rev. David C. Graham, of the West China
Mission of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, has been
collecting natural history material in the vicinity of his station at
Suifu, in the province of Szechuen, and sending his specimens to the
U.S. National Museum. At times his activities have led him further
afield, and last year (1923) he conducted a successful trip to Tatsienlu,
a locality several days’ journey to the northwest of Suifu.

Tatsienlu is an important spot for naturalists through being the
type locality for many species brought to light by earlier travellers.
It was visited by the Abbé Armand David about the year 1869, by
‘Prince Henri d’Orleans in 1890, and by A. E. Pratt in the same year,
followed in 1894 by a Russian explorer, G. Potanin. Ernest H. Wilson
34 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL 77;

and W. R. Zappey were there in 1908, the former interested in botany
and the latter in zoology. In 1913, a German traveller, Walter
Stotzner, made collections in various parts of Szechuen, including
Tatsienlu and vicinity. The above incomplete list of visitors who
have made this place a collecting ground will suffice to stamp the
region as one fairly well known to naturalists. Nevertheless, the
locality was all but unrepresented in the U. S. National Museum col-
lections, and the material sent in by Mr. Graham was received with
no little gratification.

After finishing his trip to Tatsienlu, Mr. Graham contemplated a
visit to Moupin, the scene of some of David’s early work and also a
type locality of note, but the presence of bandits in that district caused
him to look elsewhere for the moment and he decided upon Songpan
(or Sungpan), in the northern part of the province, reasoning that
a visit to this district would result in the gathering of many species
not common to the regions he had already explored. This trip was
projected at the end of the year 1923 and began to assume shape in
May of the year 1924, when the Smithsonian Institution with the
approval of Dr. W. L. Abbott, transferred to him the collecting
outfit of the late Charles M. Hoy, who had been operating in the
province of Honan.

Songpan was first visited by an Occidental in 1877, when the late
Captain W. J. Gill reached it, according to Ernest H. Wilson, who
was there on several occasions, the first time in 1903, during his
botanical travels in Szechuen. Berezowski spent several months at
Songpan in 1894, and Stotzner collected specimens there in 1913.
Wilson writes that since Gill’s entry into the city “several foreigners
have paid visits, and missionaries of Protestant denominations have
made abortive attempts to establish stations there.”

While Songpan was the objective of Graham’s proposed journey,
it was not so much the actual city as the general region that attracted
his attention. He had heard that good collecting ground existed in
its vicinity, hence looked forward to it as a trip worthy of trial.
During the latter part of May and early June he made himself
familiar with the new outfit and carried out his plans and preparations
for the long, rough trip. The distance from Suifu to Songpan in a
straight line is probably not much over 240 miles, but by the route
travelled would be nearer 400 miles, partly by water, but chiefly by
land, and to keep the cost of the trip within his original estimates,
Mr. Graham planned to walk over practically all of the overland part
of his journey.
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 35

Preparations were completed for the trip by the 22d of June, and
at daybreak on the morning of the 23d, Mr. Graham and his party,
consisting of several Chinese carriers, helpers, skinners, etc., embarked
by boat from Suifu. They touched at various minor towns and
hamlets by the way, collecting specimens at every opportunity, and
reached Kiating, the first place of importance, on the 29th. Frequent
and heavy rains fell almost daily, but the party succeeded in register-
ing specimens from point to point throughout the journey. From
Kiating to Chengtu Mr. Graham’s party had an escort of four soldiers,
and beyond Chengtu the escort consisted of double this number, who
had neither guns nor swords for defense; yet, withal, the party got
through in safety. Chengtu was reached on July 2, after daily stops
at small towns and villages. Mowchow, the next place of consequence,
was reached on the 9th, the country for some miles on either side of
it being semi-arid in nature; apparently for the time they had passed
out of the region of heavy rains.

The Graham party arrived at Songpan on July 14, after a strenu-
ous journey of twenty-two days. During his stay at this place, Mr.
Graham found the city was devoid of foreigners, and the native off-
cials would not permit him to venture out of its limits except to the
east and south.

In a letter dated September 3, 1924, Mr. Graham writes:

The Songpan trip has been taken, and we are safely at Suifu with 50 boxes
of specimens, most of which are about ready to be mailed by parcel post.

This has been a harder and rougher trip than the one to Tatsienlu or any
other previous trip. It is much harder to secure food and other necessities
around Songpan than at Tatsienlu. There were times when we could purchase
no fruit, vegetables, eggs, or meat. At Songpan it was impossible to go west
or north, where large mammals are found in abundance, so that the only
place we could go was east to the Yellow Dragon Gorge. Even there we had
to have an escort of six Chinese soldiers and had of course to pay all their
expenses.

Continuing, he writes:

The reason we could not go north of Songpan or west of that place was
that the Bolotsi aborigines are so savage and so inclined to murder and
brigandage that the Chinese can not control them and are afraid of them,
and the officials could not protect us in those regions. .... Just before we
returned from Songpan, the Bolotsis attacked a company of Chinese soldiers,
killed several of their number, stole several rifles, and drove the scared and
defeated soldiers back to their barracks. I have not heard that the Chinese
have dared to go into the Bolotsi country with a punitive expedition.

The catch of mammals is not large. We are very sorry about this. It is due
primarily to the fact that the mammal-catching districts around Songpan
36 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. “77

were closed to us. Yellow Dragon Gorge was a fine place for birds and insects,
but a great festival had just been held there, in which aborigine and Chinese
hunters from all directions had joined in the chase, and wood cutters were
busy in the woods cutting timber for the new temples that are being con-
structed. The mammals had been scared away.

In addition to the material collected on the Songpan trip, Mr.
Graham had native collectors at work in other districts, about whose
activities he writes: }

This year’s catch is bigger than that of last year. There are 50 boxes of
specimens on hand, and I expect to send them off by parcel post as early as
possible. Besides the 50 boxes just mentioned, there is the entire catch of the
netter Ho for at least three months, who has been collecting about Beh Luh Din,
Chengtu, and Kuanshien during the summer, and specimens now being secured
by two collectors on Mt. Omei, one at Shin Kai Si and one on the higher
altitudes.

The material obtained on the Songpan trip included about 5,000
insects, of which the two-winged flies and butterflies and moths
constituted an important element, many of them being either new to
the Museum or new to science. The birds, 558 in number, were
received at a late date, and have not been fully examined, though to
date about a dozen species new to the Museum have been detected.

About 250 mollusks and a lesser number of mammals, fishes, rep-
tiles and batrachians, earthworms, plants, etc., comprise the remainder
of the shipment.

ViSIT OF MR. GERRIT S, MILLER, JR. LO THE LESSER ANTE ES

During February and March, 1924, I visited the Lesser Antilles,
more for the purposes of vacation and of getting a personal impression
of the islands than with any plan for definite research. Two weeks
were spent on Barbados and a month on Grenada; while each of
the principal islands was visited for a few hours during the southward
and return voyages. Some miscellaneous collections were made,
chiefly of ferns, cacti, and lizards.

Much detailed work in zoology and botany remains to be done on
the islands of the Lesser Antillean chain. As a striking illustration
of this fact, it may be mentioned that, in a group of plants so con-
spicuous as the cacti, and so well monographed as these have recently
been in the elaborate work of Dr. N. L. Britton and Dr. J. N. Rose,
nine species (7 genera) were found growing wild on Grenada, from
which island these authors had actually examined only two. One of
the common Grenadan cacti was described in 1837, but had remained

‘Jost’ until, under the guidance of Dr. J. N. Rose, I “ rediscovered ”
it; yet the plant flourishes at the roadside within a few hundred yards
ot the fine botanical garden in the suburbs of Saint George. For the
convenience of anyone who might be interested in doing some field-
work on these Islands, attention may be called to the ease with which
they can be reached. The boats of the Quebec Steamship Company
maintain a service from New York to Barbados, touching at the
islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. Kitts, Antigua, Guadeloupe,
Dominica, Martinique and St. Lucia, and remaining at each for a
period which depends on the quantity of cargo to be handled, but
which is usually from three to ten hours. As the islands are small
and the roads on most of them are good, there is usually time to
get a fair general idea of topography, forests and cultivation during
the vessel’s call, particularly when it is remembered that points of
special interest can be seen again on the return voyage. From Bar-
bados the passage to St. Vincent and Grenada is made by the Royal
Mail boats plying between St. John, New Brunswick, and Demarara,
British Guiana, by way of Bermuda, the Lesser Antilles and Trinidad.
There is also a line directly from New York to Grenada and Trinidad,
but this gives no opportunity to see other islands. On the return
voyage inconvenience may be experienced in obtaining passage owing
to the number of “ round trippers”’ with whom the boats are some-
times crowded; and for the same cause travel between neighboring
islands is not always easy.
The appended photographs show characteristic scenes.

EXPERIMENTS IN HEREDITY AT THE TORTUGAS

In continuation of the heredity experiments in the Tortugas con-
ducted under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian and Carnegie
Institutions, Dr. Paul Bartsch visited Cuba from May 27 to May 30
this year, in order to add a spirally striated Cerion element to the
Cerion colonies established at the Tortugas. Thanks to the good
offices of Dr. Carlos de la Torre, of the University of Havana, he was
able to secure a sufficient series of a strongly spirally striated new spe-
cies of Cerion belonging to the Cerion johnsoni group at Mariel, where
also a large number of Cerion sculptum, likewise, though less strongly
spirally striated, were gathered. In addition to these, Cerion mumuaua
from Marianao and Cerion chrysalis from Cabanas Fort and Cerion
tridentata from Rincon de Guanabon were collected and planted at
the Tortugas. The last is peculiar on account of the internal lamel-
lation of the aperture, thus adding another element to our experiments.
44 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 77

On June 1 a visit was paid to the hybrid Cerion colony on New-
found Harbor Key. This was found to be in a flourishing condition
and 100 specimens were taken to Washington for record and dis-
section. From June 2 to June 15 was spent at the Tortugas where the
various Cerion colonies which have been established there were
studied and new ones added. All the colonies were found to be
doing well, excepting that of Cerion uva from Curacoa, which is on
the verge of extinction.

Fic. 55.—Four of the six island groups.

We gathered a number of F2 Florida-grown specimens of Cerion
crassilabre, which show no measurable differences from those of the
check series of the Fr Florida-grown generation, thus again con-
firming our finding with the other races of transplanted Cerions, that
changed environmental factors have no appreciable influence upon
the Fr and F2 generations of the transplanted material.

A large series of offsprings of the mixed colony of Cerion casa-
blancae and Cerion viaregis (Colony I) were gathered and taken to
Washington to be carefully studied for a possible cross.

500 Cerion mummia from the point at Miramar, Cuba.

These were planted on the west and north side of the parapet at
Fort Jefferson on Garden Key, each duly marked with a stake and tag.
Our failure in the past to grow Cerions in cages at the Tortugas
caused us to try isolating them on little islands this year. Mr. Mills

of the construction of which is shown in the accompanying diagram
(fig. 56). Two additional areas of the same size were subdivided by
a similar median septum which yielded four almost 3 x 3 ft. islets.
The simple trenches require each some nine pails of water and the
compound correspondingly more. Arrangements have been made with
Mr. Charles Johnson, keeper of the Tortugas lighthouse, to keep
these trenches filled with water. Evaporation at the Tortugas is great
and it will be necessary to replenish the loss of water almost daily.
For this purpose a pump has been installed in the middle of the
battery of islands which will make this a comparatively easy daily task.

The inclosed areas have been planted each with a Hymenocallis
plant and a few such grasses as are favored by Cerions, likewise a few
added fragments of coconut pediole fibers; in other words, all things

favored for attachment by Cerions. These islands are placed south of
the laboratory and east of the men’s quarters. They have been
stocked with:

2. 25 Cerion incanum and 25 Cerion chrysalis

3. 25 Cerion incanum and 25 Cerion mumnua

4. 25 Cerion incanum and 25 Cerion tridentata

5 and 6. In each compartment a two-thirds grown individual of Cerion incanum
and Cerion viaregis.

On June 15, during the return trip to Key West, Man and Boy
Keys were visited. The Boy Key colony has in part survived the
burning of last year, but that on Man Key has again been burned
over and it is questionable if any living thing is left in it.

Thanks to the authorities of the United States Bureau of Fisheries,
some plantings were made within the compound of the Fisheries
station at Key West where our colonies will be safe from burnings.
Two colonies were established here on the opposite extremities of
the seaside leg of the grounds. They consist of 500 specimens each
of Cerion viaregis and Cerion incanum, and 500 each of Cerion tri-
dentatum and Cerion incanuim, respectively.

In addition to the work done at the various stations on the Florida
Keys and Cuba, twenty of the hybrid Cerions from the Newfound
Harbor colony have been dissected at the National Museum by Miss
Mary E. Quick, under the direction of Dr. Bartsch. These show most
remarkable changes in anatomic character. It is planned to make a
greater number of dissections of these hybrid Cerions in order to
determine the range of changes produced by hybridization.

While at the Tortugas, Dr. Bartsch exposed 1,200 feet of moving
picture film with his undersea camera, photographing denizens of
the coral reef. He took the precaution this year to place the camera
upon a tripod, which has eliminated the seasickness-producing effects
obtained during similar efforts last year when the camera was held
freely in the hands while working in a rather rough sea. The negatives
since developed are quite satisfactory.

As in previous years a full record of the birds seen from day to
day was kept and added to the list recorded in the past. This has
yielded so far not only a large series of notes on the avian population
of the Florida Keys and the breeding habits of local forms, but much
information on bird migration.

INSECT COLLECTING EXPEDITION IN DHE. PACIBIGC COASH
REGION

On May 31, 1924, Dr. J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of the
division of insects, U. S. National Museum, left Washington on a
western trip for the purpose of examining type material of insects in
certain museums and collecting the two-winged flies in localities of
especial interest in the Pacific Coast region.

The first official work was done at the University of Kansas, where
some types of muscoid flies were examined. Next, a stop for col-
lecting was made at Redlands, California, and two days were spent

Fic. 59.—Coast of Oregon, near California line.

in the San Bernardino Mountains with Dr. Frank R. Cole. This
mountain range is somewhat isolated in position, but includes in its
fauna some of the northern species of flies as well as some known
from Mexico. An entirely different fauna is that of the lower San
Joaquin Valley where the next stop was made at the town of Newman.
In this vicinity the dry weather had made the collecting very poor,
except along the banks of the San Joaquin River; but here some
insects of unusual interest were obtained, including one genus new
to the National Museum.

Two days were spent in the Academy of Natural Sciences in San
Francisco, examining types and assisting to some extent in determin-
ing material for the museum A brief visit to Stanford University
permitted the examination of some interesting type material of para-
sitic ‘flies occurring on birds and bats.
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, I924 49

From Oakland, California, the trip was made by automobile to
Eureka and on up the coast into Oregon as far as Marshfield. Along
this route the extremely dry season made the collecting very poor
except in the vicinity of Marshfield, where the climate is compara-
tively humid and the collecting was much better. Two days were
spent here with very good results. At Corvallis, Oregon, some type
material was examined in the collection of the Agricultural College.

In the vicinity of Spokane, Washington, considerable collecting was
done for two or three days, resulting in additions of some value but
not of exceptional rarity.

Fic. 60.—Coast of Oregon, near California line.

Near Moscow, Idaho, the mountain locally known as Mount Mos-
cow was visited on several days and some important material obtained.
This mountain is the type locality for a considerable number of new
species of insects. At Kendrick, Idaho, the greatest rarity of the
trip was discovered, about 20 specimens of a fly which was originally
described in 1877 from streams in Marin County, California.

Two days were spent in collecting at Summit, Montana, and at the
Glacier National Park railroad station, a region from which very
few flies had previously been obtained for the National Museum.

The illustrations shown (figs. 59, 60) are from photographs taken
along the Pacific Coast in southern Oregon, where a very good high-
way winds in and out of the forests, frequently following the bluffs
along the ocean.

BOTANICAL EXPLORATION IN PANAMA AND COSTA RICA

With the cooperation of the government of the Panama Canal,
botanical field-work was undertaken in 1923 in the region of the
Zone by Mr. Paul C. Standley, associate curator of the division of
plants, U. S. National Museum, with the object of obtaining collec-
tions and data for a report upon the plant life, which it is planned
to publish in the near future. Part of November, December, and
most of January were spent in botanical exploration in and near the
Zone. Nearly all parts of this area were visited, and 7,000 numbers
of plants were obtained, represented by about twice as many speci-
mens. These collections are now being studied and have been found
to contain a number of species new to science, besides many not col-
lected previously in the area.

The vegetation of the Zone is typical of that existing in Central
America at low elevations, but it is here possible to study in close
proximity the floras of the Atlantic and Pacific slopes, these floras
being sharply differentiated in Central America because of differences
in the climates of the two watersheds. The Pacific slope has well
defined wet and dry seasons; on the Atlantic slope there is usually
plentiful moisture throughout the year.

Although the original vegetation of the Isthmus of Panama has
been greatly modified in many places because of long occupation by
man, and especially because of operations incident to the construction
and management of the Canal, there remain near the Canal extensive
areas of virgin forest whose animal and plant life is of great interest.
Advantage has been taken of this fact to establish recently a station
for tropical scientific research on Barro Colorado Island in Gattn
Lake, the island having been set aside for the purpose by the Gov-
ernor of the Canal. Upon this island, largely as a result of the energy
and enthusiasm of Mr. James Zetek, there has been constructed
this year a laboratory building with accommodations for students,
and trails have been cut to make the virgin forest, which covers
several hundred acres, available for study.

The most striking botanical feature of the Canal Zone is doubtless
the orchid garden formed by Mr. C. W. Powell of Balboa. In this
collection Mr. Powell has assembled orchid plants from many parts
of Panama, and he has in cultivation nearly all the species known
to occur in the Republic. During the last ten years he has found
over 300 species, about three times as many as were known previously
from Panama, and many of them have proved to be forms unknown
to orchid students.

At the end of January, Mr. Standley proceeded to Costa Rica,
remaining there until the middle of April, when he returned to Wash-
ington. Costa Rica is botanically the richest part of North America.
In the highlands, where the climate is temperate rather than tropical
and where there is a heavy rainfall, the vegetation is extraordinarily
luxuriant, and the variety of plants bewildering. Although large
collections already have been made in Costa Rica, it will require many
years of intensive exploration to gain an adequate knowledge of the
plant life.

Mr. Standley’s collection consists of 8,000 numbers of plants, many
of which will doubtless prove to be new. Special attention was given
to the orchids, of which about 1,500 numbers were obtained. These
are now being studied by Mr. Oakes Ames, through whose interest
the work in Costa Rica was undertaken. Of orchids Costa Rica
possesses probably a larger number of species than any other portion
of the American tropics of equal extent. Over 1,000 species have
been reported from this small Republic, and it is certain that many
more await discovery. While most Costa Rican orchids, like those
of other countries, have inconspicuous flowers, some, such as the
Cattleyas, are of unsurpassed beauty.

Visits were made to the Volcano of Poas, celebrated for its great
crater, which contains a lake that erupts frequently; to the Volcano
of Turrialba, whose forests are noted for their wealth of ferns ; and
to many other rich localities in the central highlands.

A short visit to the comparatively arid Pacific coast proved that the
flora of this part of Costa Rica is relatively meager and uninteresting.
Several visits were made to the wet lowland forests of the Atlantic
watershed, where the vegetation is even more luxuriant than in the
mountains and the species are almost equally numerous. Little is
known of the plants of the Atlantic lowlands of Central America,
although it is probable that no other region will better reward
exploration.

30TANICAL WORK IN SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO

During part of August, 1924, Mr. Standley was detailed for
field-work as a member of the Carlsbad Cavern Expedition of the
National Geographic Society. This expedition, under the direction
of Dr. Willis T. Lee, was engaged this year in a detailed survey of
the Carlsbad Cavern, recently set aside as a national monument, and
of its surroundings. The cavern is noteworthy because of its large
size and lavish decorations, and is one of the most notable of the
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 57

many remarkable natural features of the State of New Mexico. Mr.
Standley made a study of the plants of the plains and hills near the
cavern, an area possessing a great variety of cactuses and other
characteristic desert plants of the Southwest. Visits were made also
to the canyons of the near-by Guadalupe Mountains. This range,
partly in New Mexico and partly in Texas, has at its southern end
Signal Peak, the highest point in the latter State, about which it
has been proposed to establish a State park. The Guadalupe Moun-
tains are comparatively unknown botanically, and numerous species
were found that had not been collected previously in New Mexico.
One of the interesting features of the vegetation of these mountains
is the profusion of the Venus-hair fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris)
a species rare in the Southwest but here abundant everywhere along
the small streams.

After completion of the field-work in the vicinity of the cavern,
a trip by automobile was made to El Paso, Texas, passing the southern
end of the Guadalupes. From El Paso the route was followed to
Las Cruces, New Mexico, and thence over the picturesque Organ
Mountains and past the White Sands, a vast expanse of gypsum sand,
almost pure white, resembling great drifts of snow. The White
Mountains also were visited, and the road was followed to Roswell
and Carlsbad, thus making it possible in a short time to gain a
general impression of the varied types of vegetation covering a large
area of characteristic desert and mountain country of southern New
Mexico.

BOTANICAL EXPEDITION TO THE CENTRAL ANDES

During the summer and fall of 1923, Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, botanist
in charge of systematic agrostology, Bureau of Plant Industry, De-
partment of Agriculture, and custodian of the section of grasses of the
U. S. National Museum, visited Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia for the
purpose of studying and, collecting the grasses. He left New York
May 25 and arrived at Guayaquil June 16, making a short stop at
Port au Prince, Haiti, and at Buenaventura, Colombia, and a stay of
several days at Panama.

The work in Ecuador was done in cooperation with the New York
Botanical Garden and the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University,
and these institutions shared in the specimens obtained. Therefore
in this country the collections included all families of flowering plants.
Several localities on the coastal plain were visited, after which col-
lections were made in the vicinity of Huigra, a town on the railroad
58 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 77

at 4,000 feet elevation. Headquarters was then transferred to Quito,
the capital, at 9,500 feet elevation. The only important railroad in
Ecuador runs from Guayaquil to Quito, crossing the coastal plain for
about 100 kilometers and then ascending through one of the valleys to
the Sierra or central plateau over a pass about 10,000 feet. The train

to Portovelo, a gold mine in charge of Americans, to Loja, the
southernmost town of importance in Ecuador, and then north through
Cuenca, the third city in size, and on to Huigra. A short journey of
four days was made into the Oriente from Ambato to Banos and
on to Cashurco near Mera. The last collecting was done on the great
peak of Chimborazo, ascending to snow line at about 16,000 feet.
Leaving Guayaquil October 11, Callao was reached October 17.
In Peru two chief regions were visited, the first being the central
plateau east of Lima. A railroad runs from Lima to Oroya (12,000

A side trip was made down the east side to Colonia Perené, a coffee
plantation at 2,000 feet, and another to the Atocsaico Ranch, near
Junin, at 13,000 feet, where there is excellent grazing the year
around for 35,000 sheep and 1,100 cattle. Cerro de Pasco, on account
of the altitude, is a cold bleak place. Here grows the curious moss
grass (Aciachne pulvinata), covering entire hills with hard compact
rounded tussocks. From here a trip was made to La Quinhua, a gold
mine at a lower altitude, and another to Goyllarisquisca, a coal mine,
also at a somewhat lower altitude, where the collecting was very good.

The second region visited in Peru was reached by the Southern
Railway from Mollendo on the coast. The first day takes one up to
Arequipa at 7,500 feet, where a few days were spent. The second day
takes one to Juliaca, and the third to Cuzco. A few days were spent at
a new Government experiment station at Chuquibambilla (13,000
feet), north of Juliaca. This station is well-equipped and is devoting
its attention chiefly to sheep-raising.

From Cuzco (11,500 feet) a trip was made down the valley north-
ward to Ollantaytambo over a new railroad which ultimately will
reach Santa Ana, head of navigation on the Urubamba river, At

important industry of the montanas of Peru and Bolivia.

Ollantaytambo and at Cuzco there are fine examples of Inca archi-
tecture, now in ruins, but showing the remarkable stone walls in which
the irregular stones are fitted with great accuracy but without mortar.

On going to Bolivia from Cuzco the traveler returns on the South-
ern Railway to Juliaca, there takes a branch line to Puno on Lake
Titicaca, crosses the lake by night on a comfortable little steamer to
Guaqui, and then goes by rail to La Paz.

Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America and the highest
for its size in the world, is 130 miles long, 3,200 square miles in
area, and as much as goo feet deep. The railroad from Guaqui
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 63

passes over a high plain, gradually ascends from 12,500 to 13,500
feet, then abruptly descends into a bowl or valley to La Paz at 12,000
feet. It is a very striking experience to come suddenly to the edge of
the plain and look down 1,500 feet on the beautiful city below.

From La Paz a four-day journey by mule was made to the great
mountain mass, Illimani, about 25 miles nearly east of the city. This
snow-capped mountain is a beautiful sight from La Paz and dom-
inates the landscape much as do Rainer and Shasta in this country.
The peak is about 22,000 feet in altitude (6,619 meters) but was
ascended only to snowline, about 16,000 feet.

A second journey from La Paz was to the Yungas, a region in the
montafias (forested region) north of the city but on the Amazon
slope of the Cordillera. The trip was made in company with Dr. Otto
Buchtien, the well-known German botanist, long resident in Bolivia,
who has done so much work on the plants of that country. A railroad
takes one over a pass at about 15,000 feet to Pongo (about 12,000
feet), the present terminus of the road which is under construction
into the Yungas. Through the courtesy of the director of the rail-
road, mules were furnished for a week’s travel down through the
provinces of Nor-Yungas and Sur-Yungas to Chulumani and Coroico.
This region is the center of the coca industry of Bolivia. The leaves
of the coca shrub (not to be confused with cacao or chocolate tree,
nor with the coconut palm) are much used by the Indians as a
stimulant. The leaves are mixed with a paste of ashes and chewed.
The leaves also form an important article of export as they are
the source of the drug cocaine.

After leaving La Paz a journey was made to Cochabamba, a rich
agricultural district toward the east on the slope from the main
Bolivian plateau. The last expedition was made through, the aid of
the Ulen Contracting Corporation which is constructing a railroad
from Uyuni in southern Bolivia on the main line from La Paz to
Antofagasta, Chile, to Villazon on the Argentine border where it will
join the Argentine system. The road is now in use as far as Atocha
and ultimately will complete the line from La Paz to Buenos Aires.
Ten days were spent on a mule-back round trip from Atocha to
La Quiaca, the northernmost town in Argentina.

The return home was made from Antofagasta, arriving in New
York February 16, 1924.

The region visited consists topographically and climatically of three
main divisions. There is a coastal plain mostly not more than 100
miles in width extending all along the coast. In northern Ecuador

this plain has an abundant rainfall but becomes drier to the south and
in Peru is a desert. In Ecuador the chief crops are sugar and cacao.
In Peru the agriculture is confined to the valleys that can be irrigated
from the mountain streams. Here the crops are sugar, cotton, grain,
and alfalfa. The temperature of the coastal plain is modified by the
Humboldt current which sweeps up from the cold Antarctic regions
and the coastal cities of Peru are much cooler than those of the
Atlantic coast in the same latitude.

The central part of Ecuador and Peru is occupied by the great
Andes mountain system, the Cordillera. In a general way the system

consists of two chains with a plateau between. In Ecuador the plateau
is divided into several valleys by cross ridges. In the valleys at alti-
tudes from 8,000 to 9,500 feet lie the chief cities, such as Tulcan,
Ibarra, Quito, Ambato, Riobamba, and Cuenca. In Peru the plateau 1s
at a greater altitude. South of Cuzco (11,500 feet) it broadens into a
wide area embracing all western Bolivia, the plateau being mostly
12,000 to 13,000 feet elevation for 400 miles and more than 100
miles wide. Most of the region above 12,000 feet is devoid of trees
and the plain increases in aridity southward. The southwestern part
of Bolivia is a desert. The plains and slopes above tree line in Ecuador
are called paramos and the region is called the Sierra. They are
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 67

subject to cold winds which make travelling uncomfortable. In Peru
the treeless plateaus are called punas. Many mountain ranges rise
above the plateau and snow-capped peaks are numerous. The best
known peaks in Ecuador are Chimborazo and Cotopaxi, more than
20,000 feet in altitude. The height and massiveness of the mountain
system in central Peru is indicated by the altitude of the pass on
the railroad from Lima to Oroya in the central plateau mentioned
above.

In Peru and Bolivia there is little in the way of crop production
on the puna, but where there is sufficient rainfall the stock-raising
industry flourishes. The grazing on the puna of Peru is in the main
excellent and large numbers of sheep are raised. In the valleys falling
from the plateau agriculture at once begins and crops of beans (habas,
the broad bean of Europe) and barley are first seen ; somewhat lower
are found alfalfa, corn, potatoes, and wheat.

The third primary region is the montana, a name applied to the wet
forested slopes of the Andes on the east. In Ecuador the slope is
abrupt on the eastern chain of the Cordillera and soon passes into
the Oriente or great rain forest of the Amazon valley. In a general
way this montana region extends through eastern Peru to the Yungas
of Bolivia. Beyond that it merges into the Chaco of eastern Bolivia,
which is a drier region of scant forest and grassy plains.

The botanical results of the trip have been very satisfactory. A
large collection of grasses was made, which will form the basis of an
account of the grass flora of the three countries visited. Already
several new species have been described from the general collections
made in Ecuador.

ARCHEOLOGICAL EXPEDITION TO CHINA

During the winter of 1923-1924, the Expedition sent to China under
the joint auspices of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Museum of
Fine Arts, Boston, carried on successful investigations at I Chou, in
the province of Chihli, and at several localities in the province of
Shensi. I Chou is built on the site of an ancient city, perhaps that
of Yen Ching, and while there Mr. Carl Whiting Bishop, in charge
of the expedition, traced portions of old earthen walls of considerable
size, lying to the southwest of the present city. To the east of I Chou,
groups of many large, uncovered mounds rise from the flat plains ;
these were inspected as were also some of the many potsherds and
fragments of tile and pottery found on the surfaces of the mounds
themselves. Later, Mr. Bishop made a survey of the locality by

while there to make a fair reconstruction of the ancient city. In the
same province they inspected also, two large mounds of the usual
truncated pyramidal form, ascribed to early Han emperors; the
supposed tomb of the emperor Ch’in Shih Huang-ti (221-210 B. C.),
and the tombs of the famous emperor Han Wu Ti (140-87 B. C.)
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 Fil

and his general Ho Ch’u-ping. The tomb of Han Wu T1 is an unusu-
ally large one, measuring 278 yards at its base and presents oppor-
tunities of great archeological interest, as does also that of General
Ho Ch’t-ping, where Mr. Bishop saw not only the well-known stone
figure of a horse trampling on a recumbent warrior, but examined
also several other partially exposed stone sculptures of the early
Han period. Photographs, and scale plans of several of the tombs
and temples in this vicinity were made.

The first actual excavation work conducted by the Expedition, was
begun in the spring of this year at Yu-ho Chen, about 17 miles west
of Hsin-yang Chou, in the province of Honan. This specific under-
taking has an added significance archeologically, in that it is the
first work of the kind to be conducted in China by any foreign govern-
ment in cooperation with the Chinese authorities. At Yu-ho Chen,
two tombs of the Han dynasty (206 B. C—A. D. 221), were exca-
vated ; the work revealed interesting data on ancient tomb construction
and brought to light Chinese cultural objects dating from prehistoric
times to the Han period. Specimens in metal, stone and pottery were
found in the tombs; chariot-fittings, mirrors and arrow-points of
bronze; one or two gold rings; cast-iron implements; a stone axe
and parts of stone doors and lintels ; a jade chisel; slate arrow-heads,
and a number of pieces of ancient pottery—some intact, some frag-
mentary—among them a kind of glazed pottery which, if it be of
Han production, is a type hitherto scarcely known to us.

In August, the Yu-ho Chen finds were exhibited for one day,
under Mr. Bishop’s direction, at the Historical Museum in Peking ;
between 5,000 and 6,000 visitors attended the exhibit.

In the early autumn Mr. Bishop, together with Dr. Barbour, pro-
fessor of geology at Peking University, and Dr. Tegengren, a
Swedish mining geologist, examined a mound at Peitaiho, on the
gulf of Chihli, which discloses evidences of what Mr. Bishop believes
may be a Han dynasty naval base or fortress; one of three which
are said to have been built at that time, and of which two only have
been located.

A satisfactory report on the purchases made in China during the
past year cannot be prepared at this time, for, until a more detailed
examination of the objects shall have been made, definite information
with regard to age, provenance and type will not be possible. The
purchases include Buddhist stone sculptures, Chinese pottery and
bronzes, and, among the last named, a collection which we believe has
come from Shou Chou, the last capital of the Kingdom of Ch’u, which
was destroyed in 223 B. C.

Important as the archeological work of our Expedition has been,
a summary of the year’s activities in China should include a state-
ment concerning the perhaps still more gratifying success we have
had in accomplishing what was the fundamental object of our Expedi-
tion; namely, the establishment of a cooperative agreement between
ourselves and the Chinese authorities with regard to archeological
research. This agreement establishes for the first time, a mutually
beneficial relationship between Chinese and Western archeologists,
which will prove to be, let us hope, a dignified working basis for more
enlightened scholarship and valuable scientific research in this in-
creasingly important field. The cooperative agreement between our-
selves and the Chinese authorities was confirmed by the unsolicited
appointment of Mr. Bishop as Honorary Advisor in Archeology to
the Historical Department of the Chinese government, and, later, by
the permissions granted to our Expedition, not only by the Governor
of Shensi and the Director of Education for Honan, to excavate
within their respective provinces, but also by the Ministry of Educa-
tion, to excavate anywhere in China,

ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNOISSANCE
IN ARIZONA

During August and September, Dr. Walter Hough, head curator of
anthropology, U. S. National Museum, carried on ethnological and
archeological, reconnoissance work in Arizona. Revisiting the White
Mountain Apache after an absence of several years, effort was made
to ascertain the present status of these Indians in comparison with
their condition and attitude towards innovations some years ago.
Measures adopted for the welfare of the Indians give imperceptible
results for a period; then the innovation is gradually accepted and
finally reaches the effective stage among the larger number of Indians.
In this way schools, hospitals, etc., slowly enter the consciousness
of the Indian. Attempts to hasten matters unadvisedly in the past
have resulted in disastrous failure, blocking the orderly course of
reforms. More basic and perhaps more important is the extension
of commerce and the consequent realization by the Indian of the
value of money, Last year two prominent Apaches occupied American
type houses. This step appears to mark the abandonment of the
miserable, unsanitary tipi of brush which has held back the Apache
during all his generations.

Among the Hopi it is becoming apparent that changes are in prog-
ress that will profoundly affect the persistence of this Indian group.

receive large wages and are much esteemed for their skill. The result
of this on the integrity of pueblo life is on the eve of becoming dis-
astrous, as the older people are left on their own resources without
able help. This phase in the history of the Hopi was unexpected as a
disintegrating element. No one suspected that the Hopi would be

caught in the industrial maelstrom, especially as the Rio Grande
Pueblos never progressed in this direction.

The archeological results of the reconnoissance were the location
of several hitherto unidentified ruins, notably a large ancient settle-
ment of apparently pre-pueblo age about five miles from Whiteriver,
Arizona. A careful examination was made of the numerous picture
writings on the rocks in the vicinity of Holbrook. Most interesting
of these depictions was a group of snake dancers clothed in archaic
costume.

MARSH-DARIEN EXPEDITION

Mr. R. O. Marsh continued during a part of 1924 his work of
exploration in hitherto almost unknown regions of the Isthmus of
Darien. A considerable party of scientific men accompanied the expe-
dition, among them Mr. John L. Baer, who was deputed to care for
the anthropological work on the part of the Smithsonian. The Expedi-
tion experienced a great misfortune in the sudden illness of Mr. Baer
while proceeding up the Chucunaque River. He was transported

valleys and mountain districts. The Choco have a local government,
live in large, well built community houses, and subsist on rice, bananas,
plantains, corn, and yucca. They are expert fishermen, diving into

The party proceeded up the Chucunaque River with great difficulty
owing to barriers of drift logs, at last reaching the Cunas Bravos,
who were regarded as hostile. The Cunas Bravos are agriculturists
and exhibit a lower degree of culture than the Cunas of the lower river.
The chief of the Cunas Bravos spoke good English, having as a
young man shipped at Colon on an English vessel and in 12 years
had sailed over half the world. It was at this point that John L. Baer
became sick,

Activities were next transferred to the San Blas Indians, who
inhabit a long stretch of the north coast of Panama. These Indians,
who number approximately 40,000, have always kept aloof from the
white man, realizing that contact with other races would work their
undoing. Amicable relations were established with them and many
interesting specimens of their arts and industries were collected for
the National Museum. The San Blas Indians have an advanced
social organization, with a ruler who could perhaps be properly classed
as a king. Through the San Blas, Mr. Marsh came in contact with
hundreds of “ white Indians’ whose presence in Panama has been
known for a long time, but who have not been examined by scientific
observers. Individuals brought by Mr. Marsh to the United States
have been carefully examined and tentatively stated, before field
studies go more fully into the matter, to present a form of albinism.
Mr. Marsh states that light brown Indians having one white parent
reproduce white, light brown, and dark brown children. The San Blas
segregate the white children at the age of puberty, and from such
information as was furnished it is estimated that one thousand
individuals exist in the San Blas region. Mr. Marsh states that the
San Blas Indians are capable of assimilating the essentials of modern
civilization, and believes that these Indians should be given the
chance to develop without contact with alien blood.

Indian laborers. The explorations of 1924 mark the fourth season
of the five-year Pueblo Bonito project, inaugurated in 1921 after a
thorough reconnoissance of the entire Chaco Canyon region.

During the years 1921-1923 the Expedition completed the excava-
tion of the eastern and northern portions of Pueblo Bonito. It is in
the former section of the ruin that those dwellings last constructed are
to be found ; in the northern section are slightly earlier houses erected
above the razed walls of part of that original settlement which pre-
ceded and formed a nucleus for the great communal structure now
known as Pueblo Bonito. In 1924 the Expedition confined its principal
activities to the western half of the ruin where rooms of both early
and late construction exist. From these much new data were obtained.

As one result of the past season’s explorations, it is now reasonably
certain that no more than two major periods of occupancy are present
in the ruins of Pueblo Bonito. These were contemporaneous through-
out many successive generations and yet one was pioneer to the other.
During the second period, three separate types of masonry were
evolved. The culture of the original Bonitians appears to have been
quite distinct ; the masonry of their dwellings, the form and furniture
of their ceremonial rooms and perhaps even their daily life differed
from that of their later associates.

In that portion of the pueblo recently excavated are to be seen
rectangular dwellings whose walls were constructed both with hard,
laminate sandstone and dressed blocks of similar but more friable
material. These rooms adjoin and even encompass earlier habitations
in which broad, thin slabs of sandstone were utilized with abundant
quantities of adobe mud as the characteristic building material. The
earlier dwellings were built on a much lower level of occupancy ; the
later structures are especially noteworthy for the perfection and
symmetry of their masonry, the trueness of their corners and the
uniform regularity of their dimensions. Kivas associated with these
latter dwellings are, for the most part, of smaller diameter than those
observed elsewhere in the ancient village.

Among the older habitations excavated last season were four rooms
which had been utilized as burial chambers. A majority of the 71
bodies interred here had been placed upon burial mats and were
accompanied by mortuary offerings, including basketry and earthen-
ware vessels. Such personal ornaments as were worn by the deceased
at the moment of death were not removed. Whether the burials
represent the first or second period of occupancy is a question still
undetermined. But a curious fact in connection with these interments

is that most of them were disturbed during prehistoric times. It is
quite apparent that enemy peoples had entered the rooms and ruth-
lessly disarranged the bodies, perhaps in search of turquoise and other
treasures highly prized by primitive peoples of the Southwest. With
the cultural objects recovered by the Expedition are many jewels of
such exquisite beauty and artistic merit as to have proven entirely
irresistible to those aborigines not related to the former inhabitants
of Pueblo Bonito.

In the large number of earthenware vessels collected from these
four burial chambers and elsewhere two outstanding types of orna-
mentation appear. Although these types were frequently found
directly associated with each other, one is thought to belong essentially
to the original Bonitians while the other is believed more characteristic
of their neighbors of the later period. Chronologic studies made in
the two principal refuse mounds and about the outer wall of the
pueblo illustrate a gradual development of local pottery technique
throughout the entire period during which Pueblo Bonito was inhab-
ited. But a certain perplexity still obtains in the evidence relating to
this ceramic material. This doubt is due mainly to the fact that the
later arrivals were obviously the first to abandon the village and that
all serviceable utensils they left behind were subsequently salvaged
by those families which still clung to their ancestral home, the older
or pioneer section of Pueblo Bonito.

Several of the baskets recovered from the four burial rooms are
of types rarely, if ever before, recovered from prehistoric ruins other
than cliff-dwellings. Shallow, elongated trays of unusually fine weave
and deep, cylindrical baskets’ of rather coarser fabric are included
in the collection. In addition, there were obtained bifurcated baskets
such as have been found heretofore only in cave villages of north-
eastern Arizona and southeastern Utah. Three of the earthenware
vessels in the season’s collection simulate the general form of these
two-legged affairs of unknown import.

The Expedition of 1923 uncovered a puzzling network of founda-
tion walls on the outer northeast side of the great ruin. This series
was still further exposed during the past summer and it is expected
that the remaining portion will be brought to light in 1925, the final
year of the Pueblo Bonito project. The fact that these interlacing
walls lie buried under many feet of blown sand makes their exposure
a slow and arduous task. The studies already pursued in this area
suggest that these foundations were prepared, but never utilized,
for a contemplated and sizable addition to the village.

Among the many interesting discoveries made in 1924 is one which
affords some conception of the community pride which prevailed
during the heyday of Pueblo Bonito. The two principal refuse
mounds, where floor sweepings and other trash was deposited, were
each surrounded by stone walls. These were increased in height as the
mounds grew in elevation. Their obvious purpose was to prevent
scattering of ashes and light debris before the tireless canyon winds.
Two flights of stone steps were later constructed over the northern
wall of the east mound to facilitate access to its summit.

Other walls whose intended function remains unsolved were also
exposed during the summer. One of these, at no point more than
two feet high, extends in a northeasterly direction a distance of 500
feet from the outer southeast corner of the ruin.

Explorations in Pueblo Bonito were brought practically to com-
pletion by the 1924 Expedition. There remain for next year additional
chronologic studies and minor excavations, the fundamental purpose
of which will be to explain certain still doubtful matters of prime
importance. It is already evident that Pueblo Bonito was occupied
throughout a much longer period than was originally suspected.
Amalgamation of the two distinct groups that comprised its later
population resulted in a prehistoric village whose fame reached the
remotest corner of the Southwest. During the period of its greatest
affluence, Pueblo Bonito was undoubtedly a center at which repre-
sentatives of many unrelated tribes met for barter and trade. Evidence
has been obtained that the Bonitians engaged in commerce with primi-
tive peoples of the Pacific Coast and even so far distant as the valley
of Mexico ; indeed, there seems to be no cultural area in the Southwest
of comparable antiquity whose members were not attracted to Pueblo
Bonito. The current explorations of the National Geographic Society,
therefore, have a direct bearing upon the distribution of ancient
Pueblo peoples. With a considerable portion of its unwritten history
recorded ; with the years of its construction determined with reason-
able accuracy—a former hope that seems more and more within the
realm of possibility—Pueblo Bonito is destined to become a yard-
stick, so to speak, by which the culture of other prehistoric south-
western ruins may be gauged. As Pueblo Bonito was the most influ-
ential village yet discovered in the Pueblo area of pre-Columbian
times so is it today the most important ruin in that area—a ruin
which holds the key to many secrets that have long puzzled American
archeologists.
Q2 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. -77

PREHISTORIC ABORIGINAL CULTURE OF THE GULF STATES

Of the aboriginal culture areas within the boundaries of what is
now the United States, there are two which, although related, are
widely diverse. One of these lies in the four States, Colorado, Utah,
New Mexico, and Arizona, the other formerly extended over portions
of the Gulf States, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
or practically the Lower Mississippi Valley, Georgia, and Florida.
In both these areas there was an aboriginal culture prehistoric and
thoroughly Indian, which was on the decline when the region was
first visited by white men. Each area was inhabited by Indians speak-
ing different languages or dialects, but who had cranial similarities,
like means of obtaining a food supply, related social customs, rites,
and mythology. Ethnologists may have different opinions as to which
culture reached the higher development, but they generally agree
that we need more accurate knowledge of both to form a final judg-
ment of their character.

The amount of scientific research that has been devoted to these
two culture areas is quite unequal. The pueblo field has attracted so
many investigators that they far outnumber those studying all other
culture areas in the United States. Notwithstanding the fact that
the archeology of the Gulf States is as attractive as that of the
Pueblos, it has few votaries, possibly because the Pueblo culture has
survived less changed into modern times. The prehistoric culture of
the Gulf States may be termed Muskhogean, from the dominant
tribe of the Creek confederacy, though it is not limited to people speak-
ing any one language.

The southwest area has long been a favorite subject of study for
members of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The Smithsonian
was not only a pioneer worker in this area, but also for many years
the sole investigator. Of late, however, this field has attracted many
field workers and is now in good hands, producing annually many
discoveries.

The southeastern area, although not wholly neglected since the
epoch making work of Clarence B. Moore, is now making strong
appeals for archeological investigation which have attracted members
of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The Chief has inaugurated
a new plan of work in this area, the first step being a determination
of the aboriginal culture of Florida and an adequate diagnosis of its
character and horizon. On the south and east, boundaries of the
Muskhogean culture are limited by the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic Ocean; its extension northward and westward is more
difficult to discover.

WORK IN FLORIDA

Archeological work in Florida was begun at St. Petersburg, Tampa
Bay, in the winter of 1923-1924. It was discovered that the prehistoric

Fic, 105.—View of a road on Weeden Island, St. Petersburg, Florida, showing

inhabitants of the Everglade region and the Florida Keys showed
scant evidences of a relationship to the Muskhogean culture, but
from Tampa Bay north into the other Gulf States, archeological data
supported linguistic evidences of Muskhogean influences.

7
94 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOU 7/7,

Following the above-mentioned plan, Weeden Mound, near Se
Petersburg, was excavated by the Chief, assisted by Mr. M. W.
Stirling, through the kindness of Mr. E. M. Elliott and the Boulevard
and Bay Land and Development Company. These investigations, pre-
liminary results of which were published last fall,’ reveal that the
culture of northern Florida was in prehistoric times different from
that of southern Florida.

The character of the objects obtained from Weeden Mound, as
shown in the above-mentioned pamphlet, indicates that the former
inhabitants of this site were allied to the so-called Lower Creeks who
once lived on the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers in Georgia. These
were of the same race as the Upper Creeks, denizens of the Tallapoosa
and Coosa valleys in Alabama, and as the Creeks were the most
numerous representatives of Muskhogean culture they may be re-
garded as typical of it. The archeological relation is mainly deter-
mined by the designs on the pottery, which in the case of the ceramic
objects from the Lower Creeks collected on the Chattahoochee and
Flint, figured and described by Mr. Clarence B. Moore, and those
from Weeden Mound are practically identical. In both localities
pottery designs are outlined by pitted or perforated lines, which
designs and technique occur also on pottery found at Tarpon Springs,
Crystal Springs, and at various other localities northward on the
west and northwest coast of Florida.

There is a similarity in mortuary practices throughout the greater
part of the Muskhogean culture area which occurs also in the
Weeden Mound. The actual method of burying the dead among the
Upper Creeks, as shown by the Graves collection at Montgomery
where the skeletons were placed in urns (figs. 112, 113), is unlike that
at Weeden Island, where they were free or placed in baskets. Urn
burial has not been recorded among the Lower Creeks but a secondary
interment or burial of skeletons in urns after the flesh had been
removed has been found in the islands on the Georgian coast. Bunched
burials occur throughout the whole Muskhogean area. So far as
we at present know, urn burial (fig. 114) is a localized development
found in different localities in the Gulf States but the bunched sec-
ondary burial of skeletons is a general feature in this culture.

The cluster of mounds on Weeden Island near St. Petersburg is
easily distinguished and its site has been lately designated Narvaez
Park from the Spanish leader of the expedition in the sixteenth
century that ended so disastrously. On the largest mounds of this

1Smithsonian Misc., Coll., Vol. 76, No. 13, 1924.
NGO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 95

cluster formerly stood Mr. Weeden’s house, but earlier the Indians
used it as an eating place to which they brought their canoeloads of
shellfish, cooked the mollusks and ate the soft parts, throwing away
the shells. Mr. Weeden’s old home has now been torn down and a
pavilion erected on its site. Previously a trench was run into this
mound but it revealed little besides shells alternating with layers
of black sand, discolored by decomposed vegetable soil. A few frag-
ments of pottery rewarded excavation in this mound but it was singu-
larly poor in artifacts of any kind.

Fic. 106.—Flexed burial, lower layer, Weeden Island, Florida.

The conclusions arrived at by studies of this large mound were that,
while its top may have served as an observatory or even the site of a
building like a chief’s house, it was essentially a kitchen midden
composed of rejected shells or whatever human artifacts may have
been lost in it by the aborigines. Almost every village site in the
Gulf States culture area has a mound larger than the rest and dom-
inating it, which was used as the foundation of the houses of the
chief or of the temple in which, in some cases, the fire was kept con-
tinually burning. Such mounds were Cahokia in East St, Louis, Mo.,
96 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 77

and Etowah, near Cartersville, Georgia. This dominating mound is
here designated the Acropolis.

Dr. Fewkes made trial pits in various other mounds of the Weeden
cluster and among other elevations found a low mound of sand in
which grew a few trees and scanty plants but showed no considerable
number of shells. It gave promise of a much greater reward and to
it the main work was devoted through the winter and early spring
of 1923-24. It was found to be a burial mound concealing numerous
human skulls, much pottery, and other objects of various kinds. The
most striking specimens were secondary burials of human bones, of
which 440 bunches were found.

These remains followed the almost universal aboriginal burial
customs among people of the Gulf States. After death the bodies were
allowed to decay and the flesh removed from the skeleton by “ bone
pickers ” after which the large bones and crania, done up in bundles,
were in due time placed in heaps and covered with earth, forming
a mound over a dune of coral sand.

According to contemporary writers, one custom of the ancients in
preparing the “bundles”’’ for burial after flesh had been removed
was to paint the skulls with vermilion. Dr. Fewkes verified this
custom at Weeden Mound, for he found the paint, now in some
instances dry dust, and readily removed from the bones with a brush.
The skeletal material was in a very fragile condition and fell to
pieces almost at the least touch.

It was noticed that a cross section of the mound exposed by a
trench through it, revealed a stratification composed of two marked
layers of finest sand through which are darker narrow seams of
black or dark brown color. The difference between these layers is
mainly indicated not by the color but by the contained pottery. The
upper layer is capped by a thin superficial covering of sand which
represents the modern deposit. Below it is the thick upper stratum
in which were found specimens of decorated pottery, either in frag-
ments or whole pieces, the latter in one or two instances cached. Two
views of a fine bowl are shown in figure 108, a and b. The whole
pieces are invariably artificially pierced by an irregular opening in
the bottom by which the bowl or jar was “ killed,’ evidently to allow
the escape of the breath body or life of the bowl. In a lower layer,
the pottery is coarse, undecorated, and scattered. It contained also
a few implements and utensils made of shell. It would appear that
the lower layer was used as the burial place of the archaic Floridian

people and from its general facies Dr. Fewkes allies it with the lower
layer that has been recorded in Cuban and other West Indian Islands.

Only in rare instances is the pottery of the upper stratum painted,
but almost every fragment is decorated with designs whose outlines
consist mostly of rows of pits, in rare instances accompanied with
relief decorations (fig. 108). Little resemblance appears in the designs
on the decorated pottery from Weeden Island to those on the pottery
of the Tainan inhabitants of the West Indies, but the likeness of
utensils from the lower layers on these islands and on the peninsula
of Florida is striking.

Dr. Fewkes found no specimens of European provenience in the
Florida mound half excavated by him at St. Petersburg, which indi-
cates that the village sites were pre-Columbian. A food bowl of
coarse, undecorated black ware was found on top of the lower layer
and probably is a survival of the archaic population.

From the designs depicted on the pottery in the upper layer at
Weeden Mound and comparison with that described from mounds
on the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers of Georgia and other Gult
States, Dr. Fewkes regards this pottery as not only characteristic but
as belonging to the highest type of ceramics in the Muskhogean
culture area.

WORK IN ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE

When the Wilson dam over Tennessee River at Muscle Shoals,
northern Alabama, is finished, the back water of the river will
flood a considerable section of its banks, covering several prehistoric
mounds and permanently concealing them. In order to rescue a
typical collection from these mounds before their submergence, the
Bureau allotted to Mr, Gerard Fowke a small sum of money for the
excavation of a kitchen midden and sand mound at the mouth of
Town Creek, a few miles from Courtland. In the sand mound Mr.
Fowke found human burials and accompanying mortuary objects.
The most important discovery at this mound consisted of three rare
copper reel gorgets, only a few of which have thus far been found.

On his trip to Muscle Shoals to inspect the work, Dr. Fewkes
found several typical mounds higher up on the river banks which
would well repay excavation. The largest of these (fig. 110), which
is here called the Acropolis, was the foundation of a sun-fire temple.
It lies in full sight of the Florence-Sheffield road and has long been
a landmark, as it is probably one of the highest mounds in the Valley
of the Tennessee. The present owner of this mound is thoroughly

Dr. Fewkes visited the battlefield at Shiloh and inspected the
remains of an aboriginal village now indicated by mounds. The
beautiful pipe excavated years ago from one of these elevations he
regards as the finest art product of the old Muskhogean culture. Four
life size illustrations of this pipe, from Records of the Past, July, 1902,
represent a kneeling human figure, black in color, whereas the original
color is brown.

The shell mound at Town Creek yielded many specimens but they
indicate a lower cultural condition than the village cluster on the
Shiloh battlefield, as might be inferred from the character of the
food supply.

In November Dr. Fewkes made a trip to Montgomery, Alabama,
in order to locate prehistoric mounds and study the collections made
near that city. He also desired to familiarize himself with the ener-
getic work of the Alabama Anthropological Society. The visit was brief
but he enjoyed the privilege of inspecting several collections of an-
tiquities and was guided to several mounds by Mr. Peter A. Brannon,
President of the Society, and other members, to whom he owes many
thanks.

Montgomery is situated near the heart of the Upper Creek country
and the collections of aboriginal objects made in the neighborhood
of that city contain several unique Indian objects not yet described.
Among these may be mentioned the burial urns of the Graves collec-
tion. Figures 112-114, published by permission of Mr. Graves, show
a number of these bowls, vases, and jars used in urn burial. After
death the flesh was allowed to decay and, having been removed, the
bones were put in a deep vase and covered with a flat food bowl that
was ultimately inhumated. The cemetery where these urns occur was
situated in a corn field in which was a circular saucer like depression
called by the negroes an “ Indian talk house,” evidently an ancient
council house. An excavation of this subterranean room would
probably yield what is much needed, a knowledge of architectural
details as well as archeological treasures. While several of these urn
burial vessels are rude undecorated pottery, there are others whose
surface was incised with ornamental designs of a geometrical form.
As a rule this pottery is inferior to that found at Weeden Island or
on the Black Warrior River. Mr. Graves’ collection also contains
several unpublished shell disks decorated with finely incised natural-
istic designs which are characteristic of early Creek symbolism.

On his visit in Montgomery, Dr. Fewkes was enabled to make
several excursions to numerous prehistoric village sites. Among the

most interesting was to the site of old Tuskegee and Fort Toulouse
where William Weatherford surrendered to General Jackson at the
close of the Creek war. The Indian settlement, Tuskegee, was most
picturesquely situated at the junction of the Coosa and Tallapoosa
rivers, together forming the Alabama River. Several other mounds
situated near Montgomery were visited, including one at the ford
where it is claimed De Soto crossed the Tallapoosa.

Dr. Fewkes examined several Indian sites and mounds of size near
Nashville and Lebanon under guidance of Mr. P. E. Cox, State
Archeologist of Tennessee. The most instructive were large mounds
near which are stone walled graves that had never been opened. The
excavation of one of these is now being made by the Bureau under
supervision of the Chief. At Lebanon a rare form of bird-pipe made
of steatite shown in the accompanying figure (fig. 109) was purchased
for the Museum. The large mound at Lebanon is situated in a corn
field and surrounded by a low embankment of earth and accompany-
ing moat, indicating a fortification. The most remarkable object
seen on the visit to this mound is the stone idol shown in figure 116.
This idol was ploughed up a short distance from the base of the
mound, suggesting that the elevation was formerly a temple or house
of a chief, upon which it once stood.

In a determination of the Muskhogean culture area as fixed by the
archeologist, we find traces of it in South Carolina, somewhat modified
on account of the peripheral situation. Although little is known of
the prehistoric pottery of South Carolina, Dr. Fewkes has obtained a
photograph of a bowl (fig. 111) owned by Mr. Wm, J. Thackston, Jr.,
which is supposed to be ancient Catawba ware and shows Muskhogean
influence. Dr. Fewkes examined several fine bowls of this ware
decorated with figures of the sun and winged or plumed serpent, often
conventionalized into incised geometric designs. These clearly indicate
sun worship, a pronounced feature of the Muskhogean culture. The
design on this Catawba bowl suggests parts of a highly conven-
tionalized serpent.

A most instructive excursion near Montgomery was a visit to the
Pintlala Creek cemetery in Lowndes County, Alabama, where the
burial urns collection was found. These urns have been figured and
described by Mr. Graves in Arrow Points, Vol. 6, No. 8. Additional
figures of burial urns from islands off the Georgia coast and elsewhere
have been given by Mr. C. B. Moore who has treated the subject of
urn burials in a special article.

Although the visits of Dr. Fewkes to Tennessee and Alabama were
much limited in time they have called attention to one or two instruc-
tive problems which await new observations for solution. Urn burial
appears not to have been mentioned in the extended accounts of
mortuary customs found in early documentary and historical descrip-

tion of the Creeks. We know the bunched skeletons were placed in
baskets for the bone house and later removed and buried in mounds,
and may readily suppose the urn took the place of the basket, but are
we justified in this supposition? Furthermore, as urn burial is not
the common method of disposal of the dead, this exceptional custom
108 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 77

may have been used only for chiefs or priests. If so we have an
explanation of its occurrence around the council houses. A large
number of infants were buried in urns.

It seems evident that there were local differences in artifacts,
especially ceramic symbols, in different localities or areas dominated
by the Muskhogean culture which may be a parallelism with what
occurs in the pueblo region, but this means renewed field-work to
discover the ceramic facies of each area of population in the Gulf
States.

The relation of the Muskhogean and Pueblo areas calls for archeo-
logical work west of the Mississippi along the Red River where many
mounds have been reported. Until knowledge of the archeology of
this area is more exact, theories of the relationship of these two cul-
ture areas to each other and of both to Old Mexico are futile.

During the past year Dr. Fewkes has received from the State of
Washington two characteristic straight tube pipes of a variety which
is interesting in a comparative way in studying the large steatite pipe
collected by him at Lebanon, Tennessee. With the same collection
came also an engraved bone object of unknown use. These objects
are shown in figure 118.

REPAIR OF MUMMY CAVE TOWER IN THE CANYON DEL
MUERTO, ARIZONA

During the past year, Mr. Earl H. Morris, at the request of
the Chief of the Bureau, did some necessary repair work on the
famous Tower of the Mummy Cave House in the Canyon del
Muerto. This tower is approximately 30 feet high, and 11 feet 3
inches wide, and once contained three rooms. All woodwork on the
first ceiling has been torn out, only the haggled ends of a few of the
supports remaining embedded in the walls.

The cleanly peeled poles which supported the second ceiling are in
place, and the third ceiling—or roof—is intact, presumably because of
the difficulty which would have attended its removal.

Covering the supporting poles, there is a closely-laid layer of peeled
willows. Probably it is one of the most handsome ceilings remaining
in any ruin in the Southwest, its only rivals being the coverings of one
or two rooms in the north side of Pueblo Bonito.

For an unknown length of time the Tower has been in a dangerous
condition, due principally to its undermining by the elements. Origi-
nally there was a retaining wall rising from the very brink of the
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 109g

ledge in front which held in place the fill of loose rock and refuse
upon which the House of the Tower stands. Eventually all but the
eastern end of this wall collapsed—probably because of the insecure
foundation afforded by the abruptly sloping rock, and much of the
material behind it poured down over the cliff. As time went on, the
not infrequent winds which sweep past the cave with unbelievable

force whipped out the dust and smaller particles of rock until the
southwest corner of the Tower was undermined more than three feet
and the wall thence eastward almost to the opposite corner to a
lesser degree.
As the Tower stood in the fall of 1924, the east wall was firm and
secure, being bedded on the ledge to within 14 feet of its outer end.
8
110 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. Sg
The west wall had settled considerably, more toward the outer end
than near the cliff, and at the top the wall had leaned away from the
latter fully eight inches, The front wall had split away from the
west wall, and the entire southeast corner had fallen except for a
short distance at the very top. Evidently the upper half of this corner
had come down since Mindeleff made his report of the site (16th
Annual Report, Bur. Am. Ethn., p. 114).

As for the cracks in the west wall, they were noticeably wider in
November, 1924, than they were a year previous. The condition of
the unconsolidated mass beneath the front wall was such that the
removal of half a dozen shovelfuls of earth would have loosened the
large block just beyond its western end, the temporary wedging oi
which, alone, had prevented the entire collapse of the masonry. In
addition to the periodic action of the wind, each visitor who passed
from the eastern to the western part of the cave detached a portion of
the loose mass below the wall farther down the slope, and sent clods
and pebbles rattling over the cliff. Thus before many years it was
inevitable that the block would have been loosened, and the Tower
would have gone down to its destruction. Hence it was considered
that the first remedial effort should be centered upon providing <
secure foundation for the ancient masonry.

To this end Mr. Morris and his party devoted November 11 to
14, inclusive. The force consisted of three white men and six
Indians, with a seventh on the last day. There was no difficulty in
obtaining stone, as plenty of it from fallen walls was strewn down the
slope at the west end of the eastern section of the cave. Satisfactory
adobe was found only in the stream bed several hundred yards away.
Owing to the arduous climb, the Indians were scarcely able to provide
enough material to keep the masons busy. During the five days, but-
tresses were built beneath and enclosing the large blocks under the
west end of the Tower, and under the undermined portion of the
latter, continuing back to the limit of undermining, and extending
well forward of the masonry. At the junction of the two, wedges
were driven to knit the new work firmly to the old. From the east
end of the buttress a retaining wall was built to connect with the
remnant of the old one on the brink of the ledge, and the space
behind it was filled, thus providing a platform instead of the former
steep slope at the southeast corner of the Tower.

The total length of walls built was 26}feet, and their average height
was 44 feet. The thickness of the buttresses varied with the space

maximum thickness of 5 feet at the point where the wall was most
deeply undermined. In bedding the masonry, the ledge was swept
free from dust, and where it sloped abruptly it was chipped away
to provide a secure attachment of wall to cliff.

It was Mr. Morris’ original idea to use cement instead of adobe
for mortar. However, it was found possible to obtain the same quality
of clay used by the original builders, which is as hard as brick when
dry, and it was decided to use this material, thus avoiding the expense
of freighting cement from Gallup, New Mexico, 100 miles distant.

Although the foundation placed beneath the Tower should remove
all danger from settling, other protective measures would be highly
desirable. The front wall was not perpendicular when constructed.
Up to the level of the second ceiling it sloped slightly outward, and
thence upward leaned toward the cliff. Since it has parted from
both side walls. the maximum strain falls at the point of greatest
protuberance. Gravity, augmented by the tendency of high winds
to produce a swaying motion, might cause the wall to buckle at the
point of greatest stress and to topple outward. Rods with turnbuckles,
anchored in the cliff with expansion belts and passing through plates
on the outer side of the masonry, would prevent failure of this nature.
It was hoped that these could be installed within the limits of the
amount expended for protection in 1924, but this was not possible.
In addition to the placing of the rods, the Tower should be further
strengthened by the rebuilding of the southeast corner and its careful
bonding to both the front and east walls. It is to be hoped that pro-
vision for this work can be made in the near future; for the Tower,
which is one of the finest gems of aboriginal architecture in the
entire Southwest, thus treated, would be preserved beyond doubt
or question for centuries to come.

Besides the partial repair of the Tower, a breach was filled farther
along the wall which continues westward therefrom, and a foundation
was built beneath the high front wall of a room near the western end
of the east cave.

extensive study of the ethnology and language of this little known
tribe, said to number some 50,000 souls.

The Tule Indians, also known as Cunas, Comogres, and San
Blasefios, live along the Caribbean coast of Panama from Murru
(San Blas Point) to Armila (Port Obaldia), a distance of 120 miles.
They still have their own tribal government from Kwibgandi to
Cacardia, a strip of coast 30 miles in length. They formerly held
the coast from the region of Eskarban (Port Escribanos), 15 miles
west of San Blas Point, to include the delta region of the Rio Atrato,
a strip of coast 220 miles long. The tribe also holds the San Blas
range, which parallels the coast at a distance varying from 5 to 20
miles, from San Blas Point to the region about Tacarcuna Mountain,
including portions of the Pacific slope of the range. The linguistically
related Coiba held the isthmus to the west, including Colon and
Panama. The linguistic stock to the south was the Choco Indians,
who now inhabit much of the Savana, Chucunaque and Tuira river
drainages.

The tribe, according to the informants, is divided into six sections
as shown on the accompanying map (fig. 122.) The Negroid popula-
tion is closing in on the Indians and will soon work their extinction.

The Tule language has, with the Choco, the distinction of being
the most southerly Indian language of North America, and with the
Huaimi of Panama that of extending from the Atlantic to the
Pacific coast.

The informants are: (1) James Perry, Alice Perry and Margarita
Campos from Yantuppu (A of map), a small island in front of
Nargana, 22 miles east of San Blas Point; (2) Niga (Felipe) from
Tigandikki island (B of map), 31 miles east of San Blas Point; (3)
Igwa Nigdibippi, who is chief over 20 islands, and Olo Piniginya
from Agligandi island (C of map), 64 miles east of San Blas Point ;
(4) Alfred Robinson and Tcippu from Ustuppu island (D of map),
71 miles east of San Blas Point. Alfred’s father is Nele, chief of
the island.

Three of the party, Margarita, Olo and Tcippu, are examples of
Ibegwa or White Indians, of whom Wafer writes in 1699: “ There
is one complexion so singular among a sort of people of this country,
that I never saw or heard of any like them in any part of the world.
They are white and there are of them of both sexes. Their skins
are not of such a white as those of fair people among Europeans,
but ’tis of a milk white, lighter than the color of any Europeans, and
much like that of a white horse. For there is this further remarkable
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 I15

in them, that their bodies are beset all over with a fine short milkwhite
down, which adds to the whiteness of their skins. They are not a
distinct race by themselves but now and then one is bred of the
coppercolored father and mother.’ The little island of Ustuppu has
ten of these White Indians on it.

The Tule say that their ancestors used to live around the base of
Tacarcuna Mountain, west of the mouth of the Rio Atrato, the
highest peak in their territory, and that they spread from there up
the San Blas range and coast. It was at that mountain that God,
Olokkuppilele, created the Indians.

The language exceeds in softness and beauty the melodious Cas-
tilian. It has no sounds that do not ocur in English. Its sounds are
only 17 in number,aeiougydcslrnbmwy. These occur
single or double, as in Finnish, thus securing the required number
of syllables for the formation of words; e. g., kwalu, potato, but
kwallu, grease.

The Indians know hundreds of place-names of the coast and moun-
tains. Chief Igwa has prepared a large map showing these places.

The large collection presented by Mr. Marsh to the National Mu-
seum has afforded unusual opportunity for investigation of material
culture. The sociology and religion of the Indians have formed
fruitful fields of study. To assist the work the Dictaphone Corpora-
tion has installed machines for recording texts and songs.

The vocabulary comprises names of places, persons, parts of the
body, sociological terms and other data. Dictaphone records of ex-
tended discourse have been made which will serve as the basis for
further study of the language.

In 1914 Mr. Harrington made a six weeks study of this language
at the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, California, the informant
being a Tule boy who was brought from Panama Harbor to San Pedro
on a private yacht. This work was conducted through the kind interest
of Dr. Hector Alliot. then director of the museum.

STUDY OF THE TULE INDIAN MUSIC

A remarkable opportunity for the study of primitive music was
afforded by the presence in Washington of a group of Tule Indians
from the Province of Colon, in Panama. This study was made by
Miss Frances Densmore. The Indians were brought to the United
States by Mr. R. O. Marsh and became known as “ white Indians ”’
because of the fair skin of certain individuals. A frequent occurrence
116 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOI i

of fair-skinned individuals in this tribe was noted by Wafer, who
wrote concerning them in 1699. It is not unusual for parents of
normal Indian coloring to have children with skin of a peculiar milky
whiteness, blue eyes and pale yellow hair, the skin, in many instances,
showing irregular blotches of light brown. A family may contain
both dark and fair children. The group brought by Mr. Marsh com-
prised five adults, all of whom were dark in color, and three children
who were fair. The study of their music was carried on entirely with
the adult members of the group during November and December,
1924, and was made possible by the courtesy of Mr. Marsh.

VOCAL MUSIC

Among the Tule Indians brought to the United States was a chief
named Igwa Nigdibippi who had made a special study of the tribal
songs. If he were a member of our own race he would be termed a
man of practical intelligence and artistic culture. The head chief of
the Tule is an old man, and on his death Igwa may be elected as his
successor. In view of this possibility Igwa is cultivating his knowl-
edge of the geography of the region with its irregular coast line and
hundreds of islands and “keys.” He draws maps which show the
location of the villages, indicating the approximate number of inhabi-
tants in each. His care and ability in this work added weight to his
statements concerning the music of his people, who do not adopt any
songs from neighboring tribes but maintain their own musical cus-
toms. Associated with him in giving information were James Perry
and his wife, Alice Perry, and Alfred Robinson who acted as inter-
preter. These three did not give the Indian names by which they
are known at home, and the names here presented have been recently
acquired. The recording of the songs was done entirely by the chief,
a dictaphone being used for that purpose.

The singing tone used by the Tule chief was somewhat different
from that used by the Indians of North America. It was even more
artificial, with a “ pinched,” forced quality not particularly pleasing
to the ear and impossible to describe in an accurate manner. The
Tule songs are without instrumental accompaniment in our use of
that term. The flute and rattle are sometimes played while the people
sing and dance, and the singers sometimes clap their hands, but the
flute and rattle do not seem to have either a melodic or a rhythmic
relation to the song. No form of accompaniment was desired when
the songs were being recorded and it was said that the voice was
entirely alone in the “ songs with stories.” The flute was played dur-
NO, 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 117

ing the prolonged tones of the wedding music which occurred at
regular intervals.

In this, as in all Indian tribes, it was impossible to obtain a verbal
description of the music. It was necessary to record songs, study
the records, and question the people concerning them. The first song
recorded was about seven minutes in duration. When it was finished
the chief was asked to explain the words. These words were highly
poetic and contained an entire narrative, working up to a climax and

ending in a conclusive manner. The song related that a group of
young girls walked among the bright flowers, a young man appeared,
and later was shot by a jealous rival. Another song was requested
and the chief sang of a race between several canoes (dugouts)
equipped with sails. In this song a storm arose, followed by a calm
and a favoring breeze, the song ending with the wedding of the
captain who won the race, while the sailors danced at the wedding.
From these examples it was evident that the words of Tule songs
afforded as much pleasure as the melody.

The chief was asked whether his people used music 1n the treatment
of the sick, and he responded with a song for the cure of headache,
containing the following words:

I bring sweet-smelling flowers and put them in water,

I dip a cloth in the water and put it around your head,

Then I bring a comb, part your hair smoothly and make it pretty.
Everyone comes to see ‘you get better,

And [| tell you that you will never be cold again.

Go to sleep and dream of many animals, mountain-lions and sea-lions,
You will talk with them and understand what they say,

When you wake you will be a doctor, like me.

“received his songs in dreams,” and sang

It was said that a doctor
when preparing his most difficult remedies. He did not shake a rattle,
nor make any commotion when treating a sick person, as is frequently
done by the Indians of North America. The chief expressed the
opinion this would increase the illness of the patient.

Certain songs were sung after the death of a man, and in these
songs the man’s spirit was directed on its way to a “ happy place.”
Such a song was recorded and may be summarized as follows; in
this portion of the song the sick man speaks to his wife.

The fever returns. I drink the medicine and throw it on my body.

The fever grows worse. I am going to die.

My breath grows difficult, my face is pale,

The medicine does not help me. I am going’ to die.

Talk to my two children about me, after I am gone.

I leave the cocoanut farm for my children.

After I die you will go to the cocoanut farm and take the children with you,

There you will think of me.

If people go to our cocoanut farm and cut the trees

You must track them and find who did it.

I am leaving the plantain farm.

There will be plenty of property for the children.

I leave the small fruits, the mangoes, the bananas and other fruits,

Think of me when you gather them.

The song then mentions his ski!l in hunting and fishing, enumerat-
ing the results as he had named the fruits on his farms. He tells his
wife to marry again in a short time, then dies, and the remainder
of the song concerns the directing of his spirit on its way.

The principal social event of the Tule is a wedding, to which the
people come from all the villages. They dance and sing for several
days, according to the wealth of the bride’s father who provides the
entertainment. The writer first obtained a full and detailed account
of the wedding customs, and then asked for a wedding song. When
this had been recorded she asked for a translation of the words.
120 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL 77,

The reply was: “ He sang just what we told you . He sang how the
father gets the presents ready, the chief tells the people, the chief
musician makes a new flute to play at the wedding, and everybody
sings and dances just like we told you. He sings that in the song.”

The custom of singing to secure success in games is common among
the North American Indians but absent in the Tule. Descriptions
of five games were obtained but it was said that games were played
only by young boys. The Tule are a hard-working people, living on
the islands, or keys, and cultivating ground on the main land, going
thither in the early morning and returning at night. A man’s wealth
depends on his efforts to push back the jungle and keep it back, thus
enabling trees to grow from which he can sell the fruit.

The test of a song, as recorded among the North American Indians,
has been a comparison between records made at intervals by the
same or other individuals. In accordance with that method of work
the writer asked for a repetition of the song concerning the canoe
race, after a period of a few days. On comparing the two renditions
of the song there was found to be only a general resemblance in the
melodies. It may be recalled that, among the North American
Indians, the repetitions of a song by the same or another individual
often are absolutely exact, instances having been noted in which
renditions by one person at intervals of several months were identical
even in pitch and tempo.

Tule songs are a form of primitive music that, it is believed, has
not hitherto been described. Vocal proficiency, among the Tule, con-
sists in improvising melodies instead of repeating them with exact-
ness, yet songs are “ learned,’ and each song recorded has a distinc-
tive character. For instance, the song for relief of headache is a
soothing melody, and a song concerning eight articles has a recurrent
phrase when each, in turn, is mentioned. The general character of
the songs is gentle and pleasing, They have a compass of three to
six tones, though the melody is usually within a compass of five tones.
Nine songs have been transcribed, either wholly or in part. They con-
tain measures of two, three, five or seven beats, occurring in irregular
order and probably determined by the accented syllables of the
words. The songs bear no resemblance to chants but consist of
short melodic phrases of equal length, each concluding with a pro-
longed tone. The substance of the words is established but it seems
probable that the identical words are not repeated. This would be
exceedingly difficult in songs of such length, and, if done, would
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 i210

tend to create a rhythmic pattern in the melody, causing it also to be
repeated with exactness.

The chief said that he began the study of songs when he was ten
years old. The first song he learned was the first he recorded for
the writer. He gave the name of the man who taught him, saying
it took him a long time to learn that first song. Seven years later,
this man having gone away, he went to another from whom he
learned about 30 songs. First he learned miscellaneous songs, and
later learned those sung when preparing medicines and treating the
sick, though he is not a doctor. Recognized standards of music were
further shown by the statement that certain persons were “ good
singers ” while others “could not sing.”

INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

No drum is used by the Tule, neither do they pound upon a pole
or other object. In this respect they are unique among primitive people.
A neighboring tribe uses a tall wooden drum with a hide stretched
across one end, but the Tule have never adopted this instrument. The
statement concerning the absence of a drum was confirmed by Major
H. B. Johnson, formerly a Lieutenant of the Black Watch, B. E. F.,
whose acquaintance with these people extends over three years. Major
Johnson went to Panama with a British expedition in 1921 and became
especially interested in the Tule. He was also a member of the Marsh
Expedition in 1924.

The musical instruments used by the Tule are the conch-shell
trumpet, bone whistle, pan-pipes, flute and gourd rattle. The first
named is made by piercing a mouth-hole in the tip of the shell. The
only variety used in this manner is the Casis cameo Stm. (fig. 123).
This instrument, with its far reaching tone, appears to have been used
only as a signal.

Whistles are made of the wing-bone of the pelican and king buz-
zard. They have four finger-holes and are decorated with lines burned
with a hot iron (figs. 124, 125). These, as well as the other instru-
ments illustrated, are in the Marsh Collection at the U. S. National
Museum.

The pan-pipes are made of a different, smaller reed than the flutes.
A set consists of two parts, each of which has three or four reeds
bound together with a cord, and the two parts are connected by a cord
nine or more inches long. In the two sets under observation the
shortest reed is 44 inches, and the longest 144 inches, in length. It
was said that pan-pipes in the native villages frequently contain reeds

usually played together (fig. 126), one player sounding one tone and

the other the next tone, alternating in this manner throughout the

performance, and improvising the melody. Only one of the Indians
present in Washington was an expert player on this instrument. In
order to show the full capacity of the pan-pipes he played alone, giving
a performance marked by a rapid-succession of high and low tones

skill and variety when playing the alternating-tone melodies above
described.

The Tule flute is of a type which, it is believed, has not been
observed elsewhere. It has two finger-holes but no “ whistle opening ”

of the mouth. For this reason the term “ mouth flute ” seems appli-
cable to it (fig. 127). The specimen under observation is 24% inches
long and the finger-holes are respectively 5 and 6 inches from the
lower end. The pith is removed from the reed and the opening
NO. 2 SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1924 127

flushed with water to remove all shreds, after which the holes are
burned with a heated iron and shaped with a sharp knife. The imple-
ment used in removing the pith is the stiff quill of a tail feather of
the wild turkey.

The player usually shakes a gourd rattle with his right hand, finger-
ing the flute with his left hand. The music at weddings is provided
chiefly by two flute players, each with a gourd rattle, one being the
Chief Musician who is accorded great honor, while the other is his
assistant. The melodies played on the flute were simple and pleasing.
Dictaphone records of the music of the flute and pan-pipes were made
and transcribed in musical notation. The former intrument produced
the tones of the minor triad on E flat, and the latter had a compass
of seven tones. In one instance the melody played on the pan-pipe was
based on G flat, and in another it was based on G.

The gourd rattle of the Tule is of the usual type, a round gourd
being pierced by a stick which forms the handle, but differs from the
rattle of North American tribes in that the gourd is often fastened
to the handle by a cord that passes through it (fig. 128). Two types
of gourd rattle are in use, one by the men and the other by the women.
The former, used in connection with the flute, is not large in size but
contains rather heavy pebbles. The latter is of two sorts, one being
used by the women when dancing and the other “to put the babies
to sleep.” Information concerning these rattles was given by Alice
Perry (fig. 129). The woman’s dancing rattle contains many small
pebbles, one being shown as the large, decorated rattle in the accom-
panying illustration. The second named is a smaller rattle (in the
illustration) and contains numerous small pebbles and one rather
large pebble. When this rattle is shaken the first resultant sound is
that of the small pebbles, this is followed by the rolling of the larger
stone which, continued steadily, has a peculiarly soothing effect. The
Tule, like other tribes, have songs which are sung by mothers to put
the children to sleep, but this is the first instance known to the writer
in which Indians use instrumental music for this purpose.

The native dress of the women, with a glimpse of native environ-
ment, is shown in figure 130, a picture taken ten or more years ago.
Attention is directed to the heavy necklaces of silver coins and the
armlets and anklets of beads. The cotton tunics are decorated with
applique designs of material in a contrasting color, the work being
done with neatness.

RESEARCHES ON THE BURTON MOUND AND ON THE
KIOWA INDIANS

The beginning of the year found Mr. John P. Harrington, ethnolo-
gist, engaged in the excavation of the principal village of the Santa
Barbara Indians, known to them as Syujtun, to the early Spaniards
as El Puerto de Santa Barbara, and in more modern times as the
Burton Mound. The great mound which marks the site is situated on
the Santa Barbara waterfront, a block west of the principal wharf,
on property now belonging to Mr. Ole Hanson and to Mr. Charles
Frederick Eaton. The old village site has always been the most
prominent feature of the Santa Barbara beach, and is most famous in
Santa Barbara Indian and Spanish history, but had never been
excavated to any extent previous to the present work.

The great village of Syujtun was mentioned four times in the
Cabrillo account of 1542. Father Crespi writing in 1769 mentions its
population as comprising 500 souls. With the establishment of the
Santa Barbara Mission in 1782 the inhabitants were removed to the
adobe cuarteles provided for them at the mission. The mound became
the ‘beach ranch” of the Franciscans, later the site of the ranch
house of Joseph Chapman, and more recently the property of Lewis
T. Burton. In 1901 Mr. Milo M. Potter built a large hotel on the
mound. In 1921 the hotel, which had been purchased by the Am-
bassador Hotel Corporation, burnt, thus releasing the site again
for scientific study. Through the kind offices of Mr. George G. Heye,
director of the Museum of the American Indian, money was raised
for excavation of the mound by joint arrangement with the Bureau
of American Ethnology.

The results of the excavation of the Indian town of Santa Barbara
proved rich and interesting beyond expectation. The collection, which
comprises more than seven thousand specimens, includes many large
and showy pieces, such as steatite ollas, mortars and metates. Some
of the graves were lined with slabs trimmed from the bones of whales.
Quantities of the mother-of-pearl pendants and ornaments of the
Indians were obtained, as well as shell beads of many types. The
bodies were mostly in crouched position with the head to the north.
In addition to the cemetery, many old wigwam sites were explored
and the outline of the whole settlement slowly and laboriously traced.
In the reef rock or coquina layer of the lower levels of the mound
were found embedded two skeletons which have been reported upon
by Dr. Bruno Oetteking, Physical Anthropologist of the Museum of

the American Indian, and on which further studies are now in prog-

tinuously for a long period, and the mound forms one of the best
monuments for the study of a stable Indian culture. Associated with
Mr. Harrington in this work are Professor D. B. Rogers, formerly
of the University of Kansas, and Mr. G. W. Bayley.

At the beginning of February Mr. Harrington returned to Washing-
ton, D. C. On April 15 opportunity was afforded for further study
of the Kiowa tribe by the coming to Washington of Eimha’a (Delos

Old hunting and fighting stories were also obtained, including a
long account of a raid in Mexico.

ETHNOLOGICAL RESEARCHES AMONG THE FOX INDIANS, IOWA

Dr. Michelson left Washington towards the close of May and pro-
ceeded to Tama, Iowa, to renew his researches among the Fox (Mesk-
wakie) Indians. He devoted especial attention to the various gens
festivals, for example, the White Wolf Dance of the War Gens.
Some texts on a number of sacred packs were translated. A good deal
of general ethnology was obtained in both syllabary texts and transla-
tions. Some of this included the regulations of various gentes and
societies. Additional information on the White Buffalo Dance and
mortuary customs and beliefs was secured in time to be incorporated
in the goth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology
(now in galley-proof). In his spare time Dr. Michelson gathered
quite a little Winnebago and Potawatomi ethnological data from
the small group of each of these tribes which habitually stays at
Tama with the Fox. The data on the first largely corroborates that
given by Dr. Radin in the 37th Annual Report of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, and in some instances supplements it. The data
on the Potawatomi is important as showing that among this tribe
there are close correspondents to the Fox gens festivals. Towards
the close of June Dr. Michelson returned to Washington.

A brief explanation of some of the ethnological data in the pre-
ceeding paragraph may not be inappropriate. The Foxes are organized
in a number of exogamic totemic groups. These groups are named
after animals for the most part. e. g., Bear, Wolf, Eagle. Male

members of these groups had a special hair-cut, appropriate only to
their own groups. Personal names showed to which group the
owner belonged; however, occasionally a person might be named

by another than his or her father ; in this case the person would have
a personal name appropriate to the gens of the namer, but would
belong to the gens of his or her father unless it had been stipulated
at the time that the person should belong to the gens of the namer.

These various gentes owned one or more sacred packs (not to be
confused with individual personal packs) connected with an appropri-
ate ritual and dance; also they had special songs to be sung the night

preceding the burial of the dead, and one or two special features in
burial customs. At least two possessed definite paints appropriate to
themselves (Bear gens, green paint; War gens, red paint). Some of
these gentes had subdivisions, and in such cases one of the sub-
136 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL 7,

divisions ranked higher than the other or others. Thus the Bear gens
is composed of the Black Bears and Yellow (Brown) Bears; the
tribal chieftainship was in the Black Bear division of Bear gens. This
is why some Fox Indians objected to Pushitoniqua (the last chief
recognized by the federal government), because he was of the wrong
division of the Bear gens. The sacred packs were used especially in
war. With appropriate songs and rituals one could become invisible ;
the bullets of the foe would not hit their mark; wide rivers would
become narrow so one could retreat if hard pressed by the foe; etc.
The packs are supposed to be acquired by fasting in the wilderness
when various manitous would take pity on those fasting and bestow

blessings.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD-WORK OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION IN 1925

INTRODUCTION

The functions of the Smithsonian Institution as stipulated by the
will of the founder, James Smithson, are “ the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” In its endeavor to increase the sum of
human knowledge, the Institution conducts researches and explora-
tions, the latter particularly in regions of the earth which have not
yet been thoroughly investigated. As the founder’s will did not
discriminate in favor of any particular branch of science, the Institu-
tion endeavors to be partial to none, and its activities have covered
geology, biology, and anthropology, with all of their various subdi-
visions ; astrophysics, aeronautics, physics, and chemistry. The pres-
ent pamphlet is intended to present in‘ brief form, illustrated, the
purpose and results of the expeditions in the field during 1925.
The very limited income of the Institution from its private endow-
ment does not permit of a comprehensive, coordinated program of
exploration, and it therefore takes whatever opportunity offers to
cooperate with other agencies in sending out field expeditions. The
accounts, although written in the third person, are prepared for the
most part by the explorers themselves, and the pictures are taken by
them in the field.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

In continuation of geological field-work in the Canadian Rockies,
Secretary Charles D. Walcott left Lake Louise Station, Alberta, on
the Canadian Pacific Railway on July 9 with a camp outfit and pack
horses. The field season was even more unfavorable than that of
1924. Smoke from extensive forest fires west and north of the
mountain area north and east of Lake Louise interfered with
photography during July and the first half of August. An eddy,
or dead area in the atmosphere, hung over the mountains for several
weeks, and then, after a severe gale of several days’ duration, snow
began falling on August 21, blanketing the canyon valleys with a
depth of from 12 to 16 inches (fig. 9) and the mountain slopes with

a gradually increasing depth up to 30 inches on the passes just above

Snow squalls followed nearly every afternoon until August 30,
when camp was moved from between Fossil and Skoki Mountains
to below the pass at the head of Johnston Creek Canyon. Snow came
again on September 5, 9, and 18. Secretary and Mrs. Walcott re-
turned to Lake Louise Station, packed their collections and left for
Washington on September 21, which was the most beautiful day of

the season. Only eight camps were made while on the trail. It was
more through good fortune than favorable conditions that a fine
series of fossils from critical horizons in the great lower Paleozoic
section north of Bow Valley was discovered and collected. These
fossils increase our knowledge of the history and life of the Cor-
dilleran Sea of this time and afford the data for comparison with life
and conditions in the Appalachian Trough and the great upper
Mississippi embayment of Upper Cambrian time.

In the interval between the snow storms of September 5 and 9
several new fossil zones were found in the Lower Ordovician rocks

Upper Cambrian west of Badger Pass. The latter find enabled
Dr. Walcott to identify the Arctomys formation of the Glacier Lake
section and to clear up the uncertainty as to the position of the strata
hitherto referred to the lower portion of the Bosworth formation.

well as a mule deer, which, when shot, rushed down the Canyon side
and broke its fine horns in landing upon a mass of broken rock.

This year probably completes the field-work in the Canadian
Rockies. A few of the problems encountered have been cleared up
in the past nine years, but many remain to be studied by young, well-
trained men with strong hearts, vigorous muscles, and the high pur-
pose of the research student seeking to discover the truth regarding
the development of the North American Continent and of the life
of the waters in which the miles in thickness of sands, clay, and limey
muds accumulated during a period of several million years of lower
Paleozoic time.

Mrs. Walcott has sketched over 350 species of wild flowers during
the past 20 seasons, and she and Dr. Walcott now wish to work in
the mountains and valleys of southern Nevada and adjoining areas of
California, where climatic and physical conditions and life, both
animal and vegetable, are in strong contrast with those of the
Canadian Rocky Mountains, but where the problems in which
Dr. Walcott is interested in connection with the Cambrian forma-
tions of the Cordilleran area are essentially of the same order.

Acknowledgments Commissioner J. B, Harkin and the members
of the Canadian National Parks Service gave their hearty coopera-
tion. The effective assistance of the officers and employees of the
Canadian Pacific Railway permitted a saving of time and conserva-
tion of energy, and grants from the O. C. Marsh and Joseph Henry
endowment funds of the National Academy of Sciences were of
great assistance. To all, sincere thanks are returned and apprecia-
tion is expressed for the cooperation that has been given over a
period of years to make Dr. Walcott’s work more successful than
it would otherwise have been.

FIELD-WORK IN STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY IN TENNESSEE

During August and a part of September, 1925, Dr. R. S. Bassler,
curator of paleontology, U. S. National Museum, continued his
studies in the Central Basin and Highland Rim areas of Tennessee
in cooperation, as in previous years, with the Tennessee Geological
Survey. For several seasons past, he has been engaged in working
out the detailed stratigraphy of these two physiographic provinces,
in mapping certain areas of particular scientific and economic inter-
est and in collecting the faunas of the various Paleozoic formations
outcropping in this part of the state. By 1925, sufficient geologic
knowledge had been accumulated to make possible the determina-

tion of interesting structural features indicating discordant relations
and areal restrictions in rock formations which had hitherto been
thought to be essentially horizontal, widespread, and conformable
with each other.

At various times during the Paleozoic era, the area now termed
the Central Basin was uplifted above the sea as a low dome—the
Nashville Dome, as it is generally known—the rocks sloping gently
away on all sides. At times this dome was submerged partially
or entirely, the deposits remaining of those then formed showing
the extent of such submergences. At other times, the sea invaded
the area only in bay-like indentations in which rocks of various
interesting types were laid down. The resulting rock deposits hold
the story of these various invasions of the Nashville Dome, but the
strata, mainly limestone and shale, are so much alike that detailed
preliminary studies had to be undertaken before the formations
and their extent could be satisfactorily discriminated and mapped.
From such studies in previous seasons it was determined, for ex-
ample, that the Bigby limestone of Middle Ordovician age, the
source of much of the Tennessee brown phosphate, was deposited
in an arm of the sea which covered only the southwestern and
western parts of the Nashville Dome. The succeeding massive Cannon
limestone was developed, on the contrary, in a broad embayment
occupying the eastern two-thirds of the dome, in which it varies
in thickness from an inch or two along the ancient western shore
line to several hundred feet along the eastern side of the basin.
The Early Silurian, Richmond formation, also proved to have been
formed in similar but much narrower bays entering the dome on
the northern, western, and southern sides. The relative narrow-
ness of these embayments as contrasted with the preceding Bigby
and Cannon limestone bays indicates decided warping or wrinkling
of the surface during the transition from the Ordovician to the
Silurian. These restricted Richmond areas are also notable for
their iron ores and marble deposits. The later Silurian, Devonian,
and, Early Mississippian formations, in many cases, were deposited
in similarly restricted areas.

The occurrence and thickness of an Early Mississippian forma-
tion accumulated in one of these ancient narrow bays is illustrated
in figure 14, showing the New Providence shale, a celebrated crinoid-
bearing formation. Here, however, another structural feature 1s
shown in that the horizontal strata of the New Providence shale
are obliquely cut across by rocks of the overlying formation of

Fort Payne chert. The edges of the lower formation are clean
cut and show no signs of weathered products due to subaerial de-
composition, so that this seems a true case of submarine erosion.

Viewed in most exposures, the Fort Payne chert of Keokuk age
appears to be conformable with the overlying Warsaw limestone
but that there was an actual time break, locally indicated by an
angular unconformity, is shown in figure 15. Here the lower for-
mation has been tilted at a slight angle and the edges of the strata
worn oft before the rocks of the newer formation were laid down
upon it. A still different structural type is illustrated in figure 16,
which shows the Fort Payne chert resting directly on the Early
Mississippian Chattanooga black shale, the unconformity between
the two being recorded’ elsewhere by 500 feet or more of shales and
limestones included in the Ridgetop and New Providence forma-
tions which were absent at this place. The particular interest of
this exposure is that the Chattanooga shale developed a sharply
defined channel in its top, either through fracturing or erosion, in
which the Fort Payne chert was deposited normally. The structure
of the Eastern Highland Rim near its junction with the Cumberland
Plateau was also studied. The Highland Rim forms a rolling up-
land averaging 1,200 feet in altitude and the Cumberland Plateau,
another marked upland area, 700 feet higher. In this part of the
State, the Highland Rim is traversed as shown in figure 17, by
low ridges which, as a rule, are due to structural features in the
underlying formations. These ridges, in most cases, are capped by
hard sandstone and indicate areas of slightly downfolded strata
where the general level of erosion has not proceeded far enough
to entirely remove the resistant rock.

Tennessee is uniquely situated for the study of stratigraphic
geology, and the State has long been classic ground. Starting with
the Blue Ridge system on the east and extending westward to the
Mississippi flood plain, it comprises many physiographic provinces
with the underlying strata embracing almost all the divisions of the
geologic column. Most of these strata are highly fossiliferous and
perhaps nowhere else can the development of life be studied to
better advantage.

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN CENTRAL NEW YORK

The division of paleontology of the U. S. National Museum
contains great collections of Devonian fossils from the classic New
York areas, obtained years ago when the present methods of record-

2
14 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 78

ing very exact data as to precise horizon and locality were not
observed, To make these collections of scientific value, such detailed
information must be supplied. Towards this end, Erwin R. Pohl,
of the division, spent several weeks in the summer of 1925 at the
noted section along Kashong Creek near Bellona, New York, where
the shales and limestone formations of the Middle Devonian rang-
ing from the Marcellus at the base of the Hamilton through the
Ludlowville, the Tichenor and Moscow divisions and passing into
the overlying Tully limestone and Genesee black shale of Upper
Devonian age, are well developed in splendid outcrops. Most of
these formations abound in fossils and, as a result of the trip, half

a ton of carefully selected material was obtained. Photographs
of these formations, illustrating the stratigraphy and the opportu-
nities for collecting, are shown herewith (figs. 18 and 19).

The Kashong Creek section starts at the shore of Seneca Lake and
outcrops in the steep winding banks of the creek for more than three
miles upstream to Bellona, 300 feet above the level of the lake.
At several intervals the harder sandstone and limestone layers form
waterfalls of some beauty. Except in the stream gorge, the region
is very heavily wooded so that the collector is confined to the creek
bed to penetrate the country. The section is not continuous and as
the strata are folded in broad undulations and many of the beds
have a lithologic similarity, correlation of the rock is sometimes
quite difficult.

16 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 78

The black shales of the Ludlowville division of the Hamilton
were found to contain often myriads of small brachiopods and
pelecypods. The Tichenor limestone forming the base of the Hamil-
ton is also extremely fossiliferous while the Moscow shales above,
abounding in fossils, can be distinguished by their slightly grayer
color. Then comes a gap in sedimentation, for the Tully limestone,
forming the base of the Upper Devonian, is separated from the
underlying Moscow shale by an unconformity. The very charac-
teristic blocky Genesee shales follow the Tully limestone as shown
in figure 20.

Abundant collections were made in all the fossiliferous zones
and with their help, it has been found possible to accurately place
in this section most of the many fossils in the Museum’s series
previously obtained from this area.

GEOLOGICAL FIELD-WORK IN EUROPE

Dr. Charles E. Resser, associate curator of paleontology, U. S.
National Museum and Dr, E. O. Ulrich, associate in paleontology,
were members of the Smithsonian-Princeton expedition to Europe
during the summer of 1925 for the purpose of studying the more
important outcrops of the lower Paleozoic beds. The other mem-
bers of the party were Prof. R. M. Field and Mr. R. M. Fulle of
Princeton University and Mr. R. J. Beede of Williams College.
Prof. Field kindly offered the use of his automobile, which made
it possible to get about readily and to reach many places off the
usual travel routes. The route followed by the party covered more
than 7,500 miles by automobile alone, through central England,
Wales, and the extreme north coast of Scotland, the Scandinavian
countries, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, and
France.

Work was begun in Shropshire, where Mr. Edgar Sterling Cob-
bold of Church Stretton conducted the party to the various localities
at which he has done much valuable geological work. A few days
later he was again the guide to the famous Stiper Stones region on
the west side of the Longmynds. Some time was spent also in
studying the sections along the Onny River, in company with Mr.
B. B. Bancroft. In Wales, Prof. T. C. Nicholas of Cambridge
and Prof. O. T. Jones of Manchester guided the party about the
Harlech Dome, on St. Tudwals Peninsula and in Central Wales. At
Durness, on the extreme northwest coast of Scotland, a large series
NO. I SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1925 17
of limestone beds were next visited which have been of special
interest for many years because their contained faunas are American
rather than European.

The automobile was then transported across the North Sea to
Oslo, whence the party was guided by Prof. Olaf Holtedahl to the
famous localities on Christiania Bay. After the very brief stay in
Norway, the party proceeded to Vanersborg, Sweden, where it was
met by Dr. A. H. Westergaard, detailed by the Swedish Geological
Survey to be the guide in that country. Several weeks were spent
studying the outcrops in the hills of the region about Lake Vanern

and to the south in the ancient alum quarries of Andrarum. The
whole of southern Sweden has been heavily glaciated, but prior to
the coming of the ice it was eroded down to the fairly flat granite
floor. At a few places some of the soft, black, flat-lying Cambrian
shales with a little Ordovician limestone have been preserved in
low, lava-capped hills. Lenses of black, ill-smelling limestone, usu-
ally highly fossiliferous, occur in the black shales. Many hundreds
of years ago quarries were begun here for the sake of this lime.
Prior to 1800 wood was used in its burning but since that date
the shale itself has been used, for it contains so much carbonaceous
matter and sulphur that it serves the purpose well.

There were no particular objectives between Sweden and _ the
Bohemian Basin near Prague, and therefore the intervening regions

were traversed rapidly. At Prague the geologists again offered
every courtesy, and Dr. Jan Koliha of the famous Barrandeum
Museum and Dr. Radim Kettner of the Geological Survey served as
efficient guides to Barrande’s classic sections. In the Museum one
can see the first trilobite ever described, just too years ago, From
Czechoslovakia the journey led to Ziirich, where Dr. Ulrich remained.
The rest of the party continued across the Jura Mountains and the
Central Massif of France to Les Eyzies in the Dordogne country.
Several days were spent in investigating the abris and caves in
which remains of fossil man are preserved.

As it was necessary for the Princeton members to return at the
end of August, the party was finally disbanded at Paris and Prof.
Field returned with the automobile to Liverpool. Dr, Resser then
proceeded to Frankfurt-am-Main, in Germany, to visit Dr. and
Mrs. Rudolf Richter who have been active workers in paleontology
during the last ten years, producing much excellent work.

From Frankfurt he then returned to Copenhagen and in com-
pany with Dr. Christian Poulsen of the Mineralogical Museum,
made a visit to the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The island
consists of a granitic mass with younger and softer rocks on the
southern margin, the whole having been very heavily glaciated.

Several hundred pounds of selected fossils were collected and
sent to the National Museum, a number of valuable gifts were
secured, and exchanges were arranged.

COLLECTING FOSSIL FOOTPRINTS IN ARIZONA

Mr. Charles W. Gilmore, curator of the division of vertebrate
paleontology, U. S. National Museum, by arrangement with the
National Park Service and through the generosity of some of its
friends, was enabled to visit the Grand Canyon for the purpose of
making a collection of fossil footprints, and at the same time to
prepare a permanent exhibit of these footprints im situ by the side
of the famous Hermit Trail. Both of these undertakings were suc-
cessfully carried out.

A series of slabs, some 1,700 pounds in weight, carrying good
examples of the various kinds of imprints occurring there, were
collected and shipped to the Museum. The tracks occur in the
Coconino sandstone in Hermit Basin, on the trail down to Her-
mit Camp and from goo to 1,080 feet below the rim of the Can-
yon. Their excellent preservation and variety of kind, coupled
with their great antiquity, make this collection of more than usual
interest. Preliminary study of the tracks has demonstrated that
they represent not only a new Ichnite fauna, but probably the best
preserved and most extensive series of Permian footprints known
anywhere in the world.

It was found that the natural conditions were most favorable for
the preparation of an exhibit of fossil tracks in situ. The rather
steep slope of the sandstone on whose surfaces the tracks are im-
pressed stands at an inclination of 30° facing toward the Hermit
trail, over which in the course of the year hundreds of tourists
travel on mule back in making their pilgrimage to the bottom of
the Grand Canyon. The upper layers of the sandstone cleared
off in large sheets, thus uncovering whatever tracks and trails
there were to be found beneath. The work of preparing this
exhibit consisted, therefore, of removing the overburden of loose
dirt and broken rock, then quarrying off the loose upper laminae
until a solid and continuous face covered with footprints was reached.
This was done, and a smooth surface 8 feet wide and 25 feet long
was carefully uncovered as shown in figure 25.

At the side of the slab leading up from the trail, a series of
stone steps was laid in order to facilitate examination by those
interested in the footprints covering its surface. Although this
slab constituted the main exhibit, other large surfaces were similarly
uncovered, so that in all there are several hundred square feet of
rock surface showing imprints of feet, thus forming a permanent
exhibit of the various tracks and trails to be found here.
IN@. J SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1925 2ii

The great antiquity of these footprints is clearly demonstrated
at this locality, for it is evident that since the day when those ani-
mals impressed their feet in what at that time was moist sand, more
than 1,000 feet of rock-making materials were piled up in successive

strata above them and this does not take into account many hundreds
of feet more that have been eroded off the present top of the canyon
wall.

The great length of time necessary for the cutting away or erosion
of the rock to form the deep canyon and the even longer time
necessary for the original deposition of this great vertical mass of

stone when translated into terms of years, if that were possible,
would be so stupendous as to be almost beyond human compre-
hension.

This unique exhibit gives a very definite impression of the great
antiquity of the animal life that made these tracks, and it 1s hoped
that as an example it will stimulate the preparation and preservation
of other natural phenomena in our government controlled parks,
monuments, and reservations.

INVESTIGATION OF GLACIAL DEPOSITS NEAR DES MOINES,
IOWA

In April, 1925, Dr. James W. Gidley, assistant curator, division of
fossil vertebrates, U. S. National Museum, was detailed under the
auspices of the Bureau of American Ethnology to investigate an
alleged discovery of artifacts at Adel, Iowa. At Des Moines,
Dr. Gidley was joined by Dr. James H. Lees, assistant state geologist
of Iowa, who aided in the investigation at Adel.

After a study of the locality, the general conclusion reached by
Dr. Lees and Dr. Gidley was that although the artifacts (if such
they are) were found at a level of 24 feet below the original
surface and much below the level of Wisconsin (Upper Pleisto-
cene) drift deposits abundantly exposed at this locality, the beds in
which they were originally deposited are post-Wisconsin in age and
represent a more recently filled stream channel formed perhaps
by the abundant glacial waters coming from the last retreating
glacial ice sheet. As the artifacts were found in a bed of coarse
sand and gravel near the bottom of this ancient stream-channel
fill, however, the time of their burial must have been several thou-
sand years ago.

INVESTIGATION OF EVIDENCES OF EARLY MAN AT
MELBOURNE AND VERO, FLORIDA

The discovery at Vero, Florida, a few years ago of human remains
associated with those of an extinct fauna aroused considerable in-
terest at the time, and since the first publication of the occurrence
by Dr. E. H. Sellards in 1916, there has been much discussion as
to the age of these remains and the manner of their occurrence.
Several prominent men of science have expressed widely divergent
opinions both as to the age of the deposit in which the human bones
were found and as to their normal association with the extinct
24 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 78

animal bones with which they were found. More recently a dis-
covery, similar to that at Vero, was made near Melbourne, about
40 miles north of that place. The importance of this new discovery
was recognized, and accordingly Dr. Gidley, under the auspices
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, was detailed to Melbourne,
where with the aid of Mr. C. P. Singleton, a local amateur collec-
tor and the first discoverer of fossil bones in that vicinity, a pre-
liminary investigation was made.

For this investigation, Dr. Gidley left Washington, December 15,
1924, and returned January 4, 1925. This trip resulted in locating

several good prospects and in procuring by gift from Mr. Single-
ton, a fine specimen of the Florida mastodon which included a nearly
complete skull and lower jaws. While in Melbourne, Dr. Gidley
met Prof. F. B. Loomis of Amherst College, who also had come
there to look over these fossil deposits. There followed the formu-
lation of a tentative plan, afterwards approved by the authorities
of Amherst College and the Smithsonian Institution, for a joint
field expedition to more thoroughly explore the localities in the
vicinity of Melbourne and to re-examine the fossil beds at Vero.
This joint expedition, which left Washington on June 21 and re-
turned August 7, met with gratifying success in the way of adding
considerable new evidence to be considered in working out the problem
of early man in Florida,

On studying the fossil-bearing deposits at both localities, it was
found that the general conditions of deposition in the vicinity
of Melbourne were almost identical with those at Vero, so there
was no difficulty in recognizing over a wide area at Melbourne the
three principal geologic horizons designated by Sellards at Vero
as Nos. I, 2, and 3. This made the correlation of the beds of the
two localities comparatively easy. It was found that at both lo-
calities, all the fossil bones taken from Sellards “ No. 2” layer
were primarily deposited and were definitely of Pleistocene age.
Many of the bones of the lower part of No. 3 were also of this
age but were often mixed with bones of more modern species. Also
that “ No. 3” layer usually lies unconformably upon the somewhat
unevenly eroded surface of “No. 2.” “No. 3” layer throughout
contained numerous evidences of man, apparently of no great an-
tiquity, while no remains of this character were found in the lower
portion at least of “No. 2.” However, at Melbourne there were
found, at three relatively widely separated areas, human bones or
artifacts associated with undisturbed, and not redeposited, fossil
bones of the Pleistocene fauna. These finds were all near the top
of “No. 2” level, just below the contact plane. As no human re-
mains or artifacts were found below the top layer of “No. 2,” it

is assumed that man arrived in Florida about the close of the time
marked by the finished deposition of ‘ No. 2” or during the erosian
interval between it and “ No. 3,” and that he seems to have found
there a late survival of the Pleistocene fauna, certain species of
which may have persisted in the south later than did their relatives
in the north country. To verify these conclusions, a more extensive
and carefully worked out geologic investigation of both localities
should be made, especially along the contact plane between beds
~ Nos.2 andia

This expedition also spent some time in exploring certain of the
ancient Indian shell mounds and burial places of the vicinity. From
these a good collection of well-preserved skulls and skeletons were
obtained. There are many of these ancient Indian mounds in this
part of Florida, but unfortunately the present white inhabitants of
the region are digging them up as fast as located in the hope of
finding buried treasures. Thus is being destroyed what historic and
scientific value these mounds have for the archeologist. At the
present rate it will be only a few years until these burial places of
an interesting ancient people will almost wholly vanish as have the
people who made them.

EXPLORATION OF A PLEISTOCENE SPRING-DEPOSIT IN
OKLAHOMA

In October, Dr. Gidley was detailed under the auspices of the
Bureau of American Ethnology to examine a spring deposit in
southwestern Oklahoma. This spring is situated at the base of
Long Horn Mountain, on its southwesterly slope. It is about 14
miles south of Mountain View, and about 40 miles northwest of
Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

The fossil bones had been discovered here in August by an
Indian, Mr. Carl J. Reid Dussomé, while cleaning out the spring

preparatory to enclosing it with concrete in order to get a better
and cleaner flow of water for domestic purposes. Thus, an area
of about 150 square feet was exposed to the bottom of the deposit
which here is only 6 or 7 feet in depth. Additional excava-
tions were made under the direction of Dr. Gidley in October,
which added about 300 square feet to the area explored, The fossil
bones were confined entirely to the lower 18 inches of the stratum
which consists mostly of a black, sticky mud, or clay. The general
results of this exploration seem to be important, although not a
great amount of material was obtained. A small collection of Pleis-
tocene fossils were procured, part being donated by Mr. Reid and
28 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS VOL. 78

part collected by Dr. Gidley. Most important was the finding of a
broken bannerstone, near the bottom of the fossil bone-bearing
layer and in apparently normal immediate association with remains
of an extinct horse, while remains of the mammoth, mastodon, and
mylodon were recovered at the same level a few feet away. The
shallowness of the fossil bone layer, the general character and dis-
position of the deposits, the little altered condition of the fossil
bones and the aspect of the immediate surroundings, all suggest,
however, a not remote antiquity for the origin of this material,
and again raises the question of whether or not a remnant of. the
American Pleistocene fauna may not have survived to a much later
date in the southern border of the United States than has hitherto
been supposed.

FIELD-WORK IN ASTROPHYSICS

With the unanimous endorsement of the National Academy of
Sciences, the Chiefs of the United States and British Weather Ser-
vices, and of several other eminent meteorologists, the Congress of
the United States increased its appropriation for the Astrophysical
Observatory sufficiently to enable the Smithsonian Institution to
continue the solar radiation station at Montezuma, Chile, for the fiscal
year 1926. Hitherto this station has been carried in part by the in-
come of the Hodgkins fund of the Smithsonian Institution and in
part by the grants of Mr. John A. Roebling, who has now discon-
tinued his support, after expending a very large sum on this and
related researches.

The Smithsonian has therefore been able to continue daily obser-
vations of the variation of the sun at two exceptionally cloudless
desert stations. Daily telegrams have been received within 24 hours
after the observations, which indicate the independent results of
the two observatories. This information has been communicated
immediately to Mr. H. H. Clayton, who has continued his studies of
the relations of solar variation to weather. As a test of his results,
he has sent daily solar forecasts to the Institution estimating the
temperature of New York City 3, 4, and 5 days in advance. He has
also sent (3 days before their commencements) forecasts of tem-
perature departures at New York for each week and month.

These results will not be made public as forecasts. They are merely
to enable the Smithsonian Institution to estimate Mr. Clayton’s suc-
cess in these experiments. However, the results hitherto show very

certainly real prevision on Mr. Clayton’s part, and a gradual increase
in the accuracy of his forecasts. That the forecasts are not even
more close to the event than they are is due to several causes, not
least of which is the imperfect character of the Smithsonian solar
radiation observations.
