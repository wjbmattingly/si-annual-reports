INTR OD UCGLEONE

The Smithsonian Institution has attained a world-wide reputation, and ils
influence and importance are constantly extending. Its publications are found
uot only in the public libraries of our own land, but also in those of every other
civilized country. Its correspondents include some of the most distinguished
cultivators of science of the present day, and it is referred to as a center of infor-
mation by those who are interested in the pursuit of knowledge.

Many persons, however, who visit Washington, are but imperfectly acquainted
with the history of Smithson, the great object he had in view, the plans adopted
to carry out his intentions, and the results already obtained. It is for the pur-
pose of furnishing more definite information on these points thar this work has
been compiled, from the annual reports of the Secretary, Professor UENRy, to the

Board uf Regents, and other authentic sources.

2

Lhe Founder.

JAMES SMITHSON, the founder
of the Institution which bears his
name and wil! perpetuate his mem-
ory, was a native of London, Eng-
land. In his will he states that
he was the son of Hugh, first Duke
of Northumberland, and Eliza-
beth, heiress of the Hungerfords,
of Audley, and niece of Charles
the Proud, Duke of Somerset. He
was educated at Oxford, where he
took an honorary degree in 1786.
He went under the name of James
Lewis Macie untila few years after
he had left the university, when
he took that of Smithson, the
family name of the Northumberlands. He does not appear to have had any
fixed home in England, but travelled much on the continent, occasionally staying
a year or two in Paris, Berlin, Florence, etc. He died at Genoa, in 1828, at an
advanced age. He is said by Sir Davies Gilbert, President of the Royal Society,
to have rivalled the most expert chemists in minute analysis ; and, as an instance
of his skill, it is mentioned that, happening to observe a tear gliding down a
lady’s cheek, he endeavored to catch it on a crystal vessel; that half of the drop
escaped, but having preserved the other half, he submitted it to close analysis,
and discovered in it several salts, He contributed a number of valuable papers
to the Royal Society, and also to the Annals of Philosophy, on chemistry,
mineralogy, and geology. His scientific reputation was founded on these
branches, though from his writings he appears to have studied and reflected upon
almost every department of knowledge. He was of a sensitive, retiring disposi-
tion; was never married—appeared ambitious of making a name for himself,

either by his own researches or by founding an institution for the promotion of
science. He declared, in writing, that though the best blood of England flowed
in his veins, this availed him not, for his name would live in the memory of man
when the titles of the Northumberlands and Percies were extinct or forgotten.
He wus cosmopolitan in his views, and affirmed that the man of scicnce is of no
country—the world is his country, and all men his countrymen. He proposed
at one time to leave his money to the Royal Society of London, for the promotion
of science, but on account of a misunderstanding with the council of the Society
he changed his mind, and left it to his nephew, and in case of the death of this
relative, to the United States, to found the Institution which now bears his name.

She Bequest.

The original amount received from the bequest was $515,169 ; but from a res-
iduary legacy, savings of interest, &c., the fund has been increased to $650,000
now in the Treasury of the United States and yielding six per cent. interest.
The Government of the United States accepted the bequest, or in other words,
accepted the office of trustee, and the Hon. Richard Rush, of Pennsylvania, was
charged with the duty of prosecuting the claim. He remained in attendance on
the English courts until the money was awarded to him. He brought it over in
sovereigns, deposited it in the Mint of the United States, where it was recoined
into American eagles, thus becoming a part of the currency of the country.

At the time of the passing of the act establishing the Institution, in 1846,
tne sum of $242,000 had accrued in interest, and this the Regents were authorized
to expend on a building. But, instead of appropriating this sum immediately to
this purpose, they put it at interest, and deferred the completion of the building
for several years, until over $100,000 should be accumulated, the income of
which might defray the expenses of keeping the building, and the greater portion
of the income of the original bequest be devoted to the objects for which it was
designed. This policy has been rigidly adhered to, and notwithstanding an
expenditure of $450,000 on the building, the collection of a large library
and museum, and the publication of many volumes of original researches, the
bequest of Smithson is not only undiminished, but has increased more than a
hundred thousand dollars.

She Plan of Organization.

The bequest, in the language of the testator, was “to found at Washington an
establishment, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men.” According to this, the Government of the
United States is merely a trustee. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind, and
any plan which does not recognize this provision of the will would be illiberal and
unjust. The Institution must bear and perpetuate the name of its founder, and
hence its operations are kept distinct from those of the General Government, and
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. %

all the good which results from the expenditure of the funds is accredited to the
name of Smithson.

It will be observed that the object of the bequest is twofold—first, to ncrease,
and, second, to diffuse, knowledge among men. These two objects are entirely
separate and distinct, and to view the case understandingly the one must not be
confounded with the other. The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge
by the addition of new truths, and the second, to disseminate knowledge thus
enlarged among men. This distinction is readily acknowledged by men of science,
and in Europe different classes of scientific and other societies are founded upon
it. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of knowledge,
and hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention. Smithson was well
aware that knowledge should not be viewed as existing in isolated parts, but as a
whole, each portion of which throws light on all the others, and that the ten-
dency of all is to improve the human mind, and to give it new sources of power
and enjoyment. A prevalent idea, however, in relation to the will is, that the
money was intended exclusively for the diffusion of useful or immediately practi-
cal knowledge among the inhabitants of this country, but it contains nothing
from which such an inference can be drawn. All knowledge is useful, and the
higher the more important. From the enunciation of a single scientific truth
may flow a hundred inventions, and the more abstract the truth the more im-
portant the deductions. To effect the greatest good, the organization of the In-
stitution should be such as to produce results which could not be attained by
other meaus, and inasmuch as the bequest is for men in general, all merely local
expenditures are inconsistent with the will. ‘Phese were the views expressed by the
Secretary, Professor Henry, and constantly advocated by him. They were not en-
tertained, however, by many, and consequently difficulties have been encountered
in carrying them out. A numberof literary men thought that a great /ébrary should
be founded at Washington, and all the money expended on it; others considered a
museum the proper object; and another class thought the income should be de-
voted to the delivery of lectures throughout the country ; while still another was
of opinion that popular tracts should be published and distributed amongst the
million. But all these views were advanced without a proper examination of the
will, or a due consideration of the smallness of the income. The act of Congress
directed the formation of a library, a museum, a gallery of art, lectures, and a
building on a liberal scale to accommodate these objects. One clause, however,
gave the Regents the power, after the foregoing objects were provided for, to
expend the remainder of the income in any way they might think fit for carrying
out the design of the testator. The plan they have adopted is to stimulate al}
persons in this country capable of advancing knowledge by original research to
labor in this line; to induce them to send their results to the Institution for
examination and publication; and to assist all persons engaged in original
investigations, as far as its means will allow; also to institute, at the ex
pense and under the direction of the Institution, particular researches.
6 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

She Goberpment.

An act of Congress, dated August 10, 1846, provides ‘that the President and
Vice-President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the
Treasury, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster
General, the Attorney General, the Chief Justice, and the Commissioner of the
Patent Office of the United States, and the Mayor of the City of Washington,
during the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, and such other
persons as they may elect as honorary members, be and they are hereby constituted
an ‘establishment,’ by the name of the ‘Smithsonian Institution,” for the in-
crease and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The law also provides for a ‘“‘ Board of Regents,” to be composed of the Vice-
President of the United States and the Mayor of the City of Washington, during
the time for which they shall hold their respective offices, three members of the
Senate and three members of the House of Representatives, together with six
other persons, other than members of Congress, two of whom shall be members of
the National Institute, in the City of Washington, and resident in the said city ;
and the other four shall be inhabitants of othér States, and no two of them from
the same State.

The Establishment exercises general supervision over the affairs of the Institu-

tion.
The Board of Regents conducts the business of the Institution, and makes
annual reports to Congress. is

The Secretary of the Institution is elected by the Board. His duty is to take
charge of the building and property, discharge the duty of librarian, keeper of
the museum, etc., and has power, by consent of the Regents, to employ assist-
ants.

All laws for the protection of public property in Washington apply to the lands,
buildings, and other property of the Institution.

She Stryctyre.

The Smithsonian building stands on a part of a tract of public land denom.
inated ‘the Mall,” and the grounds extend from Seventh to Twelfth streets, east and
west, and from the canal to B street, north and south, comprising about fifty-two
acres. ‘The center of the building is directly opposite Tenth street, and the site
is about twenty feet above the average level of Pennsylvania avenue.

The style of architecture is that of the last half of the twelfth century, the latest
variety of the rounded style, asit is found immediately anterior to its merging into
the early Gothic, and is known as the Norman, the Lombard, or Romanesque. The
semi-circular arch, stilted, is employed throughout—in doors, windows, and other
openings.

It is the first edifice in the style of the twelfth century, and of a character not
ecclesiastical, ever erected in this country.

The main building bas in the center of its north front two towers, of which
the higher reaches an elevation of about 150 feet. On the south front is a
massive tower 37 feet
square and 91 feet high,
On the northeast corner
stands a double companile
tower, 17 feet square and
117 feet high; at the
southwest corner an oc-
tagonal tower, in which is
a spiral staircase. There
are nine towers in all.

The entire Ikkngth of
the building, from east to
west, is 447 feet. Its
greatest breadth is 160
feet. The east wing is
82 by 52 feet, and 423
feet high to the top of its
battlement; the west
wing, including its pro-
jecting apsis, is 84 feet
by 40, and 38 feet high,
and each of the connect-
ing ranges, including its
cloister, is 60 feet by 49
The main building is 205
feet by 57, and, to the
top of the corbel course,
NORTH CENTRAL TOWERS, 58 feet high.

8 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The building is erected in a very substantial manner, The founaation walls
under the main central towers are 12 feet thick at bottom, gradually diminishing
to five feet six inches at the surface of the ground, and are sunk eight feet deep.
The thickness of the walls of the main building above the water table is two feet
and-a-half in the first story, and two feet in the second, exclusive of buttresses,
corbel courses, &e. The walls of the wings are two feet thick ; of the central towers
three fect and a half thick in the first story, diminishing to two feet in the highest
story. ‘The roofs are slated. The face of the building is finished in ashlar, laid
in courses from 10 to 15 inches in height, and having an average bed of nine
inches.

The material employed is a lilac gray variety of freestone, found in the new red
sandstone formation where it crosses the Potomac, near the mouth of Seneca
Creek, one of its tributaries, and about twenty-three miles above Washington.
When first quarried it is comparatively soft, working freely before the chisel and
hammer; but by exposure it gradually indurates, and ultimately acquires tough-
ness and consistency, that not only enables it to resist the changes of the atmos-
phere, but even the most severe mechanical wear and tear.

The corner-stone of the building was laid with Masonic ceremonies, on the first
of May, 1847, in the presence of President Polk, his Cabinet, and an immense
concourse of citizens and strangers. The Grand Master of Masons, who performed
the ceremony, wore the apron presented by the Grand Lodge of France to Wash-
ington, through La Fayette, and used the gavel employed by Washington when
he laid the first corner-stone of the Capitol of the United States. An oration was
delivered by the Hon. George Mifflin Dallas, the first Chancellor of the Smithsonian
Institution, and now United States Minister to Great Britain. In the course of his
remarks Mr. Dallas said: ‘¢ When, at no distant day, I trust, it shall be seen
that within the walls of this building the truths of nature are forced by persever.
ing researches from their hidden recesses, mingled with the stock already hoarded
by genius and industry, and thence profusely scattered, by gratuitous lectures or
publications, for the benefit of all—when it shall be seen that here universal
science finds food, implements, and a tribune—art her spring to invention, her
studio, and her models; and both shall have throngs of disciples from the ranks
of our people, emulous for enlightenment, or eager to assist—then the condition of
our legacy will have been performed, and the wide philanthropy of Smithson have
achieved its aim.”

The design, by James Renwick, Jr., of New York, consists of a main center
building, two stories high, and two wings, connected by intervening ranges; each
of these latter having, on the north or principal front, a cloister, with open
stone screen. ’

The first story of the main building consists of one large room, 200 feet by 50,
and 25 feet high, the ceiling of which is supported by two rows of columns ex-
tending the whole length; at the middle of the space corresponding to the prin-
cipal entrances are two wing walls, by which, with the addition of screens, the
whole space may be divided into two large rooms, with a hall extending across.

The Library.

Although the act of Congress directed that provision should be made for the
accommodation of a library, on a liberal scale, it was soon seen, after the organi-
zation of the Institution, that it would be impossible, from the income which could
be devoted to it, to establish a first-class general library. Even had this been
practicable, it would still have seemed superfluous to do so in the very v.cinity of
the miscellaneous library of Congress, which is every year increasing in extent
under the liberal appropriations which are annually made for the purchase of books.
It was therefore deemed preferable, and more consonant with the purposes of the
Institution, to form a special library, which might constitute, as it were, a supple-
ment to the library of Congress, and consist, for the most part, of complete sets
of the proceedings and transactions of all the learned societies in the world, and
of ather serials essential for reference by students specially engaged in original
scientific research. The efforts of the Institution to carry out this plan, which
has since been sanctioned by Congress, have been eminently successful. Princi-
pally through exchanges, and occasionally by purchase, a more complete collection
of the works above mentioned has been procured than is to be found in any
library of the United States, or is easily met with even in Europe. The
Institution has been assisted in making this collection by the liberality of many
of the older libraries of the eastern continent, which, on application, have furnished
from their duplicates volumes and even whole sets to complete series of works long
since out of print, and which, in some cases, could not have been obtained through
any other means. ‘The Library is also quite rich in monographic or special trea-
tises in the physical and natural sciences, lacking as yet, it is true, some of the
more expensive volumes, but still affording the means of prosecuting almost any
scientific investigation.

One specialty of the Library consists of the large number of maps and charts,
obtained by exchange from geographical and hydrographical establishments, &c.
This collection is as complete as any in the country.

No effort is spared to render the Library of the Institution conducive to the
advance of science. Several editions of the catalogue of serial works have been
published.

In 1867 the care of the library was transferred to the library of Congress,
subject to be recalled at any time on certain conditions. The books are now
catalogued and bound at the expense of the Government, while the officers and
collaborators of the Institution have the same use of them as formerly, with
greatly increased facilities from access to the larger collection of books in the
National Library. The Institution still sends its publications, in exchange, to
other establishments at home and abroad, and desires to increase its library by
transactions of societies, and serial and scientific works.

THE LIBRARY.

In the large hall at the south entrance to the building are a number of
articles of special interest. The most prominent of these is the ancient
SARCOPHAGUS, which was brought to this country on the frigate Con-
stitution, by Commodore Elliott, from Beirut, in Syria, in 1839. This Sar-
cophagus was believed to be the repository of the remains of a Roman
Wmperor, and was intended for those of President ANDREW JACKSON. The
General, however, refused to accept the gift, saying “I cannot consent that
my mortal body ska!l be laid in a repository prepared for an Emperor or a
King—my republican feelings and principles forbid it—the simplicity of our
system of Government forbids it.”

A plank from the redwood tree, and a piece of bari from the famous giant
tree of California, will attract attention, as well as an immense mass of copper
from Lake Superior.

Among the most interesting objects in this part of the collection are several IDOLS
from Central America, presented by Hon. H. G Squier, late United States Minis-

ter to Nicaragua. The largest statue, carved in black basalt, was obtained from
the Island of Momotombita, in Lake Managua, where there was a temple or sacred
place. The figure with the sphinx-like head-dress is also from the same locality.
One or two of the other statues, by the Indians of the Pueblo of Subtiava, near
Leon, having been buried a great number of years, and the locality carefully con-
cealed, they are somewhat mutilated. A small group of these monuments exists
in the depths of the forest midway between Leon and the Pacific, which is still
secretly visited by the Indians for the performance of dances and other rites
pertaining to their primitive religion. The small figure resembling some animal
couchant was, until very recently, preserved on a remarkable rock on the side ot
the volcano of Omatepec, and regarded with high veneration by the Indians. It
was only after many years of search that the priests were able to find and remove
it. The granite vase, distinguished by the ornaments called grecques by Hum-
boldt, (and which characterize the ruins at Mitla, in Mexico,) was dug up near
the city of Nicaragua. The spot had been a cemetery of the ancient inhabitants.
12 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Anotner relic of the same material, and with a like style of ornament, accompanies
the vase, and was found in the same neighborhood. It seems to have been de-
signed as a pedestal for a small statue. There are also several vases, in which
the bones and ashes of the dead were packed after the decomposition of the flesh
or after burning.

The largest and most elaborate monuments in Nicaragua exist in the littlo
Island of Pensacola, near the base of the extinct voleano of Momobacho. They
weigh a number of tons each, and are distinguished as being wrought from blocks
of sandstone—a material which is not found on the island. Two of the statues
of the Smithsonian collection are from the Island of Zapatero, in Lake Nicaragua,
where once existed one of the most imposing aboriginal temples of the country.
Here, among the ruins of the feocadli, or high-places of the former inhabitants,
were found entire statues, besides the fragments of many others, several broken

sacrificial stones, etc.
She juseun.

The Smithsonian Institution is now in possession of the best collection of the
larger North American and European mammalia, both skins and skeletons, to be
found in the United States. In birds it is only second to the collection of the
Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences—the latter being without doubt the
most extensive and perfect now extant. Of fish the Smithsonian has a greater
number than is to be found in any cabinet, except that of Professor Agassiz.

THE MUSEUM.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. ts

LABORATORY OF NATURAL HISTORY

It should be understood that the Smithsonian Institution does not enter upon
grounds already occupied, and therefore it is not an object to collect specimens
promiscuously, or those usually found in other museums. Still the collection of
this Institution is now attractive to the general visitor and curiosity secker; and the
student of natural history will here find much that will be sought in vain else-
where. Duplicate specimens are often exchanged for those in other collections,
and all the objects are open for the study and examination of those engaged in
this line of research. Applications for such facilities are numerous, and have al-
ways been granted. The preparation of most of the important papers on natural
history published within a few years in this country has been aided in this way
by the Institution.

The act of Congress establishing the Institution provides as follows :—

Sec. 6. That, in proportion as suitable arrangements can be made for their reception, all
objects of art and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants,
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging, or hereafter to belong, to the United
States, which may be in the city of Washington, in whosesoever custody the same may be,
shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board of Regents to receive
tuem, and shall be arranged in such order, and so classed, as best facilitate the exam-
ination and study of them, in the building so as aforesaid to be erected for the Institution ;
and the Regents of said Institution shall afterwards, as new specimens in natural history,
geology, or minerology, may be obtained for the museum of the Institution, by exchange of
duplicate specimens belonging to the Institution, (which they are hereby authorized to
make,) or by any donation, which they may receive, or aeneE Wier, cause such new specimens
to be also appropriately classed and arranged.
14 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Under these provisions, the Institution has received and taken charge of such
government collections in mineralogy, geology, and natural history as have been
made since its organization. The amount of these bas been very great, as all the
United States Geological, Boundary and Railroad Surveys, with the various topc
graphical, military, and naval explorations, have been, to a greater or less extent,
ordered to inake such collections as would illustrate the physical and natural his-
tory features of the regions traversed.

Of the collections made by the government expeditions, those of fiftv
are now deposited with the Smithsonian Institution, embracing more than five-
sixths of the whole amount of materials collected. The principal expeditions thus
furnishing collections are the United States Geological Surveys of Doctors Owen,
Jackson, and Evans, and of Messrs. Foster and Whitney ; the United States and
Mexican Boundary Survey ; the Pacific Railroad Survey ; the Exploration of the
Yellow Stone, by Lieutenant Warren; the Survey of Lieutenant Bryan; the
United States Naval Astronomical Expedition; the North Pacific Behring Straits
Expedition ; the Japan Kxpedition, and the Paraguay Expedition.

The Institution has also received, from other sources, collections of greater or
less extent, from various portions of North America, tending to complete the
government series.

The collections thus made, taken asa whole, constitute the largest and best
series of the minerals, fossils, rocks, animals, and plants of the entire continent
of North America, in the world. Many tons of geological and mincralogical
specimens, illustrating the surveys throughout the West, are embraced therein.
There is also a very large collection of minerals of the mining regions of Northern
Mexico, and of New Mexico, made by a practical Mexican geologist, during a period
of twenty-five years, and furnishing indications of many rich mining localities
within our own borders, yet unknown to the American people.

It includes, also, with scarcely an exception, all the vertebrate animals of North
America, among them many specimens each of the Grizzly, Cinniman, and Black
Bears ; the Panther, Jaguar, Ocelot, and several species of Lynx or Wildcat ;
the Elk, the Mexican, Virginian, White-tailed, Black-tailed, and Mule Deer ; the
Antelope, Rocky Mountain Goat and Sheep; several species of Wolves and
Foxes, the Badger, Beaver, Porcupine, Prairie Dog, Gopher, and also about seven
hundred species of American Birds, four hundred of Reptiles, and eight hundred
of Fishes, embracing Salmon, Trout, Pike, Pickerel, White Fish, Muskalonge,
Bass, Redfish, Xe.

The greater part of the Mammalia have been arranged in walnut drawers,
made proof against dust and insects. The birds have been similarly treated,
while the reptiles and fish have been classified, as, to some extent, have also been
the shells, minerals, fossils, and plants.

The collections are increasing so rapidly that it will soon be impossible, from
the small part of the Smithson income which can be devoted to this purpose,
to properly sustain a large museum, and a National Museum should be esta-
blished by the Government on a scale commensurate with the resources,
productions, and character of the country.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 15

The fund of a foreigner intended for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men” should not be absorbed in local objects and in doing that which
the Government should in honor and good faith do itself.

The Institution, if relieved of the charge of the show museum, would devote
its energies in the way of advancing natural history by instituting original
explorations in all parts of the world, making collections and distributing
duplicates to all other museums.

Nj cteorites.

In the Museum hall may be seen a meteorite, from Northern Mexico, which
weighs 250 pounds,

It was brought to this country by Lieutenant Couch, of the United States
Army, he having obtained it at Saltillo. It was said to have come from the Sancha
estate, some fifty or sixty miles from Santa Rosa, in the north of Coahuila,
various accounts were given of the precise locality, but none seemed very satisfac:
tory. When first seen by Lieutenant Couch, it was used as an anvil, and had
been originally intended for the Society of Geography and Statistics in the city of
Mexico. It is said, that where this mass was found there are many others of
enormous size; but such stories, however, are to be received with many allow-
ances. Mr. Weidner, of the mines of Freiberg, states, that near the southwestern
edge of the Balson de Mapimi, on the route to the mines of Parral, there is a
meteorite near the road of not less than a ton weight. Lieutenant Couch also
states, that the intelligent, but almost unknown, Dr. Berlandier, writes in his
journal of the Commission of Limits, that at the hacienda of Venagas, there was
(1827) a piece of iron that would make a cylinder one yard in length, with a
diameter of ten inches. It was said to have been brought from the mountains
near the hacienda. It presented no crystalline structure, and was quite ductile.

Another Meteorite to be seen here is still more curious and interesting, from
its remarkable size and appearance, It is in the shape of a ring much heavier
on one side. Its greatest exterior diameter is 49 inches; the least 38 inches ;
width of central opening 23 inches; width of thickest part of the ring 174
inches. It weighs 1400 lbs. Its composition is principally of iron. It was
discovered in Sonora by Jesuit missionaries, brought to Tucson in Arizona,
and was sent, through the influence of Dr. Irwin, U. 8. A., by Mr. Augustine

Ainsa, to Hermosillo. In May, 1863, Mr. Jesus Ainsa brought it to San
Francisco, and shipped it to the Smithsonian Institution.

Mhat has beep done.

The following is a sketch of the labors of the Institution, and illustrates the
capability of the plan of operations for producing important results in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge among men:—

Publications.—Three classes are issued.

1. A quarto series, entitled “SmirHsoNrIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE,”
issued in volumes, each containing one or more separate articles. This includes
memoirs, embracing the records of extended original investigations and researches,
resulting in what are believed to be new truths, and constituting positive additions
to the sum of human knowledge.

2. An octavo series, entitled ‘‘SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS,”
consisting of reports on the present state of our knowledge of particular branches
of science; instructions for collecting and digesting facts and materials for research;
lists and synopses of species of the organic and inorganic world; museum cata-
logues; reports of explorations; aids to bibliographical investigations, etc., gene-
rally prepared at the express request of the Institution, and at its expense.

3. Another octavo series, consisting of the Annual Reports of the Institution
to Congress, called ‘‘SmirHsonran Reports.” These include the official reports
of the Secretary to the Board of Regents of the operations and condition of the
Institution; the reports of Committees of the Board; abstracts of lectures delivered
before the Institution; extracts from correspondence; original or translated articles
relating to the history and progress of science, ete.

The following rules have been observed in the distribution of the first and second
series:

1. They are presented to all learned societies of the first class which publish
transactions, and give copies of these, in exchange to the Institution.

2. To all foreign libraries of the first class, provided they give in exchange their
catalogues and other publications, or an equivalent, from their duplicate volumes.

3. To all the colleges in actual operation in this country, provided they furnish,
in return, meteorological observations, catalogues of their libraries and of their
students, and all other publications issued by them relative to their organization
and history.

4. To all States and Territories, provided they give, in return, copies of all docu-
ments published under their authority.

5. To all incorporated public libraries in this country, not included in any of
the foregoing classes, now containing 10,000 volumes; and to smaller libraries,
where a whole State or large district would be otherwise unsupplied.

Institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular branches of
knowledge, receive such articles published by the Institution as relate to their
objects. Portions of the series are also given to institutions of lesser grade not
entitled, under the above rules, to the full series, and also to the meteorological
correspondents of the Institution. =

The Reports are of a more popular character, and are presented
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. i led

. To all the meteorological observers and other collaborators of the Institution.
. To donors to its Library or Museum.
. To colleges and other educational establishments.

4. To public libraries and literary and scientific societies.

5. To teachers or individuals who ure engaged in special studies, and who make
direct application for them.

Besides the works which have been published entirely at the expense of the In-
stitution, aid has been furnished by subscription for copies to be distributed to
foreign libraries of a number of works which fall within the class adopted by the
programme. The principal works of this kind for which subscriptions have been
made are as follows: Agassiz’s Contributions to Natural History, Gould’s Astro-
nomical Journal, Shea’s American Linguistics, Runkle’s Mathematical Monthly,
Deane’s Fossil Footprints, Tuomey & Holmes’ Fossils of South Carolina, Peirce’s
Analytic Mechanics.

Metcorology —The investigation of all questions relative to meteorology has
been an object to which the Institution has devoted special attention, and one of
its first efforts was to organize a voluntary system of observation, which should
extend as widely as possible over the whole of the North American continent. It
induced a skilful artisan, under its direction, to commence the manufacture of care-
fully compared and accurately graduated instruments, now generally known as
the Smithsonian standards. It prepared and furnished a series of instructions for
the use of the instruments and the observations of meteorological phenomena; also
three series of blank forms as registers.

It next organized a body of intelligent observers, and in a comparatively short
time brought the system into practical operation; cach year the number of observers
increased, and where one ceased his connection with the enterprise, several came
forward to supply his place. By an arrangement with the Surgeon General of the
army, the observations made at the United States military posts in different parts
of the country, and also the system which had previously been established by the
State of New York, were remodelled so as to harmonize with that of the Institu-
tion. Gentlemen interested in science residing in the British provinces, and at
nearly all the posts of the Hudson’s Bay Company, also in Mexico, Central Ame-
rica, the West Indies, and some places in South America, &c., joined in this enter-
prise. All these contribute their services without compensation. Their only re-
ward is the satisfaction of co-operating with each other and the Institution in the
effort to supply data and materials for investigation. Any returns, indced, which
the Institution has in its power to make are gladly rendered in a hearty acknow-
ledgment of assistance, and in copies of all the Smithsonian publications likely to
be of interest.

The publications of the Institution contain many memoirs which have tended
to advance the science of meteorology. Among these may be mentioned the me-
teorological and physical tables prepared at the expense of the Institution by Pro-
fessor Guyot, and filling a large octavo volume of the Miscellaneous Collections,
18 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

No work extant answers the same purpose with the one referred to, which has
hence become a general standard of reference, the constant demand for it as well
in Europe as America having required the printing of several successive editions.

The results of the reductions for five years previous to 1860 have been published
in two volumes of nearly 2,000 quarto pages, containing a mass of materials of
great value in determining the average temperature, fall of rain, barometrical
pressure, moisture, direction of the wind, and time of various periodical pheno-
mena relative to plants, animals, &c.

In addition to these large and important volumes, other works have been pub-
lished by the Institution which have had a marked influence on the progress of
meteorology. Among these may be mentioned the works of Professor Coffin, on
the winds of the Northern Hemisphere; of Mr. Chappelsmith, on a tornado in
Illinois; of Professor Loomis, on a great storm which pervaded both America and
Europe; the reduced observations for twenty-eight years of Professor Caswell, at
Providence, Rhode Island; of Dr. Smith, for twenty years in Arkansas; of Dr.
Kane and Captain McClintock, in the Arctic Seas; on the heat and light of the
sun at different points, by Mr. Meech; on the secular period of the aurora, by
Professor Olmsted; the occurrence of auroras in the Arctic regions, by Mr. P.
Force, &e.

Besides these, a series of meteorological essays embodying many of the results’
obtained from the investigations at the Institution has been prepared by the Secre-
tary, and been published in the Agricultural Reports of the Patent Office.

Astronomy.—The Institution has advanced the science of astronomy both by its
publications and the assistance rendered to observers. To facilitate astronomical
observations it prepared and published for six years an annual list of occultations
of the principal stars by the moon, and printed and distributed a series of tables
for determining the perturbations of the planetary motions, the object of which
determination is to facilitate the calculation of the places of the heavenly bodies.
These tables have accomplished the desired end, saving to the practical astronomer
an immense amount of tedious and monotonous labor.

The name of the Institution has been favorably connected with the history of
the interesting discovery of the planet Neptune. From a few of the first obser-
vations which had been made on this planet, Mr. Sears C. Walker calculated its
approximate orbit, and by this means tracing its path through its whole revolution
of 166 years, he was enabled to carry it backward until it fell among a cluster of
stars, accurately mapped by Lalande, towards the close of the last century. After
minute inspection he was led to conclude that one of the stars which had been
observed by Lalande in 1795, was the planet Neptune. He was thus supplied
with the amount of its motion for upwards of fifty years, from which he deduced
a much more perfect orbit, and was enabled to construct an ephemeris giving the
place of the planet for several years in succession. These investigations, so inter-
esting to astronomy and honorable to this country, were prosecuted and published
at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 19

To render more generally accessible to practical astronomers in this country the
theory of the motion of the heavenly bodies by the celebrated Gauss, the Institu-
tion shared the expense of publishing a translation of this treatise from the Latin, —
by Admiral Davis. It furnishes a complete system of formulas for computing the
movements of a body in any of the curves belonging to the class of conic sections,
and a general method of determining the orbit of a planet or a comet from three
observations, as seen from the earth. r

For a number of years aid was afforded to the publication of Gould’s American
Astronomical Journal, which rendered good service to the science by making
promptly known to foreign observers the results of the labors of their contempo-
raries in America. It has also reduced and published at its own expense the as-
tronomical observarsions made by Dr. Kane in the Arctic regions, and has also
“published those made in the same regions by Dr. Hayes.

Congress having authorized, in 1849, an astronomical expedition under Lieuten-
ant Gilliss to the Southern Hemisphere, for the purpose of determining the paral-
lax of the planets, and consequently their distance from the sun, by observations
on Venus and Mars, accidentally failed to make the appropriation for instruments.
This omission was supplied by the Institution, which was subsequently indemnified
for the expense by the Chilian government.

In the observation of all the large solar eclipses which have happened since the
date of its organization, the Institution has actively and efficiently co-operated by
publishing projections of the phases and times of their occurrence in different parts
of America.

Under its auspices, and partly at its expense, an expedition was inaugurated to
observe the great eclipse of 1858 in Peru, from which data of value for the im-
provement of solar and lunar tables were determined, besides facts of interest in
regard to the physical constitution of the sun.

Assistance was also rendered to the expeditions under the direction of the Coast
Survey, to observe the eclipse of July 18, 1860, one of which was sent to Labrador,
under the charge of Professor S. Alexander, of New Jersey, and the other to
Washington Territory, under that of Lieutenant Gilliss.

To these may be added an account of an instrument invented by Rev. T. Hill,
President of Harvard College, for the projection of eclipses.

Physics and Chemistry.—The Institution has fostered these sciences in many
different ways; among others, by importing models of the most approved articles
of apparatus, and making them known to scientific men through lectures and
otherwise.

It has instituted an extensive series of experiments on building materials, par-
ticularly in reference to those employed by the government in the construction of
the Capitol and other public edifices; also a like series on acoustics, as applied to
public halls, and the principles deduced from these practically applied in the con-
struction of a model lecture room. It has made a very extended series of experi-
ments on different substances employed for light-house illumination, from which
20 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

has resulted the substitution of lard oil for sperm oil and the conseques
annual saving of a large amount of money to the government.

In compliance with requests made by different departments of the government,
and of Congress, particularly since the war, it has conducted various series of in-
vestigations, principally in relation to questions involving mechanical, chemical,
and physical principles, and has made reports on subjects of this kind amounting,
in the aggregate, to several hundred.

To facilitate researches, a laboratory has been established and kept constantly
in working condition, the privilege of using it having been given to various com-
petent persons for experimenting in different branches of physical science.

The most important publications under this head are the researches relative to
electric currents, by Professor Secchi; on the explosibility of nitre, by Dr. Hare;
on the ammonia-cobalt bases, by Drs. Gibbs and Genth; and on astronomical
photography, by Dr. Henry Draper.

A valuable report on recent improvements in the chemical arts, by Booth &
Morfit, was published in 1852, and there have been given in the Annual Reports
of the Institution a series of translations and articles presenting a view of the
progress of physics and chemistry from year to year, since 1855, among which
we may particularly notice the translation of Muller on recent contributions to
electricity, and the reprint of Powell on radiant heat.

Terrestrial Magnetism.—The subject of terrestrial magnetism has been prose-
cuted simultaneously with that of meteorology, and an observatory was erected in
the Smithsonian grounds, fitted up with the most approved instruments, and con-
ducted under the joint auspices of the Institution and of the Coast Survey. After
remaining in operation for several years, the instruments were transferred to Key
West, as a remote station where observations were still more desirable. Instru-
ments were also furnished an expedition to Mexico, and used with much success
by Mr. Sonntag, whose results were published in the Smithsonian Contributions
to Knowledge. Apparatus was also furnished to Dr. Kane, Dr. Hayes, and other
explorers, by means of which valuable results were obtained.

Of the more important publications of the Institution, which have tended to
advance this science, may be mentioned the articles, by Dr. Locke, on the dip and
intensity; the elaborate discussion, by Professor Bache, of the magnetic observa-
tions made at Girard College from 1841 to 1845; the report on magnetical obser-
vations in the Arctic Seas, by Dr. Kane, reduced at the expense of the Institution,
by Mr. C. Schott; and those made in Pennsylvania and adjacent States, by Pro-
fessor Bache, and in Mexico, by Mr. Sonntag.

Explorations.—In the deficiency of means for more extended operations, the
efforts of the Institution in the line of explorations and collection are confined, as
strictly as possible, to America. Arctic America, all the unknown portions of the
United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the West Indies have been
laid under contribution for facts and materials by which to advance science.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. a1

~_

An eminently useful influence has been exerted by the Institution through the
aid it has afforded in the organization of the different government explorations by
land and by sea. Whether by official representations to the heads of departments,
or personal influence with officers and employés, it has secured the engagement of
individuals competent to collect facts and specimens; it has instructed persons thus
engaged, and others, in the details of observation; it has superintended the pre-
paration, and, in some cases, borne the expense of the necessary outfits; has fur-
nished fresh supplies from time to time to the collectors while in the field; received
the collections made, and preserved them for future study, or at once consigned
them to the hands of competent persons, both at home and abroad, for investiga-
tion; directing the execution of the necessary drawings and engravings for the
reports, and finally superintending the printing and even the distribution of any
available copies of the completed works to institutions of science. Prior to the
establishment of the Institution but little had been done by our government in
the way of scientific explorations, with the exception of that under Captain Wilkes.
But since then nearly every United States expedition, whether a survey for a
Pacific railroad route, a boundary line between the United States and regions north
or south of it, or within its borders, a wagon-road across the Rocky Mountains, or
an ordinary topographical exploration, has been influewced and aided more or less,
as above stated.

Besides these, similar explorations have been carried on without any reference
to the government, and either entirely or in a great measure at the expense of the
{nstitution, and always at its suggestion, or under its direction. Prominent among
these may be mentioned the three years’ researches in the Arctic regions, by Mr.
Kennicott, with the co-operation of gentlemen of the Hudson’s Bay Company ; of
Mr. Drexler, in the region of Hudson’s Bay, and also in the Rocky Mountains;
of Mr. Coues, in Labrador; of Lieutenant Feilner, in Nebraska and Northern
California; of Mr. John Xantus, at Fort Tejon, Cape St. Lucas, and in Western
Mexico; of Lieutenant Trowbridge, on the coast of California; of Drs. Cooper
and Suckley, in Western America generally; of Drs. Coues and Beers, in Kansas,
New Mexico, and Arizona; of Dr. Irwin, in Arizona; of Dr. Hitz, about Laramie
Peak; of Lieutenant Couch, in Texas and Mexico; of G. Wurdeman, Lieutenant
Wright, Captain Woodbury, and others, in Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico; of
Dr. Sartorius, Professor Sumichrast, Dr. Berendt, in Mexico; Dr. Von Frantz, J.
Carniol, in Costa Rica; of Mr. March, in Jamaica; of Mr. Wright, Dr. Gundlach,
Professor Poey, in Cuba; Judge Carter, in Bolivia, besides many others.

In addition to the collections which have been received from explorations organ-
ized under the direction of the Institution, large numbers of duplicate specimens
have been presented by the meteorological observers and other Smithsonian col-
laborators, the whole forming a body of material for the illustration and study of
the American continent unequalled by any collection previously made. The results
of the explorations, however, as might be inferred, have not been confined to’ spe-
cimens alone, but have furnished information relative to the topography, geology,

physical geography, ethnology, and the living fauna of the country and regions
visited.
ape THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

The results have been published by government, the Institution, or other parties.
The extent and importance of these publications may be seen in the volumes of
the reports of the Pacific Railroad and Mexican boundary surveys; of the United
States astronomical expedition to Chili, under the late lamented Captain Gilliss;
of Captain Stansbury’s exploration of Utah; of Lieutenant Michler’s of the Isthmus
of Darien, &c. &c.; in the volumes of the Smithsonian publications, and in the
transactions of nearly all the scientific institutions in the United States.

In order to facilitate the operations of collectors, a series of directions and cir-
culars have been prepared and widely distributed, for collecting, preserving, and
transporting specimens of natural history, and also special instructions as to the
collecting of nests, eggs, shells, insects, Xc.

Description and Distribution of Collections and Specimens.—The object of
making these collections, in conformity with the policy of the Institution, was not
merely to supply a large museum in Washington with permanent specimens or
duplicates for exchange, but to furnish the naturalists of the world with the mate-
rials for advancing the science of the natural history of North America, and of
facilitating the study of its various branches by supplying museums, both in the
United States and in Europe, with sets of type specimens.

In pursuance of this object, full sets of the specimens collected have been sub-
mitted to a large number of naturalists, both in this country and abroad, for cri-
tical study and description, and it is not too much to say that scarcely a mono-
graphic investigation has been conducted for many years past in any branch of
American zoology which has not derived part or the whole of its material from the
Smithsonian collections. Duplicates of the specimens, when described, have been
made up into series for distribution, always accurately labelled, and are usually
types of some published investigation. The average of such distribution has, for
the last ten years, been at least ten thousand specimens annually, and the whole
number distributed over a quarter of a million. In this way all the older
museums in this country and Canada have been largely increased, and the
foundation for several new establishments of a similar kind has been furnished.
To all colleges and academies making special application, labelled specimens
have also been presented.

This distribution of specimens is very different from the ordinary exchanges
conducted between institutions or individuals, which usually involve the return of
an equivalent. The question with the Smithsonian Institution is, not what can
be had in return, but where a particular specimen or scries of specimens can be
placed so as best to advance the cause of science, by being most accessible to the
largest number of students engaged in original investigations.

Palxontoloyy, Geology, Physical Geography, &c.—Appropriations have been
made for investigations of the surface formation of the Connecticut valley, by
Professor E. Hitchcock, and for the collection of materials for the illustration of the
geology and palontology of particular regions. Appropriation has also been
made to Professor Guyot for a barometrical survey of the different parts of the
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 23

Alleghany Mountains, and to other persons for collecting observations on heights,
as determined in different parts of the country by the various canal and railway
surveys.

The publications on these subjects, besides the papers of Professor Hitchcock
on surface geology, are as follows: A Memoir on Mosasaurus, by Dr. R. W. Gibbs.
On the Extinct Species of the Fossil Ox and Sloth of North America, and on the
Ancient Fauna of Nebraska, by Dr. Leidy. On the Physical Geography of the
Mississippi Valley, by Charles Ellet. On the Law of Deposit of Flood Tide, by
Admiral Davis. On the Fluctuations of the Level of the great American Lakes,
by C. Whittlesey. On the Paleontology of the Upper Missouri, and Check List
of Miocene Cretaceous and Jurassic Invertebrata, by F. B. Meek. A Memoir, by
Dr. Leidy, on the Extinct Reptiles of the Cretaceous period.

The Institution has published a check list of minerals, with their symbols, pre-
pared by Mr. Egleston, with special reference to facilitating the labelling of the
Smithsonian minerals and the exchange of specimens, and it may be mentioned
that the Institution has made an extensive distribution of specimens of building
stone employed by the government.

Botany.—This branch of general natural history has been advanced by the In-
stitution, not only by means of the publication of the papers of original memoirs,
but also by explorations and collections made at the expense of the Smithsonian
Fund. The most important work which has been published is a large quarto vo-
lume, illustrated by expensive colored plates, of the sea plants of the entire Ame-
rican coast. The work was written for the Institution by Dr. Harvey, of the
University of Dublin, and has been the means of rendering this family of the
vegetable kingdom more generally known. The Institution has also published
several papers on the plants of New Mexico and California, by Dr. Gray, of Cam-
bridge, and Dr. Torrey, of New York. ,

Duplicates of the specimens described have been presented to institutions at
home and abroad. Considerable labor has also been expended in the preparation
of an original report on the forest trees of America, by Dr. Gray.

General Zoology.—A large part of the collections made by the Institution
belong to the general class of zoology, intended to advance the study of animal
life upon the continent of America.

The ornithology of America has always been a specialty of the Smithsonian
Institution, more efforts having been made to perfect its collection in this depart-
ment ‘han any other. The Institution has published the first part of a work by
Dr. '. M. Brewer, suitably illustrated, on the distribution and habits of North
American birds during the breeding season, with descriptions and figures of their
eggs, the materials being derived entirely from the collections of the Institution,
and mostly made at its special request. This is the first separate work on North
American zoology ever prepared. A catalogue of North American birds, prepared
by Professor S. F. Baird, has been extensively used at home and abroad in label-
ling collections.
24 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

a
Professor Baird has prepared a revision, or posting up, of our knowledge of

North American ornithology to the present date, with the addition of the species
of Central and South America and the West Indies. The materials being derived
almost entirely from the specimens collected by the Institution, have been increased
since the publication of the extensive work on the same subject, by Professor
Baird, in the Pacific Railroad report, from 12,000 to 35,000.

The collections which have been made by the Institution for the illustration of
mammalia have been very extensive, amounting to 10,000 specimens, and have not
only included many duplicates of every species previously known, but a very large
number entirely new to science. A catalogue of North American mammals,
chiefly those collected by the Institution, prepared by Professor Baird, has been
published and distributed to those interested in the study; also a monograph of
North American bats, prepared by Dr. H. Allen. Materials are now in course of
accumulation to complete the account of the classes of mammals of North Ame-
rica, which have not been included in the publications of the Institution and
Pacific Railroad Reports.

As with all American vertebrata, the collections of reptiles and fishes have been
very extensive, and numerous monographs or articles have been published relative
to them in the Pacific Railroad Reports, and the proceedings of different natural
history societies, the Institution having published a synopsis of the serpents of
North America, and a monograph of the cottoids.

The Institution has materially aided the study of the entomology of this country,
not only by the collections in that branch, but by preparing and publishing a series
of works for the purpose of exhibiting the state of knowledge on the subject, and
facilitating its further advancement. It has published and distributed the follow-
ing under this head :—

Instructions for collecting and preserving insects, and catalogues, synopses, or
monographs of the Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Neuroptera, prepared by
the most competent authorities in Hurope and America.

It has also in course of preparation, works relative to the Hymenoptera, Ho-
moptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, &c.

Conchology.—A large collection of specimens of shells was received from the
United States exploring expedition, which has been much increased by subsequent
additions. All the shells of the west coast of the United States, and those gene-
rally collected by the exploring expedition, were put into the hands of Mr. P. P.
Carpenter, of Hngland, the new ones described for publication, and the duplicates
of the whole arranged for distribution to museums, colleges, and other establishe
ments. The publications on this subject are, Lists of North American Shells,
Circulars Relative to Collecting, an Elementary Introduction to the Study of
Conchology, and an extensive work, in two octavo volumes, on the Bibliography
of North American Conchology, by W. G. Binney, and a Monograph of the Cor
biculidze, by Temple Prime. Besides these, a number of articles are in the press
or in course of preparation.
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. 25

.

Microscopy.—Encouragement has been given to this branch of science, by im-
porting, as samples, simple forms of working microscopes, and also by stimulating
our native artists to greater exertion in the construction of this instrument, by
ordering the best that could be produced. Samples of microscopic organisms have
been collected and distributed to observers, and examinations and reports have been
made on a large number of this class of objects sent to the Institution. The pub-
lications in regard to this subject are a number of papers by Professor Bailey, of
West Point, and a very interesting Memoir, by Dr. Leidy, of Philadelphia, on a
Fauna and Flora within Living Animals.

Physiology.—No experiments on this subject have beon made under the imme-
diate direction of the Institution, although it has furnished the materials for inves-
tigation by other parties. The publications in regard to it are Chemical and
Physical Researches concerning North American Vertebrata, by Dr. J. Jones;
Researches upon the Venom of the Rattlesnake, with an investigation of the Ana-
tomy and Physiology of the Organs Concerned, by Dr. S. W. Mitchell; on the
Breathing Organs of Turtles, by Drs. Mitchell and Morehouse; on the Anatomy
of the Nervous System of Rana Pipiens, by Dr. J. Wyman; and on the Medulla
Oblongata, by Dr. John Dean.

Ethnology and Philology. —One of the earliest efforts on the part of the Insti-
tution, was directed to the advancement of the science of American Ethnology.
Its first publication, as well as introductory volume to the series of Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge, being the work of Squier and Davis, on the Ancient
Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, remains the standard treatise on this sub-
ject. This was followed by a similar work on the Antiquities of New York, by
Mr. Squier; and those of Wisconsin, by Mr. Lapham; of Ohio and of Lake
Superior, by Mr. Whittlesey; a Memoir on some Antiquities of Mexico, by Brantz
Mayer; and a general introduction to the whole subject of American Archology,
by Mr. Haven, besides many articles of less extent in one or another of the Smith-
sonian series. Several pamphlets of instructions for making observations and
collections in this science have also been issued.

In the department of Philology, also, the Institution has evinced its zeal and
activity by the publication, among others, of the elaborate work on the Dakota
Language, by Mr. Riggs; that on the Yoruba Language, by Mr. Bowen; and that
on the Chinook Jargon, by Mr. Turner and Mr. Gibbs. To Mr. Shea, of New
York, who is engaged in the preparation of a library of American languages,
annual appropriations from the funds of the Institution have been made in further-
ance of the publication of linguistic memoirs furnished by its correspondents.

Systematic efforts have been directed by the Institution to the collection of as
perfect a series as possible of the specimens of American antiquities, and of those
illustrative of the habits of the modern native tribes. Already an extensive col-
lection has been accumulated, and the preparation and distribution of a series of
colored casts of the more interesting specimens of aboriginal art have been com-
menced.
26 THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Correspondence.—The Institution has constantly received a large number of
communications, asking information on a variety of subjects, particularly in regard
to the solution of scientific questions, the names and characters of objects of natural
history, and the analysis of soils, minerals, and other materials which pertain to
the industrial resources of the country. Answers have in all cases been given to
these inquiries, either directly by the officers of the Institution, or by reports from
the Smithsonian collaborators. A considerable portion of the correspondence
burned in the office of the secretary was of this character. The loss in this case
is to be regretted, not only on account of the valuable information the letters and
answers contained, but also on account of the illustration they afforded of the in-
fluence of the Institution, and the condition of the public mind at a given time.’
Every subject connected with science which strongly attracts popular attention,
never fails to call forth a large number of inquiries and suggestions.

International Exchanges.—To facilitate the direct correspondence between the
learned institutions and scientific men of the two worlds, and the free exchange
of their publications, has, from the first, been a special object of attainment with
the Smithsonian Institution. Year by year its plans for this purpose have been
modified and improved, until the system has become as nearly complete and satis-
factory as the funds and force at its disposal will allow. At the present day it is
the great medium of scientific interecommunication between the New World and the
Old; its benefits and services being recognized alike by individuals, institutions,
and governments. Its parcels pass all the custom-houses without question or in-
terference, while American and foreign lines of transportation, with rare excep-
tions, vie with each other in the extent of the privileges accorded to it. To so
great an extent has its sphere of activity been enlarged, that it is no exaggeration
to say that a very large proportion of all international exchanges of the kind re-
ferred to are now made through its instrumentality. At the present time the In-
stitution is prepared to receive, at periods made known through its circulars, any
books or pamphlets of scientific, literary, or benevolent character which any in-
stitutions or individuals in America may wish to present to a correspondent else-
where, subject only to the condition of being delivered in Washington free of cost,
and of being accompanied by a separate list of the parcels sent. Where any party
may have special works to distribute, the Institution is always prepared to furnish
a list of suitable recipients. In many cases where works of value have been pub-
lished by the United States gr State governments, likely to be of importance to
students abroad, application has been made by the Institution for copies, in most
cases with success. The articles and volumes, when received, are assorted and
combined into packages, and these, after being properly addressed and inclosed in
boxes, are despatched to the agents of the Institution in London, Leipsic, Paris,
and Amsterdam. The boxes are there unpacked, and the contents distributed
through the proper channels; the returns for these transmissions are received by
the same agents, and boxed and forwarded to Washington, frora which point the
parcels for other parties are sent to their proper destination. All the expense of

exception of the local conveyance of single parcels by express, or otherwise, within
the United States.

ihe Fire.

On the 24th of January, 1865, a fire occurred at the Institution, which caused
the destruction of the upper part of the main building, and the towers. The loss
to the Institution was as follows: 1. The official, scientific, and miscellaneous cor-
respondence, record books, and manuscripts in the Secretary’s office. 2. The large
collection of apparatus. 3. The personal effects of Smithson. 4. A large stock
of tools and instruments. 5. All the duplicate copies of Smithsonian Reports on
hand for distribution. 6. The wood-cuts of illustrations used in the Smithsonian
publications.

Besides these, Mr. Stanley lost his gallery of Indian portraits, which had been
deposited in the Institution for a number of years ; and a large quantity of private
property was destroyed belonging to persons connected with the Institution.

The fire, however, caused no interruption in the business of the Institution;
the library, museum, and laboratory were uninjured; all its operations were carried
on as usual, and plans were immediately adopted for the reconstruction with fire-
proof materials of the parts of the building which had been damaged or destroyed.

The Grounds.

The grounds around the building were laid out by the distinguished horticul-
turist and landscape gardener, Downing, but he died while engaged in the prose-
cution of his plans.

We are indebted to the editor of the “Rural New. Yorker,” for the following
remarks relative to this subject, and for the representation of the marble monu-
ment erected to his memory :—

‘When the sad tidings of the death of Andrew Jackson Downing were announced,
many hearts were stricken, and many countenances saddened. Every lover of rural
life and rural taste felt that a friend, a brother, and a leader had fallen. The homes
of hundreds, from the foundation stone to the gable point, spoke of the departed—
even the trees and flowers of the garden told a tale of sadness. The furniture in
our parlors, the books in our libraries, spoke too plainly to our wounded hearts
of the loved and lost. Scarcely a city or villagc in our country but presented
some monument of his skill and taste, something tv remind the people how great
and irreparable was their loss—cottages whose simple yet elegant adornings taught
how truly taste may be independent of wealth; windows tempting the eye from
loveliness within, to the glorious prospect without; stately trees that seemed to
guard like sentinels the sacred precincts of home, and village churches whose walls

and spires spoke of religion to the heart.
It was at once proposed, in all parts
of the country, by Horticultural and
other Societies, that some suitable monu-
ment should be erected to the memory
of Mr. Downing, and in 1852, the
American Pomological Society  ap-
pointed a committee to superintend this
work. The design adopted by the com-
mittee was furnished by Calvert Vaux,
of Newburgh, N. Y., the late partner
of Mr. Downing, and the work executed
by Robert Launitz, an eminent sculptor ca
of New York. The monument was RRR AMT
erected in the grounds of the Smithson- ATT aL
ian Institution, at Washington, and it is Saat ili
worthy of remark, that Mr. Downing
was engaged in laying out and beautify-
ing these groundsat the time of his death.
The committee made their final report
at the Pomological meeting in Sep-
tember, 1856. The funds were supplied
by friends of Mr. Downing. ‘2 Philadel-
phia, Newburgh, Boston, Washington,
Louisville, Buffalo, and Rochester.

The principal design of the monument
consists in a large vase resting on a ped-
estal, the whole executed of the finest
Italian marble. The pattern of the vase ||
is taken from an antique of the chastest 2a :
school. The vase is four feet in height, DOWNING MONUMENT.
and measures three feet in diameter on its upper rim. The body is ornamented
with rich arabesque; acanthus leaves surround the lower part. The handles
rest on heads of satyrs, (the tutelar gods of groves and woods.) The pedestal,
resting on a carved base, and being surmounted with a carved cornice, has on each
side deep panels, relieved by varved mouldings. Hach of the panels contains
an inscription ; that upon the Northern Front reads as follows :

fis life was devoted to the improvement of the national taste
in rural art,
an office for which his genius and the natural beauty amidst
which he lived had fully endowed him.
His success was as great as his genius, and for the death of few
public men,
was public grief ever more sincere.
When these grounds were proposed, he was at once
called to design them ;
but before they were completed be perished in the wreck of the
steamer Henry Clay.
His mind was singularly just, penetrating, and original.
His manners were calm, reserved, and courteous.
His personal memory

his fame to the country which honored and laments him.

Inscription upon the Southern Front :

‘*The taste of an individual,
as well as that of a nation, will be in direct proportion to the
profound sensibility
with which he perceives the beautiful in natural scenery.”

‘‘ Open wide, therefore,
the doors of your libraries and picture galleries,
all ye true republicans!
Build halls where knowledge shall be freely diffused among men,
and not shut up within the narrow walls of
narrower institutions.
Plant spacious parks in your cities,
and unclose their gates as wide as the gates of morning to the
whole people.”
[ Downing’s Rural Essays.

Upon tke Eastern Front is inscribed :

‘Weep no more,
For Lycidus your sorrow is not dead, a
Sunk though he be beneath the wat’ry floor,
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore
Fiames in the forehead of the morning sky;
So Lycidus sunk low, but mounted high
Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves.”

Upon the Western Front is this Inscription:

I climb the hill from end to end,

Of all the landscape underneath

I find no place that does not breathe
Some gracious memory of my friend
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. oL

’ Tis held that sorrow makes us wise,
Yet how much wisdom sleeps with thee,
Which not alone had guided me,

But served the seasons that may rise ;

And doubtless unto thee is given
A life that bears immortal fruit,
In such great offices as suit

The full grown energies of Heaven.

And love will last as pure and whole
As when he loved me here in time,
And at the spiritual prime

Re-waken with the dawning soul.

On the Base of the Pedestal is the following :

the United States of America, to found at Washington, under the name
of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men; and the United States having, by
an act of Congress, received said property and accepted said trust; there-
fore, for the faithful execution of said trust according to the will of the
liberal and enlightened donor—

ing the sum of five hundred and fifteen thousand one hun-
dred and sixty-nine dollars, be lent to the United States
Treasury, at six per cent. per annum interest from the first
day of September, in the year one thousand eight hundred

convened at the time of their said organization; and such
record, or a copy thereof, certified by the Chancellor and
Secretary of the Board of Regents, shall be received in

sufficient size, and with suitable rooms, or halls, for the re-
ception and arrangement, upon a liberal scale, of objects of
natural history, including a geological and mineralogical.

SMITHSONIAN BEQUEST.
[ To accompany bill H. R. No. 187.]

' January 19, 1836.

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES.

In tae House or REPRESENTATIVES, December 21, 1835.

The message of the President of the United States, in relation to the
bequest of James Smithson, of London, for founding at Washington an
“institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men ;” was
referred to a select committee ; and

Mr. John Quincy Adams, of Massachusetts, Mr. Thomas, of Maryland,
Mr. Garland, of Virginia, Mr. Pearce, of Rhode Island, Mr. Speight, of North
Carolina, Mr. McKennon, of Pennsylvania, Mr. Hannegan, of Indiana, Mr.
Garland, of Louisiana, and Mr. Chapin, of New York, were appointed the
said committee.

Mr. Apams, from the Select Committee on the message of the President
‘relating to the bequest of James Smithson, made the following

REPORT:

The Select Committee, to which was referred the message of the Presi-
dent of the United States, of the \7th of December last, with documents
relating to the bequest of James Smithson, of London, to the United
States of America, for the purpose of founding at Washington, an
establishment under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, for the
ancrease and diffusion of knowledge among men, respectfully report :

That, from the papers transmitted to Congress with the message of the
President, it appears, that James Smithson, a foreigner, of noble family and
of affluent fortune, did, by his last will and testament, made in the year
1826, bequeath, under certain contingencies, which have since been re-
alized, and with certain exceptions, for which provision was made by the
same will, the whole of his property, of an amount exceeding four hundred
thousand dollars, to the United States of America, to found at Washington,
under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the in-
crease and diffusion of knowledge among men.

To the acceptance of this bequest, and to the assumption and fulfilment of
the high and honorable duties involved in the performance of the trust
committed with it, the Congress of the United States, in their legislative
capacity, are alone competent. Your committee believe, not only that
they are thus competent, but that it is enjoined upon them, by considera-
tions of the most imperious and indispensable obligation. The first steps
necessary to be taken for carrying into effect the benevolent intentions of
Blair & Rives, printers.
2 | [ Rep. No. 181. ]

the testator, must be to obtain the possession of the funds, now held by the:
Messrs. Drummonds, bankers in London, executors of Mr. Smithson’s will,
and subject to the superintendence, custody and adjudication of the Lord
Chancellor of England. 'To enable the President of the United States to
effect this object, the committee report herewith a bill.

But your committee think they would imperfectly discharge their duty
to this House, to their country, to the world of mankind, or to the donor of
this most munificent bequest, were they to withhold a few brief reflections,
which have occurred to them in the consideration of the subject referred to
them by the House. Reflections arising from the condition of the testator,
from the nature of the bequest and from the character of the trustee to
whom this great and solemn charge has been confided.

The testator, James Smithson, a subject of Great Britain, declares him-
self, in the caption to the will, a descendent in blood from the Percys and
the Seymours, two of the most illustrious historical names of the British
islands. Nearly two centuries since, in 1660, the ancestor of his own name,
Hugh Smithson, immediately after the restoration of the royal family of the
Stuarts, received from Charles the Second, as a reward for his eminent
services to that house during the civil wars, the dignity of a Baronet of
England, a dignity still held by the Dukes of Northumberland, as descend-
ents from the same Hugh Smithson. 'The father of the testator, by his
marriage with the Lady Elizabeth Seymour, who was descended by a
female line from the ancient Percys, and by the subsequent creation of
George the Third, in 1766, became the first Duke of Northumberland.
His son and successor, the brother of the testator, was known in the his-
tory of our revolutionary war by the name of Lord Percy ; was present, as
a British officer, at the sanguinary opening scene of our revolutionary war,
at Lexington, and at the battle of Bunker's hill; and was the bearer to the
British Government of the despatches from the commander-in-chief of the
royal forces, announcing the event of that memorable day ; and the present
Duke of Northumberland, the testator’s nephew, was the ambassador ex-
traordinary of Great Britain, sent to assist at the coronation of the late
King of France, Charles the Tenth, a few months only before the date of
this bequest from his relative to the United States of America.

The suggestions which present themselves to the mind, by the associa-
tion of these historical recollections, with the condition ‘of the testator,
derive additional interest from the nature of the bequest; the devotion of .
a large estate to an institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.

Of all the foundations of establishments for pious or charitable uses,
which ever signalized the spirit of the age, or the comprehensive benefi-
cence of the founder, none can be named more deserving of the approba-
tion of mankind than this. Should it be faithfully carried into effect,
with an earnestness and sagacity of application, and a steady perseverance:
of pursuit, proportioned to the means furnished by the will of the founder,
and to the greatness and simplicity of his design as by himself declared,
“the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” it is no extrava-
gance of anticipation to declare, that his name will be hereafter enrolled
among the eminent Lenefactors of mankind.

The attainment of knowledge, is the high and exclusive attribute of
man, among the numberless myriads of animated beings inhabitants of the.
terrestrial globe. On him alone is bestowed, by the bounty of the Creator
of the universe, the power and the capacity of acqairing knowledge.

Knowledge is the attribute of his nature, which at once enables him to
improve his condition upon earth, and to prepare him for the enjoyment
of a happier existence hereafter. It is by this attribute that man discovers
his own nature as the link between earth and heaven ; as the partaker of
an immortal spirit ; as created for higher and more durable ends, than the
countless tribes of beings which people the earth, the ocean, and the air,
alternately instinct with life, and melting into vapour, or mouldering into dust.

To furnish the means of acquiring knowledge is, therefore, the greatest
benefit that can be conferred upon mankind. It prolongs life itself, and
enlarges the sphere of existence. "The earth was given to man for cultiva-
tion, to the improvement of his own condition. Whoever increases his
knowledge, multiplies the uses to. which he is enabled to turn the gift of
his Creator to his own benefit, and partakes in some degree of that good-
ness which is the highest attribute of Omnipotence itself.

If then the Smithsonian Institution, under the smile of an approving
Providence, and by the faithful and permanent application of the means
furnished by its founder, to the purpose fer which he has bestowed them,
should prove effective to their promotion ; if they should contribute essen-
tially to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, to what
higher or nobler object could this generous and splendid donation have
been devoted ?

The father of the testator, upon forming his alliance with the heiress of
the family of the Percys, assumed, by an act of the British Parliament, that
name, and under it became Duke of Northumberland. But, renowned as is
the name of Percy in the historical annals of England, resounding as it
does from the summit of the Cheviot hills, to the ears of our children, in
the ballad of Chevy Chase, with the classical commentary of Addison ;
freshened and renovated in our memory as it has recently been from the
purest fountain of poetical inspiration, in the loftier strain of Alnwick
Castle, tuned by a bard of our own native land ;* doubly immortalized as it
is in the deathless dramas of Shakespear; “confident against the world
in arms,” as it may have been in ages long past, and may still be in the
virtues of its present possessors by inheritance ; let the trust of James
Smithson to the United States of America, be faithfully executed by their
Representatives in Congress; let the result accomplish his object, “the in-
crease and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and a wreath of more un-
fading verdure shall entwine itself in the lapse of future ages around the
name of Smithson, than the united hands of tradition, history and poetry,
have braided around the name of Percy, through the long perspective in
ages past of_a thousand years.

it is then a high and solemn trust which the testator has committed to the.
United States of America, and its execution devolves upon their Represen-
tatives in Congress, duties of no ordinary importance. he location of
the institution at Washington, prescribed by the testator, gives to Congress
the free exercise of all the powers relating to this subject with which they
are, by the constitution, invested as the local Legislature for the District of
Columbia. in adverting to the character of the trustee selected by the
testator for the fulfilment of his intentions, your committee deem it no in-
dulgence of unreasonable pride to mark it as a signal manifestation of the
moral effect of our political institutions, upon the opinions, and upon the
consequent action of the wise and the good of other regions, and of distan¢

climes ; even upon that nation from whom we generally boast of our
descent, but whom from the period of our revolution we have had too often
reason to consider as a jealous and envious rival. How different are the
sensations which should swell in our bosoms with the acceptance of this
bequest! James Smithson, an Englishman, in the exercise of his rights as:
a free-born Briton, desirous of dedicating his ample fortune to the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men, constitutes for his trustees, to ac-
complish that object, the United States of America, and fixes upon their
seat of Government as the spot where the institution of which he is the
founder, shall be located.

The revolution, which resulted in the independence of these United
States, was commenced, conducted, and consummated under a mere union
of confederated States. | Subsequently to that period, a more perfect union
was formed, combining in one system the principle of confederate sove-
reignties with that of a Government by popular representation, with legis-
lative, executive, and judicial powers, all limited, but co-extensive with
the whole confederation.

Under this Government, a new experiment in the history of mankind is
now drawing to the close of half a century, during which the territory
and number of States in the Union have nearly doubled, while their popu-
lation, wealth, and power have been multiplied more than fourfold. In
the process of this experiment, they have gone through the vicisitudes of
peace and war, amidst bitter and ardent party collisions, and the unceasing
changes of popular elections to the legislative and executive offices, both of
the general confederacy and of the separate States, without a single execu-
tion for treason, or a single proscription for a political offence. The whole
Government, under the continual superintendence of the whole people, has
been holding a steady course of prosperity, unexampled in the cotemporary
history of other nations, not Jess than in the annals of ages past. During
this period, our country has been freely visited by observers from: other
lands, and often in no friendly spirit by travellers from the native land of
Mr. Smithson. Their reports of the prevailing manners, opinions and
social intercourse of the people of this Union, have exhibited no flattering
or complacent pictures. All the infirmities and vices of our civil and
political condition have been conned and noted, and displayed with no
forbearance of severe satirical comment to set them off; yet, aiter all this, a
British subject, of noble birth and ample fortune, desiring to bequeath his
whole estate to the purpose of increasing and diffusing knowledge through-
out the whole community of civilized man, selects for the depositaries of
his trust, with confidence unqualified with reserve, the Congress of the
United States of America.

In the commission of every trust, there is an implied tribute of the soul
to the integrity and intelligence of the trustee ; and there is also an implied
call for.the faithful exercise of those properties to the fulfilment of the
purpose of the trust. The tribute and the call acquire additional force
and-energy, when the trust is committed for performance after the decease
of him by whom it is granted, when he no longer exists to witness or to
_ constrain the effective fulfilment of his design. The magnitude of the
trust, and the extent of confidence bestowed in the committal of it, do but
enlarge and aggravate the pressure of the obligation which it carries
with it. The weight of duty imposed is proportioned to the honor con-
ferred by confidence without reserve. Your committee are fully persuaded,
therefore, that, with a grateful sense of the honor conferred by the testator,.
.

[ Rep. No. 181..] 5

upon the political institutions of this Union, the Congress of the United
States, in accepting the bequest, will feel, in all its power and plentitude,
the obligation of responding to the confidence reposed by him, with all
the fidelity, disinterestedness, and perseverance of exertion, which may
carry into effective execution the noble purpose of an endowment for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.

SMITHSONIAN BEQUEST.

Message from the President of the United States, in relation to the be-
quest to the United States, by James Smithson, of London, for found-
¥

ing at Washington an establishment, to be styled “ The Smithson In-
stitution, for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

WasuHineton, December 17, 1835.
To the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States:

I transmit ta Congress a report from the Secretary of State, accompany-
ing copies of certain pavers relating to a bequest to the United States, by
Mr. James Smithson, of London, for the purpose of founding, at Washing-
ton, an establishment, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, “ for
the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The Executive
having no authority to take any steps for accepting the trust, and obtaining
the funds, the papers are communicated with a view to such measures as

Congress may deem necessary.
ANDREW JACKSON.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, December 16, 1835.

The Secretary of State has the honor to submit to the President the copy
of a recent correspondence in regard to a bequest made to the United States,
for the purpose of founding, at Washington, an institution “ for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men ;” and, at the same time, respect-
fully to suggest the propriety of laying these papers before Congress, with a
view to the adoption of such measures, on their part, as the nature of the
subject may seem to require.

JOHN FORSYTH.
To the Presrpen'r of the United States.

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,

London, July 28, 1835.

Sir: The papers which I have the honor herewith to communicate to
you, will acquaint you with the particulars of a bequest of property to a
large amount,'left to the United States by a Mr. James Smithson, for the pur-
pose, as stated in the will, of founding, at Washington, an institution “ for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” * * * The letter of
Messrs. Clarke, Fynmore & F'ladgate, the solicitors, by whom I was apprised
of the existence of the will, together with the inquiries I have made, leave
no doubt of its having been established, and its dispositions recognised by
the court of chancery, the first lecatee under it having, for several years,
6 Rep. Now ist. ]

and to the time of his death, received the income of the property, which is
stated to have amounted to upwards of £4,000 per annum.

According to the view taken of the case by the solicitors, it is now for
the United States, in the event of their accepting the bequest and the trust
coupled with it, to come forward, by their representative, and make them-
selves parties to an amicable suit before the Lord Chancellor, for the pur-
pose of legally establishing the fact of the demise of the first legatee without
children, and intestate; prove their claim to the benefit of the will, and
obtain a decree in chancery, awarding them the proceeds of the estate.
Messrs. Clarke, Fynmore & F'ladgate are willing to undertake the manage-
ment of the suit on the part of the United States; and, from what I have
learned of their standing, may safely be confided in. Not being acquainted
with the exact structure of our institutions, they are not able to point out
the exact manner in which the United States should be represented in the
contemplated suit ; but they believe that their diplomatic agent here, if con
stituted, for that purpose, the legal representative of the President, would
be recognised by the court of chancery as the proper organ of the United
States, for all the purposes of the will.

Should it be thought unnecessary to await the action of Congress to
authorize the institution of the requisite legal proceedings, and should the
course suggested by the solicitors meet the views of the President, his power
of attorney, authorizing the diplomatic agent here to act in his name, will, I
apprehend, be necessary ; and, as the suit will involve some expense not con-
nected with the contingent fund of the legation, your instructions upon this
branch of the subject will likewise be desirable.

I am, sir, with great respect,
Your obedient servant,
A. VAIL.
Joun Forsytu, Esquire,
Secretary of State of the United States, Washington.

Sir: We send you, enclosed, the copy of a will of Mr. Smithson, on the
subject of which we yesterday did ourselves the pleasure of waiting upon
you, and we avail ourselves of the opportunity to repeat, in writing, what
we verbally communicated.

Pursuant to the instructions contained in the will, an amicable suit was,
on the death of the testator, instituted in chancery by Mr. Hungerford,
against Messrs. Drummonds, the executors, under which suit the assets were
realized. ‘They were very considerable ; and there is now standing, in the
name of the accountant general of the court of chancery, on the trusts of
the will, stock amounting in value to about £100,000. During Mr. Hun-
gerford’s life he received the income arising from this property; but news
has just reached England that Mr. Hungerford has died abroad, leaving no
child surviving him.

it now becomes necessary that measures should be taken for the purpose
of getting the decision of the court of chancery, as to the further disposi-
tion of the property. On reference to the will, it will appear that it is not
very clearly detined to whom, on behalf of the United States, the property
should be paid or transferred; indeed, there is so much doubt, that we ap-
prehend that the attorney general must, on behalf of the crown of England,
be joined in the proceedings which it is requisite that the United States
should institute.
f Rep. No. ISP. ] 7

We act in this matter for Messrs. Drummond, the bankers, who are mere
stake-holders, and who are ready to do all in their power to facilitate getting
the decision of the court, and carrying into effect the testator’s intentions.
We shall therefore be happy to communicate with such professional advi-
sers as your Government may think fit to appoint to act for them in this coun-
try. In the mean time, we may perhaps be permitted to add, that it is perfectly
competent for us to carry on the proceedings, on behalf of the United
States, and possibly some expense and delay may be avoided by our so doing.

Having thus briefly stated the nature of the business, we at present ab-
stain from making any suggestion as to the party in whose name pro-
ceedings should be adopted, considering the point should be determined by
our counsel here, after the opinion of the proper law officers in the States
has been taken on the subject.

Any further information you may require, we shall be happy to give you,
and are, sir, Your most obedient servants,

CLARK, FYNMORE & FLADGATE,

A. Vait, Esquire, 49 York Terrace.

I, James Smithson, son of Hugh, first Duke of Northumberland, and
Elizabeth, heiress of the Hungerfords of Audley, and niece of Charles the
Proud, Duke of Somerset, now residing in Bentinck street, Cavendish
square, do this 23d day of October, 1826, make this my,last will and testament.

I bequeath the whole of my property of every nature and kind soever, to
my bankers, Messrs. Drummonds of Charing Cross, in trust, to be disposed
of in the following manner, and desire of my said executors to put my
property under the management of the court of chancery.

To John Fitall, formerly my servant, but now employed in the London
Docks, and residing at No. 27 Jubilee Place, North Mile End, Old Town,
in consideration of his attachment and fidelity to me, and the long and
great care he has taken of my effects, and my having done but very little
for him, [give and bequeath the annuity or annual sum of £100 sterling for
his life, to be paid to him quarterly, free from legacy duty, and all other
deductions, the first payment to be made to him at the expiration of three
months after my death. I have at divers times lent sums of money to
Henry Honoré Juilly, formerly my servant, but now keeping the Hunger-
ford Hotel, in the Rue Caumartin at Paris, and for which sums of money I
have undated bills or bonds signed by him. Now, [ will and direct that if
he desires it, these sums of money be let remain in his hands at an interest
of five per cent. for five years after the date of the present will.

To Henry James Hungerford, my nephew, heretofore called Henry James
Dickinson, son of my late brother Lieut. Col. Henry Louis Dickinson, now
residing with Mr. Auboin, at Bourg la Reine, near Paris, I give and be?
queath for his life the whole of the income arising from my property of
every nature and kind whatever, after the payment of the above annuity,
and after the death of John Fitall, that annuity likewise, the payments to
be at the time the interest or dividends become due on ihe stocks or other
property from which the income arises.

Should the said Henry James Hungerford have a child or children, legiti.
mate or illegitimate, I leave to such child or children, his or their heirs,
executors and assigns, after the death of his, her or their father, the whole
of my property, of every kind, absolutely and forever, to be divided between
8 tavep. No. 181. ]

them, if there is more than one, in the manner their father shall judge
proper, and in case of his omitting to decide this, as the Lord Chancellor
shall judge proper.

Should my said nephew, Henry James Hungerford marry, I empower
him to make a jointure. ,

In case of the death of my said ngphew without leaving a child or chil-
dren, or of the death of the child or children he may have had under the
age of 21 years or intestate, [ then bequeath the whole of my property,
subject to the annuity of £100 to John Fitall, and for the security and pay-
ment of which I mean stock to remain in this country, to the United
States of America, to found, at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of know-
ledge among men.

I think it proper here to state, that all the money which will be standing in
the French five per cents. at my death, inthe names of the father of my
above mentioned nephew, Henry James Hungerford, and all that in my
name, is the property of my said nephew, being what he inherited from his
father, or what I have laid up for him from the savings upon his income.

Lonvon, September 24, 1836.

Sir: 1 had the honor to inform you, on the 31st ‘of August, of my
arrival at Liverpool, aes embarked in the first ship that sailed from New
York after my letter of the Ist of August, informing you that I was ready.

I reached this city the early part of the present ‘month, and, as soon as
circumstances w ould permit, entered upon the duty which the President’s
power of attorney devolves upon me.

‘owards asserting and presecuting with effect before the legal tribunals of
Engiand the claim of the United States to the legacy bequeathed to them by
James Smithson of London, to found,at Washington, an institution “for the in-
crease and diffusion of know ledge among men, > the first consideration which
seemed to present itself was, the selection of fit legal characters here, through
whose aid pe instrumentality the incipient steps could alone be judiciously
maerked out adopted. Ina country where the profession of the law is
known to bes Je) arn Givided as in this, Pregarded it important that not only the
counsel whose services it may ult imately. become necessary to engage, but the
solicitors to be approached in the first instance, should have a standing
suited to the nature of the case, and dignity of the constituent 1 represent.
The letter addressed you in July, 1835, by the late chargé @’ affaires of
the United States at this court, left little doubt, indeed, that Messrs. C arke,
Fynmore, and Fladgate were proper solicitors; yet, as the President’s

ower to me, and your imstructions, appeared iG fae the whole subjess:
Vis he

anew in my hands, some pe nqwry into their standing seemed
necessary on my part. This [ set on foot, and am glad to say ihat it ended
to my satisfaction ; the more, as ‘their connexion with the case in its origin
nati ally pointed to their sclection, other grounds continuing to justify, it.

Accordingly, on the 14th instant I addressed a note to these solicitors in-
forming them that [had arrived in this country with full power from the Presi- _
dent, founded upon an act cf Congress, to assert the right of the United States
to the Smithsonian bequest, and receite the money; and requesting that
they would call upon meon the 16th. A copy of my note is enclosed. This
is a season of the year when professional and official business of every kind
F. Doc..No. 51, | 3

is much at a pause in London, and those who conduct it dispersed. It
was not until the 20th that I was enabled to command an interview with
these gentlemen, when two of them, Mr. Ciarke and Mr. Fladgate, waited
upon me, the latter having previously called, after ae my note, to
mention the absence of his associates from town. With these two, Thad
the preliminary conversation suited to a first interview. They chiefly
went over the grounds stated in their note of the 21st of July, to our charge
dafiaires, Mr. Vail ; in some points enter them and giving new
particulars. They said that James Smithson, the testator, died in June,
1829; that his will was proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury, by
Mr. Charles Drummond, one of the executors, and one of the banking-house
of that name in London ; that Henry James Hungerford, the testator’s s nephew,
to whom was bequeathed the whole of his property for life, subject to a small
annuity to another person, brought an amicable suit in chancery against
Messrs. Drummond, the executors for the purpose of having the testator’s
assets administered under the direction of the Lord Chancellor; in the course
of which suit the usual orders and decrees were made, and by its issue
assets ascertained aud realized to the value of about one hundred thousand
pounds sterling; that Mr. Hungerford, who resided out of England, re-
ceived up to the time of his death the dividends arising from the property,
which consisted of stock in the public funds ; and that he died at Pisa; on
the 5th of June, 1835, of full age, though still young, without having
been married, and, as far-as 1s yet known, without illegitimate child or
children ; th: at the assets of the estate are now invested in the name of
the accountant-general of the court of chancery, subject to the further
disposition of the court; that the will of Mr. Smithson having made the
United States the final lecatee on Mr. Hungerford’s death without child or
children, legitimate or illegitimate, the facts seem to have happened under
whieh fice right will attach : but the solicitors continue to think that a
suit, or legal proceedings of some nature, to which the United States must
be party, will have to be instituted in the court of chancery, i In order to
make mali their right and enable them to get possession of the fund, now
in the hands of the court, and subject to its judgment.

The foregoing formed the main purport of their communication. They
added, that the mother of Henry James Hu ngerford, who is still living,
and ed toa Mrenchman of the name of De la Batiut, has put ina
claim to a part of the property ; but as the claim is small and not likely to
come to much, the mother of Mr. Hungerford not having been married to
his father, it is scarcely necessary at this time to detail the circumstances.

Lasked at what time from the present the earliest sitting of the court
of chancery would be held. hey replied in November. It will be my
object to get the fund for the United Stat es without a oo in chanee TV
of any kind, if this be practicable ; and towards an end so desirable, iny
further reflections and measures will for a while be directed, taking care
that I do not lose the advantage of all proper applications at the first term
of the court, for whatever form of suit or other legal proceedings may be
found indispensable. ‘

1 have nothing further of any importance to communicate at this june-
ture. [delivered to the minister ae he United States, Mr. Stevenson, the:

Sir: I had yesterday the honor to receive your letter of the 27th of
December, enclosing the President’s renewal of my power to prosecute the
Smithsonian claim, and receive the money for the United States when-
ever the same may be oe It remains uncertain, as intimated in
my communication of the 27th of October, whether the exhibition of the
new power will be eventually domautaed but even if not, I trust the
President will think it has been erring on the safe side, after what passed,
to have it in my possession.

After my letter of the 16th of December, I had fully hoped that the
evidence of which it makes mention would have been obtained from
France before this time; but it seems that the French attorneys, who
were written to upon the subject by our solicitors, mistook some of their

instructions at first, which led to delay. They are now in expectation ..f

receiving it daily.
I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,
RICHARD RUSH.
The Hon. Joun Forsyrs,
Secretary of State.

Lonpon, Febrtary 12, 1838.

Sir: The day after my last number was sent off, I received information
from the solicitors that some of the evidence expected from France had
arrived, but that it was not of validity to repe! the claim of Madame de la
Batt. From as much, however, as it disclosed, they pronounced a strong
opinion that ifa fee commission issued from the court, evidence might
finally be had that would defeat it.

On fully weighing what they said, I wrote them.a note on the 3d
instant, requesting answers to the following inquiries :

1. What would be the probable expense of a commission ?

2, How much time would be required for its execution and return ?

3, Supposing the evidence obtained under it to be sufficient in their
opinion, our counsel’s, and my own, to defeat the claim; yet, as the legal
advisers of Madame de la Batut might not take the same view of it, and
thence contest it, what further delays might such a turn in the case become
the means of producing : ? (J enclose a copy of my note.)

J received an answer from them dated the 8th, a copy of which is also
enclosed. ’

_ Referring specifically to my inquiries, it will be seen—

1, That they estimate the expense of a commission at one hundred and
fifty pounds.

2, That they think it might be executed and returmed within three
om

That, assuming the requisite evidence to be obtained, they incline to
think the suit might be wound up before the rising of the court for the
long vacation, (which means in August next ;) but after the introductory
observations of their note, which advert to the uncertainty of all previous

calculations as to the duration of suits in chancery, they leave me to judge
how far this opinion of theirs is to be relied upon; and they conclude

— >
Doe. No. 10. 3

with an intimation that the case might, in the end, be taken before the
House of Lords on appeal; in which event the delay, they add, would be
“very great.”

I have determined, under these circumstances, not to seek further evi-
dence by a commission to France or otherwise for defeating the claim,
and accordingly wrote to them, on the 9th instant, to proceed with all ex-
pedition in bringing the suit to a close without it. A copy of this note is
also enclosed. As to bringing interrogatories into the master’s office for
the personal examination of Madame de la Batut and her husband, as
adverted to in the answer from the solicitors, I say nothing of the objec-
tions to that mode of getting at more evidence, the solicitors themselves
forestalling me by an admission that they could not be certain of its
success.

I hope that the determination to which I have come will be approved
as judicious. This claim has been already, by full scrutiny and resistance,
greatly cut down from its original injustice and extravagance, as a refer-
ence to my No. 12, of the 24th of last June, will show. That it might
be wholly defeated by going on to pursue measures within our power, I
incline to believe. ‘The solicitors tell me that they think so decidedly, and
their letter is to the same effect. But it is now necessary to balance the
advantage to be gained by doing so against the time and money it would
cost. The report in favor of the claimant, as the master has determined
to make it in the state of the evidence as now before him, will not, by the
information I have reccived and heretofore communicated, be likely to ex-
ceed one hundred and fifty pounds a year, payable during her life; to which
will have to be added a few years of arrears, calculated on the basis of
whatever may be the precise amount of the annuity allowed. The claim-
ant, as far as I can learn, is about sixty years old. Hence, supposing
that measures necessary for the total defeat of her claim occupied only
another twelvemonth, it seems probable that the very cost of the agency
for going on with them, added to all unforeseen legal fees and expenses,
might prove more than the annuity is worth. That the suit would be
lengthened out another twe!vemonth by going into the measures in ques-
tion, can scarcely, I think, be deemed a strained inference, from all that the
solicitors say in their letter, not to dwell upon contingencies coming within
its scope that might make the time longer. Should the suit reach the
House of Lords, for example, by appeal, it would not be easy to assign
a limit to its duration.

I trust, therefore, it will be thought that I exercise a proper discretion,
as representing the interests of the United States, in determining not to
expose myself to any of these hazards, and new ones that might even
chance to spring out of them as time was opened for their operation. It
seems to me, conclusively, that I should henceforth rather strive to obtain
a decision of their suit as speedily as possible, regardless of the small and
temporary diminution of the fund, should it be finally adjudged in their
favor, which the foregoing payments to Madame de la Batut would occa-
sion. Opposition has been effectively made to the claim up to the point,
it is believed, that duty enjoined and prudence would sanction; to go
farther seems not reconcilable with the latter, under the certain and con-
tingent delays and dangers I set forth.

The occasion may be a fit one for remarking, that when this claim first
assumed a vexatious aspect last summer, my immediate wish and sug-
gestions were to get a decree in favor of the United States for the general
4 Doc. No. 19.

fund, leaving such fractional portion of it swb judice as would have been
sufficient to satisfy the claim if established; thus cutting short delay from
this source, by which this agency might have had the chance to be closed
the sooner, and the bulk of the fund secured to the United States at the
earliest possible day. The last I hold an object of pressing importance,
encompassed, as all law-suits more or less are, (to say nothing, of the pe-
euliar nature of this,) by hidden risks. But it was part of the vexation of
the claim that our legal advisers found the course I desired to pursue im-
practicable, for the reason mentioned in the letter of the solicitors of the
22d of July, a copy of which was forwarded with my No. 15 on the 19th
of August.

Now that this obstruction is removed from my path by the determina-
tion I have taken in regard to it, I indulge the hope that no new one will
be thrown across it; and can only repeat the assurance, that nothing
within my power shall be left undone towards accelerating the suit, anx~
iously desiring, on all public and personal accounts, (if I may speak in the
latter sense,) to see it terminated.

In the continued hope that the decision, when it comes, may be favor-
able, | have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

Fepsrvary 3, 1838.

GenTLEMEN: | understood, when with you on Wednesday, that the
evidence obtained from France would not, in your opinion, be found suffi-
cient to prevent the master’s report embracing an allowance in Madame
de la Batut’s favor of about one hundred and fifty pounds a year during her
life, with some arrearages calculated on that basis; and the evidence, as
you exhibited and otherwise made it known to me, certainly led my mind
to the same conclusion.

You added that, by sending out a commission from the court of chan-
cery to Paris, (a process not yet resorted to,) you thought that evidence
might still be obtained to defeat her claim; on which subject I should be
glad to receive answers to the following inquiries, as far as in your power
to give them to me: ' j

1st. What would be the probable expense of that process?

2d. How long before its full execution and return might be expected?

3d. Assuming that the evidence, when so obtained, struck your minds,
our counsel’s, and my own, as sufficient to defeat the claim; yet as it might
not happen that the legal advisers of Madame de la Batut would take the —
same view of it, and thence contest its validity before the court, what fur-
ther delays might such a turn in the case be likely, under all the cireum-
stances, to lead to? :

As I have so repeatedly made known to you my desire for the speediest
decision of the case that may be practicable consistently with justice to the
United States, 1 make no apology for asking a reply to these inquiries at
as early a day as may be convenient.

I remain your obedient servant,
RICHARD RUSH.

43 CRAVEN-STREET, STRAND,
February 8, 1838.

Duar Str: We have ‘to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the
3d instant, containing certain queries touching the measures which may
be adopted in respect of the claim of Madame de la Batut.

In reply, we beg to*state that, so long as proceedings in the English
court of chancery are conducted as amicable suits, when both parties
unite in a wish to obtain the direction of the court, without unnecessary
delay, it is a matter of no great difficulty to calculate their probable dura-
tion; but circumstances sometimes arise, even in such suits, that prove
the calculations fallacious. When once, however, a suit ceases to be so
conducted, and parties come in whose interest it is to throw impediments
in the way of a decision, any calculation as to either delay or expense
must be a matter of little better than guess. So many unforeseen points
may arise, and the practice of the courts affords such facilities for a hostile
party to obstruct the course of justice, that the most experienced lawyers
hesitate before they attempt to give an opinion upon the subject. If in
the present case Madame de la Batut’s claim be further resisted, the suit
will become one to which these observations apply; or Madame de la
Batut might perhaps abandon the claim now brought in, and try to im-
pede us by filing an original bill for its establishment. We do not think
this likely, but it is not impossible.

Having said thus much, we will proceed to answer the queries.

We think that within three months evidence might be obtained of the
facts necessary to defeat Madame de la Batut’s claim, and that such evi-
dence might be procuredeither by sending over a commission to Paris for the
examination of witnesses, or by bringing interrogatories into the master’s
office for the personal examination of Madame de la Batut and her hus-
band. We now know so much of the case that Madame de la Batut
would hardly venture to deny any of the necessary facts; but this is not
quite certain.

We think that the expense of a commission to examine witnesses would
not exceed £150. The expense of interrogatories for the examination of
Madame de la Batut would be trifling; probably thirty or forty pounds.

Assuming that the requisite evidence were obtained, we are inclined to
think that, notwithstanding Madame de la Batut’s resistance, the suit
might be wound up before the rising of the court for the long vacation ;

i but, after the observations we have thought it our duty to make in the
early part of this letter, you will be able to judge how far this opinion can
be relied on.

You will bear in mind that the decision of the master is not final. Ex-
ceptions may be taken to his report, and argued before the court; and
even an aypeal may be brouglit against the decision of the vice-chancellor,
or master of the rolls,and the cause might be taken to the House of
Lords. The delay under such circumstances would be very great.

We are your very faithful and obedient servants,
CLARKE, FYNMORE, & FLADGATE.

Ricuarp Rusu, Esq.

[With Mr. Rush’s No. 21.]’
Fesruary 9, 1838.

GenTLEMEN: Your communication of yesterday’s date was received,
and is satisfactory by its fuliess and candor.

Under its representations, I determine not to seek further evidence, by
a commission to Paris or otherwise, for the purpose of further reducing
the claim of Madame de la Batut.

Let the master’s report in this respect be, therefore, made in the state
I understood it to have been settled by him ; and, how that I take this
determination, I trust that it will be made at a very early day.

I need scarcely reiterate to you my most earnest wishes for a speedy
decision of the case, or my instructions that you will urge it on with
all the expedition in your power.

In the hope that the decision will be in all things favorable, as well as
speedy, I remain your faithful and obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

To Messrs. CLarKE, Fynmore, and FLrapG@arte.

No. 22.
Lonpon, March 28, 1838.

Sir: Since the date of my last letter, the report of the master has been
duly made, and yesterday it was confirmed.

This is a step forward in the case which I am at length happy to an-
nounce. It is second in importance only to the decree of the court on the
whole merits, and has laid the best foundation for speedily obtaining that
decree.

The precise sum that the report allows to Madame la Batut is one hun-
dred and fifty pounds and nine shillings, to be paid to her annually during
her life, with a payment of arrears, to be calculated on this basis, from
some period in 1834; the exact date of which I have not at this moment,
but will mention when I next write.

The court takes a recess next week for the Easter holidays : these will
last until the 17th or 20th of April. The case will be set down for an-
other hearing before the court at as early a day as 1can command after it
reassembles. A decree, I am informed, will be pronounced after this
hearing on all the facts as settled by the master—a favorable one, as I
hope, for the United States.

By the determination I took respecting the claim of Madame la Batut,
as announced in my last, her professional ‘advisers, knowing that she can
now get no more than the report allows her, are interested in co-operating
with me towards a prompt decision, instead of resorting to adverse pro-
ceedings to prolong or thwart it—a course which they have been more or
less pursuing hitherto.

On better grounds than ever I think I may, therefore, flatter myself that
the case approaches its conclusion; and I will only add that its remaining
stages shall be watched by me with a care proportioned to the auspicious
results that I believe to be near at hand.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

Secretary of State.

No. 23. ,
Lonpon, 4pril 24, 1838.

Sir: The court reassembled last week, since which I have been doing
all that is practicable, by personal calls upon the solicitors and otherwise,
to urge on the case ; and sha!] continue this course.

Judging by all they say to me, and my own knowledge of the pres-
ent situation of the case, I have a confident and, I trust, well-founded be-
lief that May will not elapse without its being brought to a hearing.

Referring to my No. 22, I now beg leave to state that the 22d of Sep-
tember, 1834, is the date from which the annuity allowed by the master’s
report to Madame la Batut was to commence ; and that the arrears to be
paid to her, in the event of a decision in favor of the United States, were
to be computed from that time to the 22d of March last. This makes
three years and six months, so that the sum due on an annuity of £150 9s.
would be £526 11s. 6d.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

Hon. Jonn Forsyru,

Secretary of State.

No. 24.

Lonpon, May 3, 1838.

Sir: I am glad to say that the confidence expressed in my last that a
hearing of the case was near at hand has been justified, even sooner than
I expected, for it was heard on the 1st of this month, and I am now to
have the honor of reporting to you the nature of the hearing.

Mr. Pemberton, our leading counsel, rose, and after. recapitulating the
general nature of the case, as formerly heard by the court, proceeded to
state that the reference to the master, as ordered by the decree in Febru-
ary, 1837, had duly taken place, and that all the requisite evidence had
been obtained in England and frem Italy and France, as to the facts on
the happening of which the United States were to become entitled to the
fund bequeathed by Mr. Smithson for the purpose mentioned in his will.
These facts I need not here repeat, being already set forth specially in my
No. 9, of the 25th of March, 1837.

Overlooking a volume of matter merely technical in the evidence and
report, or now become immaterial to the main points, it will be sufficient
to say that it was satisfactorily established by the former that Henry James
Hungerford, named in the pleadings, was dead; that he died at Pisa, in
the summer of 1835; that he was not married at the time of his death, nor
at any time; and that he died childless. It was not found how old he
was at the time of his death; nor is that material to any of the issues.
As to John Fitall, it was found that he died in London, in June, 1834; and
as to Madame de la Batut, the mother of Henry James Hungerford, the
master, on the evideuce before him, found her to have a claim on the estate
of Mr. Smithson to the amount of one hundred and fifty pounds and nine
shillings a year, payable as long as she lives, and for the arrears of this
annual allowance from the 22d of September, 1834, to the 22d of last
March.

The establishment of all the foregoing facts will be found to meet the
8 Dee. No. 10.

essential inquiries to which the master’s attention was directed by the
court’s first decree, as reported in my No. 9. Mr. Smithson’s will hav-
ing provided, among other things, that on the death of his nephew,
Henry James Hungerford, “ without leaving child or children,’’ the whole
of his property should go to the United States; and this primary fact being.
now incontestably established in due and legal form under the authority
of the court, and all other proof required by the pleadings obtained, Mr.
Pemberton asked for a decree declaring the United States entitled to the
property. The representative of the attorney general, who was present
in court, said that he believed every thing had been established, as stated,.
and that the rules relating to public charities, as applicable to this case,
calling for no objection on the part of the Crown, none would be inter-
posed—a course that falls in with what was said by the same officer on
the occasion of the first decree, as reported in my No. 7.

The counsel of the defendants, Messieurs Drummond, agreed also to.
what was stated, and had nothing to allege in opposition to the claim of
the United States.

The counsel of Madame la Batut were also content; the course I took,.
as made known in my No. 21, having put an end to opposition from that
quarter.

All essential facts being at length fully and formally established, and
opposition from all quarters quieted by the measures I have directed,
there seemed no reason why a decree in favor of the United States should
not at once be pronounced; but Mr. Pemberton having stated that, in the
end, a petition would have to be presented for a transfer of the fund to me,,
as representing the United States, the master of the rolls said that he:
would pause upon his final decision until that petition was presented.

It is thus that the case now stands. It will come on again one day
next week, and I have every ground for believing that my next commu-
nication will inform you of a decree having passed declaring the United
States entitled to the fund. WAVE:

Should the forms of chancery require any authentication of my power
io receive the fund that Mr. Stevenson can give, he will be ready, at any
moment, to give it, as he has assured me; and should his important aid
be otherwise needed in any way before the suit is closed, I shall not scruple
io call upon him, knowing how zealously he would afford it.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

The Hon. Joun Forsyru,
Secretary of State.

No. 25.
Lonpon, May 12, 1838.
Sir: I have great satisfaction in announcing to you, for the President’s
information, that the case came on to be heard again on the 9th instant,.
when a decree was solemnly pronounced, adjudging the Smithsonian be-
quest to the United States.
Both my powers had been previously lodged with the court—not one
only, as stated in newspaper reports of the case; and no question was
aised as to my full authority to receive the money on behalf of the United
iates, without calling for any further authentication of my powers.
The suit is therefore ended without fear of more delays; nothing buta
Doc. No. 10. 3

few forms remaining to put me in actual possession of the fund. These
I have the hope may be completed within the present month.

The fund is invested in the stocks of this country, of which I shall, in
due time, have an exact account. The largest portion is in the three per
cent. annuities. The entire aggregate amounts to fully one hundred thou-
sand pounds; and this, according to my present information, exclusive of
about five thousand pounds to be reserved by the court to meet the an-
nual charge in favor of Madame la Batut during her life ; the sum produ-
cing it to revert to the United States when she dies.

As soon as the decree is formally made up, the accountant general of
the court will transfer all the stock to me, under its sanction, except the
small sum to be reserved as above.

Having no special instructions as to what I am to do with it, my pres-
ent intention is to sell the whole, at the best time and for the best prices
tobe commanded, and bring it over in gold for delivery to the Treasurer
of the United States, in fulfilment of the trust with which I am charged.
But I will reflect further upon the mode of bringing it home, and adopt
that which, under all circumstances, may seem best.

The result I announce will, I trust, justify, in the President’s eyes, the
determination I took to let the allowance made to Madame la Batut by
the master’s report stand, without attempting to overset it, whatever
might have been the prospect or assurance of ultimate success. The
longer the suit lasted, the greater were the risks to which it was exposed.
A large sun of money, fhe whole mentioned above, was to go out of the
kingdom, unless an heir could be found to a wandering young English-
man, who had died in Italy at eight or nine and twenty,* and whose
mother, never lawfully married, still lives in France. Here was basis
eaough for the artful and dishonest to fabricate stories of heirship, on alle-
gations of this young Englishman having been married. That fact as-
sumed, the main stumbling-block to their devices would have disappear-
ed. Fabrications to this effect might have been made to wear the sem-
blance of truth by offers in the market of perjury of Italy, France, and
England—incidents like these being familiar to history, whether we take
public annals, or those of families ; and although the combinations, how-
ever craftily set on foot, might have been defeated in the end, it is easy
to perceive that time and expense would have been required to defeat
them. ‘The possibility of their being formed (never to be regarded as
very remote while the suit remained open) made it my first anxiety, as it
wasalways my first duty, to have it decided as soon as possible, and to take
care even that it moved on during its pendency with no more of publicity
to its peculiar circumstances than could be avoided. I trust that both
these feelings have been discernible in the general current of my letters
to you, reporting all the steps I have taken in it from my first arrival.

Need I add, as a further incentive to despatch, had further been want-
ing, that events bearing unfavorably upon the public affairs of this coun-
try, above all upon the harmony or stability of its foreign relations,
would not have failed to operate inauspiciously upon the suit, if in nothing
else, by causing stocks to fall. They did begin to fall on the first news
of the rebellion in Canada, not recovering until the accounts of its sup-
pression arrived. The case is now beyond the reach of accident, whether

from political causes, or others inherent in its nature; and that its fina,
decision thus early has been brought about by the course adopted in Feb-
ruary, 1am no longer permitted to doubt. arly may at first seem a
word little applicable, after one entire year and the best part of a second
have been devoted to getting the decision ; but when the proverbial de-
lays of chancery are considered, (and they could hardly have become a
- proverb without some foundation,) it may not, perhaps, be thought wholly
out of place. Although neither the counsel nor solicitors gave their pre-
vious advice to the course, it being a point of conduct for my decision
rather than of law for theirs, it is yet satisfactory to be able to state that
they approved it afterwards. They regarded it as best consulting the
interests of the United States, on every broad view of a case where a
great moral object, higher than the pecuniary one, was at stake, enhan-
cing the motives for rescuing it, at the earliest fit moment, from all the
unavoidable risks and uncertainties of the future. A fortnight has not
elapsed since it was said in the House of Commons by an able member
that “a chancery suit was a thing that might begin with a man’s life and
its termination be his epitaph.”’

On the whole, I ask leave to don eraiaglete the President and yourself
on the result. A suit of higher interest and dignity has rarely, perhaps,
been before the tribunals of a nation. If the trust created by the testa-
tor’s will be successfully carried into effect by the enlightened legislation
of Congress, benefits may flow to the United States and to the human
family not easy to be estimated, because operating silently and gradually
throughout time, yet operating not the less effectually. Not to speak of
the inappreciable value of letters to individual and social man, the monu-
ments which they raise to a nation’s glory often last when others perish,
and seem especially appropriate to the glory of a republic whose founda-
tions are laid in the presumed intelligence of its citizens, and can only be
strengthened and perpetuated as that improves. May I also claim to share
in the pleasure that attends on relieved anxiety now that the suit is ended ?

I have made inquiries from time to time, in the hope of finding out
something of the man, personally a stranger to our people, who has
sought to benefit distant ages by founding, in the capital of the American
Union, an institution (to describe it in his own simple and comprehensive
language) FOR THE INCREASE AND DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE AMONG MEN.
I have not heard a great deal. What I have heard and may confide in
amounts to this: That he was, in fact, the natural son of the Duke of
Northumberland; that his mother was a Mrs. Macie, of an ancient fam-
ily in Wiltshire of the name of Hungerford; that he was educated at,
Oxford, where he took an honorary degree in 1786; that he went under’
the name of James Lewis Macie until a few years after he had left
the university, when he took that of Smithson, ever after signing only
James Smithson, as in his will; that he does not appear to have had any
fixed home, living in lodgings when in London, and occasionally staying
a year or two at a time in cities on the continent, as Paris, Berlin, Flor-
ence, Genoa, at which last he died; and that the ample provision made
for him by the Duke of Northumberland, with retired and simple habits,
enabled him to accumulate the fortune which now passes to the United
States. I have inquired if his political opinions or bias were supposed to
be of a nature that led him to select the United States as the great trustee
ft his enlafged and philanthropic views, The reply has been, that his
Doc. No. 10. li

Opinions, as far as known or inferred, were thought to favor monarchical
rather than popular institutions; but that he interested himself little in
questions of government, being devoted to science, and chiefly chemistry;
that this had introduced him to the society of Cavendish, Wollaston, and
others advantageously known to the Royal Society in London, of which
body he was a member, and to the archives of which he made contribu-
tions; and that he also became acquainted, through his visits to the con-
tinent, with eminent chemists in France, Italy, and Germany. Finally,
that he was a gentleman of feeble health, but always of courteous though
reserved manners and conversation.

Such I learn to have been some of the characteristics of the man whom
generations to come may see cause to bless, and whose will may enrol
his name with the benefactors of mankind.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Lonpon, June 5, 1838.

Sin: With all my exertions to have the forms necessary for putting me
in possession of the Smithsonian fund completed in May, it will be seen,
from the enclosed copy of a letter to me from the solicitors, in reply to one
I wrote them on the last of May, (a copy of which is also enclosed,) that
it is only to-day that all the forms have been finally and fully completed.

After getting this information, I went immediately to the proper depart-
ment of the accountant general of the court of chancery at the Bank of
England, and find that there has been transferred to me the following
stock, viz: !

1. Sixty-four thousand five hundred and thirty-five pounds eighteen
shillings and nine pence in the consolidated three per cent. annuities, com-
monly called consols by abbreviation.

2. Twelve thousand pounds in reduced three per cent. annuities.

3. Sixteen thousand one hundred pounds in bank stock.

The books at the bank show the above stock to have been regularly
transferred to me under the authority of the court of chancery, by the
accountant general, as the proper officer of the court, in virtue of the
deeree reported in my last; and I have accepted the same on the books,
on behalf of the United States, by signing my name to a form of accept-
ance drawn out under each transfer.

The above stock constitutes, with the exception of five thousand and
fifteen pounds, the whole property left by Mr. Smithson to the United
States, and now recovered for them, with the further exception of some
-small sum in cash, to which the solicitors refer as still to come from the
accountant general, but of which I have as yet no statement.

The sum of five thousand and fifteen pounds in consols, it has been
decreed by the court is to be reserved and set apart to answer the annuity
payable to Madame la Batut; the principal to revert to the United States
on the death of the annuitant.
12 Doc. No. 10.

I have taken care to instruct the solicitors to see that there is due prootr
at all times of the annuitant being in full life as the half-yearly payments
are made to her.

Although the aggregate of the stock transferred as above is under one
hundred thousand pounds in its nominal amount, there is no doubt what-
ever but that the sale of it will yield more than that sum.

The transfer by the accountant general was made to me only to-day ;
and this is so far fortunate as that it could not otherwise have been effect-
ed as to the principal part of the stock (viz: the three per cent. annuities)
until the 17th of July, the books closing after to-day for the transfer of
this species of stock wntilthe date I mention.

The important operation of selling the stock now remains to be con-
ducted, and shail claim my careful attention. I design to go into the city
to-morrow, with a view to adopting the earliest measures for this purpose ;
iaking advice, in aid of my own judgment, for so managing the sales as
best to promote the interests of the United States.

I continue to think that the best mode of bringing home the money
will be in gold, in English sovereigns. Exchange is low, and so will in-
surance be at this season; and on all accounts it seems to me the prefer-
able mode in which to realize the fund, and deliver it over to the Treasurer
of the United States on my arrival, in final discharge of the trust confided
to me.

I shall hope to make some report of my steps by the next packet; and
in the mean time have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obe-
dient servant,

GrentLemen: I need scarcely again make known to you what I have
so frequently urged. in person since the decision on the 9th instant, viz :
my anxiety to have the necessary document from the proper office of the
court, by which the Smithsonian fund adjudged to the United States may
be placed at my disposal. But, whatever the past obstacles which you
may not have been able to prevent, I must ask the favor of your renewe
and best exertions for causing me to be put in possession of it at the earli-,
est possible day ; the more so, as we are now at the end of the month, and
my being invested with the requisite authority is an indispensable pre-
liminary to arrangements for selling the stock advantageously in June,
prior to my embarkation with the fund for the United States. Your past
attention to the case is a pledge to me that you will do all in your power
to fulfil my wishes; in which assurance I remain,

Your obedient servant,
RICHARD RUSH.

43 CRAVEN STREET, STRAND, June 5, 1838.

Dear Sir: We beg to assure you, in answer to your favor of the 31st
of May, that our endeavors to get through the forms necessary for wind-
ing up the suit, and putting you into possession of the Smithsonian fund,
have not been less urgent and unremitting than have been your applica-
tions to ourselves upon the subject. The circumstance of the shutting of
the offices of the court of chancery for the holidays, at a period when
they are ordinarily open, and some other petty difficulties not within
our control, have, however, prevented our getting through all the forms
in the month of May, as we hoped to have been able to do.

We have now, however, the satisfaction to announce to you that
every thing is complete, and that the accountant general of the court of
chancery has transferred into your name the several sums following :

. £64,535 18 9 consols,

12,000 0 O reduced annuities,
16,100 0 0 bank stock.

These sums are entirely at your disposal, free from the control of the
court of chancery.

There will be, in addition, a small cash balance, which, in the course
of a few days, you will be able to receive of the accountant general.

We are, very faithfully, your obedient servants,

CLARKE, FYNMORE, & FLADGATE.

No. 27.
Lonpvon, June 13, 1838.
_ Sir: Iam glad to be able to report to you that the sales of the stock
are going on well.

The whole of the consols have been sold, and part of the bank stock.

A portion of the consols, viz: £4,535 18s. 9d. was sold on the 6th
instant for cash, at 942. This was considered a high price; more could
not have been obtained for cash.

My first desire was to sell all the stock for cash, and immediately, that
I might the sooner close the whole operation and get away ; but such a
course I soon found, on the best information and advice, would have been
injudicious.

To have attempted a sale of the bank stock, for example, all at once,
whbuld probably have depressed the market for this particular species of
security, and occasioned a loss of several hundred pounds. The reason is,
that the dealings in it, contradistinguished from those in the great national
stocks, are limited, and confined to a very few persons on the stock ex-
change. The course which prudence dictated was, to sell it out in small
parcels, under careful instructions to the broker on each day of sale.

As it thus became necessary, in order to guard against loss, that I should
allow myself some little latitude as to time in selling the bank stock, it
opened a door the more properly for disposing of the other stock on time,

at a short interval; the more especially if by that mode it could be made
to produce a larger sum,
14 Poe: No. 10.

Accordingly, on the same day that I disposed of a portion of the consols
for cash, which served also as a feeler to ascertain the cash price, I caused
the whole of what remained of this stock, viz : £60,060, to be sold om time
for the 6th July, that being the day after dividend day, which falls on the
5th of July.

It gives me great satisfaction to state that this sale was effected at 953.

Up to the day when it was effected, consols had not brought so high a
price, as far as I have yet been able to examine the London Mercantile
Price Current, for nearly eight -years before.

Two sales have been made of the bank stock, viz: one of £3,000, the
other of £5,000; the former at 2043, the latter at 2042; both sales being
for the 30th instant, the money payable and stock to be delivered on that
day. Should the remainder be sold at these rates, or near them, it will
be seen that the bank stock, though in nominal amount only £16,100, as
stated in my last, will yield upwards of £30,000.

In the impor tant operations of selling the stock, I am receiving ther most
beneficial aid from the constant advice and active daily co-operation in
all ways of our consul, Colonel Aspinwall, whose long residence in Lon-
don and ample opportunities of knowing the mysteries of its great stock
market, and the minute details of doing business in it, have given him
the ability to aid me. It is thus that I am selling to every advantage.

None of the three per cent. reduced annuities have yet been sold. We
are watching the market with a view to the most favorable moment for
~ disposing of this part of the-stock.

The fortunate point of time was hit for selling out the consols. They
have now sunk a little, and, with the exception ‘of momentary intervals,
would not have brought as much since the 6th instant as I obtained.

From the sales made, it is now IT think certain that the whole stock will
yield from one hundred and three to one hundred and five thousand
pounds, apart from the five thousand and fifteen to be retained here during
the life of Madame !a Batut.

From the successful manner in which they are proceeding, it seems
clear also, at the present time, that the fund, independent of the j accumula-
tions of interest, will be richer in the state in which I shall deliver it over
to the United States, than it was in the summer of 1835, when their right
to it first attached by the death of Henry James Hungerford.

Left to myself to make the most of the fund after recovering it from
chancery, which depended so much on the sale of the stock, it has not
been without full consideration that I did not call on the Messrs. Roths-
child to sell it all, for which their experience and situation here, besides
being the bankers of the United States, might have seemed to point them
out. But, first, they would, f take for granted, have charged a commission
of one per cent., to which I could not have objected, as it is allowed here,
apart from the broker’s commission, aud by the chamber of commerce at
New York on effecting sales of stock ; whilst Colonel Aspinwall charges
me no such commission, and I much desired to save the amount of it to
the fund, if, with his efficient aid, 1 could conduct the sales confidently and
advantazeously myself. But, secondly, if the former, as the bankers of
the United States, would have performed the task without charge, I
should not have been the less disinclined to place it in their hands, having
had no instructions to do so, and, pene without these, I could only exer-
cise my best discretion, They are, s Ti in common with others here sup-

pose, very large dealers in stock on their own account, as occasion may
serve; and hence may naturally be supposed to desire sometimes a rise,
sometimes a fall, in these ever-fiuctuating things. With more than a hun-
dred thousand pounds to throw upon the market, I therefore thought it
best, acting on a general rule of prudence in all business, to keep the
operation of selling entirely clear of every quarter where any insensible
bias might, by possibility even, exist to a course other than that which
would regard alone the Smithsonian fund.

I design to leave no sale outstanding after the 6th of July. The sub-
sequent steps, however, for obtaining the gold, and those necessary in
various ways for shipping it, will render it impracticable for me to embark
with it in the packet which sails from Portsmouth on the 10th of July,
that packet leaving London always on the 7th. But I will follow in
the succeeding one of the 20th of July, which leaves this port on the 17th,
before which time I trust that every thing will have been fully and satis-
factorily closed, as far as the trust can be closed here.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

Lonpon, June 26, 1838.

Sir: Since my No. 27, the sales of the stock have been going on
from time to time, and at length are finally closed.

They have all been good—perhaps I may say fortunate. The prices
have been high, as compared with the state of the stock market for sev-
. etal years past; and Iam confidently informed that, from the time the stock

came under my control until I sold it all, no higher prices were obtained
by any private seller than I obtained.

The whole of the reduced three per cent. annuities (£12,000) sold at
94. This description of stock is never as high as consols, but 94 is repu-
ted nearly, if not quite, as good a price, in proportion to its general value
in the English stock market, as the 953 I obtained for the consols.

Of the bank stock unsold at the date of my last, (viz: £8,100,) I obtain-
ed 205 for £5,000, and 2053 for the remaining £3,100. Both these
prices, it will be perceived, are higher than the former ones I obtained for

‘this stock.

' The entire amount of sales has more than realized the anticipations
held out in my No. 27, having yielded an aggregate of rather more
than one hundred and five thousand pounds, as will be seen when I come
to render a more particular statement. The two days on which I am to
make all the transfers are the 30th of thismonth and 6th of July. The
money will all be received simultaneously.

Immediately afterwards I shall take measures for converting the whole
into English gold coin, having finally determined that this is the proper
mode in which to bring the money to the United States, under the trust I
have in hand. It appears to me the right course in itself, independent of
any question of exchange, considering the peculiar object and terms of
16 Doc. No. 19.

the law of Congress of the Ist of July, 1836, under which I am acting
But by the rate of exchange, as quoted at New York under the last dates,
there would be a gain to the United States, by the best calculations I-can
now make, (though I am aware how exchange is ever liable to fluctuate,)
of upwards of a thousand pounds on bringing over the money in gold
rather than remitting it in bills. This would help to cover the commis-
sions on shipping the former, effecting insurance upon it, and paying the
premium of insurance, as well as charges for freight and those that have
been incurred on selling the stock. All.these operations demand mercan-
tile agencies and assistance, to which I am inadequate in my own person,
beyond superintending them and seeing that they are rendered justly. I
will take care that these expenses are kept within limits as moderate as
possible, consistently with having the business regularly done according
to mercantile usage in operations of the same nature, so that the fund, in
bearing its own unavoidable expenses, may be encroached upon as little
as possible.

I have not yet been able to get from the solicitors a statement of the
costs of the suit, but will not fail to obtain it before [ embark. The final
payments under this head, and those I shall be called upon to make for
services enumerated above, can scarcely be completed but at the last mo-
meuts of my stay; hence [ may not be able to transmit an account of
them to you until I arrive at New York, where also the freight will have
to be paid.

In reporting to you the final decision of the court, I omitted to mention
some particulars not at first accurately known to me, but necessary to be
now stated, viz: £526 11s. 6d. were decreed to be paid out of the fund
to Madame la Batut, as her arrears; £25 as arrears found to be due to
John Fitall, the annuitant under the will; and, lastly, £53 7s. 6d. as due
for the use of certain warehouse-rooms in London. The two first items
explain themselves, after all I have written. The third has reference to
some personal property left by the testator, contained, as I understand, in
thirteen boxes or trunks deposited in the warehouse-rooms specified. I
have had no opportunity as yet of examining the contents of these boxes,
but am informed that they consist chiefly of books unbound, manuscripts,
specimens of minerals, some philosophical or chemical instruments;and a
few articles of table furniture. The contents of the whole are supposed
to be of little intrinsic value, though parts may be otherwise curious. As
all now belong to the United States, under the decree of the court, I shall
think it proper to have them shipped when the gold is shipped, paying all
reasonable charges.

Having more than once spoken of the possibility of fictitious claimants
starting up for the Smithsonian bequest, perhaps I may here be allowed
to mention what thesolicitors have informed me of, viz: that, since the
decision, two claimants lave’ presented themselves at théir office, neither
having any connexion with the other. When the decision was pronounced,
the sum recovered was also proclaimed in the London newspapers,
which had probably awakened these claimants into life. The solicitors
add that one of them desired, somewhat importunately, to know if the
case could not be reheard in court? .It is needless to remark that he was
told he was a little too late in his application.

I will use this opportunity—the last I may perhaps have of writing to
you before I embark, from the engagements likely to press upon me in
Dic. No. 10. 17

getting the fund ready for shipment and clearing off all necessary ex-
penses—to say a word of our professional advisers. Of the counsel I se-
lected it is unnecessary for me to speak; their established reputation in
the highest department of their profession putting them above any testi-
monial from me. But of the solicitors, as they move in one of its less
conspicuous fields, I will barely take the liberty of saying that more at-
tention, diligence, discretion, and integrity could not, I believe, have been
exerted by any persons than they have shown throughout the whole suit,
from first to last. Could they ever have forgotten what was due to the
United States and to themselves, in the desire to eke out a job, nothing is
plainer to me, from what has been passing under my observation of the
entanglements and delays natural to a heavy suit in the English court of
chancery, than that they might have found opportunities in abundance of
making this suit last for years yet to come.

iT have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient ser vant,

Lonpvon, July 14, 1838.

Six: All the transfers of stock were made on the proper days; all the
money was received, and arrangements are now in daily progress for ob-
taining, insuring, and shipping ‘the gold. It will be on board the New
York packet Mediator, Captain Champlin, by or before the 17th instant,
in which ship I have taken my passage, intending to embark on that day.
The costs of suit have been paid, but the other. expenses, arising out of
the sale of the stock and shipment of the proceeds, cannot be examined
and settled until immediately before I embark, as the whole of the oper-
ations cannot be completed until then. It will ened not be in my power
to make a statement of all these expenses until I arrive at New York or
Washington, when it shall be rendered in a manner that I trust will be
satisfactory. I can only repeat that my best exertions have not been
spared to keep them all within a compass as moderate as possible.

I received at the Bank of England, day before yesterday, £900, being
the interest on £60,000 of consols sold on the 6th of June. It will be re-
membered (see my "No. 2 7) that this amount of the consols was sold on

_time, the stock not being deliverable until the 6th of July, which was the
‘day after the dividends for the last six months fell due, by ‘which I became
entitled to receive for the United States the above sum of £990.

The boxes and trunks mentioned in my last are to go on shipboard to-
day. Before knowing any thing of their contents, I thought proper to
have them opened and examined i in the presence of our consul and two
other persons. A large portion of the contents proved to be unimportant;
nevertheless, all will be delivered over on my arrival as I received them,
except to have them better packed for a sea voyage, and so as to prevent
further injury to that which time and bad packing have already done to
them.

I design to leave this letter behind me, to be forwarded by the British

steamer Great Western, which, although not to sail until after the Medi-
ator, may be expected to arrive firstat New York. My going in the Great
Western has been precluded by the fact of her accommodations for pas-
sengers having all been engaged long before I knew the time when I
should be able to close the business in my hands, and have the gold ready
for shipment.

Sir: I have the honor to report to you my arrival here in the ship Me-
diator, with the amount in gold of the Smithsonian bequest recovered for
the United States.

The expenses, of every kind, incurred by closing the business in Lon-
don and shipping the gold, were paid there ; but I have still to pay freight
here and primage, and also some other small charges incurred on bringing
over the Smithsonian boxes and trunks heretofore mentioned. When every
thing is fully paid, there will be left in my hands, as wellas I can now
compute the amount, upwards of £104,500; the whole is in sovereigns,
packed in boxes.

The money being consigned to no one here, I must continue to hold it
in my custody until I can receive your instructions to whom to deliver it,

as provided for by the act of Congress of the Ist of July, 1836.

I have the honor to remain, in the mean time, your most faithful and

nad been waiting my arrival here, instructing me to transfer the Smith-

Mint, to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States, taking duplicate
receipts from the former, one of which to be transmitted to the latter.

The ship has not yet got into the dock, but the gold shall be sent on to

packed at the Bank of England, according to the instructions I have thus
received from the Secretary of the Treasury.

PHILADELPHIA, September 4, 1838.

Sir: I was yesterday honored with your letter of the 30th of August,
acknowledging my No. 30 from the harbor of New York, and tender my
thanks for your kind congratulations on my return to my own country,
and on the success of the public business confided to me. Your letter
wenton to New York, as directed, but was returned; and I received it at
my home, near this city.

My No. 31, written after [had landed, will have informed you that
I had then received the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury to
which your letter refers, and I have since been in correspondence with
him. Owing to the delay in getting the ship into the dock, I was not able
to leave New York with the gold until the 1st of this month, when I ar-
rived with it, accompanied by two agents from the Bank of America, that
institution having, at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, obliging-
ly afforded me every facility in its power towards the business I had in
hand. I did not, however, feel at liberty to withdraw my own personal
superintendence from the operation of transferring the gold, until I saw it
deposited at the Mint. Thither I immediately had it conveyed on reach-
ing this city ou the Ist instant, the director and treasurer of the Mint
having been in readiness to receive it under the previous information of
its intended transfer, which I had requested the bank to transmit. The
entire sum contained in the eleven boxes which I delivered to those two
officers of the Mint on Saturday, was £104,960 8s. 6d.—the whole in
English sovereigns, except the change ; and | have now the satisfaction of
informing you that official receipts of this amount from my hauds have
been forwarded to the Treasury Department.

The excess of this sum over that which I had computed in my No. 30
as the probable amount to be left in my hands, arises from the president
of the bank having undertaken, at my suggestion, to pay the freight and
other shipping-charges due at New York; the bank to be repaid by the
20 Doc. No. 10.

Treasury. The freight was three-eighths of one per cent.—this being the
usual charge in the packet-ships—and came to £393 12s.- Primage
was £19 13s. Sd.; and the charges on, bringing over the Smithsonian boxes
(left in the custody of the collector, from whom I had eveiy facility on
1anding) were to have been £3 8s..5d., or thereabouts.”

It seemed to me that it would be best for the bank to pay all these
charges, as the most convenient mode of settling without delay with the
ship-owners, to whom I had become responsible by my engagements with
the captain in London; and I have the hope that this course will meet the
approbation of the Secretary of the Treasury and yourself. It left the
gold, as secured in boxes at the Bank of England, untouched at New
York ; and I had caused the seal of our consul at London to be affixed
to each of them.

Somewhat worn down by fatigue since coming on shore, after an un-
comfortable voyage of squalls, gales, and head-winds, I venture to ask a
little repose at my home before proceeding to Washington, for the pur-
pose of making out and rendering to you an account of ali expenses that
have attended the final recovery of this fund, of which the, United States,
by the information I give you in this letter, are now in possession. In the
course of the next week I shall hope to proceed to: Washington, with the
view stated ; and in order that, my account of the expenses being found
satisfactory, which I presume to hope will be the case, I may ask to be
discharged from all further responsibility under the trust I have been per-
forming. The nett amount, in dollars, of the fund as I delivered it over to
the United States at the Mint, was found to be five hundred and eight
thousand three hundred and eighteen dollars forty-six cents, ($508,318 46,)
as specified in the receipt given to me for it by the treasurer of the Mint.

PuHitapepuia, Seplember 11, 1838.

Sir : I yesterday received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury,
dated the 7th instant, stating it te be desirable that the expenses attending
‘the trauster of the Smithsonian fund to this country, and its deposite at
the Mint, should be ascertained as early as practicable, that the accounts.
in relation to it may be adjusted with a view to the investment of the
balance, and asking my attention to the subject at my earliest convenience.

In reply, I had the honor to inform the Secretary that I could not make
out a statement of the expenses, as far as then incurted, before embark-
ing at London with the gold, the documents relating to them not being
obtainable until the last moments of my stay ; besides that, the whole
operations of selling the stock in the English funds, in which My. Smith-
son’s fortune was invested, and afterwards shipping the gold, required and

had my constant supervision until I saw the latter finally deposited at our
Mint, in fulfilment of his instructions; that, having suffered greatly from
sea-sickness during the voyage, added to fatigue after landing ina weak
state at New York, where the care of the gold still required my personal
superintendence, I had been unable hitherto to prepare a statement of the
expenses in question, but that I was now regaining strength and intend-
ed to set out for Washington on Saturday, at farthest, if then able, as at
present I had reason to hope would be the case. I added, that I supposed
a settlement of my account could be effected more satisfactorily and .
promptly by my presence with the accounting officers at Washington
than by any attempt to make it out here, and transmit it by letter, which,
it may be, might lead to writing backwards and forwards before a final
adjustment took place: of which correspondence I have the honor to
inform you, and to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,

No. 34.

Wasuineton, September 15, 1838.

_ Sir: I am now to give you a statement of all the expenses that at-
tended the recovery of the Smithsonian bequest for the United States.

It may be in order first to mention the whole amount of stock and mo-
ney that came into my hands from the court of chancery, or otherwise.

I received of English Government stock £645,535 18s. 9d. in consols,
£12,000 in reduced three per cent. annuities, and £16,100 in bank stock of
the Bank of England, as heretofore mentioned in my No. 26, and will
now be seen by the original order or decree of the court, which I enclose,
(marked A.) This document I could not obtain until the 11th of July,
when I received it with the letter of the solicitors of that date, also en-
closed, (marked B.)

On the 1ith of June I received from the accountant general of the

court of chancery £725 3s. 7d. This was the sum remaining to be paid
to me, after previous payments to others, out of cash in hand appertaining
to. the Smithsonian fund whilst in the custody of the court, as will be seen
2 Doc. No. 10. ‘

in the concluding part of the decree. That this was the exact residue
coming to a will be further seem by an explanatory letter from the
solicitors of the 5th of July, also enclosed, (marked C,) and more au-
thoritatively ig a document (marked D) from the books of the account-
ant general of the court, sent to me by the solicitors, with their letter of
the 11th of July. ‘This ‘document, besides verifying in its own forms the
amount of stock and money I have otherwise stated myself to have re-
ceived, also verifies the statements in my Nos. 26 and 28, as to the
sums Awarded to Madame de la Batut, the arrears to John Fitall, and the
money decreed as warchouse-rent for the boxes containing the personal
effects of Mr. Smithson, which I brought over and delivered into the cus-
tody of the collector at New York. It is a document founded on the de-
cree of the court itself, and shows in more detail how its judgments were
fulfilled.

I received on the 12th of July £900 at the Bank of England, being the
dividend due on the consols I had sold, as mentioned in my No. 29;
and, lastly, [ received from the solicitors £116 2s. 2d., being money re-
turned by them out of what I had paid them for costs on the Sth day of
April, 1837, viz: £200 4s., as reported in my No. 14. The following
is the explanation of this item: When I paid them this sum, I fully ex-
pected to pay all further costs out of the same fund, then in my hands,
that Congress had appropriated for that purpose; but it appears that, on
the termination of the suit in favor of the United States, the costs of all
parties were paid out of the corpus of the fund; nor would the court
award the fund to the United States, as may be secn by the decree, until
all costs were accordingly first taken out of it, which the court judged it
Pee the rand itself should bear. I knew not of such a rule which the
solicitors advert to in their letter of July the 5th, until a short time before
the decree was pronounced. The total amount of their costs, as made
known to me in the same letter, and set out in detail ina voluminous bill,
which I enclose, (marked E,) and to which I caused their affidavits to be
annexed, was £490 4s. 10d. The court adjudged £406 3s. of this sum
to be paid to them out of the fund, as their taxed costs, which, added to
what I had previously paid them, made £606 7s. The difference be-
tween this and £490 4s. 10d. being £116 2s. 2d., they refunded the
latter sum tome. Their total bill, (considering that it included all fees paid
by them under my direction to the counsel, and all costs and charges of
every description from the beginning to the end of the suit, with some
small extra charges, to which their letter refers, which I also ‘authorized,
to ensure a speedy and successful termination of the suit ,) and considering
the magnitude of the suit, was, in my judgment, and in that of others
better informed, to whom I submitted its amount, extremely moderate.
T hope it will be thought to show care on my part to keep all those charges
low, that often are run up to amounts so enormous in English chancery
pro oceedings ; ; and, let me add, as in justice [am bound to do, to show more
strongly that the solicitors I had to deal with were honorable and just
men. |

I did not consider these refunded costs as belonging to the legacy fund
recovered, but I threw them into it when the general gold was obtained,
that all might be safely kept together, and come under one insurance.

The gross amount yielded by all the stock I sold, including the £900 I
received as the dividend on the consols, was £105,649 6s.
Doc. No. 16: 23

For the prices at which I sold the different parcels and kinds, I beg to
referto my Nos. 27 and 28, which detail the commencement, progress,’
and conclusion of the sales. This sum, added te the £725 3s. 7d. re-
ceived from the accountant general of the court of chancery, and the
£116 2s. 2d. returned to me by the solicitors, will show that the entire
sum that came into my hands was £106,490 11s. 9d.

I am next to inform you of the expenses that attended the sales of the
stock, and shipping and bringing over the gold to this country.

After I had finally recovered the legacy from the court of chancery, it
did not seem to me prudent that I should, by myself alone, undertake the
sales of the stock awarded, and delivered to me by its decree, any more
than the shipment of the gold, into which the money was afterwards to
be converted ; these ulterior operations being usually conducted through
mercantile agencies, and being of a nature not to be advantageously, if
safely, conducted without them. Feeling inadequate, in my own person
merely, to the management of such operations, my first intention was
that the sales of the stock, as a highly important part of them, should be
put under the direction of some experienced mercantile or banking-house
in London, familiar with the modes of doing business on its great stock
exchange, and self-confident in the measures to be taken. But I found
that to put this operation into such hands would incur a commission of
one per cent. on the entire fund, as mentioned in my No. 27, in addition
to brokerage and other charges, such as the expenses on transfers and
stamps ; besides that, I should have had to part with the possession of
the stock to such mercantile or banking-house whilst the sales were going
on. I was also given to understand that this latter step. would probably
lay a foundation for a further mercantile commission on receiving and
paying.

Weighing all these circumstances, I came to the conclusion to keep the
operation of selling the stock in my own hands. Nevertheless, t felt, as
already intimated, that I could conduct it with neither skill nor safety
unless-under the counsel and co-operation of a person well informed iu
these matters, and trustworthy. To the consul of the United States in
London [applied as to such a person, and received from him, as my No.
27 informed you, this aid and co-oper:tion, in the fullest and most effi-
cient manner, daily, throughout the monihs of June and July, until ail
the sales were effected; and effected, I may be allowed to add, witi fa-
vorable results not to have been surpassed, as I have already reported to
you, and as the public records of the l.dndon stock market on each of the
days that I sold will attest. Into his hands I also put the other mercan-
tile business necessary to the shipment of the gold. These included the
obtaining, verifying, arranging, packing, and securing it for shipment,
contracting for freight, entering and clearing at the custom-house, effecting
insurance, (which was done at five principal offices and with thirty-two
private underwriters,) and, finally, shipping the gold. For these services,
of whatever kind, (and-I had many incidental ones from him, not here
enumerated,) I allowed and paid him a commission of three-fourths of
one per cent., which amounted to £797 15s. 6d.

I speak from good information when expressing a belief that an equal
amount of assistance and services to.me, under all the heads rendered,
could not have been commarided through the usual agency of banking
and commercial houses, on so heavy and responsible a moneyed operation,
24 Doc. No. 10.

at a less charge to the fund than a commission of from two to two and a
half per cent. on the whole amount of it; and that this falls below rather
than goes beyond what it might be expected to have been.

I enclose the consul’s account, signed T. Aspinwall, together with
his voucher fer a charge of £6 19s. 4d. for expenses paid by him on
shipping the 14 Smithsonian boxes.

The premium for insurance was one half of one per cent., and amounted,
with the expense of stamps and policies, to £599 3s.4d. The statement of
this, as paid for me by the consul, will be seen in the enclosure, (marked
“ Invoice,’’) on which are also certain items, as dock charges, charges for
bills of lading, and some other things, amounting in all to £6 Os. 6d., ac-
companied by vouchers. I also enclose the policies of insurance.* The
insurance covered all commissions and charges paid in London, so as
to have made the United States entirely whole in case of loss. This I
directed, thinking it most prudent.

The expenses on selling the stock, viz: brokerage, charges on the trans-
fers, and charges for stamps, were £120 4s. 6d. These will be seen in my
account, marked among the enclosures R R.

The several expenses above enumerated, viz :

ist. The consul’s commission of £797 15s. 6d.,and charges £6 19s. 4d.
_ 2d. The premium of insurance, stamps, and policies, viz: £599 38. 4d.,
with the charges £6 Os. 6d.

And 3d. The expense of selling the stock, viz: £120 4s. 6d., deducted
from the gross amount of moneys that came into my hands, viz:
£106,490 11s. 9d., will leave £104,960 Ss. 7d., which was the precise
sum in gold I brought over in the eleven boxes, and, under instructions
from the Secretary of the Treasury, deposited at the Mint in Philadel-
phia, on the Ist instant, to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States.

The foregoing is the statement I have to make of, the expenses. I pre-
sume to hope that they will not be thought objectionable, but, on the con-
trary, moderate under all the heads. If I have been somewhat minute
in explaining them, it is for the better understanding of the diiferent ac-
counts and documents enclosed, trusting that this will be my excuse when
about to surrender up a trust where so much pecuniary responsibility has
devolved upon me.

In regard to the 14 boxes containing the personal effects of Mr. Smith-
son, it will be perceived that the letter of the solicitors, of the 5th July,
mentions that they had sent me a list of them. They did so, and I en-
close it, (marked F.) It is proper to remark, that this list refers to but one
of the boxes, or rather to a trunk, as their letter specifies, and it proved to.
be erroneous. I preferred that all these boxes, and the trunk, should be
first opened at the consulate, in presence of the consul and others, who
might aid me in ascertaining their contents. When the trunk was open-
ed, several of the articles down upon the list were not in it. I mentioned
this to the solicitors, and it produced the explanatory letter from them of
the 13th of July, which I enclose, (marked G.) All the rest of’ the boxes
were filled with things of little intrinsic value, as far as a mere superficial
inspection of them, pressed upon me on the eve of my embarkation, could
determine. They seemed to be chiefly old books, pamphlets, manuscripts,

* It has been deemed unnecessary, at the Department of State, to communicate copies of the
several policies of insurance above referred to.
Doc. No. 10. 25

and some philosophical or chemical instruments. Of the whole contents,
(such as they were,) all were left as we found them, except to have been
repacked, with the aid of the consul and his assistants, and put in a better
state for crossing the sea than they were when delivered to me. When
first opened, it was evident that time, mould, and careless packing in the
first instance, had nearly destroyed many of the articles.

The freight payable on the gold was not paid in London, not being due
until the arrival of the ship at New York; but the consul agreed with
the captain for three-eighths of one per cent., which brought the amount:
to £39312s. Primage was £19 13s. 8d.; and the freight and primage on
the 14 Smithsonian boxes was to have been £3 8s. 5d. These several
charges I was necessarily obliged to assume for the United States, and
engaged to pay them when the ship got to New York. On arriving there,
I received the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury, of the 20th of
July, directing me to transfer the gold io the Mint at Philadelphia as soon
as practicable; it being added that the president of the Bank of America
at New York had been requested to render me any facilities in his power.
The captain of the ship being content to take the bank as payment for
these last-mentioned charges, I thought I should best consult the spirit of
the Secretary’s instructions by leaving the bank to pay them, which its
president expressed an immediate readiness to do. I supposed it could
make no difference to the Government, in the end, whilst it saved the ne-
cessity of opening one of the boxes of the gold at New York, out of which
fund alone I could have made the payment if demanded of me under the
engagement I had contracted. The bank may “have further charges to
make for its aid to me otherwise in removing the gold to the Mint, but I
know nothing of them in detail.

Referring, therefore, to that part of the Secretary’s letter to me of the
7th instant, which I mentioned in my No. 33, asking a statement of
expenses attending the transportation of the gold after its actual shipment
at London, and its transfer to the Mint at Philadelphia after its arrival at
New York, I beg to offer the above explanation, having paid nothing
myself.

I have the honor to remain, with great respect, your obedient servant,
RICHARD RUSH.
Hon. Joun Forsyrn,
Secretary of State.

Smithson’s estate; and, for the better discovery of the matters aforesaid,
the usual directions were given, and his lordship did reserve the considera-

said master should have made his report. That, in pursuance of the said
decree, the said master made his report, dated the 23d day of March, 1838,
which stands absolutely confirmed by an order dated the 27th day of
March, 1838, and thereby certified he found that the sum of £53 7s. 6d.
was justly due and owing to Messrs. Thomas Clarke & Co., the solicitors
for the defendant Charles Drummond, from the estate of the said testator ;
and he found that the said John Fitall was dead, and that he died at Bush
house, Wanstead, in the county of Essex, on the 14th day of June, 1834;
and he found that the said Henry James Hungerford assumed the name

ing any issue. And the said master cer rtified that he was of opinion and
did find that the said wary Ann de la Batut, in her right, was entitled to
a claim on the estate of the said testator, James W. Smithson, for an in-
terest during the life of the — peg Ann dela Batut, in a moiety of
the annual income or sum of 3 livres de rentes, in the report men-
tioned, amounting in value to he Coral sum of £150 9s. sterling money
of Great Britain and Ireland, calculated at the current rate of exchange in
the city of Londen, on the Sth day of March, 1838; and he found that the
income arising from the said French stock or fund, called livres de rentes,
Was payable and paid half- oy by the French Government, on or about
the 22d day of March and the 22d day of September in each year ; and he
also found that there was due and owing to the said Mary Ann de la Ba-
tut, (or the said Theodore de la Batut, in her right,) from the estate of the
said testator, James Smithson, the sum of 13,427 francs 75 centimes, for
arrears of the said annuity, from the 22d day of September, 1834, to the
22d day of March, 1838, amounting in value to £526 11s. 6d., sterling
money of Great Britain and Ireland, calculated at the current rate of ex-
change in the said city of Loudon, as aforesaid; and he found that the
annual income cr annuity to which the said Mary Ann de la Batut
(or the said Theodore oe la Batut, in her right) was entitled for her
life out of the estate of the said testator, James Smithson, amounting to
£150 9s. sterling money of Great Britain and Ireland as aforesaid. And

ing in the name of the accountant general of this court, in trust in the cause
of Hungerford vs. Drummond, and in trust in this cause, which should
remain after providing for and satisfying the annual and other payments
directed by the will of the said testator, and the costs and charges to which

several proceedings and measures aforesaid, or any of them, might be
respectively transferred, (the amount thereof to be verified by affidavit,)
in the books of the governor and company of the Bank of England, and
paid to the petitioner, Richard Rush; and that the boxes and packages
mentioned in the said master’s report might be delivered into the custo-
dy of the petitioner, Richard Rush. Whereupon all parties concerned were

CRAVEN STREET, July 11, 1838.

Dear Srr: We have made the affidavit which you required to verify
the bill of costs, and which we now return to you.

We also send you the original order on further directions, under which
the several transfers of the funds have been made into your name. This
order has the initials of the registrar, as also of the entering clerk, placed
t the foot of it; this being the mode adopted in the court of chancery to
how the authenticity of their orders.

We also send you a transcript from the books of the accountant general,
certified by Mr. Lewis to be a true copy—Mr. Lewis being the clerk
whose duty it is to make such transcript. The sum of £70 7s. 8d., ap-
earing still to remain on the general credit of the cause, is reserved for
the costs of the attorney general, and will be paid over to his solicitor
upon his applying for the amount ; and the cash standing to the account
of Mrs. de la Batut is for the arrears of her annuity, and will be paid
oer. .

We have seen Mr. Deacon upon the subject of his charge for warehouse-
room beyond the 24th ultimo, and have paid him for the same £2; and
ve have also paid 4s. 6d. for swearing to our bill of costs, which is the
dwhole of our demand against you.

Mr. Deacon informed us when we saw hin that he had in his posses-
ion’ a painting belonging to the estate, and which he promised should be
sent over to your house, and which we presume he has done ; but should
he not have done so, perhaps you will be good enough to apply to him
for it.

We will thank you to send us an acknowledgment for the different
boxes we have handed you.

We are, dear sir, your very faithful servants,
CLARKE, FYNMORE & FLADGATE.

Craven street, July 5, i838.
Dear Sir: At the time of the decease of the late Henry James Hun-
gerford, Esq., which happened on the Sth June, 1835, there was standing
in the name of the accountant general of the cant of Chancery, to the
‘credit of the cause Hungerford vs. Drummond, the several sums follow-

ing, Viz:

£62,739 19s. 2d. bank £3 per cent. annuities ;

12,000 0.0 , £3 per cent. reduced annuities;
16,100 0 O _ bank stock.

And if these several funds had then been sold, they would have realized
the sum of £102,991, or thereabouts ; but owing to the proceedings which
were necessary to be instituted in the court of chancery. the tunds were
not transferred into your name until the 5th June, 1858. We ure happy
to inform you that, notwithstanding this delay, no loss has been occasioned
to the United States, as, according to the market prices of the funds on the
last-mentioued day, the funds were then worth $103,888, being an excess
of £897 beyond their value on the 5th June, 1835, the dite of Mr, Hun-
gerford’s death.

The whole of the costs of the chancery sui! amounted to £723 7s. 11d,
so that the increase in the value of the funds was ee to pay the
whole of these costs, and leave a surplus Of LETS 12s. la

In making out the above statement, the devcicnaes upon the funds have |
not been taken into account, but the United States receive thei in aldi-]
tion to the original fund.

The United : States do not, however, receive the whoie amount of s ich
dividends now, as a portion of them was invested in stock, of which £5,015)
has been appropriated to answer an annuity of £150 s to Madame def
la Batut, upon whose decease the same will become the property of tae
United States.

The sums in court, at the last hearing of the cause, were as follows, viz:

£62,739 19s. 2d. bank 3 per cent. annuities ;

6,810 19 7 lke annuities ;
12,000 0 O- reduced annuities ;
16,100 O O- bank stock ;
1,765), 2) 0) cash;
204. ..6,.8 .¢ash.
These sums have been appropriated as follows, viz :
£62,739 19s. 2d. bank £3 per cent. annuities; |

1,795 19 7. partof £6,810 19s. 7d. like annuities; | TrYans’d_ imtop

for costs ;
725 3 7 balance of cash paid to R. Rush, Esq. '
Herewith we send you a complete copy of our bill of costs, amounting

altogether to £490 4s. 10d.; and we have received the following sums on
account of costs, viz :

costs - - - - = - =. OO 8) 'O

The latter sum exceeding our bill of costs by £116 2s. 2d., leaves us in
debt to the United States to that amount, for which we beg leave to enclose
our check. ;

We may here remind you of the information on the subject of costs,
which we had before given you verbally, viz: that the court allows
against the fund certain ordinary costs; and such costs have been received
by us from the accountant general, as before stated. In consequence,
however, of the line of conduct adopted by us, under your own directions,
to ensure a speedy and successful termination of the suit, some small extra
costs have been incurred beyond what are considered ordinary costs.

We have, as you requested, had a lock placed upon the trunk* in our
possession, having previously deposited therein the several articles of plate
and other matters, which we mentioned to you as being in our possession,
and of which articles we enclose you a list.

We are, dear sir, your faithful and obedient servants,
CLARKE, FYNMORE, & FLADGATE.

P. S. We also return to you the memoranda which you left with us as
to the stock.

again looked through the papers - - - -

May 2.—Attending at Mr. Rush’s in long conference as to the
application of Mr. Batut, when it was decided that we could
not offer any pledge that attention would be paid to his ap-

claim, we would offer no technical or aly ag papa
to it ‘ =

May 4.—Attending Mr. Gritdino#: é cin eatin very fully again

a bill should now be filed against the defendant, (Drum-
mond,) as executor of the testator in this cause, for such
account ; and that it was expected a larger sum would be
found to have been received ; but that at all events a claim
would be established to a life interest in a sum equal to
that stated in the will to be the nephew’s property, viz:
£260 per annum, which, in point of fact, had been the
amount of allowances made to Mrs. Batut by the testator,
as she could prove; and we urged that filing a bill would
be useless, as it was impossible to furnish an account, but
would search through all the documents in the plaintiff’s
custody or power, and give them every sy to settle the
matter in the master’s office - :

May 5.—Attending Mons. Batut for upwards of two hours, °

when we told him the only chance for his obtaining any
remuneration from the plaintiff was to furnish him with
every information in his power relative to the death of Mr.
Hungerford, which he seemed very unwilling to do, without
a pledge that something should be done ; and we assured him
that no party here could give such pledge; and that if he
| was really disposed to sell his information, he must put his
terms into writing ; when he stated that he would consider the
course to adopt; and advising him to give us the informa-
tion, and informing him, if he did not, we should resist Mad-
ame Batut’s claim in every possible way - - -

required information, when it appeared that Mr. Hunger-
ford. was buried at a ‘Dominican convent, at Pisa, under. the
name of Baron de la Batut, on the 5th June; 1835, and that
a stone was raised to his memory; but that his servant, Leo
Ferna, could not be found, and he urged his claim upon
the consideration of the plaintiff; when we informed him
that we could not entertain such claim, but referred him at
once to Mr. Rush, or to the American Government :

43 CRAVEN STREET, STRAND, July 13, 1838.

Dear Str: With reference to the gun, a few pieces of China, and a
few other articles of a miscellaneous nature, which are mentioned in the
schedule of property formerly belonging to Mr. Smithson, (of which sched-
ule we furnished to you a copy,) and which articles do not now appear
to be amongst the property lately under the charge of Messrs. Deacon,
we beg to state that the schedule in question was a schedule prepared at
the time of Mr. Smithson’s death, now several years back, and that we
have no doubt that the articles (which appear to have been such as
would be used personally by Mr. Smithson) were handed to Mr. Hun-
gerford, who, indeed, lad he thought fit to apply for them, would, under
the direction of the court, have obiained possession of all the property
lodged with Messrs. Deacon, and which is now handed over to you as
representative of the United States.

We are, dear sir, your very obedient servants,

CLARKE, FYNMORE, & FLADGATE.

DervaARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, September 24, 1538.
Sia : Tam directed to transmit to you, for settlement, the enclosed ac-
count of Mr. Richard Rush, and a letter from him (No. 36) accompanying
it. The balance which may be found due to Mr. Rush he wishes to have
remitted to him. The compensation and allowance for expenses are to
be up to the period charged in the account, (the 20th instant.) é:
It is presumed that the amount repaid to Mr. Rush by the solicitors in
London, mentioned in his letter, (£116 2s. 2d. sterling,) which was paid
into the Treasury, together with the avails of the Smithsonian legacy, will
be brought to the credit of the appropriation from which it was originally
taken, and thus form a fund from which the balance due to Mr. Rush can
be paid. The papers explanatory of this circumstance have been trans-
mitted, together with the account of the legacy, to the Treasury Depart-
ment.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
EDWARD STUBBS, -dgent.

Treasury DepARTMENT,
December 3, 1838.

Six: | have the honor to report to you that, under the act of Congress
approved Ist July, 1536, in relation to the legacy bequeathed to the United
States by James Smithson, the sum of $508,318 46 has been received,
and paid into the Treasury of the United States.

In compliance with the provisions of the sixth section of the act of Con-
gress for the support of the Military Academy of the United States, and
for other purposes, approved 7th July, 1838, the sum of $499,500 has
been expended in the purchase of five hundred bonds of the State of Ar-
kansas, for one thousand dollars each, bearing six per cent. interest, paya-
ble semi-annually, on the first days of January and July in each year,
from the fourth day of September last, (the period of their purchase.)
The further sum of $8,270 67 has been applied to the purchase of eight.
bonds of the State of Michigan, bearing six per cent. interest, payable
semi-annually hereafter, on the first Mondays in January and July, from
the lst of May last. The interest on all these bonds is payable at the
city of New York.

There is still left in the Treasury the sum of $547 79 which has not
yet been invested, but will be as soon as a favorable opportunity offers,

The amount received in London by the agent of the United States, un-
der the decree of the court of chancery, of England, was the gross sum
of £106,490 11s. 9d., including the sum of £116 2s. 2d. for costs refunded.
This was reduced, by the payment of commissions, insurances, &c., to the -
sum of £104,960 8s. 9d., which was brought into the United States in
gold, and produced at the Mint the sum of $508,318 46, before mentioned.

This Department, having doubts as to what constituted the amount of
the Smithsonian fund, consulted the Attorney General, and he has given
his opinion (hereto annexed, A) that the proper construction to be given

)
66 Doc. No. 10.

to the legislation of Congress on this subject requires that the gross amount
of the payment made to the agent of the United States, after deducting
the costs refunded, as before stated, shall constitute tne fund, “ and all ex-
penses, of whatever kind or nature, should be paid out of the appro-
priation made by Congress.’’ That appropriation, however, not being
sufficient, an estimate will accordingly be submitted to the House of Rep-
resentatives, to enable the Department to comply with the acts of Con-
gress referred to, in accordance with the construction thus given to them
by the Attorney General.

The estimate to be submitted is for $10,000. Of this, the sum of
$128 24 will be required to make good a deficiency in the former appro-
priation. ‘The sum of $6,845 12 will be required to be added to the fund,
on the principles laid down by the Attorney General. This sum is esti-»
mated on the same ratio as upon the amount produced in the United
States on the remittance which has been received. The balance, $3,023 64,
will be required to pay the freight, &c., of the remittance, amounting to
$2,235 63, and such expenses as may be incurred in disposing of the per-
sonal effects of Mr. Smithson, which have been brought to the United
States; for the sale of which I would suggest that provision should be
made by Congress.

This report is submitted to you, in compliance with the resolution of the
House of Representatives, which you referred to this Department for the
necessary information that its archives would furnish in relation to the
call thus made on you.

Respectfully submitted :
LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury.
To the Presipent of the United States.

Avrorney GENERAL'S OFFICE,
November 16, 1838.

Sir: [have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 11th
of October last, requesting my opinion upon various points in relation to
the Smithsonian legacy. A separate answer to each of your inquiries is
deemed unnecessary, as the opinion I entertain, and am about to express
in general terms, will be found to cover most of them.

James Smithson, of London, on the 23d of October, 1826, executed his
last will and testament, by which, tpon the happening of certain contin-
gencies, he bequeathed to the United States of America all his property,
to found at Washington, under the tiame of the Smithsonian Institution,
an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.
The Congress of the United States, by an act passed Ist of July, 1836,
accepted the bequest, and directed the President to appoint an agent to
assert and prosecute the claim, and by said act pledged the faith of the
United States to apply the moneys and other funds which might be
received to carry into effect the provisions of said will: and, by the
fourth section of said act, it is provided, “that to the end that the claini
to said bequest may be prosecuted with effect, and the necessary expenses
Doc. No. 10. 67

in prosecuting the same be defrayed, the President of the United States
be, and he is hereby, authorized to apply to that purpose any sum not
exceeding $10,000,” &c.

From these provisions it appears to me that Congress intended. that
there should be no diminution of the funds bequeathed for the purpose
specified in said will, but that the whole, whatever they might amount to,
should be applied to carry into effect the intention of the testator ; and
when the object of the bequest is considered, it cannot be supposed that
Congress would act in any other than a liberal spirit.

My opinion, therefore, is, that the amount of the whole money and
other funds received by the agent of the United States, under the act of
July Ist, 1836, without reduction, constitute the Smithsonian fund, for
_the purposes specified in said Smithson’s will; and that the whole ex-
penses of prosecuting said claim, receiving, and transporting the same to
this country, including any additional expenses which may have been
incurred here, ought to be defrayed out of the appropriation made by
Congress.

It appears that cash and stocks, which, when converted into money,
amounted to £106,490 11s. 9d., were decreed to the United States, as the
amount of the iegacy and bequest in said will. This sum, after deduct-
ing £116 2s. 2d., the amount of costs refunded, is the amount which
should be paid to the Treasurer of the United States, to be kept and
disposed of according to the provisions of the act of July 1, 1836, and
the sixth section of the act of July 7, 1838; and all expenses, of what-
ever kind or nature, should be paid out of the appropriation made by
Congress.

Ini relation to the disposition of the other personal effects of Mr. Smith-
son, which have been transferred to this country by the agent of the
United States, my opinion is, that Congress should direct the disposition
of them.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
FELIX GRUNDY.

Hon. Levi Woopsury,

Secretary of the Treasury.

BEQUEST OF JAMES SMITHSON.

- MESSAGE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Upon the subject of the bequest of James Smithson to the United States.

eee

DecemsBer 10, 1838. a

Read, and referred to a select committee.

Wasuineton, December 6, 1838.
To the House of Representatives of the United States :

The act of the Ist July, 1836, to enable the Executive to assert and
prosecute with effect the claim of the United States to the legacy be-
queathed to them by James Smithson, late of London, having received
its entire execution, and the amount recovered and paid into the Treas-
ury having, agreeably to an act of the last session, been invested in
State stocks, | deem it proper to invite the attention of Congress to the
oblization now devolving upon the United States to fulfil the object of
the bequest. In order to obtain such information as might serve to
facilitate its attainment, the Secretary of State was directed, in July last.
to apply to persons versed in science, and familiar with the subject of
public education, for their views as to the mode of disposing of the fund
best calculated to meet the intentions of the testator, and prove most
beneficial to mankind. Copies of the circular letter written in compli-
ance with these directions, and of the answers to it received at the
Department of State, are herewith communicated, for the consideration
of Congress.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
December 6, 1838.

The Secretary of State has ihe honor to report to the President copies
of the cireular letter written by his directions, in relation to the mode of
carrying into effect the provisions of the Smithsonian bequest, and of the
answers to it received at the Department of State.

2 Doc. No. 11.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
Washington, July 19, 1838.
Hon. Joun Quincy ADAMS:

Sir: By the will of James Smithson, late of London, deceased, proper-
ty to a considerable amount was bequeathed to the United States, for the
purpose, as expressed in the language of the will, of ‘founding at
Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establish-
ment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The United States having, under the authority of an act of Congress,
approved the Ist of July, 1836, accepted the legacy, pledged their faith
for the performance of the trust, in such manner as Congress may here-
after direct, and reeovered the proceeds of the bequest, to the amount of
about one hundred thousand pounds sterling, the President is anxious,
in presenting the subject to Congress for their consideration and action
upon it, to aid his judgment by consulting the views of persons versed
in science and in matters relating to public education, as to the mode of
applying the proceeds of the bequest, which shall be likely at once to
meet the wishes of the testator, and prove most advantageous to man-
kind.

The President will be pleased to have, if agreeable to you to give it,
the result of your reflections on the subject, communicated through this
Department, at as early a day as convenient.

fam, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN FORSYTH.

Quincy, October 8, 1838.

Str: I duly received your letter, dated in July last, expressing the de-
sire of the President of the United States to consult the views of per-
sons versed in science and in matters relating to public education, as to
the modes of applying the proceeds of the Smithsonian bequest, to meet
the wishes of the testator, and which may prove most advantageous to
mankind, with a view to present to Congress the subject, for their con-
sideration, and action upon it.

Having been the chairman of the committee of the House of Repre-

sentatives, and reporter of the bill which became the act of July 1, 1836,
relating to this bequest, in which act the faith of the United States is
pledged for the application of the funds, placed by the founder of this
institution at their disposal, to the promotion of the great object of his
munificence, the tnerease and diffusion of knowledge among men. 1
have waited with anxious expectation the consummation of the first re- —
quisite for the accomplishment of the purpose, the recovery of the fund
itself, aware that, until that should be effected, all speculation upon the

7
Doc. No. 11. 3

most suitable appropriation of the proceeds would be premature. It is
with the warmest satisfaction that ] have learnt the successful attainment
of this preliminary end.

When, at the last session of Congress, provision was made, by the sixth
section of an act making appropriations for the West Point Academy
for the temporary investment of the Smithsonian bequest, I regretted,
first, that this provision was made not in a separate bill, but as an append-
age to one with which it had no proper connexion; secondly, that the
investment should be directed in stocks of States; and, thirdly, that it
should give tothe Secretary of the Treasury a discretionary power to
invest the fund, at a yearly interest of five per cent., at the very time
when the Government itself of the United States was issuing Treasury
notes at the rate of six per cent. Whatever may have been the ocea-
sion or the design of these arrangements, it was impossible to evade the
remarks, that here was a deduction of one per cent. a year from the free
gift of a noble-minded foreigner, for the most exalted of purposes, to
bestow it, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, upon some
favorite State. This did not appear to me to be an appropriation of the
fund to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, nor did it
lead me to augur very well of the sequel.

This, however, was but a temporary investment of the fund, which, |
was willing to hope, would under no consideration be made permanent.
In the report of the committee to the House of Representatives, aceom-
panying the bill which authorized the President to take the necessary
measures for recovering the fund, I had set forth, in very explicit language,
my sense of the dudies which devolved upon the Government of the
United States by their acceptance, in behalf of the nation, of this be-
quest; and, with the same views, I introduced into the bill a pledge of
the faith of the United States, that the fund should be applied to the
generous purpose of the testator.

Before leaving Washington last July, 1 took the liberty of calling upon
the President, and of expressing to him my earnest hope that, in the in-
terval before the next session of Congress, he would be prepared with
some plan for the permanent safe keeping and security, unimpaired, of
the fund itself, by an investment which would yield a certain income as
large as the ordinary interest of the country, and for appropriating that
income to the object of the testator—the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.

{ was kindly received by the President, who assured me of his readi-
ness to take into consideration any suggestions which I might be disposed
to make on the subject, or those of any other person whom I might rec-
ommend.

Thus encouraged, I gave him freely the views which I entertained
with regard to fixing the permanency ef the fund, wnimpaired, and to
suitable objects of application for its annual income. The opinions
which I gave were general, and of course not matured. Further reflec-
tion since that time has but slightly modified thein, and I have not since
had the opportunity of consulting with any person in my own judgment
qualified to give counsel, at once judicious and perfectly disinterested,
for the disposal of the fund.

The provision made at the last session of Congress was made merely
for an investment for a few months, that the fund should, after the arri-
4 Doc. No. 11.

yal of the money in this country, not remain unoccupied, even until the
next session of Congress. ‘The object now first deserving attention will
be to secure the permanency of the fund entire ; for which purpose, I
must indulge the hope that it will not be intrusted to any bank, nor
loaned upon any pledge of State stocks.

I should greatly prefer that it should be disposed of as was the fund
of one hundred thousand dollars which had been held by the President
of the United States, in trust for an annuity of six thousand dollars,
payable to the Seneca Indians. By the act of February 19, 1831, the
whole fund was placed to the credit of the Department of War, and the
duty of making the annual payment to the Sencea tribe was assigned
to the Secretary. In the present case, the whole fund might pass to the
eredit of the Treasury of the United States, and the annual payment
be directed to be made by the Secretary of the Treasury. The fund of
course to be redeemable at the discretion of Congress, and otherwise
invested for the objects of the institution.

This would give an annual appropriation of 50,000 dollars, and, to
keep the fund permanently unimpaired, the annual appropriation should
be confined to that sum.

I think that no part of the money should be applied to the endowment
of any school, college, university, or ecclesiastical establishment; to
no institution for the education of youth, for that is a sacred obligation,
binding upon the people of this Union themselves, at their own expense
and charge, and for which it would be unworthy of them to accept an
eleemosynary donation from any foreigner whomsoever. Nor do | be-
lieve it to have been sirictly within the intention of the testator. For
the immediate object of the education of youth is not the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men, but the instruction of children in
that which is already known. Its result is doubtless to diffuse, and
may be to increase, knowledge among men; and so is apprenticeship to
trades, and so is the tillage of the ground, and so was to the ancient
shepherds of Egypt and Chaldea the nightly keeping of their flocks, for
it enabled them, by the habitual observation of the stars, to trace their
eourses to some of the sublimest discoveries of astronomy.

Nor could the application of the fund to any ecclesiastical or religious
sstablishment be a proper fulfilment of the testator’s intention. The
people of the United States have also religious duties to perform, for the
charge and discharge of which they should not consent to be tributary,
even in gratitude, to the bounty of any foreigner. The preaching of the
gospel, like the education of youth, promotes the increase and diffusion
of knowledge; but the worship of God, and the fulfilment of moral
duties to man, the special object of religious institutions, do not so much
import the increase of knowledge as the right use of what is known.

I suggested to the President that annual courses of lectures on the
principal sciences, physical and mathematical, moral, political, and liter-
ary, to be delivered not by permanent professors, but by persons annu-
ally appointed, with a liberal compensation for each course, were among
the means well adapted to the end of increasing and diffusing knowledge
among men.

But the great object of my soliciitude would be to guard against the
eanker of almost all charitable foundations—jobbing for parasites, and
3ops for hungry incapacity. For the economical management of the fund,
Doc. No. 11. 5

and the periodical application of it to appropriate expenditures, it should
be invested in a board of trustees, to consist partly of members of both
Houses of Congress, with the Secretaries of the Departments, the At-
torney General, the mayor of the city of Washington, and one or more
inhabitants of the District of Columbia, to be incorporated as trustees
of the Smithsonian fund, with a secretary and treasurer in one person,
and to be the only salaried person of the board; to be appointed for
four years, and be capable of reappointment, but removable for ade-
quate cause by a majority of the board. Into details it is unnecessary
to enter.

The first object of appropriation, however, in my judgment, should be
the erection of an astronomical observatory, for all the purposes of the
Greenwich Observatory, in England, and the Bureau des Longitudes, in
France. This alone would absorb the annual income of the fund for
seven years, and will form the subject of another letter.

I am, with great respect, sir, your very obedient servant,

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
Joun Forsytn, Esq.,
Secretary of State of the United States, Washington.

Quincy, October 11, 1838.

Str: Ihave reserved for a separate letter what I proposed to say in
recommending the erection and establishment of an astronomical obser-
vatory at Washington, as one and the first application of the annual in-
come from the Smithsonian bequest, because of all that I have to say I
deem. it by far the most important, and because having for many years
believed that the national character of our country demanded of us the
establishment of such an institution, as a debt of honor to the cause of
science and to the world of civilized man. I have hailed with cheering
hope this opportunity of removing the greatest obstacle which has hith-
erto disappointed the earnest wishes that I have entertained of witness-
ing, before my own departure for another world, now near at hand, the
disappearance of a stain upon our good name, in the neglect to provide
the means of increasing and diffusing knowledge among men, by a sys-
tematic and scientific continued series of observations on the phenomena
of the numberless worlds suspended over our heads—the sublimest of
the physical sciences, and that in which the field of fature discovery is
as unbounded as the universe itself. I allude to the continued and ne-
cessary expense of such an establishment.

In my former letter I proposed that to preserve entire and unimpaireé
the Smithsonian fund, as the principal ofa perpetual annuity, the annual
appropriations from its proceeds should be strictly confined to its annuai
income. That, assuming the amount of the fund to be five hundred
thousand dollars, it should be so invested as to secure a permanent yearly
income of thirty thousand ; and that itshould be committed to an incorpo-
rated board of trustees, with a secretary and treasurer, the only person
of the board to receive a pecuniary compensation from the fund. +

On the 18th of March, 1826, Mr. C. F. Mercer, chairman of a select
committee of the House of Representatives of the United States, report-
ed to that House a bill for the erection of a national observatory at the
6 Doc. No. 11.

city of Washington, together with sundry documents containing estimates
of the cost of erecting the buildings necessary for such an establishment,
for the instruments and books which it would require, and for the com-
pensation of a principal astronomer, two assistants, and two attendants.
These estimates of expense were, however, prepared upon the principle
of providing the establishment at the smallest possible expense—to which
end it was proposed that it should be attached to the Engineer’s office,
in the Department of War, and that the mathematical and astronomical
instruments already belonging to that Department should be transferred
to the use of the observatory. Ali this must of course be otherwise ar-
ranged, if the President and Congress should approve the proposal of es-
tablishing the observatory on the Smithsonian foundation. But that doc-
ument contains much valuable information, which may be made availa-
ble whenever an observatory shall be erected. It is No. 124, House
documents of the first session of the 19th Congress.

In the estimate of expenses at that time, by the Chief Engineer, he
assigned for the necessary buildings only 14,500 dollars. But as it is
desirable that the principal building, the observatory itself, should be, for
the purposes of observation, unsurpassed by any other edifice constructed
for the same purposes, I would devote one year’s interest from the fund
to the construction of the buildings; a second and third, to constitute a
fund from the income of which the salaries of the astronomer, his as-
sistants and attendants, should be paid ; a fourth and fifth, for the neces-
sary instruments and books; a sixth and seventh, for a fund from the in-
come of which the expense should be defrayed of publishing the ephe-
meris of observations, and a yearly nautical almanac. These appropria-
tions may be so distributed as to apply a part of the appropriation of each
year to each of those necessary expenditures ; but for an establishment
so complete as may do honor in all time alike to the testator and his
trustees, the United States of America, I cannot reduce my estimate of
the necessary expense below two hundred thousand dollars.

My principles for this disposal of the funds are these :

Ist. That the most complete establishment of an astronomical obser-
vatory in the world should be founded by the United States of America ;
the whole expense of which, both its first cost and its perpetual mainte-
nance, should be amply provided for, without costing one dollar either
to the people or to the principal sum of the Smithsonian bequest.

2d. That by providing from the income alone of the fund, a supple-
mentary fund, from the interest of which all the salaries shall be paid,
and all the annual expenses of publication shall be defrayed, the fund
itself would, instead of being impaired, accumulate with the lapse of
years. Ido most fervently wish that this principle might be made the
fundamental law, now and hereafter, so far as may be practicable, of all!
the appropriations of the Smithsonian bequest.

3d. That, by the establishment of an observatory upon the largest and
the most liberal scale, and providing for the publication of a yearly nau-
tical almanac, knowledge will be diffused among men, the reputation of
our country will rise to honor and reverence among the civilized nations
of the earth, and our navigators and mariners on every ocean be no lon-
ger dependent on English or French observers or calculators, for the
tables indispensable to conduct their path upon the deep.

In the document to which I have above referred, there is a letter from
Doc., No. 11. ~

Mr. de Wallenstein, then attached,to the Russian legation in this coun-
try ; a report from Major Kearney, of the topographical engineers; and
extracts from a memoir of Mr. Francis Baily, respecting a new method
of determining the longitude ; all of which contain precious information,
both of facts and of encouragement to the application of a strenuous and
persevering effort, on the part of the Government of the United States, to
contribute their effective aid, by this establishment, to the progress of
physical and mathematical science. When the opportunity for this is
afforded by the munificence of a foreigner, without needing the taxation
of a dollar upon the people, I cannot forego the hope that this opportu-
nity will not be lost, believing that, of all the physical sciences, there is
none for the cultivation of which brighter rewards of future discovery
are reserved for the ingenuity and industry of man, than practical as-
tronomy.

There is appended to the same Congressional document a memorial
to Congress, from William Allen, president of Bowdoin College, and
sundry other distinguished citizens of the State of Maine, praying for the
establishment, at the charge of the nation, of an astronomical observa-
tory in the town of Brunswick, in that State ; and a memorial of Mr.
Hassler, recommending two observatories—one in Maine and one in
Louisiana. The memorial from Maine urges with great force and ele-
gance some of the general considerations pointing to the usefulness and
importance of an astronomical observatory in the western hemisphere.
But it is doubtful, at least, whether any application of the Smithsonian
bequest can, in fulfilment of the testator’s will, be located otherwise than
in the city of Washington ; and if hereafter Congress should ever be dis-
posed io appropriate any portion of the national funds to these elevated
purposes, observatories may be erected in Maine, or Louisiana, or both,
which may be auxiliary to tie labors of the Smithsonian institution at
Washington, without in any manner interfering with its pursuits.

If the President should approve and give the weight of his reeommend-
ations to those suggestions, I have no doubt they will receive tie sanc-
tion of Congress at their next session. As I propose the appropriation for
seven successive years of all the income from the fund to this special object,
there will be ample time for considering the best manner of appropria-
ting the same income afterwards to permanent establishments for increas-
ing and diffusing knowledge among men. Nothing could be more easy
than to dispose of a fund ten times as large, without encroaching upon
the proper sphere of any school, college, university, or academy. Not
so easy will it be secure, as from arattlesnake’s fang, the fund and its in-
come, forever, from being wasted and dilapidated in bounties to feed the
hunger or fatten the leaden idleness of mountebank projectors, and shal-
low and worthless pretenders to science.

Since I began this letter, | have conferred with Mr. Bancroft, the col-
lector of the customs at Boston, concerning its object, who has promised
to communicate his views of the subject to the President. 1 may, per-
haps, after consultation with others, again address you in relation to it
before my departure for Washington.

I am, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

Joun Forsytn, Esq.,

Secretary of State of the United States, Washington.
8 Doc. No. 11.

» Provipence, October 2, 1838.

Sir: In reply to your communication dated July last, requesting my
views respecting the Smithsonian Institute, I beg leave to state as fol-
lows:

1. It is, I suppose, to be taken for granted, that this institution is in-
tended for the benefit.not of any particular section of the United States,
but for the benefit of the whole country; and, also, that no expense,
which may be necessary in order to accomplish its object will be spared.

2. 1 think it also evident, that there is no need, in this country, of
what may be properly termed collegiate education ; that is, of that edu-
cation which may be given between the ages of fourteen or sixteen, and
eighteen or twenty. All the old States, and many of the new ones,
have as many institutions of this kind as their circumstances require.
And, besides, since persons of the ages specified are too young to be,
for a long period, absent from home, it is probably better that a large
number of such institutions should be established within convenient dis-
tances of each other. The age of the pupils in these institutions would
also render it desirable that very large numbers be not associated to-
gether.

3. It is probable that professional schools—that is, schools for divinity,
law, and medicine—will be established in every section of our country.
Divinity must be left to the different Christian sects ; law will probably
be taught in the State, or at least the district, in which it is to be prac-
tised. The same will, I think, be true of medicine.

4. If the above views be correct, it will, I think, follow, that the prop-
er place to be occupied by such an institution would be the space be-
tween the close of a collegiate education and a professional school. Its
object would be to earry forward a classical and philosophical education
beyond the point at which a college now leaves it, and to give instrue-
tion in the broad and philosophical principles of a professional education.

The demand for such instruction now exists very extensively. <A
very considerable portion of our best schools now graduate as early as
their nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first year. If they are sufficiently
wealthy, they prefer to wait a year before studying their profession.
Some travel, some read, some remain as resident graduates, and many
more teach school for a year or two, for the purpose of reviewing their
studies. These would gladly resort to an institution in which their time
might be profitably employed. The rapidly increasing wealth of our
country will very greatly increase the number of such students.

The advantages which would result from such an institution are vari-
ous. It would raise up and send abroad in the several professions a new
grade of scholars, and thus greatly add to the intellectual power of the
nation. But, specially, it would furnish teachers, professors, and officers,
of every grade, for all our other institutions. As the standard of education
was thus raised in the colleges, students would enter the national uni-
versity better prepared. This would require greater effort on the part
of its professors, and thus both would reciprocally stimulate each other.

The branches which should be taught there, | suppose, should be the
same as in our colleges, only far more generously taught—that is, taught
to men, and not to boys—and the philosophical principles of law and med-
icine. ‘This would embrace lectures on Latin, Greek, (lebrew, and the

Doc No. 11. 9

oriental languages ; all the modern languages of any use to the scholar,
with their literature ; mathematics, carried as far as any one would desire
to pursue them; astronomy ; engineering, civil and military ; the art of
war, beginning where it is left at West Point; chemistry ; geology ; mi-
ning ; rhetoric and poetry; political economy ; intellectual philosophy ;
physiology, vegetable and animal; anatomy, human and comparative ;
history ; the laws of nations; and the general principles of law, the con-
stitution of the United States, &e.

5. Supposing such an institution to be established, something may be
added respecting the mode of its constitution and organization.

I suppose, then, that an institution of this kind is a sort of ecopartnership

between the instructers and the public. The public furnish means of edu-
cation, as building, libraries, apparatus, and a portion of the salary. The
professors do the labor, and provide for the remaining part of their in-
come by their own exertions. Hence there arises naturally a division
- of the powers and duties of the parties. To the corporation, or gov-
ernors, or trustees, or by what name they may be called, would belong
the management of the fiseal concerns of the institution, and the controi
of that portion of its affairs which depended specially upon its relation
with the public donation. The government of the institution, the con-
ferring of degrees, the appointment of professors, would be performed
jointly by the officers of instruction and the corporation.

In the English universities, the government-of the institution is vested
in a general meeting of the former graduates. This forms-a literary
public, which exercises ultimate jurisdiction in most matters which re-
quire deliberation. How far such an institution might be constructed
upon this principle, may be fairly a question.

6. If the above-mentioned views should be adopted, it will be per-
ceived that no funds will be required for dormitories. The young mer
will provide for themselves board and lodging wherever they please,
and the professors will be responsible for nothing more than their educa-

on. It is supposed that they are old enough to govern themselves.

Hence the funds may be devoted to the following purposes:

Ist. A part would be appropriated to the creation of a library, cabinets,
and for the furnishing of all the apparatus necessary to the instructers.

2d. A part to the erection of buildings for the above purposes, together
with buildings for professors’ houses.

3d. A fund wouid be established for the endowment of professorships,
giving to each so much as may form a portion, say one third or one half,
of his living, and the rest to be provided for by the sale of the tickets to
his courses. ‘

7. If the institution is governed by a board, this board should be ap-
pointed by the President and Senate, or by the President alone, and

.they should hold their office for no longer a period than six years, one
third of them retiring, unless reappointed, every two years.

8. Graduates of the university should be allowed to teach classes and
receive payment for tickets, upon any of the subjects on which instruc-
tion is given in the regular course. This will prove a strong stimulant
to the regular professors, and will train men up for teachers. “

Degrees should never be conferred as a matter of course, but only
after a strict and public examination. They should never be conferred
either in course, or causd honoris, unless by the recommendation of the

faculty.

I have thus very briefly, but as far as my avocations would allow,
thrown together a few hints upon the subject to which you have directed
my attention. That I should go into detail, I presume, was not expected.
Whatever may be the plan adopted, I presume it will not be carried into
effect until an extensive observation of the best universities in Europe
has furnished the Government with all the knowledge which the present
condition of the science of education can afford.

I have the honor to be, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. WAYLAND.

Secretary of State.

Coxtumbia, SoutH Caro.ina,
July 20, 1838. =

Sir: With respect to the Smithson legacy, two courses only suggest
themselves to my mind: one, annual premiums for the best treatises on
given subjects, which we have not literary or scientific men enough to
supply or to enter into any thing like competition with the Bridgewater
Treatises ; and, therefore, we should only be disgraced by it ; and, there-
fore, I cannot recommend this mode of application. Add to which, it
would be very apt to degenerate into a political and party institution, in
various ways. The other is an institution of the character of an university.
I am well aware the power of erecting an university was twice refused
to Congress, in the convention of 1787. But the objection may be gotten
over by transferring the donation to the corporation of Georgetown, un-
der such limitation as may be expedient and constitutional, and let an
university be instituted by that corporation. This would be a sufficient
approximation to Mr. Smithson’s required locality, and would obviate the
constitutional objection.

Such an university ought not to be opened, except to graduates of
other colleges. The studies might be the higher algebraical calculus ;
the application of mathematics to practical mechanical knowledge of
every description, and to astronomy, to chemistry, electricity, and gal-
vanism ; the principles of botany and agriculture. No Latin or Greek ;
no mere literature. Things, not words.

Strict attendance ; strict and public examinations. [ object to all belles-
letters, and philosophical literature, as calculated only to make men pleas-
ant talkers. I object to medicine, which cannot be well taught in a !o-
cality of less than 100,000 inhabitants.

I object to law; for all that can be orally delivered can be more profit-
ably and deliberately learnt by perusal. Ethics and politics are as yet
unsettled branches of knowledge.

Whether physiology and political economy ought to be rejected, re-
quires more consideration than | can at this moment bestow. I want to
see those studies cultivated, which, in their known tendencies and results,
abridge human labor, and increase and multiply the comforts of exist-
ence to the great mass of mankind. Public education should be useful,
not ornamental. "

The course should not be less than 3 years, of 10 months each. The
instruction afforded gratis; examinations for admission rigid. Such, in
Doc. No. 11. ii

few words, are my notions on this subject, which I respectfully submit,
sir, to your better judgment.
Accept, I pray you, the assurances of my sincere and high considera-
tion.
THOMAS COOPER, M. D.

SYDENHAM, NEAR PHILADELPHIA,
November 6, 1838.

Sir: Referring to your letter of July, the receipt of which I had the
honor to acknowledge, and desiring now to meet the wishes it conveys,
however sincerely distrustful I am of myself in attempting the task, 1
proceed to remark: that a university or college, in the ordinary sense, or
any institution looking to primary education, or to the instruction of the
young merely, does not strike me as the kind of institution contemplated
by Mr. Smithson’s will; declaring it, in language simple, yet of the widest
import, to be “for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,”
and making the United States the trustee of his intentions, it seems to
follow that it ought to be as comprehensive as possible in its objects and
means, as it must necessarily be national in its government. In turning
my thoughts to the subject, itis, therefore, only upon a basis the most com-
prehensive, under all views, that I can think of any general plan for its
organization. Hence it appears to me:

1. That even officers of the United States, abroad and at home, might
be made subservient to some of the main objects of the institution—as
their consuls, naval and military officers; and, I would add, their foreign
ministers. i

Consuls, by their residence in foreign ports, have opportunities ef be-
coming acquainted with the natural history and productions of the places
where they reside, and learning other things useful to be known. This
class of officers had instructions, at a former period of the Government,
to send home seeds, plants, and other productions, beneficial to agricul-
ture, manufactures, or any of the useful arts. But their efforts were frus-
trated or impeded for want of a fund to defray incidental expenses,
which, however small, constitutional scruples existed against providing.
The Smithsonian fund might supply the means of renewing such instruc-
tions, giving to them more scope as well as efficacy.

Our naval officers, those especially in separate commands on foreign
stations, must have opportunities of gaining knowledge in other spheres
than those to be filled by their usual reports to the Navy Department;
and the same may be said of officers of the army, in regard to the War
Department. Many of the latter, by their stations at garrisons, or em-
ployment otherwise in remote and unexplored parts of our country, have
the means, as past instances testify, of collecting facts bearing upon its
geology, its natural history in all branches, its antiquities, and the char-
acter of its aboriginal races; the communication of which might advan-
tageously fall in with the purposes of this institution, and be ultimately
promulgated through its instrumentality.

I propose to include, also, ministers plenipotentiary among the func-
tionaries who might serve the institution, and, through it, the general
public, on this occasion. By their power of commanding the best inter-
course in the several communities to which they are sent, they may open
12 Doc. No. 11.

to themselves avenues to knowledge of all kinds; the transmission of
which to the institution, under executive instructions to that effect, might
often prove of high value. It would not be expected from them but at
convenient intervals, and never when interfering with their primary du-
ties. When an appropriate channel was opened for receiving communi-
cations of this nature, they would become, it may be presumed, an agree-
able appendage to the primary duties of our ministers, affording a resource
for their leisure, with opportunities of a more enlarged usefulness to their
country, and fame to themselves. Permanent missions were once ob-
jected to by Mr. Jefferson, as not within the true theory of our foreign
‘intercourse, which seems to countenance the more a proposal for connect-
ing with them the honorable appendage suggested, since neither official
dignity nor usefulness can ever be impaired, though both may be height-
ened, by coassociation with knowledge in other fields.

2. A building to be erected at Washington, with accommodations for
the business of the institution. Ground to be attached to it, sufficient
for reproducing seeds and plants, with a view to diffusing through the
country such as might be found to deserve it. The officers of the insti-
tution to be a director, a secretary, a librarian, and a treasurer. Persons
to be under them to take care of the building and grounds. The officers
to be appointed by the President and Senate. The director to make an
annual report to Congress on the state of the institution, and oftener if
necessary. Its affairs to be subject to the visitation of the President,
aided by a standing board, to consist of the chief officers of the Govern-
ment, say, taking the example of a law already in the statute book in
relation to the finances, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, the Sec-
retaries of State and the Treasury, and the Attorney General. The
institution to have its press, as the University of Oxford, or otherwise
authority to employ one for printing communications sent to it, and the
lectures to be presently mentioned. Nothing to be printed but under
the sanction of the director and standing board of visiters. To this and
other ends, for the good government of the institution, the standing board
to have the right to call in the assistance of three or more scientific or
literary persons unconnected with it. The profits arising from all publi-
cations to go in aid of the funds of the institution. Communications from
learned societies, or from individuals eminent in science or letters, in
whatever part of the world, to be received by the director, and taken
charge of by the secretary. The director to be authorized to correspond
with any such societies or persons. A council to assemble once a month,
to consist of the officers of the institution and the lecturers attached to
it, before which all communications to be laid. Order to be then taken
upon them. Such as go upon the archives, with a view to the question
of publication, to be brought under the consideration of the standing
board of visiters at the proper time, when that question will be decided.
The director to preside at these councils, at the meetings of the standing
board of visiters, and at all other meetings required by the business of
the institution ; and the Secretary to keep the minutes. The standing
board of visiters to hold stated meetings twice a year, and assemble on
other occasions when they deem it necessary. At the commencement
of the institution, the duties of librarian and treasurer to be united in the
same person.

3. Lectureships to be established, comprehending as many of the
Doc. No. 11. 13

leading branches of physical and moral science as the funds of the insti-
tution may be able to bear. Apparatus to be provided for the branches
requiring it. One of the lectureships to be dedicated to government and
public law. When conflicting opinions on government are raging in the
world, to have the democratic principle, as modified by our systems-of
representation, and the conjoint workings of the federative and national
principle, illustrated in elementary disquisitions, apart from temporary
topics and passions, is a desideratum which the Smithsonian Institution
might supply. Such productions seem due to mankind, as to ourselves,

imperfectly described as our institutions have been, through adverse feel-

ings in the writers; it having generally fared with us as the cause of Roman
liberty fared in the hands of royal historians. Rarely can foreigners,
however enlightened, be equal to the task of justly analyzing the com-
plicated movements, unintelligible to hasty observers, yet full of harmo-
ny, that maintain the order, prosperity, and freedom, of this great eon-
federated republic, under guards combining the efficacy of popular
sovereignty with its safety. Authentic explanations of them, all issuing
from this institution, at an age when steam is quickening all intercourse
throughout the world, would give: new motives for listening to the doc-
trines and results of the democratic principle in this hemisphere. So
expounded, it would go before the world without disparagement, and be
fairly judged by its results. Under public law, the tenets of America,

now locked up in diplomacy, or otherwise hidden or overlooked in
Europe, might come into useful publicity; her proposals to Europe to
abolish privateering, and prohibit public ships from capturing merchant
vesseis upon the ocean, thus forever stripping war of more than half its
evils upon that element—a stride in civilization to transcend, whenever
it may be made, the West India_abolition act; her resistance, single-
handed, against the enforcement of British municipal law upon the
ocean, as seen in the individual miseries and national violations involved
in the feudal claim of impressment, and her desire, shown in other ways,
for freeing the international code from barbarous relies, whereby this
institution, working in its orbit of calm discussion, might become the ally
of America towards gaining for these great public benefactions, and
others, the growth of our institutions, in our days, (so maligned for re-
taining the domestic servitude bequeathed to them by our progenitors, )
favor and acceptance among nations. The steady abhorrence expressed
by this Government against F employing savages in warfare between civ-
ilized and Christian States, and its abortive negotiations to prevent it,
would further illustrate the harmonizing policy of America. Such are
samples of the maxims that might claim elucidation from an institution
reared under the sanction of this republic, and thence, by the principle
of its existence, desirous of doing justice to them, examined in juxtapo-
sition with those taught in the ancient and cloistered seminaries of the
old world, and upheld by its Governments.

The other lectureships, as the foregoing, might be made to yield, each
in its proper field, contributions to ‘‘ the increase and diffusion of know!l-
edge among men. > Tam aware that voluntary lectureships have not
always been found to succeed. But in the foundation of these, consid-
ering the time and all concomitant circumstances, there seems reasonable
ground for anticipating success. The plan would imply that the lectur-
ers be also appointed by the President and Senate. It would imply that
14 , Doc. No. 11.

their salaries be ample enough to command the best men, and admit of
the exclusive devotion of their time to the studies and investigations of
their posts. They might even be laid under the restriction of not en-
gaging in other pursuits, as our laws interdict the revenue officers
from trading. Genius being of all countries, and the intentions of the
founder peculiarly expanded, the range of our own and other countries
would be open for selecting the incumbents. The desire of fame, in-
creased by the hope of their lectures being published, might be expect-
ed to stimulate them to exertion; and if incentives so high were want-
ing, the tenure of their appointments, where the Executive and public
eye would be upon them, would act as a guard against slacknessin their
duties. Ifknowledge is power, power, directing knowledge, may make
it efiicacious. The place where the lectures were delivered would im-
part to them interest and dignity. If delivered when Congress was in
session, and not recurring too often, some of the members might be ex-
pected occasionally to attend ; as a change from the turmoil of politics,
and possibly a good influence on legislation itself, might grow out of these
new intellectual elements gathering about its precincts. To the public
functionaries of all sorts, to distinguished foreigners, and to visiters at
Washington, as well as itsresident inhabitants, the Smithsonian lectures
might prove attractive. It will have been their lot, if established, to spring
up when stupendous agents in nature, and new contrivances In art, are
changing the state of the world, in peace and for war; when this coun-
try is taking a conspicuous share in these magnificent innovations, which
some of the lectures would doubtless treat of, and when the successful
results of its popular institutions hitherto are among the causes at work
in modifying the political and social condition of other nations. Can it
be that, delivered under such circumstances, they would be devoid of in-
terest? Centring in the capital of the Union, to which the eyes of the
States are apt to turn with a curiosity both natural and ambitious, may
not these lectures do their part also, if recommended by ability, towards
raising up among us new homage to mental accomplishments and re-
nown, those memorials ofa nation’s glory, when others perish ?

Each lecturer, at the conclusion of his course, to deposite with the di-
rector a copy of his lectures. These to be published, or not, as deter-
mined by the board of visiters. Hence, if the audience in the lecture-
rooms proved, after all, to be inconsiderable, the publication of the lec-
tures, when of merit to authorize it, would be fulfilling the intentions of
the founder, and the prospect of publication be sufficient to keep up the
spirit of the lecturer. We have heard of the Bridgewater Treatises, in
England, emanating from the provisions of a munificent will. Perhaps it
might not be too sanguine to anticipate, in good time, from the Smithso-
nian lectures, disquisitions doing honor to their authors, and, let it be
hoped, to their country, whilst diffusing knowledge among men every
where. We have seen, also, the publications that issue from those recently
formed associations that hold their annual meetings in Europe, and seem
to have made science a fashion there, enrolling statesmen, and nobles,
and kings, among its votaries. May not the Smithsonian Institution mark
an occasion for our eountry to start in this rivalry of mind? The race
among nations is going on, of wealth, of power, and of science ; the two
first extending as the last extends. An immense achievement, which
the present year has finally witnessed, the crossing of the Atlantic by
Doc. No. 11. ; 15

steam, is a revolution in human affairs. Distance, once an element in our
safety, as in all our relations with the old world, and the basis on which
rested essential maxims in our policy, has disappeared. Europe has sud-
denly become neighbor to us, for good and for evil, involving consequen-
ces that baffle all foresight. Our statesmen must wake up to the mighty
change. ‘There is no time to lose. They will have to ask themselves
what are the parts of our policy to be accommodated to the change. Our
men of science, feeling new excitements from this approximation of the
hemispheres, will naturally be on the alert, growing more emulous in
their several fields. The continent that Columbus found was a desert,
or overspread with barbarous people and institutions. The continent
that steam has found teems with civilization, fresh, advancing, and una-
voidably innovating upon the old world. The statesmen, the warriors,
the active and enterprising men, the whole people of the two worlds, now
almost confront each other. It is at such a point in the destinies of Amer-
ica that the Smithsonian Institution comes into being. Bytheir physical
resources and power, the United States are well known. Their resour-
ces of intellectual and moral strength have been more in the back
ground ; but may not an auspicious development of them be aided by an
institution like this, rising up in their capital simultaneously with this new
condition of things, guarded, as it will be, by the annual watchfulness,
fostered by the annual care, and improved, from time to time, by the
superintending wisdom of Congress ?

The usefulness of the institution would doubtless be increased, if young
men could be regularly educated at it. But here imperious obsiacles
seem to interpose. I! I only, in conclusion, touch this part of the plan,
without dilating upon it, it is from a fear that the fund would not bear
their maintenance, in connexion with what has seemed to me other indis-
pensable objects. Perhaps a limited number who had passed the age of
18, taken equally from the different States, say two from each, under the
federative principle, might come to the institution, be formed into a class,
and attend its lectures for a couple or three. courses; their expenses to
be paid under such restrictions as the Government might prescribe, and
the young men to undergo public examinations at the end of the term,
prize medals being awarded by the board of visiters or a committee of
Congress, to keep the tone of ambition high. But would the fund bear
even this? Again, I fear not.

In the foregoing suggestions as to the nature of the institution, sent to
you in compliance with the President’s call, [ have confined myself to a
very general outline and a few reflections. The subject has many as-
pects, and | have dealt only with some of them, and those partially. It
is intrinsically one on which much diversity of opinion may be expected
to prevail, and that hardly any discussions could exhaust. However
honored by the President’s call, and desirous of responding to it ade-
quately, [ have felt incompetent to the task of going into the arrange-
ments in detail necessary to the complete organization of an institution,
designed by its philanthropic founder to be so universal in its scope, so
far-reaching in its benefits. It ought to have all the simplicity compati-
ble with its ends; but these are momentous, since they may run, by their
effects, into distant ages. It is like a new power coming into the repub-
lic—its means the human mind ; its ends still the triumphs of the mind ;
its fields of glory beneficent and saving—a power to give new force to
16 Doe. No. 11.

the moral elements of our institutions, helping to illustrate, strengthen,
and adorn them. Such, in my humble conception, it is, or may be made.
Even as to the brief outline I venture upon, for the plan of such an insti-
tution, I must repeat how greatly I distrust myself, sketched, as it has
been, without consultation with others, giving their thoughts to the same
subject, who might have corrected, modified, and improved, my own. If
any of these can be turned to the least profit in abler hands, or serve to
start better ones in better minds, I shall be amply rewarded.

I beg to add that this communication would have been sooner sent to
» you, but for interruptions incident to the first month or two after return-
ing to my home aftera two years’ absence.

With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

RICHARD RUSH.

Cotiece Hix, D. C.,

November 26, 1838.

Sir: In an interview I had with you some time since, you desired me
to express my views respecting the anticipated Smithsonian Institution.
I will therefore attempt to do so, though conscious of my inability to do
justice to a subject so important in its character and relations. If it be
wisely organized, and supplied with a corps of distinguished professors
in the various departments of learning, it will affect not only the highest
interests of our country, but its influence will be felt in foreign lands.
Let it go up inacharacter worthy of its liberal founder, jet it be sustained
with the zeal and liberality becoming the object and our own reputation,
and it will add to our national points of union: in these we are not very
rich, and, therefore, should be glad to multiply them, to bind together
more firmly the elements of the American confederation. The object of
the contemplated institution is ‘the cultivation and diffusion of knowledge
among mankind.” This object, I believe, is distinctly expressed in the
will of Mr. Smithson. In making his will, he probably had his eye
upon those modern institutes and universities of Europe, which are de-
signed, not to teach the first elements of science and letters, but to re-
ceive graduates, and men looking forward to professional eminence, for the
purpose of advancing them to the highest grades of learning, and thus
to give them power to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge, by fresh
discoveries and investigations. We may conelude, then, that he intended
his bequest should be applied to the erection of an institution for liberal and
professional purposes, and for the promotion of original investigations—to
earry scholars through a range of studies much above those of the ordi-
nary collegiate course. i am happy to know that this is the opinion of
John Quincy Adams, a gentleman whose judgment in the present case
is entitled to all respect.

Admitting that this is to be its object, it is natural to inquire, in the next
place, how it should be organized, so as most fully to promote this design.
In organizing it, respect should be had to the spirit of the present age, to
the genius of our Government, and to our peculiar wants asanation. It is
of vital moment that it should receive such a shaping as will best correspond
with all the particulars. Many of the institutions of learning in Europe,
in rigidly adhering to systems of government and instruction settled for
ages, altogether different from our own, do not send forth men fitted to
Doc. No. i. wi

meet the exigencies of modern society. Though richly endowed, and
supplied with teachers of great powers and attainments, they serve for °
little else than to show the strength of the current that is setting by them.
We, at this day, and especially in this country, need men who are ae~
quaintec with something better than the learning of the ancient schools, |
men who have studied profoundly the relation of scientific principles to
practical purposes, and who can teach their fellow-men how to apply them
in advancing the public welfare.

The general superintendence of the institution may be committed toa
board of commissioners, appointed by Government, to hold their offices
during good behaviour, and with power to perpetuate their existence. In
this way, the institution would not only be free from the evils of frequent
changes and political agitations, but would secure to itself, in the highest
degree, the benefits of person:| obligation. ‘These commissioners weuld
feel a deep sense of their responsibility, and that their powers and per-
manency in place were given to them that they might have the best op-
portunity to make the institution what it ought to be—a distinguished honor
to their country, and a blessing to the world.

Let this board of commissioners procure the best men that can be
found to fill the several professorships that may be instituted ; and, in or-
der to secure the services of men of the first powers and attainments, to
lecture and conduct investigations in their appropriate denartments, let
their several means to facilitate their studies be ample, and their stated
salaries liberal; and then its public course of lecturing will be most fully
attended, numbers being allured both by the fame of the professors and
the lightness of the fees. It was in consequence of high salaries that the
the University of Gottingen, in the 18th century, rose to the first emi-
nence in Germany.

As the funds are not now, nor are they likely to be for some time to
come, sufficient to support professorships in the whole cirele of science,
it will be necessary to make aselection. The temptation will be to un-
dertake too much. A few chairs, well filled and well sustained, would
effect more than a number far greater than there are adequate means to
support. In deciding upon the branches of knowledge to be taught, I
would select those that would make the institution as much American as
aregard for general science will allow. In addition to the ordinary
professorships of law, of medicine, of ihe exact sciences, and physics,
of classical literature, and of modern languages, &c., | would have
one of the English literature, one of Ameriean history, one of Ameri-
ean constitutional law and jurisprudence, one of American institutions,
one of civil engineering and architecture, one of the practical appli-
cation of the exact sciences to the mechanic arts.

You will perceive that [ have said nothing about professorships in the
department of metaphysics. I would rather leave the whole business of
ethical and moral philosophy to be taught elsewhere, than to introduce it

as a distinet course in a national institution of learning.

Some of the above professorships are of a local and novel character ;
but this, I trust, will not be urged as an objection against them. The
achievement of our independence formed an epoch in the political
world. Let, then, the institution of this, eur first national university,
form an epoch in the republic of science. Much might be said in rec-
ommending the branches appropriate to our country. They are such

2

18 Doc. No. 11.

as ought to be adopted, out of a regard to our reputation and to our present
wants and future prospects. What have we done, as yet, to enrich
and improve our own tongue? Besides, when we consider that the
English language imbcdies, perhaps, richer treasures of science and
literature than any other, and when we consider that itis spoken by
two of the most commercial, enterprising, and powerful nations upon the
earth—nations which are doing more than any other two that can be na-
med, in forming colonies, and in diffusing knowledge and the light of Chris-
tianity—how powerful is thé motive to cultivate and carry it to the high-
est state of refinement and power.

With regard to buildings, it may be remarked that it would be wisest
to erect no more than are necessary for the library, the apparatus, a
cabinet of minerals, collection of niodels, specimens, curiosities, &e.,
for the accommodation of the professors, when lecturing or engaged in
their investigations. The scholars, instead of eating in common, might be
accommodated in private boarding-houses. If this course be pursued,
the interest which has acerued and which willaccrue onthe bequest, be-
fore the institution can be organized, will probably be sufficient to erect
all the necessary buildings, and leave a handscme sum to be expended
upon a Jibrary, apparatus, &c., so that the whole of the original dona-
tion may be invested for a permanent fund.

It will be of vital moment that the professors and students should be
rich in the external means of knowledge——an extensive and well-chosen
_ library, instruments, apparatus, models, specimens, &e. Especially would
I recommend that there should be an astronomical observatory connect-
ed with the institution. The expense of this would not be very gre#t,
and the Government are already in possession of many of the requisite
instruments. By such means, a meridian may be established, not only
for our own country, but for the western continent. To this all our na-
tiopal surveys, our charts, &c., may be referred. Astronomical observa-
tions might be made, for which our position and climate offer peculiar
advantages. There is now no observatory worth naming in this part
of the world. Let, then, the American Government now build one, and
it will not only be an honor to the nation, but it will be a powerful reason
for giving permanency to the present seat of Government.

It may not be thought best to employ any artificial means for stimulants
to rivalship, and to seek for literary honors. Congress will always have
the right of visitation, and they can, if they please, direct the committee
whom they may appoint to attend the stated examinations of the various
classes, to award medals, or some other mark of distinction, to those schol-
ars who shall give the best proof of proficiency, or the ablest essayson ap-
pointed subjects. But it should be remembered that the community at large
constitute, in fact, the most efficient board of overseers, and that that insti-
tution will be the most honored and frequented, which sends forth the best
prepared and the most faithful agents to meet the wants of their country.

I have the honor, sir, to be yours, with sentiments of great respect

and esteem, ;
S. CHAPIN.

REPORT.

GENTLEMEN: A statement of the financial condition of the Smithsonian
Institution, and of the progress made in the erection of the building, hav-
ing been presented to your board by the committees charged with the care
of these objects, it becomes my duty, as Secretary of the institution, to give
an account of what has been done relative to the development of the plan
of organization, and of the steps which have been taken in the way of
carrying it into operation.

In accordance with my instructions, I consulted with men of eminence,
in the different branches of literature and science, relative to the details of
the plan of organization, and arranged the various suggestions offered, in
the form of the accompanying programme. This, after having been sub-
mitted to a number of persons in whose knowledge and judgment I have
confidence, is now presented to the board, with the concurrence of the
Committee on Organization, for consideration and provisional adoption. I
regret that my engagements have been such as to render it impossible for
me to call upon many persons whose counsel would have been valuable,
but I hope hereafter to avail myself of their advice in behalf of the institu-
tion. TL also regret that I could not give the names of those whose sug-
gestions have been adopted in the programme; the impossibility of ren-
dering justice to all, has prevented my attempting this. Many of the sugges-
tions have been offered by different persons, independently of each other;
and, indeed, the general plan of the increase and diffusion of knowledge
as adopted by the board, is such as would naturally arise in the mind of
any person conversant with the history of physical science, and with the
means usually employed for its extension and diffusion.

The introduction to the programme contains a series of propositions,
suggested by a critical examination of the will of Smithson, to serve asa
guide in judging of the fitness of any proposed plan for carrying out the
design of the testator. ‘The first section of the programme gives the de-
tails of the plan proposed for the increase and diffusion of knowledge by
means of publication and original researches. The second section fur-
nishes the details, so far as they can be made out at the present time, of
the formation of a library, and a collection of objects of nature and art.
‘These two plans combined, embrace the general propositions adopted by
the Board of Regents at their last meeting, as the basis of future operations.
It is intended in the proposed plan to harmonize the two modes of increasing
4

and diffusing knowledge, and to give to the institution the widest influ-
ence compatible with its limited income. ‘That all the propositions will
meet with general approval cannot be expected; and that this organization
is the best that could be devised is neither asserted nor believed. To
produce a priort a plan of organization which shall be found to succeed
perfectly in practice, and require no amendment, would be difficult under
the most favorable circumstances, and becomes almost impossible where
conflicting opinions are to be harmonized, and the definite requirements of
the act establishing the institution are to be observed. It is not intended
that the details of the organization, as given in the programme, should be
permanently adopted without careful trial; they are rather presented as
suggestions to be adopted provisionally, and to be carried into operation
gradually and cautiously, with such changes, from time to time, as expe-
rience may dictate.

PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[Presented to the Board of Regents December 8, 1847.]

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a plan of
organization.

1. Witt or Smiruson. The property is bequeathed to the United States
of America, ‘‘ to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.’’

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of the
United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the testator.

3. The institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently sup-
posed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and perpetuate
his name.

4. The objects of the institution are—Ist, to increase, and 2d, to diffuse
knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to increase the existing stock of knowledge by the addition of
new truths; and the second to disseminate knowledge, thus increased,
among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating and
promoting the discovery of new truths, and can he most efliciently diffused
among men by means of the press.
5

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should be
such as to enable the institution to produce results in the way of increas-
ing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced by the existing
institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provisionally,
can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or be abandoned,
in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to make up for the loss of time occasioned by the delay
of eight years in establishing the institution, a considerable portion of the
interest which has accrued should be added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated, the
funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the construc-
tion of the building; and not only should the first cost of the edifice be
considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in repair, and of
the support of the establishment necessarily connected with it. There
should also be but few individuals permanently supported by the institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined by
the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be benefited
by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expenditure on local
objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from the
will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of the act of
Congress establishing the institution. These area library, a museum, and
a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of organization of the institution, in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To IncrEase Know tence. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offering
Suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular re-
searches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To Dirruse Knowtepce. It is proposed—

1. 'To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the different
branches of knowledge; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general in-
terest.
6

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.
J. By stimulating researches.

1. Rewards, consisting of money, medals, &c., offered for original me-
moirs on all branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of volumes, in
a quarto form, and entitled ‘‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.”’

3. No memoir, on subjects of physical science, to be acccepted for pub-
lication, which does not furnish a positive addition to human knowledge
resting On original research; and all unverified speculations to be rejected.

4. Each memoir presented to the institution to be submitted for exami-
nation to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in the branch
to which the memoir pertains, and to be accepted for publication only in
case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. ‘The commission to be chosen by the officers of the institution, and
the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless a favorable
decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the Transactions of
literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given toall the colleges
and principal libraries in this country. One part of the remaining copies
may be offered for sale; and the other carefully preserved, to form complete
sets of the volumes, to supply the demand from new institutions.

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs to be
given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to Congress.

Il. By appropriating a portion of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended by
counsellors of the institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that in course
of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published, with
the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithsonian Contri-
butions to Knowledge,

4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations, for solving the
problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological, magnet-
ical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the formation of a
Physical Atlas of the United States,

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determination of
the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of light; chemical
7

analyses of soils and plants; collection and publication of articles of science,
accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical, moral,
and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated in
American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the different
races of men in North America; also explorations and accurate surveys of
the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our country.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the
new discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year inall
branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally interesting,
but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of the reports
may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as the income of the
institution, or the changes in the branches of knowledge, may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators, eminent in the dif
ferent branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publications,
domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his report; to be
paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on the title-page of the
report.

4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons interested
in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it, without pur-
chasing the whole.

5.’ These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distribution ;
the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific institutions, and
sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in the
reports.

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry, and
meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts.
8

Il. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology, an-
tiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world ; penal reform, &c.

Ill. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

II. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general in-
terest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs, trans-
lated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the direction of
the institution, or procured by offering premiums for the best exposition of
a given subject.

2. The treatises should in all cases be submitted to a commission of
competent judges previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of the
present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in the table
of reports. Also of the following subjects, suggested by the Committee on
Organization, viz: the statistics of labor, the productive arts of life, public
instruction, &c.

SECTION Ii.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents, providing for the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the institution contemplated the
formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents, in-
cluding these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide the
income into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge by
means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme before
given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of a library and
a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.
9

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be required,
consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions and proceedings
of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the more important cur-
rent periodical publications, and other works necessary in preparing the
periodical reports.

5. The institution should make special collections, particularly of ob-
jects to verify its own publications.

6. Also a collection of instruments of research in all branches of expert-
mental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those mentioned
above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United States should
be procured, in order that the valuable books first purchased may be such
as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also catalogues of memoirs, and of books in foreign libraries, and.
other materials, should be collected for rendering the institution a centre
of bibliographical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase by
donation, as rapidly as the income of the institution can make provision
for their reception, and therefore it will seldom be necessary to purchase
any articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of arts casts of
the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of expense,
for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of anti-
quities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, besides the
Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except one, to act as
librarian.

14. The duty of the Secretary will be the general superintendence, with
the advice of the Chancellor and other members of the establishment, of
the literary and scientific operations of the institution; to give to the
Regents annually an account of all the transactions; of the memoirs which
have been received for publication; of the researches which have been
made; and to edit, with the assistance of the librarian, the publications of
the institution.

15. The duty of the Assistant Secretary, acting as librarian, will be, for
the present, to assist in taking charge of the collections, to select and pur-
chase, under the direction of the Secretary and a committee of the board,

books and catalogues, and to procure the information before mentioned ; to
2
° 10

give information on plans of libraries, and to assist the Secretary in editing
the publications of the institution and in the other duties of his office.

16. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art; also distinguished individuals should be invited to give
lectures on subjects of general interest.

17. When the building is completed, and when, in accordance with the

et of Congress, the charge of the National Museum is given to the
Smithsonian Institution, other assistants will be required.

Haplanations and ilustrations of the programme.

Though the leading propositions of the programme have been fully dis-
cussed by the board, yet it will be important to offer some remarks in ex-
planation and illustration of them in their present connexion.

That the institution is not a national establishment, in the sense in which:
institutions dependent on the government for support are so, must be evi-
dent when it is recollected that the money was not absolutely given to the
United States, but intrusted to it for a special object, namely: the estab-
lishment of an institution for the benefit of men, to bear the name of the
donor, and, consequently, to reflect upon his memory the honor of all the
good which may be accomplished by means of the bequest. ‘The operations
of the Smithsonian Institution ought, therefore, to be mingled as little as
possible with those of the government, and its funds should be applied ex-
clusively and faithfully to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.

That the bequest is intended for the benéfit of men in general, and that
its influence ought not to be restricted to a single district, or even nation,
may be inferred not only from the words of the will, but also from the
character of Smithson himself; and I beg leave to quote, from a scrap of
paper in his own hand, the following sentiment bearing on this point:
‘¢™™he man of science has no country; the world is his country—all men,
his countrymen.’’ The origin of the funds, the bequest of a foreigner,
should also preclude the adoption of a plan which does not, in the words
of Mr. Adams, “‘ spread the benefits to be derived from the institution not
only over the whole surface of this Union, but throughout the civilized
world.’’? ‘Mr. Smithson’s reason for fixing the seat of his institution at
Washington obviously was, that ¢here is the seat of government of the
United States, and there the Congress by whose legislation, and the Ex-
il

ecutive through whose agency, the trust committed to the honor, intelli-
gence, and good faith of the nation, is to be fulfilled.”? The centre of
operations being permanently fixed at Washington, the character of thts
city for literature and science will be the more highly exalted in proportion
as the influence of the institution is more widely diffused.

That the terms increase and diffusion of knowledge are logicaliy dis-
tinct, and should be literally interpreted with reference to the will, must be
evident when we reflect that they are used in a definite sense, and not as
mere synonymes, by all who are engaged in the pursuits to which Smithsen
devoted his life. In England there are two classes of institutions, founded
on the two ideas conveyed by these terms. ‘The Royal Society, the Astro-
nomical, the Geological, the Statistical, the Antiquarian Societies, all have
for their object the increase of knowledge; while the London Institution, the
Mechanics’ Institution, the Surry Institution, the Society for the Diffusion
of Religious Knowledge, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge,
are all intended to diffuse or disseminate knowledge among men. In
our own country, also, the same distinction is observed in the use of the
terms by men of science. Our colleges, academies, and common schools,
are recognised as institutions partially intended for the diffusion of knowl-
edge, while the express object of some of our scientific societies 1s the pro-
motion of the discovery of new truths.

The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of knowl-
edge; though propositions have been frequently made for devoting the
funds exclusively to the promotion of certain branches of science having
more immediate application to the practical arts of life, and the adoption of
these propositions has been urged on the ground of the canformity of such
objects to the pursuits of Smithson; but an examinsiion of his writings
will show that he excluded from his own studies no branch of general
knowledge, and that he was fully impressed with the important philosoph-
ical fact, that all subjects of human thought relate to one great system of
truth. To restrict, therefore, the ‘operations of ‘the institution to a single
science or art, would do injustice ‘to the character of the donor, as well as
to the cause of general knowledge. If preference is to be given to any
branches of research, it should be to the higher, and apparently more ab-
stract; to the discovery of new principles, rather than of isolated facts. And
this is true even in a practical point of view. Agriculture would have for-
ever remained an empirical art, had it not been for the light shed upon it
by the atomic theory of chemistry; and incomparably more is to be ex-
pected as to its future advancement from the perfection of the microscope,
than from improvements in the ordinary instruments of husbandry.
12

The plan of increasing and diffusing knowledge, presented in the first
section of the programme, will be found in strict accordance with the sev-
eral propositions deduced from the will of Smithson, and given in the in-
troduction. It embraces, as a leading feature, the design of interesting
the greatest number of individuals in the operations of the institution,
and of spreading its influence as widely as possible. It forms an active
organization, exciting all to make original researches who are gifted with
the necessary power, and diffusing a kind of knowledge, now only ac-
cessible to the few, among all those who are willing to receive it. In
this country, though many excel in the application of science to the prac-
tical arts of life, few devote themselves to the continued labor and patient
thought necessary to the discovery and development of new truths. The
principal cause of this want of attention to original research, is the want,
not of proper means, but of proper encouragement. The publication of
original memoirs and periodical reports, as contemplated by the programme,
will act as a powerful stimulus on the latent talent of our country, by pla-
cing in bold relief the real laborers in the field of original research, while
it will afford the best materials for the use of those engaged in the diffu-
sion of knowledge.

‘The advantages which will accrue from the plan of publishing the vol-
umes of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, are various. In the
first place, it will serve to render the name of the founder favorably known
wherever literature and science are cultivated, and to keep it in continual
remembrance with each succeeding volume, as long as knowledge is val-
ued. <A single new truth, first given to the world through these volumes,
will forever stamp their character as a work of reference. The contribu-
tions will thus form the most befitting monument to perpetuate the name
of one whose life was devoted to the increase of knowledge, and whose
ruling passion, strong in death, prompted the noble bequest intended to
facilitate the labors of others in the same pursuit.

Again, the publication of a series of volumes of original memoirs will
afford to the institution the most ready means of entering into friendly
relations and correspondence with all the learned societies in the world,
and of enriching its library with their current transactions and proceedings.
But perhaps the most important effect of the plan will be that of giving to
the world many valuable memoirs, which, on account of the expense of the
illustrations, could not be otherwise published. Every one who adds
new and important truths to the existing stock of knowledge, must be
of necessity, to a certain degree, in advance of his age. Hence the
number of readers and purchasers of a work is generally in the inverse

a
13

ratio of its intrinsic value; and consequently, authors of the highest
rank of merit are frequently deterred from giving their productions to
the world on account of the pecuniary loss to which the publica-
tion would subject them. When our lamented countryman, Bowditch,
contemplated publishing his commentary on La Place, he assembled his
family and informed them that the execution of this design would sacri-
fice one-third of his fortune, and that it was proper his heirs should be con-
sulted on a subject which so nearly concerned them. ‘The answer
was worthy of the children of such a father: ‘“‘ We value,”’ said they,
‘your reputation more than your money.’’ Fortunately, in this in-
stance, the means of making such a sacrifice existed; otherwise one of
the proudest monuments of American science could not have been given
to the world. In the majority of cases, however, those who are most
capable of extending human knowledge are least able to incur the expense
of the publication. Wilson, the American Omithologist, states, in a letter
to Michaux, that he has sacrificed everything to publish his work: ‘I
have issued,’’ he says, ‘‘ six volumes, and.am engaged on the seventh, but
as yet I have not received a single cent of the proceeds.’’ In an address
on the subject of natural history, by one of our most active cultivators of
this branch of knowledge, we find the following remarks, which are directly
in point: ‘‘ Few are acquainted with the fact that from the small number
of scientific works sold, and the great expense of plates, our naturalists not
only are not paid for their labors, but suffer pecuniary loss from their publi-
cations. Several works on different branches of zoology, now ia the course
of publication, will leave their authors losers by an aggregate of $15,000.
I do not include in this estimate works already finished—one, for instance,
the best contribution to the natural history of man extant, the publication
of which will occasion its accomplished author a loss of several thou-
sand dollars. A naturalist is extremely fortunate if he can dispose of 200
copies of an illustrated work, and the number of copies printed rarely exceeds
250.” It may be said that these authors have their reward in the reputa-
tion which they thus purchase; but reputation should be the result of the
talents and labor expended in the production of a work, and should not
in the least depend upon the fact that the author is able to make.a pecu-
niary sacrifice in giving the account of his discoveries to the public.
Besides the advantage to the author of having his memoir published in
the Smithsonian Contributions free of expense, his labors will be given to
the world with the stamp of approval of a commission of learned men; and
his merits will be generally made known through the reports of the insti-
tution. ‘Though the premiums offered may be small, yet they will have
considerable effect in producing original articles. Fifty er a hundred dollars
14

awarded to the author of an original paper, will, in many instances, suf-
fice to supply the books, or to pay for the materials, or the manual labor
required, in prosecuting the research.

There is one proposition of the programme which has given rise to much
discussion, and which, therefore, requires particular explanation; 1 allude
to that which excludes from the contributions all papers consisting merely
of unverified speculations on subjects of physical science. The object of
this proposition is to obviate the endless difficulties which would occur in
rejecting papers of an unphilosophical character; and though it may in
some cases exclude an interesting communication, yet the strict observance
of it will be found of so much practical importance that it cannot be dis-
pensed with. It has been supposed, from the adoption of this proposition,
that we are disposed to undervalue abstract speculations: on the contrary,
we know that all the advances in true science—namely, a knowledge of the
laws of phenomena—are made by provisionally adopting well-conditioned
hypotheses, the product of the imagination, and subsequently verifying
them by an appeal to experiment and observation. Every new hypothesis
of scientific value must not only furnish an exact explanation of knowa
facts, but must also enable us to predict, in kind and quantity, the phe-
nomena which will be exhibited under any given combination of cir-
cumstances. ‘Thus, in the case of the undulatory hypothesis of light, it
was inferred, as a logical consequence, that if the supposition were true -
that light consisted of waves of an ethereal medium, then two rays of light,
like two waves of water under certain conditions, should annihilate each
other, and darkness be produced. ‘The experiment was tried, and the
anticipated result was obtained. tis this exact agreement of the deduc-
tion with the actual result of experience that constitutes the verification of
an hypothesis, and which alone entitles it to the name of a theory, and to
a place in the Transactions of a scientific institution. It must be recollected
that it is much easier to speculate than to investigate, and that very few
of all the hypotheses imagined are capable of standing the test of scientific
verification.

For the practical working of the plan for obtaining the character of a
memoir, and the precaution taken before it is accepted for publication, 1
would refer to the correspondence, given in a subsequent part of this report,
relative to the memoir now in process of publication by the institution.
As it is not our intention to interfere with the proceedings of other inst-
tutions, but to co-operate with them, so far as our respective eperations are
compatible, communications may be referred to learned societies for inspec-
tion, as in the case of the above mentioned memoir, and abstracts of them
given to the world through the bulletins of these societies, while the details
15

of the memoirs and their expensive illustrations are published in the vol-
umes of the Smithsonian Contributions. The officers of several learned
societies in this country have expressed a willingness to co-operate in this
way.

Since original research is the most direct way of increasing knowl-
edge, it can scarcely be doubted that a part of the income of the bequest
should be appropriated to this purpose, provided suitable persons can
be found, and their labors be directed to proper objects. ‘The num-
ber, however, of those who are capable of discovering scientific prin-
ciples is comparatively small; like the poet, they are ‘‘born, not
made,’’ and, like him, must be left to choose their own subject, and
wait the fitting time of inspiration. In case a person of this class has
fallen on a vein of discovery, and is pursuing it with success, the better
plan will be to grant him a small sum of money to carry on his investiga-
tions, provided they are considered worthy of assistance by competent
judges. This will have the double effect of encouraging him in the pursuit,
and of facilitating his progress. The institution, however, need not depend
upon cases of this kind, even if they were more numerous than they are,
for the application of its funds in the line of original research. There are
large fields of observation and experiment, the cultivation of which, though
it may afford no prospect of the discovery of a principle, can hardly fai!
to produce results of importance both in a practical and a theoretic point of
view. As an illustration of this remark, I may mention the case of the in-
vestigations made afew years ago by committees of the Franklin Institute,
of Philadelphia. 'The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States
placed at the disposal of this society asum of money, for the purpose of
making experiments with reference to the cause of the explosion of steam-
boilers. A committee of the society was chosen for this purpose, which
adopted the ingenious plan of writing to all persons in the United States en-
gaged in the application of steam, and particularly to those who had observed
the explosion of a steam-boiler. In this way opinions and suggestions in
great variety, as to the cause of explosions, were obtained. The most
plausible of these were submitted to the test of experiment: the results ob-
tained were highly important, and are to be found favorably mentioned in
every systematic work on the subject of steam which has appeared, in any
language, within the last few years. New and important facts were es-
tablished; and, what was almost of as much consequence, errors which had
usurped the place of truth were dethroned.

In the programme, examples are given of a few subjects of original re-
search to which the attention of the institution may be turned. I will
16

mention one in this place, which, in connexion with the contents of our
first memoir, may deserve immediate attention. I allude toa small appro-
priation made annually for researches with referencé to the remains of the
ancient inhabitants of our country. This is a highly interesting field,
and what is done in regard to it should be done quickly. Every year the
progress of civilization is obliterating the ancient mounds, cities and vil-
lages are rising on the spots they have so long occupied undisturbed, and the
distinctive marks of these remains are every year becoming less and less
legible.

In carrying out the spirit of the plan adopted, namely, that of affecting
men in general by the operations of the institution, it is evident that the
principal means of diffusing knowledge must be the press. ‘Though lec-
tures should be given in the city in which Smithson has seen fit to direct
the establishment of his institution, yet, as a plan of general diffusion of
knowledge, the system of lectures would be entirely inadequate; every
village in our extended country would have a right to demand a share of
the benefit, and the income of the institution would be insufficient to supply
a thousandth part of the demand. It is also evident that the knowledge
diffused should, if possible, not only embrace all branches of general in-
terest, so that each reader might find a subject suited to his taste, but also
that it should differ in kind and quality from that which can be readily
obtained through the cheap publications of the day. These requisites
will be fully complied with in the publications of the series of reports pro-
posed in the programme. A series of periodicals of this kind, posting up all
the discoveries in science from time to time, and giving a well digested ac-
count of all the important changes in the different branches of knowledge,
is a desideratum in the English language. The idea is borrowed from a
partial plan of this kind in operation in Sweden and Germany; and for an
example of what the work should be, I would refer to the annual report to
the Swedish Academy of its perpetual Secretary, Berzelius, on physical
science. ‘The reports can be so prepared as to be highly interesting to the
general reader, and at the same time of great importance to the exclusive
cultivator of a particular branch of knowledge. Full references should
be given, in foot-notes, to the page, number, or volume of the work from
which the information was obtained, and where a more detailed account
can be found. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the preparation of
these reports should be intrusted only to persons profoundly acquainted
with the subjects to which they relate—namely, to those who are devoted
to particular branches, while they possess a knowledge of general princi-
ples. Sufficient explanations should be introduced to render the report in-
17

telligible to the general reader, without destroying its scientific character.
Occasionally reports may be obtained from abroad—as, for example, ac-
counts of the progress of certain branches of knowledge in foreign coun-
tries—and these may be translated, if necessary, and incorporated into other
reports, by some competent person in this country.

Besides the reports on the progress of knowledge, the programme pro-
poses to publish occasionally brief treatises on particular subjects. There
are always subjects of general interest, of which brief expositions would
be of much value. ‘The preparation of these, however, should be intrusted
to none but persons of character and reputation, and should be subjected
to a revision by competent and responsible judges before they are given to
the public. hey may be presented in the form of reports on the existing
state of knowledge relative to a given subject, and may sometimes consist
of memoirs and expositions of particular branches of literature and science,
translated from foreign languages. The reports and treatises of the insti-
tution, sold at a price barely sufficient to pay the expense of printing, will
find their way into every school in our country, and will be used not as
first lessons for the pupil, but as sources of reliable information for the
teacher.

The second section of the programme gives, so far as they have been
made out, the details of the part of the plan of organization directed by
the act of Congress establishing the institution. ‘The two plans, namely,
that of publication and original research, and that of collections of objects
of nature and art, are not incompatible, and may be carried on harmoni-
ously with each other. The only effect which they will have on one
another is that of limiting the operation of each, on account of the funds
given to the other. Still, with a judicious application, and an economical
expenditure of the income, and particularly by rigidly observing the plan
of finance, suggested by Dr. Bache, in the construction of the building,
much good may be effected in each of the two branches of the institution.
To carry on the operations of the first, a working library will be required,
consisting of the past volumes of the transactions and proceedings of all
the learned societies in every language. ‘These are the original sources
from which the most important principles of the positive knowledge of our
day have been drawn. We shall also require a collection of the most im-
portant current literature and science for the use of the collaborators of the
reports; most of these, however, will be procured in exchange for the pub-
lications of the institution, and therefore will draw but little from the li-
brary fund. For other suggestions relative to the details of the library, I

3
is

would refer you to the annexed communication from Professor Jewett, As-
sistant Secretary, acting as librarian. (See appendix No. 1.)

The collections of the institution, as far as possible, should consist of
such articles as are not elsewhere to be found in this country, so that the
visitors at Washington may see new objects, and the spirit of the plan be
kept up, of interesting the greatest possible number of individuals. A per-
fect collection of all objects of nature and of art, if such could be obtained
and deposited in one place, would form a museum of the highest interest;
but the portion of the income of the bequest which can be devoted to the
increase and maintenance of the museum, will be too small to warrant
any attempt towards an indiscriminate collection. It is hoped that in due
time other means may be found of establishing and supporting a general
collection of objects of nature and art at the seat of the general govern-
ment, with funds not derived from the Smithsonian bequest. For the
present, it should be the object of the institution to confine the application
of the funds, first, to such collections as will tend to facilitate the study of
the memoirs which may be published in the Contributions, and to estab-
lish their correctness; secondly, to the purchase of such objects as are not
generally known in this country, in the way of art, and the illustration of
antiquities, such as models of buildings, &c.; and, thirdly, to the formation
of a collection of instruments of physical research, which will be required
both in the illustration of new physical truths, and in the scientific inyes-
tigations undertaken by the institution.

Much popular interest may be awakened in favor of the institution
at Washington, by throwing the rooms of the building open, on siated
evenings during the session of Congress, for literary and scientific assem-
blies, after the manner of the weekly meetings of the Royal Institution tn
London. At these meetings, without the formality of a regular lecture,
new truths in science may be illustrated, and new objects of art exhibited.
Besides these, courses of lectures may be given on particular subjects by
the officers of the institution, or by distinguished individuals invited for
the purpose.

Commencement of the operations of the institution.

I was authorized, in connexion with the Committee on Organization, ta
commence the publication of the Smithsonian Contributions to Know!-
edge, and to receive any memoir which might be presented on any subject,
provided it was found, on examination, to furnish an interesting addition
to the sum of human knowledge, resting on original research. The
first memoir presented, and found to be of the character prescribed by
19

the resolution of the board, was one on the remains of the ancient in-
habitants of the North American continent. It contains the result of
several years’ labor in the survey and exploration of the mounds and earth-
works of the Mississippi valley, and will furnish a highly interesting addi-
tion to the antiquities of our country, which could not have been given to
the world, but for the timely aid extended to it by this institution. ‘The
memoir was referred to the American Ethnological Society, with a request
that a committee of its members might be appointed to examine and re-
port on its character, as to fitness for publication in the Smithsonian Con-
tributions to Knowledge. On the favorable report of this committee, and
on the responsibility of the society, the memoir has been accepted for pub-
lication. The following correspondence will serve to give an account of
the work, and to illustrate the manner in which it is proposed to submit the
papers which may be presented for publication to a commission of com-
petent judges.

ETHNOLOGICAL MEMOIR OF MESSRS. SQUIER AND DAViS.

From Messrs. Squier and Davis to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

CuituicoTHE, O., May 15, 1847.

Dear Sir: It is proposed in the recognised plan of organization of the
Smithsonian Institution, of which you are the executive officer, to publish,
under the title of ‘‘ Smzthsonian Contributions to Knowledge,’ such original
papers and memoirs ‘‘ as shall constitute valuable additions to the sum of hu-
man knowledge.’ Under the belief that it falls legitimately within the scope
of the above plan, the undersigned herewith submit for acceptance and publi-
cation, subject to the prescribed rules of the institution, a MS. memoir, entitled
‘« AnctenT MonuMENTS OF THE Mississippi VaLLEy, comprising the results of
Extensive Original Surveys and Explorations: by E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis.”
The extent of these investigations, and their general character, are sufficiently
indicated in the prefatory remarks to the volume.

With high consideration, we are truly yours,

WasHINGTON, June 2, 1847.
Dear Sir: I am authorized by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
to publish, in the numbers of the ‘ Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,’
any memoir which may be presented for this purpose, provided that, on careful
20

examination by a commission of competent judges, the memoir shall be found
to furnish a new and interesting addition to knowledge, resting on original re-
search. The accompanying memo1, entitled ‘ Ancient. Monuments of t the Mis-
sissippt Valley,” &c., having been presented for publication, I beg leave to refer
the same, through you, to the American Ethnological Society, with the re-
quest that a committee of the members may be appointed to examine and
report on its character, in reference to the particulars above mentioned. If the
report of the committee be favorable, the memoir will be accepted for publica-
tion ; full confidence being placed in the ability of the committee to judge of
the character of the article, and in their caution in making up their opinion.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

‘New York, June 12, 1847.

“ Dear Sir: I have the honor to enclose a copy of the proceedings and
resolutions of the New York Ethnological Society upon the MS. work on
American Antiquities, by Messrs. E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis, submitted with
your letter of the 2d inst.

‘‘T approve entirely of the resolutions and recommendations of the society.

‘Whatever may be the intrinsic value of the remains of former times which
are found in the United States, it is necessary that they should at least be cor-
rectly described, and that existing gross errors should be corrected; and I re-
peat my conviction that, though ardent, Messrs. Squier and Davis are animated
by that thorough love of truth which renders their researches worthy of entire
confidence.

“ Prof. J. HENRY,

“ Secretary of Smithsonian Institution.”

At a regular meeting of the American Ethnological Society, held at the
house of the Hon. ALpert GALLATIN, on the evening of the 4th of June, the
president laid before the members a communication from Professor J Henry,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, transmitting, for the examination and
opinion of the society, a MS. work on the Ancient * Aboriginal Monuments of
the United States. On motion, the letter and accompanying MS. were refer-
red to a committee consisting of Epwarp Rogrinson, D. D., Joun R. Barrett,
Professor W. W. Turner, Samuet G. Morton, M. D., and Hon. Grorce P.
Marsu, to report upon the same. At a subsequent meeting of the society,
this committee submitted the following report and resolutions, which were’
unanimously accepted and adopted :
21

REPORT.

The committee of the American Ethnological Society, to which was referred
the communication of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, transmitting
amanuscript work, entitled ““ ANctenr Monuments or THE Mississippi VAL-
LEY, comprising the results of Extensive Original Surveys and Explorations,”
by E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis, beg leave to report, that

They have examined the work in question, and regard it not only as a new
and interesting, but as an eminently valuable addition to our stock of knowl-
edge on a subject little understood, but in which is felt a deep and constantly
increasing interest, both in our country and abroad. In their judgment, the
work is worthy of the subject, and highly creditable to the authors. Its chief
features are, a scientific arrangement, simplicity, and directness of statement,
and legitimate deduction from facts, while there is no attempt at mere specula-
tion or theory. If published, it will be an enduring monument to connect the
names of the investigators in honorable and lasting remembrance with the great
subject of American Archeology.

The existence and progress of these investigations were made known to
the society by correspondence early in the year 1846; and in June of that year
specimens of the relics recovered, accompanied by numerous maps and plans of
ancient earthworks and sectional views of the mounds from which the remains
were taken, were laid before the society by Mr. Squier in person. These ex-
cited deep interest and surprise in all who saw them; and the society imme-
diately took measures to encourage further investigation, and secure the publi-
cation, under its own auspices, of the important results already obtained. A
few months later, the chairman of the present committee, being in Ohio, was
enabled, through the kindness of Messrs. Squier and Davis, to visit several of
the more important monuments in the immediate vicinity of Chillicothe, and,
among these, ‘‘Mound City,” so called, from which very many of the minor relics
and specimens were procured. He was struck with the accuracy of the plans
and drawings, as well as of the accounts which had been laid before the socie-
ty, and bears full testimony to the fidelity and integrity with which the process
of investigation and delineation has been conducted.

During the last and present season the researches of these gentlemen have
been actively prosecuted and widely extended, and the above work, largely il-
lustrated, comprising the results, has been prepared. These results are so nu-
merous and important, and consequently such is the extent and magnitude of
the work itself, as to put its publication beyond any means which the society
can command. Under these circumstances, your committee learn with pleas-
ure that preliminary arrangements have been made for its publication by the
Smithsonian Institution, among its ‘Contributions to Knowledge.” It can only
be a matter of sincere gratification to this society to see that which it cannot
itself accomplish for the history and antiquities of our country, taken up and
carried out under such favorable auspices: and they cannot but rejoice that an
opportunity is thus afforded to that noble institution of opening its high career
by fostering scientific researches into the interesting problems connected with
the Ante-Columbian history and Aboriginal monuments of our own country.

In view of these facts, your committee would recommend the adoption of the
following resolutions by the society :

Resolved, That this society regard the researches of Messrs. Squier and
Davis as of very great importance in American Archeology, and as casting much
light upon our aboriginal antiquities, especially upon the character and habits
of the earliest races which had their seat in the Mississippi valley.
22

Resolved, That we regard the work prepared upon this subject as one of
great general interest, and as worthy to be adopted for publication by the Smith-
sonian Institution, both as resting on original researches, and as affording re-
markable illustrations of the history of the American continent.

Your committee would also append to this report the accompanying letters
from Samuel G. Morton, M. D., of Philadelphia, and Hon. George P. Marsh, of
Vermont, both members of this society, and joint members of this committee.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

New York, June 9, 1847.

I have examined with much interest and attention the manuscripts, drawings,
and ancient relics in the possession of Mr. E. G. Squier, and am happy to
say that my previous impressions concerning the value of the researches of that
gentleman and his associate are fully confirmed. It is fortunate for the cause
of American Archeology that the first systematic attempt at its elucidation
should have been conceived and executed in so truly philosophical a spirit; and
rich as this age already is in antiquarian lore, it has, Ithink, received few more
important contributions than that which the enlightened and generous zeal of
these two private gentlemen is about to confer upon it. The Smithsonian col-
lections could not begin with a more appropriate or creditable essay: and I
hope that every facility may be afforded to the authors in bringing before the
public the results of their honorable labors in as suitable a form and with as
little delay as possible.

GEO. P. MARSH.

PHILADELPHIA, June 8, 1847.

As a member of the committee of the American Ethnological Society, ap-
pointed to report on the memoir on American Archwology, by Messrs. E. G.
Squierand E. H. Davis, Ihave great pleasure in saying that after a careful and
repeated inspection of the materials in the hands of those gentlemen, I am con-
vinced they constitute by far the most important contribution to the Arche-
ology of the United States that has ever been offered to the public. The num-
ber and accuracy of their plans, sketches, &c., have both interested and sur-
prised me, and it is gratifying to learn that the preliminary arrangements have
been made for their publication under the honorable auspices of the Smithso-
nian Institution.

SAML. GEORGE MORTON.

The memoirs of Messrs. Squier and Davis will occupy the greater portion,
if not the whole, of the first volume of the Contributions. The illustra-
tions will consist of fifty-five quarto plates of the mounds, earthworks, and
maps of the adjacent country; also, of about two hundred wood-cuts,
principally delineations of the various articles found in the mounds.
Those who consider no branch of knowledge of any value but such as
23

relates to the immediate gratification of our physical wants, have objected
to the acceptance of this memoir as one of the first publications of the
institution; but it must be recollected that the will of Smithson makes no
restriction in favor of any particular kind of knowledge, and that each
branch is, therefore, entitled to a share of his bequest. The Ethnological
memoir of Messrs. Squier and Davis was the first, of the proper character,
presented for publication, and hence it was entitled to the first place in the
series of Smithsonian Contributions. Besides this, it furnishes an addition
to a branch of knowledge which is at this time occupying the attention of
a large class of minds, and which cannot fail to be interesting to every
intelligent person who would learn something of the changes to which
man has been subjected.

One of the volumes of the Contributions will contain a sketch of the life
of Smithson, by the Chancellor. The materials for this have been col-
lected from the several volumes of the Transactions of the Royal Society,
and the scientific journals of the beginning of the present, and the latter part
of the last century. ‘The first volume will be published as soon as the
wood-cuts and plates, now in the course of preparation, are finished.

Besides the memoirs before mentioned, a number of others have been
presented, some of which, though apparently of interest, and the product
of thought and labor, were not of the character required by the resolution
of the board, and these have either been returned to the authors, or are in
the possession of the Seeretary. A number of others have also been pro-
visionally adopted, or are in the course of preparation. Some of these are
on the most abstruse parts of physical science, and all will do honor to the
intellectual character of our country. Though the number of original
memoirs which will be found worthy of a place in the Contributions will
probably not be large, yet it will, perhaps, be best to set apart a definite
portion of the income of the bequest—as, for example, at present three or
four thousand dollars annually—to defray the expense of this part of the
plan of increasing knowledge. A considerable portion, however, of the
sum thus expended will be returned to the institution in the form of addi-
tions to its library. I may also suggest, in this place, the propriety of the
adoption, by the board, of a resolution inviting all engaged in original re-
search to send the results of their labors for publication in the Smithso-
nian Contributions.

The board also directed me to commence the collection of apparatus,
and I accordingly sent orders to Europe, to the amount of twelve hundred
dollars, for the purchase of such articles as could not be procured in the
United States. Most of the instruments have been received, and will
24

be found of importance, not only in the way of original research, but
also in illustrating some of the most interesting and recent phenomena
of physical science, as well as serving as samples for imitation to the art-
ists of this country. It was thought that these articles would be admitted
free of duty, and a petition to this effect was presented to the Secretary of
the Treasury; but, though this officer is well known to be much interested
in the prosperity of the institution, such is the nature of the law that the
duty could not be remitted.

There is an article of apparatus which, within a few years past, has
opened almost a new world of research in the phenomena of life and
organization, the use of which is now indispensable in advancing our
knowledge of physiology and its kindred branches of science. I allude to
the achromatic microscope, to increase the power of which, the artists of
Germany, France, and England have vied with each other. On account
of the small number of persons who are capable of constructing the proper
lenses, the best specimens of this instrument are very scarce in this coun-
try, and can be procured only at a great expense. Under these circum-
stances, it was a matter of much interest to learn, from a source which
could be relied upon, that an individual in the interior of the State of
New York had successfully devoted himself to the study of the micro-
scope, and that he was able to produce instruments of this kind which
would compete with the best of those constructed in Europe. In order to
do justice to the talents and labors of this person, as well as to furnish the
institution with a valuable instrument of research, I requested him to con-
struct a microscope, to be paid for out of the funds for the purchase of
apparatus, provided that a commission, appointed by myself, should find it
capable of producing certain effects. This proposition was accepted, and
the result will probably be given to the board at the next meeting.

Preparations have also been made for instituting various lines of physi-
cal research. Among the subjects mentioned in the programme as an ex-
ample for the application of the funds of the institution, is terrestrial magnet-
ism. I need scarcely say that this is a subject not only of high interest in
a theoretical point of view, but also in its direct reference to navigation and
the various geodetical operations of civil and military life. A resolution
of Congress, authorizing the exploration of the mineral lands adjacent to
the great lakes, has given to us the means of advancing this branch of
knowledge with but little expenditure of the funds of the institution. The
Secretary of the Treasury readily agreed to the proposition that there
should be added to the mineralogical and geological surveys of these
regions, determinations of the dip, the variation, and the intensity of the
25

magnetic forces, provided that the Smithsonian Institution would furnish
one set of the instruments, and take charge of the direction of the obser-
vations, and of reducing and publishing them. In the survey of the min-
eral lands in the vicinity of lake Michigan under Dr. Jackson, Dr. Locke,
of Cincinnati, has been employed with his own apparatus; and to supply
ihe necessary instruments for the survey in Wisconsin, preliminary steps
have been taken to procure other instruments from London.

Another subject of research mentioned in the programme, and which has
been urged upon the immediate attention of the institution, is that of an ex-
tensive system of meteorological observations, particularly with reference
to the phenomena of American storms. Of late years, in our country,
more additions have been made to meteorology than to any other branch
of physicalscience. Several important generalizations have been arrived at,
and definite theories proposed, which now enable us to direct our attention,
with scientific precision, to such points of observation as cannot fail to
reward us with new and interesting results. It is ‘proposed to organize a
system of observations which shall extend as far as ‘possible over the
North American continent; and in order to this, it will be necessary to en-
gage the co-operation of the British government. I have accordingly ad-
dressed a letter on this subject to Lieutenant Colonel Sabine, corresponding
secretary of the Royal Society, who assures me that, as soon as the plan
is fully matured for this country, there will be no difficulty in establishing
a system of corresponding observationsin the British provinces. 1 have also
addressed letters to several gentlemen distinguished for ‘their attainments in
meteorology, asking for suggestions as to the plan of observation; and I beg
leave to refer the board to the accompanying report of Prof. Loomis, of New
York University, and also to the communication df Prof. Espy,, received in
answer. (Appendix Nos. 2 and 3.) ‘The former contains an exposition of
the advantages which may be derived from the study of meteorology, and
what has been‘done in this branch of science in this country, and what
encouragement there is for the further prosecution of the same subject,
together with a general plan of operations. ‘The present time appears to
be peculiatly auspicious for commencing an enterprise of the proposed
kind. 'The citizens of the United States are now scattered over every part
of the southern and western portion of North America, and the extended
lines of telegraph will furnish a ready means of warning the more northern
and eastern observers to be on the watch for ithe first appearance of an
advancing storm.

All which is respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX No. 1.

Liztract from a communication of Professor Jewett, Assistant Secretary
of the institution, acting as librarian.

My prar sir: As Ido not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again
before the meeting of the Regents, I will, with your indulgence, refer to
some of the principal matters which will require attention in commencing
the library. They would no doubt all occur to you in their order, but I
have thought you might find it convenient to have this part of the busi-
ness in some degree prepared to your hands. <A great deal of preparatory
work is to be gone through with, before any books can be placed on the
shelves.

1. On the plan proposed for the library, it seems to me that the first
thing to be done is to make arrangements for obtaining catalogues, printed
or in manuscript, of the principal libraries of the United States; to ex-
amine these libraries, as far as can be done personally, in order to know
their general character, the statistics of their increase, &c.; and to form
such alliances with the librarians as will be indispensable in making the
library of the institution, in conformity with the suggestion of Dr. Bache,
a supplemental one, and a centre of bibliographical yeference. Some
libraries possess printed catalogues complete nearly down to the present
time; others are several years behindhand. It will be necessary to pro-
cure manuscript catalogues in continuation of those which have been print-
ed, and to make arrangements for receiving, from month to month, or from
year to year, lists of all future accessions. ‘These supplementary cata-
logues should all be prepared on a uniform plan. The titles should be written
on cards of the same size, so that they may be placed together in one al-
phabetical arrangement, in order to facilitate research. A mark placed
on the back of each card will designate the library from which it came.
Now, in every library with which we are in correspondence some one must
be employed to do this. It would be merely clerk’s labor, where the cata-
logues are properly kept, and no doubt the librarian or assistant might in
every case be induced to undertake it for a small compensation.

2. The next thing to be done will be to make arrangements for pro-
curing the books to which we are entitled by the 10th section f the char-
ter of the institution. Unless something be done, this provision, in course
of time, will bring in comparatively few books in ayear. Ihave no doubt
that publishers generally would readily send their books, if the subject were
properly presented to them, and arrangements made by which they could
transmit them to Washington without subjecting the institution or them-
selves to expenses altogether disproportioned to the value of the books.
27

It has occurred to me that perhaps the several district clerks might be in-
duced to attend to the business: it is perhaps legally their duty to do so, but
I suppose it would be unsafe to rely upon their performing faithfully such an
unexpected duty, unless they received for it some additional compensation.
Besides this, a circular might be printed and sent to publishers, setting
forth the advantages which would result directly to the cause of letters,
eand indirectly to themselves, from compliance with this requirement. By
these means I think we should obtain nearly all the publications of impor-
tance issued from the American press.

3. The selection of books for the first purchase must be made. This
will, [ suppose, comprise three classes of works: 1. Those which may be
immediately needed in the scientific department; 2. Bibliographical works
and descriptions, histories and catalogues of similar institutions; and, 5.
The general collection, consisting of the memoirs, transactions, and jour-
nals of the learned societies of Europe and America. These three classes of
books will forma library quite unique, and one of great utility. The
catalogue, if it be made with fulness and accuracy, will be a valuable pub-
lication. I think, further, that a somewhat extended list of books should
be made out for future purchases. ‘These lists should be intrusted to
honest and faithful men in some of the principal book marts in Europe,
with orders to buy the books whenever they can find them—at say one-
half the ordinary prices. In this way we should obtain at very low prices
great numbers of the books which we shall want. Of course, the same
list should not be left with different men. ‘The work should be done
with care, and by consultation with the best scholars in the country. It
will be difficult to find the necessary bibliographical helps. The best col-
lection of them in the country is in the library of the Brown University,
but this is very imperfect.

4. The first purchases are to be made, and the arrangements for future
purchases. ‘These, of course, should not be commenced until the lists are
as far completed as they can judiciously be in this country.

5. Another subject contemplated in the programme of organization, and
which should receive immediate attention, is the procuring of copies of some
of the most celebrated worl:s of art. It will probably be best to confine the
purchases at first principally to plaster casts of some of the finest specimens
of ancient and modern statuary. These can be procured very cheap, and
convey, of course, a perfect representation of the original. I have no doubt
that for a public institution, and one under national auspices, we could,
whenever we desire it, obtain permission to take casts directly from the
statues.

The expense of doing so would of course be somewhat greater than
that of purchasing such copies as might be found in the market, but a
28

small difference in expense is not to be thought of in such acase. It
would further be desirable to commence the purchase of the models of an-

tiquities, such as models in cork of some of the houses, temples, theatres,,
baths, &c., &c., in Pompeii and Herculaneum. These can be procured

at comparatively small prices. Models of every interesting part of Pompeii

which has been excavated, presenting in miniature a perfect view of nearly

the whole on the scale of 1 foot to 150, might be procured for about $2,000"
It might also be well to procure a few Etruscan vases; also a few antique

coins and medals, sufficient to convey some illustration of numismatics, as

a subsidiary branch of history. The Regents should of course decide

what proportion of the appropriation for collections should each year be

expended for these purposes. I will merely remark that $1,000, or even

$500 at the outset, prudently expended, would procure a very interesting

collection.

I have thus stated quite in detail the work which must be done before |
the library can be ready for use, or rather before any part of it can be placed
upon the shelves. Before it can be ready for use, much more is to be done
in arranging and cataloguing. ‘To lay properly the foundation of a large
library is a slow work, and much time must necessarily be consumed in
producing but small visible results.

APPENDIX No. 2.

Report on ihe Meteorology of the United Siates: By Professor Loomis.
Submitted to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

My pear sir: Believing that the science of meteorology has now ar-
rived at that stage of advancement in which a more powerful combination
of observers is needed to secure any rapid progress, I fully concur in the
importance of establishing an extended system of observations under the
direction of the Smithsonian Institution, and propose in this report briefly
to inquire,

I. What advantages society may expect to derive from the study of me-
teorology, particularly that branch of it which relates to the phenomena of
storms.

Ii. What has already been done in this country, Ist, towards making
the necessary observations; and, 2d, towards deducing from the observa-
tions general laws.
29

fil. What encouragement there is to a further prosecution of the same
researches; and,

IV. I shall offer a plan for securing these advantages in their fullest ex-
tent.

I. Of what importance to society is the study of meteorology ?

Very little argument is needed to prove that our comfort and convenience,
and not unfrequently our lives and property, are dependent upon meteoro-
logical phenomena. ‘This is proverbially true of the mariner. The mo-
ment he embarks upon the treacherous sea, he finds himself at the mercy
of the winds. His life often depends upon the fidelity with which he
watches every change in the aspect of the sky. Ina single hour he may
exchange the deceptive calm for the fatal tornado. The number of dis-
asters upon the sea is frightful, and is far greater than is generally known.
In the gale of December 15, 1839, 89 vessels were wrecked on the Massa-
chusetts coast; and of these, 61 ona single cape. In the great hurricane of
1780, 13 battle-ships were lost, and 16 more dismasted. England and
America alone suffer an annual loss from wrecks of more than 1,000 ves-
sels, and nearly one-half of this is on the American coast.

But how can the study of meteorology benefit the sailor? Will it en-
able him to calm the tempest—to subdue the raging of thesea? This we
do not expect; yet, if he can anticipate the approach of a storm even by a
few hours, he may generally place himself beyond the reach of its fury.
Isit in the power of science to enable the navigator to anticipate the
coming tempest? If so, then it would be difficult to name a subject
of more vital importance to our commerce. How far this object has been
already attained, and what encouragement there is to expect further dis-
eoveries, I shall consider hereafter.

The sailor is not the only person who has an interest in the study of
meteorology. Although buta small part of the population of the United
States are directly engaged in foreign commerce, yet so important has this
department of industry become, and so interwoven with all the business
of the country, that there is not a trade or profession which does not feel
the shock of any great disaster at sea. Aside from this indirect interest,
the farmer is directly dependent upon the weather for the consummation of
his plans, almost equally with the sailor. Severe drought or excessive
rains, untimely frost or a scorching sun, may blast all the hopes of the
husbandman. Here it may be asked, do you expect to produce rain or
sunshine at pleasure? Probably not. But if we can anticipate the gene-
ral character of a season, the farmer may regulate his time of planting or the
nature of his crops, so as to be least injuriously affected by unpropitious
weather; so that, if we cannot strip the lightning of its power, we may at
least direct it harmlessly to the earth.
30

Again, an extensive series of meteorological observations may prove of
immense importance to the scientific physician. It cannot be doubted
that the salubrity of a climate is to a great extent dependent upon its me-
teorology—on its mean temperature, the range of the thermometer, the
suddenness of its changes, the moisture of the air, excessive rains or un-
usual droughts, &c. ‘To trace the connexion between these causes and
prevalent diseases, requires an accumulation of precise meteorological ob-
servations made in every variety of exposure, and continued for a long pe-
riod of time. ‘That it is possible to discover such a connexion, if it really
exist, cannot admit of a reasonable doubt; nor is it difficult to anticipate
the important consequences which must flow from it. ‘To discover the
cause of disease is the first step towards acure; and itis by no means
chimerical to suppose that acomplete system of meteorological observations
throughout the United States might be the means of extending the dura-
tion of human life.

It cannot, then, be questioned that meteorology is a subject of the greatest
practical importance, provided it has any solid foundation for a science. If
the laws of storms can be. discovered, this knowledge must be of the
highest importance to mankind, particularly to those who are employed in
navigating the sea. If the prevalent character of a season can be antici-
pated, it would save the husbandman much bitter disappointment from the
failure of his crops. If the influence of climate upon disease could be
detected, it might add years to the mean duration of human life. What
encouragement there may be to anticipate that these results will ever be at-
tained, I shall consider after inquiring—

II. What has already been done for the promotion of meteorology,

1, In the way of making the necessary observations.

Previous to the year 1819, no combined systematic effort had been made
in this country for the promotion of meteorology. Registers had been in-
dustriously kept by various private individuals, but they were without
any concerted action. In 1819, under the direction of the then Secretary
of War, John C. Calhoun, a system of meteorological observations was
commenced at the different military posts, which has been continued to the
present time. This was a highly important movement, and was prompted
by a most liberal spirit. It has furnished us with an approximate knowl-
edge of the mean temperature of a considerable number of stations, many
of them remote from the more populous parts of the United States. It
should, however, be remembered that the instruments provided never ex-
ceeded a thermometer and a rain-gauge ; and the observations, therefore,
had of necessity a limited range.

In 1825, a similar system of observations was introduced into the State
of New York, almost without modification. Each of the academies incor-
31

porated by the Board of Regents was furnished with a thermometer and a
rain-gauge, and was required to keep a register, after a prescribed form, in
order to be entitled to a portion of the public literary fund. This system
has now continued for more than twenty years, and the number of
academies reporting has increased from ten to forty. ‘The plan was highly
creditable to the public spirit and scientific taste of New York. It wasa
movement in advance of public sentiment in the other States, and the ob-
servations Were, perhaps, as extensive as it was expedient to undertake at
that time. ‘These observations have determined, with considerable aceu-
racy, the mean temperature of the State; and the annual report contains
a vast amount of important meteorological statistics.

More recently, Pennsylvania has setan example of the same kind to her
sister States. In 1837 the legislature of that State appropriated $4,000 for
the advancement of meteorology; and out of this sum, which was placed
at the disposal of a joint committee of the American Philosophical Society
and Franklin Institute, a barometer, two common thermometers, a self-
registering thermometer, and a rain-gauge, were purchased for each county
in the State, to be placed in the hands of some skilful observer who
should volunteer to keep a journal of the weather, according to a com-
mon form prescribed by the committee. The observations were com-
menced with little delay, and have been regularly continued. Here are
made observations of the barometer and thermometer three times a day; of
the self-registering thermometer; the winds estimated for sixteen points of
the compass; the depth of rain; and, at some stations, observations of the
dew-point.

In the year 1843, the system of observations at the military posts was
reorganized upon a scale more in accordance with the claims of science.
They now comprise observations of the barometer, attached and external
thermometer, wet-bulb thermometer; direction and force of the wind; di-
rection, velocity, and amount of clouds; each at four hours of the day,
viz: sunrise, 9a.m., 3 and 9p. m.; together with the amount of rain,
and the times of its beginning and ending.

Thus it appears we have observations from the general government at
about sixty posts, stretching along the entire Atlantic coast, the gulf of
Mexico, the Indian territory beyond the Mississippi, and the chain of
the northern lakes. Next come the observations of two large States,
New York and Pennsylvania. And then we have amateur observers,
pretty numerous in New England—scattered more sparingly over the south
and west.

I now come to the inquiry, what progress has been made,

2, Towards deducing from these observations general laws.
iB y4

In the list of philosophers who have contributed to create science out of
the crude materials furnished by observation, I shall first mention Mr.
Redfield. His first paper on the storms of the Atlantic coast appeared in
April, 1831, in volume 20 of the American Journal of Science. This
paper gives a full account of the hurricane of September, 1821, which was
traced from the West India islands northward alorg the whole line of ow
coast. It contained also a notice of the storm of August 17, 1830, and two
or three other storms of the same year. From a comparison of all the ob-
servations, Mr. Redfield derived the conclusion that those storms were
great whirlwinds. In 1833 he published the following general proposi-
tions, as embodying the results of his investigations:

1. The severe storms of the Atlantic coast often originate in the tropical
latitudes, where they are distinguished by the name of hurricanes.

2. These storms cover, at the same moment of time, a surface whose
diameter varies from one to five hundred miles, and in some cases they
have been much more extensive. They act with diminished violence
towards the exterior, and with increased energy towards the interior.

3. While south of the parallel of 30° these storms pursue their course
towards the west, on a track which inclines gradually to the northward.
in the vicinity of latitude 30° their course changes somewhat abruptly te
the northward and eastward, and the track continues to incline gradually
to the east, towards which point, after leaving the lower latitudes, they ad-
vance with an accelerated velocity. The rate of progress may be estimated
at from 12 to 30 miles an hour.

A. The duration of the storm at any place within its track depends upon
its extent, and the rate of velocity with which it moves.

3. The direction of the wind over the greater portion of the track is not
the direction of the progress of the storm.

6. In the lower latitudes, while drifting to the westward, the direction of
the wind at the commencement of these storms is froma northern quarter,
usually from northeast to northwest, and during the latter part of the gale,
it blows from a southern quarter of the horizon.

7. North of the parallel of 30°, and while pursuing their cowrse to the
northward and eastward, these storms commence with the wind from an
eastern or southern quarter, and terminate with the wind from a western
quarter.

8. On the outer portion of the track, they exhibit at their commence-
ment a southerly wind, which, as the storm comes‘ever, veers gradually to
the westward, in which quarter it terminates.

9. Along the central portion ef the track, the first force of the wind is
from the southeast; but after blowing for a certain period, it changes sud-
33

denly to an opposite point, from which quarter it blows with equal vio-
lence, till the storm has passed over: it is under this portion of the storm
that we notice the greatest fall of the barometer, and the mercury usually
begins to rise a short time previous to the change of wind.

10. On the inner portion of the track the wind commences from a more
eastern or northeastern point of the horizon, and afterwards veers by north
to a northwest or westerly quarter, where it finally terminates.

11. Hence Mr. Redfield infers that the portion of the atmosphere which
composes the body of the storm blows in a horizontal circuit around a verti-
cal axis of rotation, which is carried onward with the storm, and that the
direction of the circuit is from right to left.

12. The barometer always sinks while under the first portion of the
storm, and rises again under the last portion of the gale.

In 1835 Mr. Redfield published an analysis of several additional storms
which visited the American coast, and accompanied his paper with a chart,
upon which eleven of these tracks were carefully represented. In subse-
quent years Mr. Redfield continued his investigations, and in 1846 he
published an analysis of three additional hurricanes, making sixteen storms
whose tracks are delineated upon his chart of the Atlantic coast. The re-
sults of all these investigations served to confirm substantially the conclu-
sions published in 1833. |

In the Journal of the Franklin Institute for April, 1836, Mr. Espy
commenced the publication of a series of essays, in which he announced a -
new theory of storms; and he has since continued his researches up to
the present time. ‘The following generalizations, given in his own words,
are the latest at which he has arrived: ,

1st. The rain and snow storms, and even the moderate rains and snows,
travel from the west towards the east, in the United States, during the
months of January, February, and March, which are the only months yet |
investigated.

2d. There is a depression of the barometer near the central line of
the storm.

3d. The central line of minimum pressure is generally of great length
from north to south, and moves sideforemost towards the east.

Ath. This line is sometimes nearly straight, but generally curved, and
most frequently with the convex side towards the east. ;

5th. The velocity of this line is such, that it travels from the Mississippi
to the Connecticut river in about twenty-four hours; and from the Con-
necticut to St. John, Newfoundland, in nearly the same time, or about
thirty-six miles an hour.

5
a4

6th. When the barometer falls suddenly in the western part of New
Iangland, it rises at the same time in the valley of the Mississippi, and also
at St. John, Newfoundland.

7th. In great storms, the wind, for several hundred miles on both sides
of the line of minimum pressure, blows towards that line directly or ob-
liquely.

Sth. The force of the wind is in proportion to the suddenness and
amount of the barometric depression.

9th. In all great and sudden depressions of the barometer, there is much
rain or snow; and in all sudden great rains or snows, there is a great fluc-
tuation of the barometer.

10th. Many storms are of great and unknown Iength from north to
south, reaching beyond our observers in the gulf of Mexico, on the one
hand, and beyond the northern lakes on the other, while their east and west
diameter is comparatively small. The storms, therefore, move side-
foremost.

11th. Most storms commence in the ¢ far west,’’ beyond the stations of
our most western observers; but some commence in the United States.

12th. When a storm commences in the United States, the line of mini-
mum pressure does not come from the “ far west,’? but commences with:
the storm, and travels with it towards the east.

13th. There is generally a lui} of wind at the line of minimum pressure,
anc sometimes a calm. |

14th. When the wind changes to the west, the barometer begins to rise.

15th. There is generally but little wind near the line of maximum pres-
sure, and on each side of that line the winds are irregular, but tend out-
wards from that line.

16th. The fluctuations of the barometer are. generally greater in the
northern than in the southern parts of the United States.

i7th. The fluctuations of the barometer are generally greater in the
eastern than in the western parts of the United States.

18th. In the northern parts of the United States, the wind, in great
storms, generally sets in from the north of east, and terminates from the
north of west.

19th. In the southern parts of the United States the wind generally sets
in from the south of east, and terminates from the south of west.

20th. During the passage of storms the wind generally changes from
the eastward to the westward by the south, especially in the sowthern parts
of the United States.

The importance of, verifying, modifying, or refuting these generaliza-
tions, will appear more fully by a consideration of the following theory,
39

which first led to the adoption of the plan of laying down the phenomena
of storms on maps, as here recommended to you:

ist. When the air near the surface of the earth in a particular locality
acquires a higher temperature or a higher dew point than that of surround-
ing regions, it will ascend, on account of a less specific gravity—perpen-
dicularly if there is a calm.

2d. As it ascends it comes under less pressure and expands, and be-
comes colder by expansion, about one degree and a quarter for each hun-
dred yards.

3d. The dew-point falls about one quarter of a degree, by the expansion
of the vapor, for each hundred yards; and, therefore, when the ascending
air rises as many hundred yards as the dew-point is below the temperature
of the air at the surface of the earth in degrees of Fahrenheit, the cold of
expansion of the air will begin to condense the vapor contained in it, and
thus form cloud.

Ath. As soon as the vapor begins to condense into cloud, the latent
caloric will begin to be evolved, which will diminish the cooling effect of
its expansion in its further ascent, sometimes a little more and sometimes
a little less than one-half, according as the dew-point is above or below
70° of Fahrenheit.

5th. When the air has ascended high enough to have condensed by
the cold of expansion, from diminished pressure, one-hundredth of its
weight of vapor, its temperature will be about 48° warmer from the evolu-
tion of the Jatent caloric than it would be by going up to the same height
without vapor in it, and will then be about 48° warmer than the air around
the cloud at the same elevation, and of course about one-tenth lighter.

6th. The air in the cloud being thus specifically much lighter than the
surrounding air, will ascend, and, in ascending, spread out in all direc-
tions above, overlapping the air of surrounding regions, and thus causing
the barometer to rise all round the cloud to a distance proportional to the
magnitude of the cloud.

7th. Whilst the barometer is rising all round the cloud from the in-
creasing weight of the air, it will fall under the central regions of the cloud
in proportion to the quantity of air spreading out above.

8th. The air near the surface of the earth will now rush in on all sides
from the regions around the cloud, where the barometer stands high, to-
wards the central regions, where the barometer stands low, witha volocity
proportional to the square root of the difference of pressure.

9th. The air thus rushing in under the cloud on all sides will ascend,
and carry up its vapor with it, and will condense it into cloud by the cold
36

»

‘of expansion from diminished pressure, as before, and thus the process of
cloud-forming will be continued.
10th. As the principal part of this upmoving current of air is in the upper
regions of the atmosphere, which move all the year, over the United States,
from west to east, the cloud, with its whole column of light air, must also
move in the same direction.
<¢Dr. Hare bas turned his attention to the electrical phenomena which
“accompanies the more violent exhibitions of the storm when it assumes
the form of a tornado. He agrees with Mr. Espy in opinion as to in-
ward and upward direction of the wind towards the middle of the storm,
but differs from him with respect to the cause of the current. He proposes
‘a definite theory of the phenomena of the tornado, founded on well-known
laws of electrical action, combined with facts of observation. It has been
fully established by experiment in different parts of the earth that there is
an accumulation of positive electricity in the upper regions of the atmo-
sphere, that the surface of the earth relative to the lower stratum of air is
slightly negative, and that space void of air may be considered an electrical
conductor. Krom these facts Dr. Hare infers that the surface of the
earth, the surrounding atmosphere, and the space immediately around
*and exterior to the atmosphere, form three concentric spheres, of which the
outer and inner are constantly charged with opposite electricity. The
arrangement is, therefore, precisely that of a charged leyden jar, of which
the exterior sphere is analogous to the outer coating, the surface of the earth
to the inner, and the intervening atmosphere to the non-conducting glass.
The clouds are insulated conductors floating between the two coatings, and
therefore liable to be variously charged by indwetion as their position rela-
tive to each other and the two coatings is varied. In some cases the ar-
rangement may be such as to form a series of steps of intermediate con-
ductors, each electrified by induction, so as to produce a violent ascending
current or convective discharge from the surface of the earth upwards.
“<The theories of Redfield, Espy, and Hare may not be found incompati-
ble in all points; and whatever may be the future state of our knowledge
-relative to them, they point to definite objects of inquiry, which cannot
fail to reward proper observation with a rich harvest of important results.”’
The idea occurred to me that more might be learned from a complete
analysis of a single storm, than from a partial analysis of several storms;
cand that any storm of strongly marked characteristics, if fully investi-
gated, must prove a complete experimentum crucis, at least between
the theories of Messrs. Redfield and Espy. I accordingly selected the
storm of December 20, 1536, for a thorough examination. I obtained
37

barometric observations from 27 different stations within the United States
and the neighboring British possessions. I also obtained meteorological
journals, not containing barometric observations, from 28 military posts,
from 42 academies in the State of New York, and from five other stations;
making 162 in all, besides several stations beyond the probable limits of
the storm.

In analyzing these materials, the barometric observations were all graphi-
eaily represented by curves, showing the fall and rise of the barometer,
with the time of its minimum height. Then joining by a line all those
places where the minimum of the barometer occurred at the same instant,
we are furnished with the means of measuring the rate of progress of the
great atmospheric wave. On the southern border of the United States, this
velocity varied from 17 to 29 statute miles per hour; and on the northern
border from 17 to 37 miles. The leading characteristics of this storm were
as follows: After a clear and cold interval, with barometer high, the wind
commenced blowing from the south. The barometer fell rapidly; the
thermometer rose; rain descended in abundance. ‘The wind veered sud-
denly to northwest, and blew with great violence. ‘The rain was succeeded
by hail or snow, which continues but a short time. The barometer rises
rapidly; the thermometer sinks as rapidly. ‘These changes are experienced
progressively from west to east.

This storm was not circular. The area of rain and snow was about
500 miles broad from east to west. Its length from north to south was
known to be 800 miles, and probably was not less than 1,500. For nearly
a day before the crisis, the wind blew from the southern quarter, and gen-
erally for several hours from the southeast. After the minimum of the
barometer, the wind blew with great violence from nearly the opposite point;
commonly the northwest. Here was clearly indicated a prevalent tendency
of the wind towards a central line; but, unfortunately, the observations em-
braced onlv one-half the area of the storm. ‘The oscillation ef the barom-
eter showed a steady increase from latitude 25° to Quebec. ‘The centre
of the storm, therefore, could not have been south of Quebec, and north
of this place we could obtain no observations.

I was now desirous of investigating a storm of marked characteristics
which could be entirely surrounded, so that more of its features would

“need to be supplied by conjecture. ‘Iwo storms which occurred in Febru-
ary, 1S42, appeared tolerably well suited to my purpose, and were selected
for a new investigation. Great pains were taken to collect materials from
every part of the United States. I succeeded in obtaining barometric ob-
servations from 64 different stations. I also procured registers, without
barometric observations, from 41 military posts, and 22 other stations, ma-
38

king 127 in all, not including registers from several stations too remote to
be of any service in the proposed investigation.

I commenced the analysis of the storm of February 1-5, by following
the same course I had pursued with the storm of 1836, viz: representing
the barometric observations by curves which should exhibit the fall and
rise of the mercury, with the time of minimum height; and from the time
of minima I proposed to deduce the progress of the storm. But I was
disappointed in my expectations. I did not obtain such a uniform rate of
Progress as I had anticipated. After some time I perceived that my observa-
tions embraced two centres of disturbance; that I had got at least two
storms in close juxtaposition, and interfering with each other. 1 then dis-
covered that my lines of barometric minimum represented relations which
were extremely complex, and were not well adapted to my purpose, which
was the development of physical causes. | therefore sought for some mode
of graphically representing the observations which should be founded upon
simple relations, and be better adapted to suggest the causes of the phenom-
ena. I atlast settled upon a method which appears to me well suited to this
purpose, and substituted for lines of minimum pressure, lines of equal pres-
sure. Having determined, as well as I was able, the mean height of the
barometer at each station, I compared each observation with the mean. I
then drew a line upon a map of the United States, passing through all
those places where the barometer stood at its mean height. ‘This line
may be called the line of mean pressure. I then drew a line through all
the places where the barometer stood 2 inches above the mean, and another
for 4 inches above the mean. So, also, I drewa line through all the places
where the barometer stood 2 inches below the mean; another for 4 inches be-
low; and others for 6 inches, 8 inches, and 10U inches below the mean height-
These lines must, from the nature of the case, be continuous curves; and
the centre of these curves must be a point of maximum or minimum
pressure. Near the middle of a great storm we find a point of minimum
pressure—that is, the centre of a vortex; and the lines of equal pressure
will indicate at a glance whatever connexion there may be between the
weight of the air and the direction of the wind.

Upon a similar principle, all the observations of the thermometer were
graphically represented upon the same chart. A line joining all those
places where the thermometer stands at its mean height for the given hour
and month is marked zero, and may be called the line of mean tempera-
ture. Another line joins all those places where the thermometer is 10°
above the mean, and others for 20° and 30° above the mean. So, also,
lines are drawn for 10° and 20° below the mean temperature. ‘There are
also continuous lines surrounding a point of maximum or minimum ther-
39

mometric disturbance; not points of maximum or minimum temperature
absolutely, for we only regard the deviation from the mean temperature of
the place for the given hour and month. These barometric and ther-

iometric curves exhibit some conformity to each other, but are far from
being identical. The direction of the wind is represented by arrows, and
its force is indicated, so far as convenient, by their length.*

Other phenomena are now indicated by colors. 'Those regions where
the sky was unclouded, or where the cloudiness was less than one-half,
are colored blue; those where the sky was entirely overcast, or the cloudi-
ness exceeded one-half, but without rain or snow, are colored brown.
Those regions upon which snow is falling, are colored green; and those
where rain is falling, are colored yellow. ‘Thus, nearly every important
circumstance of a storm is presented to the eye ata single glance. All
these particulars will be understood from the two accompanying charts,
illustrating the progress of the storm of February 16, 1842.

In both the storms of February, 1842, after they had acquired consider-
able violence, there was a prevalent motion of the winds inward, with a
tendency to circulate around the centre, in a direction contrary to the sun’s
motion. ‘The motion of the wind, therefore, was neither wholly centrip-
etal nor wholly rotary, but a combination of the two. As long as the
wind was moderate, neither of these tendencies was clearly marked, and
there were numerous perplexing anomalies, probably occasioned in many
instances by the inequalities of the earth’s surface. The storm of Febru-
ary 16 travelled in one day 560 miles in a direction N. 53° E., making its
velocity 23 miles per hour. The storm of February 1-5 remained for
two days nearly stationary, and then travelled N. 62° E. at the rate of 36
miles per hour. On the whole, then, we may conclude that when storms
are violent, and there is a great depression of the barometer, the direction
of the wind presents considerable regularity, being spirally inward towards
the centre of the storm; but when the winds are moderate, which is the case
of most frequent occurrence, this tendency is very fully developed, and
the subject demands more particular investigation.

III. I now proceed to inquire. what encouragement there is to a further
prosecution of meteorological researches.

In all our investigations respecting natural phenomena we assume that
the operations of nature are subject to laws, and that these laws are uni-
form in their operation. A law of nature knows no exceptions. There
is no place for science except upon this basis. Are storms subject to laws,
and are these laws invariable? Such a question may appear almost like

trifling, and yet many argue as if they had but feeble faith in these princi-
ples. It is presumed that no philosopher will seriously question them; but
it may be said that these laws are so complex that they can never be dis-
covered. What right have we to make such an assumption? Have not
the laws of nature been actually discovered in many cases in which they
appear equally complex? How long is it since comets were believed
to rush through the planetary system in defiance of all law; or if subject
tolaw, then a law of such complexity that all attempt to discover it seemed
hopeless? Now, these laws appear so simple that we wonder they were
not sooner discovered. All the laws of nature appear complex while they
remain unknown; but when once discovered, we are surprised at their sim-
plicity. Why should storms form an exception to this rule? Does the
past history of meteorological investigations justify such a conclusion ?
Have our researches been rewarded with no success? Far otherwise.
During the brief period that meteorology has been cultivated we have ar-
rived at many important generalizations, which, if not entitled to the name
of laws of nature, afford the strongest assurance that such laws exist, and
that we are on the eve of their discovery. We have discovered that the great
storms of the United States travel nearly from west to east. No instance
has yet been found in which a violent storm in these latitudes has travelled
from east to west, although some great rain storms have remained nearly
stationary fora day or two. Violent storms usually travel at the rate of
about 25 miles per hour, although this velocity has been observed to rise
as high as 40 miles. ‘These storms are of various dimensions. While
summer showers may cover an area of but a few miles, winter storms some-
times have a diameter of 1,000 miles and upwards. ‘The duration of a
storm at any place depends upon its extent, and upon the velocity of its
progress. If the diameter of a storm is. 500 miles, and its progress 25
miles per hour, its duration at a place situated in the centre of the track
will be 20 hours, and less for places out of the centre. Hence we may
form some estimate of the superficial extent of a storm from its duration at
any place. The direction of the wind is generally inward towards the
area of rain, and in violent storms there is a tendency to rotation about a
vertical axis. Over arugged country there are so many obstacles to the
wind’s progress, that observations at the surface of the earth present a great
many anomalies; but at sea there are no such obstacles, and the observa-
tions of the wind exhibit a greater uniformity and simplicity. The ba-
rometer falls under the first half of the storm, and rises as the storm re-
cedes; the centre of the storm coinciding nearly with the greatest depres-
sion of the barometer. The passage of this centre is marked by a sudden
Al

change of wind toa point of the compass nealy opposite to that from
which it had previously been blowing.

The preceding propositions are deductions from a large number of par-
ticular cases which have been investigated. If any one of these proposi-
tions requires some modification, the fact will be disclosed by a contin-
nance of the same system of observations. ‘This is a legitimate subject of
investigation. Further observations will either prove or disprove these
propositions. Some of them may require a little modification, although it
is believed they are all substantially true.

We are justified, then, in inferring that storms are subject to laws; that
these laws are uniform in their operation, and that they may be discovered.
We have already made important progress in this discovery, and we are
persuaded that we have only to follow up the same methods of investiga-
tion, and our labor will be rewarded with more brilliant discoveries. The
results of such knowledge are too important to be overlooked. When we
have fully learned the laws of storms, we shall be able to predict them. .
This attainment is of the highest practical importance. If the navigator
can anticipate the approach of a storm by 24 hours, this interval will be
quite sufficient to place hima beyond the reach of its fury; and although
the landsman could not remove his habitation from the approaching torna-
do, he might withdraw his family and the most valuable of his effects to
a place of security.

When the magnetic telegraph is extended from New York to New Or-
leans and St. Louis, it may be made subservient to the protection of our
commerce, even in the present imperfect state of our knowledge of storms.
*The severe winter storms which desolate the Atlantic coast come from the
valley of the Mississippi, and require about 24 hours to travel from St.
Louis to New York. ‘The approach of a dangerous storm might therefore
be telegraphed at New York hours before its arrival, while the sky was
yet unclouded and the wind propitious, in season to save a fleet of ships
from putting to sea, to be engulphed in the bottomless deep. The science
of meteorology is already sufficiently advanced to render important service
to commerce, if practical navigators would but heed the indications of the
barometer, and make themselves familiar with the principles which obser-
vation has established.

It is, then, not without reason that we expect to be able to predict an ap-
proaching storm, long enough in advance to render such knowledge of the
highest importance; but it may admit of more serious question, whether
we shall ever be able to predict the general character of a season with sufh-
cient precision to be of any value to the farmer. But why should we des-
pair of ultimately attaining even this result? Ifone season is remarkable for

6
42

its cold, and another for its heat, is there no reason for it? Is there not some
cause acting upon a grand scale to bring about this result? Is there no
cause which brings an excess of winds from the north, or an excess from
the south—which brings an unusual amount of precipitation, or an extra-
ordinary degree of cloudiness? And cannot this cause be discovered ?
This discovery may require the exercise of patience—it may require a
long continued series of observations; but to assume that a principle can-
not be discovered, is unphilosophical. This is a legitimate subject of in-
vestigation, and it is a field in which the laborer cannot fail of reaping his
reward. We only need adequate observations—observations sufficiently
precise, and upon a scale of proper extent. Weconclude, then, that there
is the highest encouragement to the prosecution of meteorological inqui-
ries—that by continuing our researches we may hope to arrive at general
laws, and that a knowledge of these laws cannot fai! to contribute to the
wealth and happiness of mankind.

I proceed, therefore, to inquire—

IV. Upon what plan the observations should be conducted to secure the
object proposed.

Violent winter storms appear most suitable for investigation, because
they are of longer duration, and their features are more strongly marked.
The oscillation of the barometer affords the surest criterion for identifying
a storm in its progress from day to day; and these oscillations are greatest
in winter.

1. How large an area should be covered by our observations, to enable
us to investigate advantageously the phenomena of our winter storms ?

Our observations ought plainly to embrace the entire region of the
storm, and even extend somewhat beyond its margin, fer in no other way
could we be sure that we had found its limits. Now, the great storms
which are experienced between the parallels of 40 *and 45 degrees are fre-
quently felt as far south as latitude 30°, and sometimes to 25°. South of
this line, the oscillations of the barometer, except in a few rare instances,
are quite small; and it is probable that the limiting parallel of the trade
winds forms a dividing line between the ordinary storms of the torrid and
temperate zones. We should therefore extend our system of observations
to the southern margin of the United States. The northern limit of our
ordinary winter storms remains unknown. In the storm of December 21,
1836, the oscillation of the barometer increased uninterruptedly with the
latitude as far as the most northerly station, Quebec. Only the southern
half of the storm was included within the United States. This storm was
probably experienced as far northward as to the northern shore of Hudson’s
bay. We should therefore extend our system of observations to the north-
435

ern margin of the United States; and to render our system complete, re-
quires the co-operation of the British government to extend the observa-
tions to the entire region of Hudson’s bay.

If we merely wished to embrace in our observations the area of a storm
for a single hour, then the interval between the Mississippi and the Atlan-
tic would ordinarily be sufficient. But we could not thus expect to dis-
cover the origin of astorm. We must trace it in its progress from its come
mencement to its greatest violence, and thence to its decline. By observing
under what circumstances it takes its rise, we may hope to be able to dis-
cover the cause of its activity. We should therefore aim to trace every
storm from its origin to its close. At the ordinary rate of progress a great
storm would travel from the Rocky mountains to the Atlantic in two days.
What influence this range of mountains may have upon our storms is un-
known, except from conjecture. We cannot suppose that a storm could
travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic without experiencing some modifi-
cation in passing over a range of mountains rising into the region of per-
petual snow. What this modification is, can be determined by corres-
ponding observations on both sides of the mountain. I therefore conclude
that it is important to embrace in our system of observations the entire
continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from the gulf of Mexico to
the northern shore of Hudson’s bay.

2. At what distance from each other should stations of observation be
selected ?

If we were investigating the phenomena of a summer shower, it would
be indispensable to have stations at very short distances from each other;
but in winter storms this is less important. I consider it, however, desira-
ble to have stations at intervals of fifty miles from each other, and such
might probably be obtained in the more thickly settled parts of the United
States. In other parts of the country this would be impracticable; but I
would strive to obtain at least one station for every hundred miles square.
At this rate we should need about three hundred observers for the United
States. Itis not doubted that this number might be obtained; indeed, we
have well nigh this number already, but, unfortunately, they are very une-
qually scattered over the country.

3. What materials have we to depend upon, and what is wanting to
complete the plan of one observer to every hundred miles square ?

We have the government observations at the military posts, now 57 in
number. We have observations from 41 academies in the State of New ©
York, and 25 stations in Pennsylvania. ‘Then we have borometric obser-
vations from about 40 other individuals scattered promiscuously over the
country; and thermometric observations from about 20 others. There is,
44

besides, a large number of those who have meteorological instruments,
which they occasionally consult, but do not feel sufficient interest in the
subject to keep a systematic journal. Hf a grand meteorological effort were
made, with a prospect of yielding important results, probably most of
those persons might be pressed temporarily into the service. New Eng-
land is pretty well manned with observers, except in the northern part,
where three or four more are greatly needed. Probably, if instruments could
be furnished without expense, volunteers might be found to make the obser-
vations. New York and Pennsylvania are fully organized ; but throughout
the remainder of the United States the stations are few and scattered.
Excluding Oregon and the Indian territory, the remaining States embrace
about a million and a half square miles, and at our lowest estimate would
require about 150 observers. We have 50: observers already in the field,
leaving 100 to be provided for. How is this deficiency to be supplied ?
If our government would direct meteorological observations to be made at
the principal light-houses along our coast and the chain of the great lakes,
it would leave only the interior of the country to be provided for; and if
instruments could be furnished without expense, volunteers might proba-
bly be found to take the observations at most of the remaining stations.

To extend this system of observations further westward must be attend-
ed with serious difficulties. We already have registers kept at most of the
military posts in the Indian country; and as new posts are established, it
is presumed that the government will direct them to be improved for obser-
vations. We may thus hope ere long to obtain a line of stations reaching
to the mouth of the Columbia river; and as settlements extend, observa-
tions will multiply on the other side of the Rocky mountains. On the
whole, then, it is believed we might occupy the whole United States from
its northern to its southern border, and from the Atlantic to the Indian
territory, beyond the Mississippi, with an.army of meteorologists sufficiently
numerous to enable us to investigate advantageously the phenomena of our
great storms, provided instruments could be fernished gratuitously for about
10). stations; and, moreover, we might probably have a line of observers
at unequal intervals, reaching even to the Pacific ocean. ‘The expense of
100 sets of meteorological instruments may be estimated at $3,000.

It is believed that the Smithsonian Institution might undertake to furnish
these instruments and organize a grand system of meteorological observa-
tions upon this continent, in perfect harmony with the views of James
Smithson. Mr. Smithson bequeathed his property, in trust, to this coun-
try, for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. It is believed
that by carrying out the plan now suggested, knowledge would be in-
creased and diffused, and it would be that kind of knowledge which
45

would contribute to the comfort and happiness of society, as much as
perhaps any other which can be named.

A. Specific plan of operations proposed.

The following is proposed for the consideration of the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, as the outline of a grand meteorological cam-
paign.

Let a meteorological department of the institution be organized, under
the direction of the Secretary, with a suitable assistant. Leta united effort
be made to secure for a limited period, and to the greatest possible extent,
the co-operation of the general government, the several State governments,
scientific societies, and the friends of science throughout the country. Let
the general government be requested to give the greatest possible exten-
sion to their system of observations at the military posts, and to authorize
similar observations to be made at certain light-houses, so far as may be
necessary to complete a line of stations at intervals of 100 miles along the
whole extent of our coast, and the chain of the northern lakes. Let the
regents of the University of the State of New York be requested to reor-
ganize the system of observations in that State, by furnishing barometers
to about 20 of their academies, and directing the observations to be report-
ed regularly to Washington. Let the committee having charge of the
observations in Pennsylvania be requested to adopt the same plan of ob-
servations which shall be agreed upon for the other States, and report regu-
larly to Washington. Let application be made to the legislatures of each
of the other States, inviting them to co-operate in this noble scheme,
by emulating the examples of New York and Pennsylvania. Let the
scientific societies throughout the United States be appealed to, to assist in
organizing an efficient corps of observers, each in its appropriate sphere;
and let individual observers throughout the country be requested to unite
their efforts in one uniform and systematic plan of operations. Let them
be requested to report their equipment of instruments, and state whether
they will undertake to provide whatever may be wanting, at their own ex-
pense. Let then the entire country be divided into sections not exceed-
ing 100 miles square; and in each section not already provided for, let an
observer be sought out, who shall volunteer to make the observations if
instruments are furnished him. Let then the Smithsonian Institution
assume the burden of furnishing the necessary instruments to those who
are unable to do it themselves. Jt is estimated that the sum required for
this purpose would not exceed three thousand dollars. Let a form of ob-
servations be provided, and instructions to all the observers, who shall re-
port at least quarterly to the Secretary at Washington. Let it be the duty
of the meteorologist to take charge of the observations, to discuss and ana-
lyze them, and endeavor to deduce from them the laws of storms. Let
46

these investigations be published, in as much detail as may be thought de-
manded by the claims of science, and let a copy of whatever may be pub-
lished be forwarded to each observer, in order that he may be stimulated
in his work by finding that his labor is not wholly in vain.

Finally, to give to this system its greatest efficiency, the co operation of
the British government and of the Hudson’s Bay Company is absolutely
indispensable. ‘The greater part of our severe storms extend far beyond
the limits of the United States on the north. Observations confined to the
United States will therefore seldom give us the entire area of a storm, and
frequently only half of it. ‘The remaining half must then be supplied by
conjecture. ‘This would leave all our investigations in an unfinished and
unsatisfactory state. We want a line of stations through Canada, along
the shores of Hudson’s bay, to the farthest outpost of civilization. At
every government station a meteorological journal might doubtless be kept;
and it is confidently believed that if the Smithsonian Institution would
embark in earnest in a grand meteorological crusade, the British govern-
ment would cheerfully contribute its efficient co operation.

A system of observations like that here contemplated, if faithfully pros-
ecuted for one year, would well nigh exhaust the subject. ‘The storms of
each year are probably but a repetition of those of the preceding. Never-
theless, it would be unsafe to calculate upon concluding the war after a
single year’s campaign. Experience in similar cases has shown that it
requires considerable time to organize so large a plan of operations, and
the system would not, probably, attain its greatest efficiency the first year.
It would be unwise, therefore, to calculate upon a less period of operations
than three years. But it is believed that in this period, results would
be developed which would more than repay all the expense of time and
money incurred; while, upon the existing scale of operations, the progress
of discovery must be slow and uncertain. In order to enable us to inves-
tigate advantageously the phenomena of a single storm, we must have
simultaneous observations from a vast number of stations. Observations
from a few stations, though continued to the end of time, will not accom-
plish the same object. How, then, can the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution more faithfully carry out the views of its benevolent founder,
than by vigorously prosecuting these researches to their completion? How
can they contribute more directly and powerfully to the prosperity of our
commerce; and, through commerce, add to the wealth and happiness of
the whole country?

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
ELIAS LOOMIS.

APPENDIX No. 3. e

Extract from a communication from Professor Espy on the subject of
Meteorology.

My pear sir: I am much pleased to learn from your letter that the Re-
gents of the Smithsonian Institution would probably make an appropria-
tion for the purpose of establishing a series of observations ‘‘ to solve, if
possible, the problem of American storms.’’ \ I am of opinion that no sub-
ject of science is more worthy of the attention of the institution; and in
answer to your request that I should furnish you with suggestions on the
subject, I refer you, in the first place, to my work entitled ‘‘ Philosophy
of Storms,” from page 77 to page 172, for a full development of the plan
adopted twelve years ago of investigating the phases of storms, by the joint
committee of the American Philosophical Society and the Franklin Insti-
tute, of the State of Pennsylvania.

The plan then suggested, and in part carried out, was adopted in the
investigation of the phases of storms during the five years in which I was
in the service of the government. In my ‘circular to the friends of
science,’? in which I invited all persons in the United States keeping
journals of the weather to send them to the office of the Surgeon General,
Washington, I announced my intention to lay down on skeleton maps of
the United States, by appropriate symbols, all the most important phases
of great storms which might come within the range of our simultaneous
observations ; and thus it was hoped we should be able to determine the
shape and sizé of all storms; whether they are round or oblong; and if ob-
long, whether they move sideforemost or endforemost, or obliquely; and to
ascertain their velocity and direction in all the different seasons of the
year; the course of the wind in and beyond the borders of the storm; the
Jluctuation of the barometer and change of temperature which generally
accompany storms, and the eztené to which their influence is felt beyond
their borders.

Having obtained observations from a wide extended correspondence, I
laid down the phases of the storms on maps, as presented in my first re-
port, and [ have continued the same plan in my second report, now ready
to be printed. In the investigation of the materials of the second report,
comprising the observations of three years and three-quarters, I have dis-
covered no facts contradictory to the generalizations deduced from the
winter storms of three months embraced in the second report. I consider
it of the highest interest, by an extended series of observations, which I
hope the Smithsonian Institution will cause to be made over a much wider
48

territory than my observation embraced, to verify, or, if necessary, modify
these generalizations, and also to investigate the laws of summer storms,
which f[ fear cannot be done without much more numerous observers than
i was able to procure.*

The elements of the theory I have given you are the same as those pre-
sented in my work on storms; and though I have demonstrated them ap-
proximately, and have no doubt of their general accuracy, yet | am con-
vinced that nothing will establish the truth on this subject in such a man-
ner as to carry conviction to every mind but a series of wide extended
simultaneous observations, continued for a long time, by numerous observ-
ers. Such a series I hope is now about to be made.

It would be inappropriate to extend this communication to a greater
length; but I will explain to you at another time some experiments con-
nected with meteorology, which { wish to see performed, on the electricity
of steam, and on the specific caloric 0 .ospheric air and other gases,
with the aid of my nephelescope, and on the law of cooling of air in great
expansions of air by diminished pressure.

I remain, very respectfully, yours, &c.,
JAMES P. ESPY.

Prof. J. Henry,

Secretary Smithsonian Institutioi.

REPORT

Re.
OF THE

BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

SHOWING

Lhe operations, expenditures, and condition of the Institution.

January 6, 1848.
Ordered to be printed.

"

To the Senate and House of Representatwes of the United States :

In obedience to the act of Congress “‘to establish the Smithsonian In-
stitution, for the increase and diffusion of Knowledge among men.”’ the
Board of Regents herewith submit to Congress a report of the operations,
expenditures, and conditien of the institution, with sundry accompany-
ing documents. ‘

These documents embrace a complete record as well of the operations
of the institution since the date of the last annual report to Congress, as
of its expenditures, and of its present condition.

They are as follows:

No. 1. Report of the building committee to the Board of Regents,
accompanied by a copy of their journal from the date of the appointment
of the committee to the Ist December, 1847. :

No. 2. Copy of the journal of the building committee, referred to in ~
the foregoing.

No. 3. Report of the Executive Committee, containing a statement of
the expenditures of the institution from the organization of the institu-
tion to the Ist December, 1847.

_ No. 4. Proceedings of the Board of Regents, from the date of the last —
annual report to the 22d of December, 1847.

No. 5. Report of the Executive Committee to the Board of Regents,
dated December 15, 1847, embodying a statement of the present condi-
tion of the funds of the institution, and the proposed scale of annual ex-
penditure until the completion of the building.

No. 6. Report of the Secretary of the institution to the Board of Re-
gents, containing a programme of organization of the Smithsonian Institu- ~
tion, presented to the board December 8, 1847. E a

_ Document No. 1 will be found to contain a condensed statement of the
proceedings of the building committee, compiled from their journal; by
which it will be seen, that in the discharge of their duty they had occa-
Sion to collect, and record,-a variety of information of practical value,

specially on the subject of building-materials. The result, in their own
he has been, that they have obtained for the institution building a. free-
ippin & Streeper, printers. ; :

[23 ] i 2

stone superior, both in durability and appearance, to any heretofore used
in the public buildings of this city, yet costing less than one-half as much
as that employed in the erection of the Capitol, Executive mansion, 'Treas-
ury building, and Patent Office. Attention is respectfully invited to these
results, as they can hardly fail to be important to the public service if the
general government, at any time hereafter, should add to the number of its —
buildings in this metropolis.

Document No. 2 gives in minute detail the results above referred to.
Tt contains reports from an experienced geologist, on the marble and granite
quarries of Maryland; on the Aquia creek quarries, which have hitherto
furnished the material for the principal structures in this city; and on the
freestone quarries of the upper Potomac, in the vicinity of Seneca creek,
whence has been drawn the lilac-gray freestone employed by the commit-
tee, for the institution building. It contains also a report, by a chemist of
this city, of the results of certain experiments which the committee caused
to be instituted, to determine the durability of various building materials
when exposed to the action of the weather.

This document contains, further, a copy of the contract made for the
erection of the institution building, together with the specifications of the
same. It will be perceived that the contract was taken at a rate less, by
about thirty-seven thousand dollars, than the amount set apart by the
board, for the erection of the building.

In this document will also be found several other contracts made by the
committee; among them, one with Messrs. Wiley & Putnam, publishers
of New York, for the publication of a brief treatise on public architecture,
to be illustrated with plans and designs of the institution building, and to
contain the result of a series of experiments which have been set on foot
by the institution, to determine the economical value of the principal
building materials throughout the United States.

It also contains an address by the Chancellor of the institution, deliv-
ered on occasion of laying the corner stone of the building; and embracing
a succinct view of the ebjects and the general proceedings of the institution,
together with some details touching the style and dimensions of the build-
ing, then about to be commenced.

Document No. 3 gives a table of the expenditures of the institution,
under the various heads, since its commencement. The entire expendi-
ture is $37,670; of which about two-thirds were spent for the building and
incidentals therewith connected, and one-third for other objects: among the
latter, upwards of two thousand dollars for books and philosophical appa-
ratus; about two thousand dollars for salaries of officers; thirteen hundred
for premiums for designs for the institution building; and $3,876 for ex-
penses of the board and its committees. T'his last item has been consid-
erably swelled in consequence of the provision, in the act organizing the
institution, that its first meeting should be in September, when Congress |
was not in session, and when, consequently, the travelling and other ex-
penses of all its members, fifteen in number, and some residing at a great
distance, had to be paid; those of two members only excepted, who were |
residents of the city. To prevent the recurrence of such expense, the)
board, as will be seen by reference to its journal, has arranged its regular |
meetings to take place during the session of Congress, restricting them to |
one only each year; and as at that time all the members of the board,
except four, become residents of the city, incurring no additional expense —
3 [23]

by attending to their duty as Regents, and therefore charging to the insti-
tution no expenses, the annual expense of the board will hereafter be very
small compared to what it has been: it cannot reasonably be estimated be-
yond eight hundred or one thousand dollars annually.

This item of expenditure has also been increased by the necessary
expenses of a committee appointed to visit and report upon public struc-
tures in the principal cities of the Union, and to confer with architects, with
a view to the selection of convenient plans, based upon the act of Congress,
and of a suitable style of architecture. It is believed, that when the
institution building shall be completed, Congress and the public will be
satisfied with the result of these labors.

Some expense will annually be incurred by the building committee,
until the completion of their task. But, as two of the members of the
committee are residents of Washington, that expense will not be large;
and will, it is believed, be repaid by the amount of information collected
and recorded by them, and by the volume now preparing for publication.

Document No. 4 is a record of all the important proceedings of the
Board of Regents, extracted from their journal, and continued from the
close of their proceedings, as given in the last report of the board to Con-
gress, down to the end of their last meeting. There will be found, among
other resolutions passed by the board, one making appropriations for the
current expenses of the institution throughout the coming year; also, the
action of the board upon the series of resolutions establishing a scale of
expenditure for the next four years.

Document No. 5 is the report of the Executive Committee, in which is
proposed to the board a plan of financial operations, and scale of expenditure,
for four years from and after the 19th of March next—that is, during the
last four years of the building contract; according to which plan, the sum
of fifteen thousand dollars may annually, throughout that term, be appro-
priated for the current expenses ‘of the institution; and the building may
be completed and furnished, and the grounds laid out and fenced, without
withdrawing from the amount of so-called accumulated interest—to wit :
$242,129, specially made applicable by Congress to the building—more
than $102,000, and thus leaving $140,000 of that sum to be added to the
original principal or bequest, as a permanent investment.

Document No. 6 is the first report of the Secretary of the institution. The
programme of the organization, given therein, embraces as well the general
considerations which have served as a guide in adopting that organiza-
tion, as the details both of the plan to increase and of the plan to diffuse
knowledge. 'The report of the Secretary elucidates and explains the pro-
gramme, and also contains a statement of the progress made in the pre-
paration of the first volume of the Transactions of the institution; in the
purchase of apparatus, the preparation for original researches, with sugges-
tions as to the operations of the next year, &c., &c.

The board respectfully express the hope that Congress will cause to be
published, along with this report, these several documents.

All which is respectfully submitted.

No. :1.
Report of the Building Committee of the Smithsonian Institution.

The committee submit to the board, asa complete record of their pro-
ceedings from the date of their appointment, on the 5th of February last,
to the Ist of December current, a copy of their journal.

By reference to that journal, the board will perceive that the committee,
in discharge of their duty, were led into a somewhat extended field of
inquiry, especially as regards building material ; and that they have been
enabled to collect, and have duly recorded, a large amount of detailed
information on this subject essential to their own guidance, but also, they
believe, important to the public generally, and especially to the government,
if Congress should decide to erect any other public buildings in this city.
They caused to be examined the various marble, and granite, and freestone
quarries within a moderate distance of Washington, having been fortunate
enough to engage the services of a gentleman of practical ¢ experience as a
geologist, and who tendered these services gratuitously, his necessary trav-
elling and other expenses only being paid.

The examination embraced the chief marble and granite quarries of
Maryland ; the freestone quarries of Aquia creek, Virginia, whence the
material has been. drawn for the construction of the Capitol, President’s
house, Treasury building, and other public structures in this city; and the
freestone quarries of the upper Potomac, chiefly in the vicinity of Seneca
creek, on the banks of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and about twenty-
three miles from the city.

The results of this examination, as contained in reports made by the
geologist, and which will be found spread at large on our journal, were
briefly these :

Ist. That the marble quarries of Maryland, chiefly in the EL a of the
village of Clarksville, about thirteen miles from Baltimore, on the line of
the Susquehanna railroad , contain two qualities of marble: one fine-grained
and of beautiful uniform color, approaching the character of statuary
marble ; the other, of inferior quality, similar to the Sing Sing marble em-
ployed in New York, in Grace church and other public structures, of a
somewhat coarse and highly crystalline structure, and known to the quarry-
men here under the name of “alum limestone.’’? The former was confi-
dently recommended as a building material equal in durability to any in”
the world; the latter was «pronounced inferior, both in beauty and dura--
bility, yet capable of furnishing a very lasting material if the selection was}
made with care. Being less tough than the finer-grained variety, it was |
thought less suitable for ornaments having bold projections, aud somewhat |
Hable to chip off where there was much undercutting. |

2d. That the granite quarries of Maryland, in the vicinity of Wood- |
stock, on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and about sixteen |
miles beyond the Relay House, furnish a granite equal to that of Quincy, |
and not excelled for beauty of appearance, compactness of structure and |

uniformity of color, texture, and composition, by any granite in the United |
States; splitting, also, with remarkable facility, so that on a block twelve
or fourteen feet in length the face of cleavage may not vary more than a |
5 [ 23 ]

single inch from a true level; in short, a building material of unsurpassed
durability and uniformity, and to which, as to the finer-grained marble in
the Clarksville quarries, no possible objection, except on the score of
expense, could be found, unless, indeed, it be considered one, that in this
material the effect of light and shade from projecting surfaces is in a
measure lost, while in marbie and good tinted freestone every shadow is
sharply marked.

3d. That the Aquia creek freestone, heretofore used in public buildings
in Washington, is a material not to be trusted to, being pervaded by dark
specks of the protoxide and peroxide of iron, which in peroxidating acquire
a yellowish or reddish color, and having occasional clay holes, such as dis-
figure the T'reasury and the Patent Office. A portion of this freestone was,
indeed, considered durable and free from material blemish; but the chance
of actually procuring it free from disfiguring spots and stains was consid-
ered so uncertain, that it was recommended to refrain from using it in the
istitution building.

. Ath. That the freestone of the upper Potomac, in the vicinity of Seneca
ereek, and found in quarries close to the line of the Chesapeake and Ohio
canal, is the best and most durable of all the Potomac freestones.

The lilac-gray variety found in the Bull Run quarry, twenty-three miles
from Washington, was especially recommended, and pronounced to be
equal, if not superior, to that supplied for Trinity church, New York, from
the quarries of New Jersey.

In regard to this latter material, it was stated that it possessed a quality
that should especially recommend it to the attention of builders. When
first quarried it is comparatively soft, working freely before the chisel and.
hammer; but by exposure it gradually indurates, and ultimately acquires

_ a toughness and consistency that not only enables it to resist atmospheric

_ vicissitudes, but even the most severe mechanical wear and tear. ‘l'hus,
on the tow-path of the aqueduct, near Seneca creek, over which horses and
mules have been travelling almost daily for upwards of twenty years, this
freestone was found still unimpaired. Even the corners around which the
heavy lock-gates swing, showed no signs of chipping or decay; and on the
perpendicular wall of the aqueduct, where the water is continually oozing
through the joints and trickling down its face, forming an incrustation of
carbonate of lime, this freestone was observed, where the calcareous crust
had scaled off, with the grooves and ridges of the surface still nearly as
distinct as when the blocks first came from the hands of the stone-mason,
more than twenty years ago. .

The rare and valuable quality possessed by this freestone, of hardening
by exposure to the weather, and which may be due to iron in its compo-
sition, passing from a lower to a higher degiee of oxidation, is occasionally
found in building-stone on the continent of Europe; as, for example, in a
calcareous freestone which has been excavated for centuries from St. Peter’s
mountain, near Maestrich,in Belgium. I[t is highly prized wherever found,
as this peculiarity permits the freestone to be wrought at considerably less
expense than either granite or marble, and imparts to it a durability increas-
ing with age.

Further to test the durability of these various building materials under
exposure to the vicissitudes of the seasons, specimens of each, and also of
other building-stones from New York and elsewhere, were handed to a
gentleman of this city experienced in chemistry, and having a laboratory
[23] 6

at command, and he was requested to subject these to a process recom-
mended by Brard, a French chemist, and described in the ‘‘Annales de
Chimie et Physique;’’ according to which, the crystallization of the sul-
phate of soda is substituted for the freezing of water; and thus, by artificial
means, the action of the elements on these materials—the alternate freezing
and thawing to which the external component of a building is in this cli-
mate annually subjected—is in a measure imitated. "The result—which,
however, in consequence of the short time which could be allowed for the
process, must be considered an approximation only to the truth—is given in
a report from the gentleman in question. The specimens were reduced to
inch cubes; and it was found, after four weeks, that a cube of granite had
lost about one-third of a grain; acube of the fine-grained marble about o7e-
Sifth of a grain; a cube of the best quality of the ‘‘alum-stone,’’ or coarser:
grained marble, half a grain toa grain anda half; and a cube of freestone
from the Patent Office, which, however, was judged not to bea fair average
specimen of the Aquia creek freestones, lost eighteen grains and a half.
Freestone from ‘Trinity church lost from two-thirds of a grain to about a:
gram anda half. ‘The brown Connecticut stone, freely used in New York,
lost from fourteen to nearly twenty-five grains. Coarse-grained New York
marble, trom Mount Pleasant, lost nearly a grain; Nova Scotia coarse-
grained sandstone about two grains; while Pennsylvania blue limestone
lost little over a quarter of a grain.

As to the relative cost of the Maryland granite, Maryland marble, fine-
grained and coarse-grained, Aquia creek freestone and Seneca creek free-
stone, it was found, from the report of the geologist and from actual offers
made to the committee by owners of quarries, and which will be found re-
corded in the journal of the committee, to be, per cubic foot of dimension
stone delivered in Washington, as follows:

Ist. For coarse-grained marble with large crystals, commonly called
‘‘alum-stone,’’ from fifty to sixty cents, according to quality.

2d. For fine-grained marble, the lowest offer was seventy cents.

od. For granite, forty-six cents.

Ath. For Aquia creek freestone, forty cents. ‘The material used in the
public buildings in Washington, in blocks of ordinary size, has cost from
forty to fifty cents.

5th. For Seneca freestone, the lilac-gray variety, from Bull Run quarry,
twenty cents. A contract has been made by a gentleman of Washington,
not connected with the institution, to have stone from the Seneca creek
quarries delivered to him in the city at that price.

East Chester marble was offered at seventy-five cents.

The committee ought here to state, that the proposals by owners of
granite and marble quarries in Maryland to deliver material for our build-
ing were at a considerably lower rate than they otherwise would have been,
in consequence of the liberality evinced by the directors of the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad, and of the Baltimore and Susquehanna railroad, towards
the institution. The chairman of the committee had an interview with
Mr. McLane and Mr. Howard, the presidents of these railroads, and the
directors of both companies passed resolutions, that if we decided to use
Maryland marble or granite, they would transport it at the rate of éo and
a half cents per ton per mile, instead of four cents, the usual charge for
the transportation of similar materials. As it happened, the committee had
no occasion to avail themselves of this liberal proposal; but it doubtless
| 7 ea

_ materially influenced the amount of the bids subsequently put in for the
erection of the building in marble and granite.

Such is a brief summary of the measures adopted by the committee, and
of the information collected by them, and which will be found in detail on
their journal, on the important subject of bnilding material. While engaged
in collecting that information, they caused to be inserted in the city jour-
nals, advertisements inviting from contractors proposals for the erection of
the ‘institution building; the external walls to be of upper Potomac free-
stone, or of marble, or of granite, or of blue gneiss; and separate proposals
were requested in each of these materials. Meanwhile the architect and
superintendent attended in the office of the institution with specifications,
ready to give the necessary information to all applicants.

The day originally set as the last on which bids would be received, was
the 10th of March; but as the specifications were delayed by the printers
several days beyond the time appointed by the public advertisement for tie
inspection of bidders, the committee extended the time for receiving bids
to the 15th March.

On the 16th of March the bids were opened, in presence of the building
committee and of the architect and superintendent. A number of these
were found to be proposals to deliver materials only, or to execute a small
portion of the work, as the brick work, alone; the stone cutting at so much
per foot, &c. These are spread on the journal of the committee, and will
be found to contain much valuable information as to prices.

The bids to erect the building were found to be fourteen in number, and
to vary in amount from $196,000 to $318,000—the lowest being that of
James Dixon & Co., of Washington, and the estimate being for Seneca
freestone, laid up in rubble masonry. ‘The bids by the same firm, as given
in the explanatory correspondence of the same date and in a personal com-
munication on the 18th March, for ashlar finish, were also the lowest put
in, namely:

For marble ashlar - - - - - $228,500
And for Seneca freestone ashlar - - - 205,250

After a careful examination of the subject, the committee decided, that
to the particular design as adopted by the board, with its numerous vertical
lines often closely approaching each other, the finish of regularly coursed
ashlar was the best suited, and would make a more substantial job than

‘broken rubble.

They concluded also, that, with a complete conviction on their minds of
the durability of the Seneca freestone, and with a doubt whether it did not
assort even better with the Lombard style of architecture adopted than
marble, it was inexpedient to expend twenty-three thousand dollars addi-
tional to obtain the latter material. They informed James Dixon & Co.,
therefore, that their bid of $205,250 for the erection of the building in
Seneca stone, finished in coursed ashlar, was accepted.

The result, your committee think, has proved that their selection of ma-
terial was a judicious one.

On inquiry, the committee found that the firm of James Dixon and Co.
consisted of James Dixon, of Washington, and Gilbert Cameron, of New
York. The latter gentleman executed a portion of the work on Trinity
church, and was a contractor on Calvary church, New York.

A contract was signed by the committee and by Messrs. Dixon and Cam-
eron on the 19th of March. It will be found, accompanied by the specif-

[23] 8

eations, which make part of the same, on the joumal of the committee.
Tt includes a portion but not the whole of the furniture; the portion inclu-
ded, however, being the most expensive part of it, and comprehending the
ues ving cases, desks, drawers, and tables, in the laboratory and apparatus
room; the book-cases, large tables and alcove desk <s, in the library; the glass
cases ty the museum; the seats {mn the lecture- 100m; the elevators, with
sheaves and counter-weights; water-closets, completely fitted up; rain-
water cisterns; and the chairs and table in the Regents’ room. Flues
for heating and ventilation are provided for, but the expense of heating
and ene is not included. Cess-pools are ineluded, but no provisions
for draining , according to the municipal regulations of the city.

Phe foundation walls, under the main “central towers, are twelve feet
thick at bottom, gradually diminishing to five and a half feet at the surface
of the ground, and are sunk eight feet deep. ‘The foundations of the rear
central tower, excavated to the same depth, are ten feet, diminishing to
five feet; of the campanile and octagonal towers also ten feet, diminishing
to five and six feet deep. The thickness of the walls of the main build-
ing, 2bove the water-table, is two feet and a half in the first story, and
two ieet in the second, exclusive of buttresses, corbel-courses, and other
similar external projections, and exclusive, also, of an internal lining wall
of brick, of the thickness of a single brick, tied at intervals to the wall,
and intended to plaster to. The walls of the wings are two feet thick.
The central towers are three feet and a half thick in the first story, dimin-
ishing to two feet in the highest story.

Inverted arches, of hard brick, are turned under all the openings of the
foundation. Groined arches are turned under the central towers, the cam-
pauile, the octagonal tower, and the tower of the west wing.

‘The ashlar facing of the building is to be laid in courses from ten to
fifteen inches in height, with a bed of nine inches, and the joints to be
nowhere over three-eighths of an inch.

‘The basements, to contain the heating furnaces, also the janitors’ rooms
and the room to receive Smithson’s personal effects, are fire-proofed. A
pine floor, covered two inches thick with cement, is carried under the roofs
of the whole building. ‘The floors, where they are not fire-proofed, have
a de ay ace of lime, clay, and sand.

The central stair- cases, front and rear, are to be of stone to the museum
floor. ‘The floor of the gallery of art, embracing the west wing and its
connecting range, of the laboratory, including the east wing and part of
its conneeting range, of the central hall and the vestibules, also the floors of
the basement under the laboratory, under the central ‘towers, under the
campanile and other towers, together with the cloisters, are to be flagged
with North river flagging. The floor of the principal lecture-room will also
be flagged with flags, supported on brick cross-walls. The floors of the
libyary and museum are to be of pine; and it is not proposed that either of
these two rooms should be artificially lighted.

‘The laboratory wing is to be roofed with slate—therest of the building,
as the contract now stands, with sheet tin; but the committee propose to
roof the main building and west wing with slate, paying the difference.

It was made a condition of the contract that the erection of the building
should occupy a period of five years from its date, that term ending on the
19th of March, 1852. It. was also agreed that the building should be
erected in such proportions, during each year, as the committee might
9 [ 23 ]

direct, but so that the payments to the contractor in each of the first four
years of the contract should not exceed an annual amount of $41,000; and
so that the wings and connecting ranges should be completed in two years
| from the date of the contract. Fifteen per cent. on the architect’s estimates
is kept back until the completion of the building; but interest is to be ulti-
mately paid on this per-centage, calculated from the dates of the several
estimates.

On the suggestion of one of the Regents, not a member of the committee,
and of the Secretary of the institution, a supplement was appended to the

|

contract, by which it was stipulated, that if the Board of Regents should

hereafter determine to make important alterations in the plan of building,
or in the time of its execution, then the contractor was to be paid pro rata,
according to the prices in the contract, for work executed, and reasonable
damages, if the nature of the case should justly demand it. In case of .
dispute as to the amount, the matter to be referred to the architect of the

institution, or any other architect selected by the committee.

The contractors gave as security for the faithful performance of the con-

tract, W. H. Winter, of Washington, and Horace Butler, of New York.

The security was approved by the committee; and a bond, with a penalty

of fifty-two thousand dollars (being one-fourth of the amount of the entire
contract) was executed accordingly.

The corner-stone of the building was laid on the Ist of May. ‘The de-
tails of the ceremonies upon that occasion, including the address delivered,
in accordance with an invitation from the committee by the Chancellor,
and which ceremonies were witnessed by six or seven thousand persons,

will be found at large on the journal of the committee.

The contractors proceeded for some time with the work in partnership;
but on the Jst of June Mr. Dixon informed the board that the work would
thereafter be conducted by Mr. Cameron alone; and since that time, it has

_been entirely managed by that gentleman.

Mr. Cameron has since proceeded in the work with spirit, and has
executed it, upon the whole, in a manner satisfactory to the committee.
Occasional departures from the letter of the contract have been pointed out
to him, and he has promptly remedied whatever was complained of. He
is now covering in the east connecting range, and hopes still to coyer in
the east wing, also, before he shall be arrested by frost; though he has been
very much retarded in his operations, and has suffered some pecuniary
loss by the breakage in the canal, caused by the late freshets. Since the
7th of October, when the first damage was done, until now, the canal has
been closed, and not a perch of stone has been received. In another week
or fortnight there is a fair prospect that the damage may be repaired, and
water let into the canal. But for this accident, the contractor would alrea-
dy have covered in the east wing of the building. He has now some
twelve or fifteen thousand feet of stone lying ready quarried, and awaiting
the re-opening of the canal.

The chairman of the committee recently visited the quarry and found
the stone that had been quarried of excellent quality and color, the tint
somewhat lighter than the average tint of the present building. It quarries
with remarkable facility, and the supply is unlimited.

The contractor has commenced to lay the foundations of the west wing
and west connecting range, but nothing whatever has yet been done
towards the erection of the main building.
[23] 10

The style of architecture selected by the board seems to meet with gene-
ral approval. It may be taken as one evidence of this, that a church now
in progress of erection in Stuyvesant square, New York, and of which
the cost will reach some hundred and fifty thousand dollars, is built in the
same style; as, by a perspective view of the same herewith submitted, the
board will perceive.

The lot belonging to the institution has been fenced in with a paling
fence, whitewashed, which will last at least until the termination of the
contract for the building. No measures have yet been taken for the erec-
tion of a permanent fence.

Water has been conveyed to the site of the building by tapping the fire
plug at the engine house in Market square. ‘The pipe is a strong leaden
one, of inch-bore, laid two feet below the ground, and the water is con-
veyed across the canal in an iron pipe of two-inch bore.

The contract for the fence was taken by Joel Downer, and that to con-
vey the water by Caleb Buckingham, both of Washington. A copy of
their respective contracts will be found on the journal. After completing
the work in a satisfactory manner, both of these gentlemen applied to the
committee for extra compensation. Mr. Downer stated that the fence
erected by him cost much more than the amount at which he contracted to
complete it, and which was paid to him; and at one time during its pro-
gress—to wit, on the 22d of May—he offered to relinquish to the committee
all he had done, if they would release him from the contract. This, how-
ever, they declined to do.

Mr. Buckingham handed in a bill of his expenses, showing a larger
amount expended than that which, in accordance with the terms of his
contract, was paid to him, and alleged that he had laid down a heaver pipe
than by the contract he was required to do. On these grounds, he put
in a claim for additional compensation. 'The committee declined to allow
it, but informed Mr. Buckingham that the matter would be by them refer-
red to the Board of Regents.

The board will find the particulars of this case, and of that of Mr. Dow-
ner, in the minutes of their thirty-fourth meeting; and the committee beg
to refer both cases to the board, for their decision as to whether in either
case relief ought to be granted.

The total amount expended on the building and on the fencing of the
lot up to this date, the 1st December, including superintendence and all
incidental expenses therewith connected, is $25,002 67, namely:

Paid to Cameron, contractor - - - - - - $20,840 00
Buckingham, supplying water to building - - - 650 00
Downer, for fence, $400; additional rail subsequently added,

$60; whitewashing the same, $60 - . - - 520 00
For architect’s office - - - . - - : 209 00
Coal bin - - - - - - - - . 10 00
Corner-stone — - - - - - - . - . 9 00
Superintendence, including incidentals therewith connect-

ed, and allowance to architect for original plans - - 2! 2773 "OR

Total to lst December, 1847 - - $25,002 67

The committee has made a careful estimate of the probable expenditure
for the building and lot, all incidentals included, from the 1st December,
; il [ 23]

1847, to the 19th March, 1848, being the end of the first year of the build-
ing contract, and set it down at $10,467 50, thus:

Payments to contractor, about - . - - - - $9,500 00
Superintendence and contigencies,about — - - - - 967 50

Total from 1st December, 1847, to 19th March, 1848, about $10,467 50

These two sums added together will give the total amount expended and
to be expended for the above objects, from the commencement of operations
to the end of one year from the date of the contract, about $35,470 17.

It will be observed that the amount paid and to be paid to the contrac-
tor within that year, will be less than thirty-one thousand dollars; that is,
‘upwards of ten thousand dollars less than the annual payments to which,
by the contract, the contractor is restricted.

The item of superintendence, with its incidentals, is a considerable one.
‘It is larger this first year than it will be in any subsequent one: first, be-
cause of an allowance of about two months’ salary to the architect, not in
payment of his design, but to repay the actual expenses incurred during
these two months and previously, in the mechanical execution of plans
and sections of the building, including those which embodied the modifi-
eations of the original design suggested by the committee appointed on the
9th September, 1846, and subsequently adopted by the board; and, second-
ly, because it was necessary to engage the services of the architect and su-
perintendent about a month before the actual signature of the contract.

The annual expense of superintendence is necessarily increased by the
circumstance that the architect does not reside in Washington. The
committee could not afford to offer him a salary which might have induced
him to abandon his New York business; and as in consequence he could
be present during a portion of his time only in this city, the alternative was
‘presented to them either to leave the work, during his absence, under the
control of the contractor, trusting wholly to his judgment and to his seru-
-pulous observance of the contract, or to engage the services of a superin-
tendent who might be always on the spot, to see that no faulty materials
nor insufficient work was admitted into any portion of the structure. ‘They
considered this latter the more prudent course, and engaged as superintend-

ent agentleman of much experience as an architect and builder, at a sal-
ary of $1,000 a year. To the principal architect they gave eighteen
hundred a year and his travelling expenses—which, as he usually passes
between New York and Washington once a month, amount to about three
hundred a year—together with actual expenses for stationery, being from
fifty to a hundred dollars annually.

In connexion with this item of superintendence, the committee remark,

that the labor and expense of preparing working plans in a style so novel
as the Lombard, and for a design so irregular as that: which has been
adopted, are very much greater than if the style were one common in this
country, or the design characterized by greater regularity.

The expenses necessarily incurred by the building committee—which,
however, are small, as one member only of that committee is a non-
resident of Washington—are not included as part of the expense of the
building; both because a considerable portion of their attention was directed
to objects other than the building, hereafter tobe mentioned, and with which
they were charged by the board, and also because they consider the infor-
[ 23 ] | 12

mation embodied in their journal, herewith submitted and in this report, to
be more than an equivalent, in its value to the public, for the small sum to
which their expenses amount. rogtel-P o

In regard to the probable expense of completing the building, including
its fitting up and furnishing, its lighting, heating, drainage, &c., the laying
out, planting, and permanent fencing of the lot, and all other expenses
therewith properly connected, as compared with appropriations heretofore
made for these objects, the committee report as follows:

It will be within the recollection of the board that, on the 28th of Janu-
ary last, resolutions were passed by the board making the following appro-

q

priations: y
The contract for the building not to exceed - - $231,000
Fitting up and furnishing the same. do - St tes 20,000
Warming and lighting the same do - - 5,000
Permanent fence around the grounds do - - 10,000
Laying out and planting the grounds do - : 4,000
Together - . - “4, - : $270,000

No special appropriation was made for superintendence; but the com-
mittee was empowered, by resolution of the 25th January, in accordance
with the fifth section of the act organizing the institution, to ‘‘employ one
or More persons to superintend the erection of the building,’’ and they were
required to cause the work to be done ‘‘to the entire satisfaction of said
superintendent or superintendents.’’? 'The committee believe that there is
no example in this country of the superintendence of a building as exten-
sive as that of this institution costing, including all. remuneration to
the architect for the original design, and all incidentals appertaining to
the architect’s office, less than $3,000 a year. The salary paid to a
resident superintending architect of such a building, when it is his own
design, is usually, without reckoning incidentals, either $2,500 or $3,000
a year. ‘The committee are justified, then, in setting down the entire item
of superintendence, (not included in the above appropriations,) with its inci-
dentals, at $3,000 a year. In consequence of the principal architect resi-
ding in New York, it actually costs a trifle more.

Nor was any appropriation made to supply the building with water.
This item, under a favorable contract, has cost $650.

_ The item of drainage, also, was omitted. In consequence of the muni-
cipal regulations of Washington city, it will cost from $1,000 to $1,500.
The committee has put it down at $1,350.

If we add to the appropriations specifically made, these necessary items,
it will appear that the scale of expenditure to which, by the action of the
board, the building committee have been limited for the completion of the
building and grounds, all incidentals included, was about $287,000, thus:

Special appropriations, already enumerated - - $270,000
Superintendence, including incidentals, say five years,

$3,000 a year - - - - - 15,000

Drainage, say ___- - - - - - 1,350

Supplying water to the building - - - - 650

$287,000

The contract, however, for the building, has been taken at a rate much
lower than the board seem to have anticipated; at a rate; too, to the credit
of the architect it should be stated, fifteen thousand dollars below his esti-
mates. And the contractor has proceeded so far with the erection, that
the committee has had a good opportunity to judge of his competency and
willingness to complete the whole under the conditions of the contract.
Unless prevented by accident not to be foreseen or anticipated, they do not
doubt that he will do so. Under these circumstances, although the com-
mittee is aware that, in the execution of so extensive a work, many con-
tingencies must be expected necessarily to present themselves, that will add
to its cost; yet they confidently believe, that by judicious management
and strict economy, the entire expenditure for the erection of the building,
including the fitting up and furnishing of the same; supplying the same
with water; laying out the lot in grass and planting it with trees and shrubs;
fencing the same, both with the present temporary fence and the ultimate
permanent one; also all expenses for superintendence of erection, including
the cost of architect’s office and other incidentals, so as, in fact, to cover
all expenses whatever that have been incurred, or are to be incurred, on
the building and on the lot on which it stands, until the completion of the
building and of the preparation of the lot, up to the 19th of March, 1852,
need not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, being thirty-
seven thousand dollars less than the sum total, according to the scale of
appropriation, heretofore adopted by the board.

So confident is the committee of the accuracy of the above opinion, that
they are willing to see passed by the board stringent resolutions rescinding
former appropriations for these objects, and restricting the committee, in
their entire operations, to the above amount.

By a resolution of the board of the 5th of February last, the prepara-
tion and publication of a work to be entitled ‘‘ Hints on Public Architect-
ure,’’ and to contam, among its illustrations, views and plans of the inst-
tution building, was intrusted to the committee; and an appropriation of a
thousand dollars was made for that purpose.

In carrying out that resolution, the committee made with Messrs. Wiley
& Putnam, one of the most respectable publishing firms in New York, a
contract, of which a copy will be found on their journal ; according to the
terms of which, the committee agrees to furnish the entire illustrations,
which it is stipulated shall not be of less value than one thousand dollars;
and the publishers, without further cost to the committee, agree to furnish
a thousand copies of the volume bonnd in cloth, provided the letter-press
does not exceed one hundred and fifty pages. é

In order to give increased value to the work, the committee applied to
several public bodies, having control of edifices of which the architecture
is of reputable character, for plates of the same. In the case of one of the
New York churches they were successful, and they hope to obtain in the
same way plates of one or two other public edifices. The particulars of
these applications will be found at large on their journal. /

The committee hope to make this treatise, of which a portion of the
manuscript is prepared, a work of practical importance, and of national
interest. Among the resolutions on the journal of the committee, several
will be found relating to this subject, and providing, among other things,
that the forthcoming work should include a comparative review of the ad-
vantages, economy, and facility of adaptation to modern purposes, of
[ 23 ] 14

various styles of public architecture, particularly the Grecian, Roman,
modern Italian, Gothic of different ages, and Norman; giving the actual
cost, compared to extent of accommodations, of some of the principal pub-
lic edifices in the United States, in the various styles, including some of
the public buildings erected in Washington, and elsewhere, by the general
government; also, that, so far as the funds permit, the work shall contain
illustrations, in the best style of art, representing such among the public
buildings of the United States as exhibit the purest specimens of architect-
ure, in various styles, including two perspective views of the Smithsonian
Institution on steel; and including, also, one or more perspective views of
the best designs for the institution, offered in competition.

To execute such a plan as this in a reputable manner, the illustrations,
including numerous wood-cuts, essential to a proper elucidation of the
text, will, the committee have ascertained, cost more than the sum here-
tofore appropriated. ‘The two steel engravings of the institution building
in perspective cannot be obtained, executed in the best style of art, for
less than $35U to S400 for the two. ‘The committee ask, therefore, of the
board an additional appropriation of a thousand dollars. By reference to
a supplement recently made to the original contract with Wiley & Putnam,
and of which a copy is given in the minutes of the forty-first meeting of
the committee, the board will perceive that such an additional appropria-
tion, expended on illustrations, will entitle us to an additional hundred
pages of letter-press; making in all two hundred and fifty pages. This
the committee consider important, as it is doubtful whether the number of
pages to which, by the original contract, the volume was restricted, will
suffice for the purpose of the work.

{t will require six months, properly to execute the illustrations of this
work ;-so that it cannot be published before next summer or autumn. ‘The
committee will proceed in its preparation as rapidly as is consistent with
the proper execution of the work.

It is the purpose of the committee to add to this work, as an appendix,
the result of the experiments heretofore (to wit, by resolution of the first of
March last) authorized by the board, to determine the economical value of
the different building materials used in the United States. This will
give to the work additional value for builders, carpenters, and mechanics,
generally.

For further particulars regarding the various subjects touched on in this
report, the committee beg to refer the board to the copy, herewith sub-
mitted, of their journal. ‘They think it would be useful to make that copy
a portion of the annual report of the board to Congress.

They submit also, herewith, the original contracts with Dixon &
Cameron, Joel Downer, Caleb Buckingham, and Wiley & Putnam; and
the security bond signed by Dixon & Cameron, Winter, and Butler.

All which is respectfully submitted.
