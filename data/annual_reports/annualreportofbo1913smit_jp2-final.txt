OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
CHARLES D. WALCOTT

FOR THE YEAR ENDING FUNE 30, 1913,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:
GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith a report on the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches during
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, including work placed by Con-
gress under the direction of the Board of Regents in the United
States National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-
physical Observatory, and the United States Bureau of the Inter-
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature. There is also included
an outline of work proposed in the Langley Aerodynamical Labora-
tory, the establishment of which has been authorized by the Board
of Regents under a grant from the Hodgkins fund of the Institution.
The general report reviews the affairs of the Institution proper
and briefly summarizes the operations of its several branches, while
the appendices contain detailed reports by the assistant secretaries
and others directly in charge of various activities. The reports on
operations of the National Museum and the Bureau of American
Ethnology will also be published as independent volumes.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

The Smithsonian Institution was created an establishment by act
of Congress approved August 10, 1846. Its statutory members are
the President of the United States, the Vice President, the Chief
Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Board of Regents consists of the Vice President and the
Chief Justice of the United States as ex officio members, three
_ Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representa-
tives, and six citizens, “two of whom shall be resident in the city

44863°—sm 1918——1 1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

of Washington, and the other four shall be inhabitants of some
State, but no two of them of the same State.”

In regard to the personnel of the board it becomes my sad duty
to record the death on October 30, 1912, of its Chancellor, James
Schoolcraft Sherman, Vice President of the United States. Resolu-
tions in memory of Chancellor Sherman were adopted by the Regents
at their annual meeting on December 12, when the Hon. Edward D.
White, Chief Justice of the United States, was elected Chancellor
of the Institution.

Dr. Andrew D. White was reappointed as Regent to serve until
June 26, 1918; the Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks to serve until July 3,
1918; and Judge Gray to serve until February 7, 1919. Senator
Bacon was reappointed a Regent, and Senator William J. Stone was
appointed to succeed the Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, whose term as
United States Senator expired in March, 1913. The Hon, Thomas R.
Marshall, Vice President of the United States, became a Regent on
March 4, 1913.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Edward D. White, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor ;
Thomas R. Marshall, Vice President of the United States; Henry
Cabot Lodge, Member of the Senate; Augustus O. Bacon, Member
of the Senate; William J. Stone, Member of the Senate; John Dal-
zell, Member of the House of Representatives; Scott Ferris, Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives; Irvin S. Pepper, Member of
the House of Representatives; Andrew D. White, citizen of New
York; Alexander Graham Bell, citizen of Washington, D. C.;
George Gray, citizen of Delaware; Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of
Massachusetts; John B. Henderson, jr., citizen of Washington, D. C.;
and Charles W. Fairbanks, citizen of Indiana.

Regular meetings of the Board of Regents were held on December
12, 1912, and February 18, 19138, and a special meeting on May 1,
1913. The minutes of these meetings have been printed as usual
for the use of the Regents, while such important matters acted upon
as are of public interest are reviewed under appropriate heads in the
present report of the secretary. The annual financial report of the
Executive Committee has also been issued in the usual form, and a
detailed statement of disbursements from Government appropria-
tions under the direction of the Institution for the maintenance of
the National Museum, the National Zoological Park, and other
branches will be submitted by the secretary to Congress in compli-
ance with the law.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The activities of the Smithsonian Institution under its plan of
organization cover practically the entire field of the natural and
physical sciences, as well as anthropological and archeological re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

searches. The Institution was founded for the increase and dif-
fusion of knowledge. It is an Institution of record, research, and
education, and also of cooperation. It offers facilities for the ad-
vancement of human knowledge through original research and in-
vestigation in every field and educates the people through the pub-
lication of the results of such researches. There is reciprocal
cooperation between the Smithsonian Institution and the several
departments of the United States Government and learned societies
in this country and abroad in carrying forward important explora-
tions and lines of investigation.

Some of the scientific studies originating with the Smithsonian
Institution in this country have since developed into distinct and
important bureaus and departments of the Government. The influ-
ence of the Institution is world-wide; through its international ex-
change service alone it is in correspondence with more than 60,000
individuals and learned societies'in the United States and prac-
tically in every land on the globe. During its entire existence there
has been an unbroken record of friends intercourse with every
agency devoted to the encouragement of learning. As was said in
1896, by the late Dr. Daniel Coit Gilman, “ Without any Puibonaee)
Santen the power to bestow much pecuniary assistance, * *
the Smithsonian has been, and is, the great auxiliary of science and
education throughout the length and breadth of the land.”

The extent of the activities of the Institution is limited only by
the amount of the funds available. During recent years its private
income has been supplemented on several occasions by friends of the
Institution who have generously provided the means for carrying
on certain explorations and lines of research, but opportunities for
further important work constantly arise which must be declined or
temporarily held in abeyance. Some of the projects proposed are
such as could not properly be carried on through Government appro-
priation, but which the Smithsonian Institution could readily under-
take were the means available.

Research Corporation—The work of the Research Corporation,
organized primarily for handling the Cottrell patents offered to the
Institution for the benefit of research, has been progressing steadily
during the year. As explained in detail in my last report, this cor-
poration was organized February 8, 1912, under the laws of the
State of New York as a means of furthering scientific and technical
research. It objects as stated in its prospectus are:

First, to acquire inventions and patents and to make them more available in
the arts and industries, while using them as a source of income, and, second,
to apply all profits derived from such use to the advancement of technical and
scientific investigation and experimentation through the agency of the Smith-

sonian Institution and such other scientific and educational institutions and
societies as may be selected by the directors. For these purposes the corpora-
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

tion has been capitalized at $20,000, divided into 200 shares, but the charter
provides that no dividends shall be paid and that the entire net profits shall
be devoted to research, all the stock being held under a stockholders’ agree-
ment, which recites that the corporation has been organized for the purpose of
aiding and encouraging technical and scientific research, and not for personal
or individual profit.

At the present time many discoveries are constantly being made, which un-
doubtedly possess a greater or less potential value, but which are literally being
allowed to go to waste for lack of thorough development. This is due, in some
cases, to the fact that the inventors are men in the service of the Government
or in the universities or technical schools, who are retarded either by official
positions, lack of means, or reluctance to engage in commercial enterprises,
and in other cases to the fact that a discovery made incidentally in the labora-
tory of a manufacturing corporation does not lend itself to the particular pur-
pose of such corporation. ‘True conservation demands that such by-products
as these shall be developed and utilized to the fullest extent of which they are
capable. The Research Corporation aims to supply this demand and, through
the cooperation of the Smithsonian Institution and the universities, to carry
forward the work of investigation alréady begun by others upon lines which
promise important results and to perfect such inventions as may prove to
possess commercial value, thus bringing scientific institutions into closer rela-
tions with industrial activities and furthering the improvements of industrial
processes.

The establishment of the Research Corporation was rendered uo
mediately possible by the acquisition, through the gift of Dr. F. G!
Cottrell, of the United States Bureau of Mavies! and his associates, of
a nob set of patents relating to the precipitation of dust, anges
and chemical fumes by the use of electrical currents. These devices
are in operation in several States, and are fully described i in ‘an’ ‘ar-
ticle in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, for August, 1911:

A number of other patents in various fields of industry have been
offered by officers of the Government and scientific institutions, as
well as by manufacturing corporations holding paténts not available
for their own purposes, and undoubtedly there are many others, both
in this country and abroad, who will be glad to have their inventions
utilized for the benefit of scientific research. The Smithsonian Insti-
tution is interested in the management of this corporation through
the membership of the secretary in its board of directors, which is
composed of business and professional men, many of whom have had
experience in large industrial and mining enterprises.

The George W. Poore bequest.—By the terms of the will of the
iate George W. Poore, of Lowell, Mass., who died December 17, 1910,
the Smithsonian Institution becomes his residuary legatee. As men-
tioned in my 1910 report, the estate, estimated at about $40,000, is
bequeathed under the condition that the income of this sum should
be added to the principal until a total of $250,000 should have been
reached, and that then the income only should be used for the pur-
poses for which the Institution was created. The estate is still in
process of settlement by the executors,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

As a reason for making this bequest to the Smithsonian Institution,
Mr. Poore in his will says: “ I make this gift not so much because of
its amount as because I hope it will prove an example for other
Americans to follow, by supporting and encouraging so wise and
beneficent an institution as I believe the Smithsonian Institution to be,
and yet it has been neglected and overlooked by American citizens.”

The Kahn Foundation—The Smithsonian Institution is closely
allied with a number of organizations and movements of importance
to the public through the membership of the secretary in various
boards of trustees. Some of these are mentioned elsewhere in this
report and among others are the Carnegie Institution of Washington,
with whose administration the secretary has been connected since
its establishment, and “ The Kahn Foundation for the Foreign Travel
of American Teachers.” The last-named organization was founded
in 1911 through a deed of gift and trust between Albert Kahn, of
Paris, France, of the first part, and Edward D. Adams, Nicholas
Murray Butler, Henry Fairfield Osborn, of New York; Charles W.
Eliot, of Cambridge; and Charles D. Walcott, of Washington, of the
second part. The founder had heretofore established certain trust
funds in France, Germany, Japan, England, and other countries for
the purpose of defraying the expenses of teachers and supplying them
with what he termed “ bourses de voyage” so as to enable them to
travel, observe, and study in foreign countries. He believes “ that
the cause of civilization may be greatly encouraged and promoted by
travel on the part of teachers, scholars, and investigators, and that,
by the study and. comparison of national manners and customs, and of
political, social, religious, and economic institutions of foreign coun-
tries, they will become better qualified to teach and to take part in
the instruction and education of the people of their own nation.” In
the selection of beneficiaries of the Kahn Foundation preference is
given to professors of American colleges or universities and, as a
rule, the itinerary is expected to involve an absence from America of
at least a year. The limited size of the fund does not permit the
granting of more than two or three fellowships each year.

There were originally four pieces of real estate bequeathed to the
Institution by the late R. S. Avery, but during the year one of these
pieces and a part of another were sold and the proceeds added to the
permanent fund. The real estate owned by the Institution is free
from taxation and yields a nominal rental.

That part of the fund deposited in the Treasury of the United
States bears interest at 6 per cent per annum, under the provisions of
the act organizing the Institution and an act of Congress approved
March 12, 1894. The rate of interest on the West Shore Railroad
bonds is 4 per cent per annum.

The income of the Institution during the year, amounting to
$92,870.74, was derived as follows: Interest on the permanent foun-
dation, $58,875.12; contributions frgm various sources for specific
purposes, $16,575.50; and from other miscellaneous sources, $17,920.12 ;
all of which was deposited in the Treasury of the United States to
the credit of the current account of the Institution.

With the balance of $33,060.09 on July 1, 1912, the total resources
for the fiscal year amounted to $125,930.83. The disbursements
which are given in detail in the annual report of the executive com-
mittee, amounted to $92,289.43, leaving a balance of $33,641.40 on
deposit June 30, 1918, in the United States Treasury.

The Institution was charged by Congress with the disbursement
of the following appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1913:

RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS.

The Smithsonian Institution has continued to carry on field work
in various lines throughout the world by means of small allotments
_ from its funds. It has also accomplished a great deal in the way of
exploration and research through the generosity of frienas of the
Institution, who have contributed funds for special work or provided
opportunities for participation in explorations which they had under-
taken personally or through the aid of others. Each year, however,
the Institution is obliged to forego opportunities for important in-
vestigations through lack of sufficient funds.

I can here only briefly mention some of the explorations and re-
searches in progress during the past year. Accounts of activities
connected with the Astrophysical Observatory, the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, and the United States National Museum are given in
other parts of this report by those in direct charge of those branches
of the Institution.

LANGLEY AERODYNAMICAL LABORATORY.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents on May 1, 19138, the follow-
ing resolutions were adopted:

Whereas the Smithsonian Institution possesses a laboratory for the study of
questions relating to aerodynamics, which has been closed since the death of
its director, the late Dr. S. P. Langley, formerly Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution; and

Whereas it is desirable to foster and continue, in the Institution with which
he was connected, the aerodynamical researches which he inaugurated ;
Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby

authorizes the Secretary of the Institution, with the advice and approval of the

executive committee, to reopen the Smithsonian Institution laboratory for the
study of aerodynamics and take such stens as in his judgment may be necessary
to provide for the organization and administration of the laboratory on a per-
manent basis.

That the aerodynamic laboratory of the Institution shall be known as the

Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory.

That the functions of the laboratory shall be the study of the problems of
aerodromics, particularly those of aerodynamics, with such research and ex-
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

perimentation as may be necessary to increase the safety and effectiveness of
aerial locomotion for the purposes of commerce, national defense, and the wel-
fare of man.

That the secretary is authorized to secure, as far as practicable, the co-
operation of governmental and other agencies in the development of acrogrom:
ical research under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Regents also authorized the secretary to appoint an advisory
committee; to add, as means are provided, other laboratories and
agencies; to group them into a bureau organization; and to secure the
cooperation with them of the Government and other agencies.

In accordance with the above general plan an advisory committee
was organized at a meeting convened at the Institution on May 23,
1913. The official status, organization, agencies, resources, and
facilities of this committee are set forth in a statement reprinted in
the appendix to the present. report.

In preparing plans for carrying forward investigations in various
lines a study is being made of researches in progress in other coun-
tries, and an allotment has been made from the Hodgkins fund for
the maintenance, in part, of the laboratory.

STUDIES IN CAMBRIAN GEOLOGY AND PALEONTOLOGY.

During the field season of the fiscal year 1912-13, or the spring and
summer of 1913, I continued my geological work in the Canadian
Rockies. A month was spent in the Robson Park district of British
Columbia, and Jasper Park, Alberta, our camp being on the conti-
nental divide near Berg Lake, northwest of the Yellowhead Pass,
through which the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern
Railways have beens built.

Considerable collections of fossils were made at several localities,
photographs were taken, and several places in the geological section
studied in 1912 were examined. This was rendered necessary by
reason of my having been driven out of the region by continued rain
and snow storms the previous year.

From the Robson district I went to Burgess Pass, north of Field,
British Columbia, and worked at the Middle Cambrian fossil quarry
until late in the season. Both in the Robson district and also at Bur-
gess Pass I was assisted by my two sons, Sidney and Stuart, who
have had many years’ experience in field work in the Rocky Moun-
tains. Mr. R. D. Mesler, of the United States National Museum,
spent nearly the entire field season collecting at Burgess Pass.
Special effort was made to finish collecting at this famous locality,
and at the close of the field season a collection of several thousand
specimens weighing over two and a half tons was shipped to Wash-
ington.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF PANAMA,

A plan has been formulated and some progress has been made in
certain lines of field work for a geological survey of Panama, under
the joint auspices of the Isthmian Canal Commission, the United
States Geological Survey, and the Smithsonian Institution, and an
allotment has been made from the Institution’s funds toward the ex-
penses of such investigation. The general plan of the survey com-
prises a systematic study of the physiography, stratigraphy and
structural geology, geologic history, geologic correlation, mineral re-
sources (including coal, oil, and other fields), petrography and pale-
ontology of the Canal Zone, and of as much of the adjacent areas of
the Isthmian region as is feasible. In this survey an opportunity is
afforded for working out in detail the succession of the geologic for-
mations and the study of the structure, petrography, and paleontology
of a Central American area such as has never before existed, and
probably never will be realized again. It is possible to make and
properly characterize a standard geologic section of this part of the
world, one with which the more obscure exposures of adjacent areas
may be compared. ‘There is already nearly completed a section of
each side of the Culebra Cut in a horizontal scale of 1: 5,000, vertical
seale 1: 2,500; and a general section has been made from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, with collections from every fossiliferous exposure seen.
A basis has been practically determined for the intercorrelation of
the formations across the Isthmus and for correlation with the Gulf
States, also with certain formations in some of the West Indian
Islands.

Upon the completion of this survey the Institution will publish a
general account of the work accomplished, and later it is planned to
print a detailed report of the geological data of the Isthmus and
adjoining regions.

BIOLOGICAL EXPEDITIONS IN AFRICA.

Rainey African expedition—The Paul J. Rainey expedition in
British East Africa came to a successful close in February, 1912.
The collections, numbering 5,750 large and small mammals, 400 birds,
2,000 reptiles, and 500 miscellaneous specimens, included a large
number of new genera and species since described in the publications
of the Institution and the National Museum. During this expedition
Mr. Edmund Heller, of the National Museum, who had previously
served as naturalist on the expedition under Col. Roosevelt, was the
guest of Mr. Rainey, who provided him all the native assistants that
he could use, and accorded him perfect freedom as regards choice of
collecting ground. Mr. Heller was thus able to visit the exact regions
from which material was most needed to supplement that procured
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

by the previous expedition. After studying the mammals in the
British Museum, Mr. Heller reports that the United States National
Museum now has the finest series of East African mammals in the
world. Eighty lions were secured on the expedition, which more
than tripled the highest previous record for Africa.

The Childs Frick Expedition—As mentioned in my last report,
Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, associate in zoology in
the National Museum, who had served on the expedition under Col.
Roosevelt, accompanied Mr. Childs Frick, of New York, on a hunt-
ing and collecting trip in the territory north of that visited by Col.
Roosevelt and Mr. Rainey, covering at the same time certain parts of
Abyssinia, northern British East Africa, and the country lying about
Lake Rudolf. The expedition ended in September, 1912. The col-
lections as a whole embraced plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, batra-
chians, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. A
part of the large collection of birds obtained by this expedition is
deposited in the National Museum.

EXPLORATIONS IN BORNEO.

Abbott Borneo expedition —Through the generosity of Dr. W. L.
Abbott, who for many years was engaged in natural history and
ethnological ‘investigations in the Malay Archipelago, a fund has
been provided for natural history field work in Dutch East Borneo.

Nothing has been published concerning this practically unknown
region, and the National Museum had no collections from East
Borneo, although there were a few from the west and south coasts
of Borneo. During the past year Mr. Raven, in charge of this
exploration, succeeded in securing a very interesting series of the
characteristic mammals of the country, such as orangs, deer, wild
pigs, squirrels and smaller rodents, and other interesting species.

Mr. Streeter’s exploration in Borneo.—Mr. Daniel Denison Streeter,
jr., of Brooklyn, having offered his services as a collaborator in
zoology of the National Museum, sailed from New York on April 4,
1912, and returned December 24, 1912. Some of his thrilling experi-
ences in the interior of Borneo are described in his interesting report
to the Institution. He passed from Sarawak into Dutch Borneo
by ascending the Rejang River and crossing the mountains on the
dividing line to the Kajan River. He then ascended to the head
of this river and crossed another range to the headwaters of the
Mahakam River, which he descended to the Strait of Macassar.
During his trip he secured some interesting collections of mammals,
reptiles, and anthropological specimens, part of which have been
received by the Museum, but many additional specimens were neces-
sarily left behind in the mountains and may not be recovered.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ai

In describing his journey Mr. Streeter writes:

Arriving at Kuching, the capital of the Kingdom of Sarawak, in north-
western Borneo. I apprised the officials of my plan to cross Borneo. They
helped me with every means in their power, although they told me that no man
had ever yet been across Borneo, and that they did not think it possible for me
to do it. * * * JT erossed a bay 200 miles wide in a Chinese junk to the
mouth of the Rejang River. Here I engaged three Malays aud their canoe to
take me S80 miles up the river to the island of Sibu. * * * A little Malay
river steamer arrived and took me 90 miles farther up the river—as far as it
could go. At this head of navigation is a little native town called Kapit, and
here I again took to dugout canoes, this time for good and all. * * * It
took me two months to ascend this river to its headwaters. I collected
specimens of reptiles and mammals, together with interesting anthropological
specimens, took photographs of all kinds, studied the natives, the rivers, the
weather, vegetable life in general, made notes on everything, and mapped
my course as accurately as I could with the instruments in my possession.
* %* * T crossed the main range of mountains forming the backbone of
Borneo to the headwaters of the Kajan River. I estimate the altitude of the
pass through which I crossed the mountains at a little over 3,000 feet. * * *
[He then proceeded] in dugout canoes down one branch of the Kajan River
and up the main river for several days to the immense village of Long Nawong.
This village comprises about 3,000 souls, ruled by a native rajah, who visited
me and with whom I exchanged presents. Here I set out with one canoe and
five head-hunters as paddlers and continued up the Kajan River. A flood
arose, my canoe went to the bottom, and we had to swim for shore. I saved
my rifle and my tin box of maps, papers, diaries, and notes.

Continuing on foot up the river we fell in with a party of 40 head-hunters
of the Bahau Tribe and I arranged to travel with them, sending back my five
Kajan paddlers. With this Bahau troupe I continued up the Kajan River
to its headwaters and over another range of mountains to the headwaters
of the Mahakam River. * * * After losing my collection I immediately
began a second collection, and this assumed the proportions of the first as I
proceeded. When within about 500 miles of the mouth of the Mahakam River
I came to the first outpost of civilization, the Dutch military post of Long
Iram, in charge of a Dutch captain and a company of native Javanese. Upon
hearing my story the captain promised to send a military expedition up into the
interior, where the Dutch had never been before, and try and secure the outfit
which I had left at these native villages. * * * I boarded a little flat-
bottomed Malay river steamer, which * * * floated on down the river to
the coast.

LYMAN SIBERIAN EXPEDITION.

The expedition to the Altai Mountains, which was financed by Dr.
Theodore Lyman, of Cambridge, Mass., as mentioned in my last
report, returned to Washington September 16, 1912. Mr. Ned
Hollister, a naturalist of the National Museum, accompanied Dr.
Lyman. The expedition resulted in securing 350 mammals for the
National Museum and 300 birds for the Museum of Comparative
Zoology, Cambridge. The region covered was in the Kurai dis-
trict, Government of Tomsk. The mammal collection is one of the
most important received in recent years, as the region had not been
represented in the Museum, and the fauna was of special interest
on account of its close relationship with that of North America.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES IN SIBERIA AND MONGOLIA.

With the view of securing further information as to the origin of
the race that peopled America, a visit was made to certain portions of
Siberia and Mongolia by Dr. Hrdlicka, of the National Museum, dur-
ing the summer of 1912. This work was undertaken partly under
the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and partly in the interest
of the Panama-California Exposition of San Diego.

Besides field observations made by Dr. Hrdlicka, an examination
was made of the anthropological collections in the various Siberian
museums in the region covered. He saw or was told of thousands
upon thousands of burial mounds, or “ kourgans,” dating from the
present time back to the period when nothing but stone implements
were used by man in those regions. And he saw and learned of
numerous large caverns, particularly in the mountains bordering the
Yenisei River, which yield human remains and offer excellent oppor-
tunities for investigation.

A brief account of Dr. Hrdli¢ka’s studies is given by him in a
pamphlet published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
in which he says:

In regard to the living people, the writer had the opportunity of seeing nu-
merous Buriats, representatives of a number of tribes on the Yenisei and Aba-
can Rivers, many thousands of Mongolians, a number of Tibetans, and many
Chinese, with a few Manchurians. * * * Among all these people there are
visible many and unmistakable traces of admixture or persistence of what
appears to have been the older population of these regions, pre-Mongolian and
especially pre-Chinese, as we know these nations at the present day. Those
representing these vestiges belong partly to the brachycephalic and in a smaller
extent to the dolichocephalic type, and resemble to the point of identity Amer.
ican Indians of corresponding head form. * * *

The physical resemblances between these numerous outcroppings of the older
blood and types of northeastern Asia and the American Indian can not be re-
garded as accidental, for they are numerous as well as important, and can not
be found in parts of the world not peopled by the yellow-brown race; nor can
they be taken as an indication of American migration to Asia, for emigration
of man follows the laws of least resistance or greatest advantage, and these
conditions surely lay more in the direction from Asia to America than the
reverse.

In conclusion, it may be said that from what he learned in eastern Asia, and
weighing the evidence with due respect to other possible views, the writer feels
justified in advancing the opinion that there exist to-day over large parts of
eastern Siberia, and in Mongolia, Tibet, and other regions in that part of the
world, numerous remains, which now form constituent parts of more modern
tribes or nations, of a more ancient population (related in origin, perhaps, with
the latest paleolithic EHuropean), which was physically identical with and in all
probability gave rise to the American Indian.

BIOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE.

The biological survey of the Panama Canal Zone, organized by the
Institution in 1910, was brought to a close during the past year as
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

far as field work was concerned, and some of the results have been
published. ‘The natural history collections made by the survey have
added very valuable material to the National Museum series of
mammals, birds, fishes, reptiles, and amphibians, land and fresh-
water mollusks, flowering plants and ferns, and specimens of micro-
scopic plant and animal life.

ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDIES IN PERU.

During the past year a second trip was made to Peru by Dr.
Hrdlicka in continuation of the brief but very interesting researches
made by him in that country in 1910. The principal objects of the
trip were the mapping out as far as possible of the anthropological
distributions of the prehistoric Peruvian, more particularly the coast
people; the determination of the physical type of the important
Nasca group of people, which represent one of the highest American
cultures; further inquiry as to man’s antiquity on the west coast of
South America; and the extension of Dr. Hrdlitka’s researches on
pre-Columbian pathology. Important collections were made for the
National Museum, as well as for the Panama-California Exposition
at San Diego. A very perceptible change for the worse was observed
in the state of preservation of the ancient remains, both skeletal and
archeological. Dr. Hrdlicka reports:

The major part of the old population of the extensive coast region were
found everywhere to belong to the brachycephalic type, intimately related to
the Maya-Zapotec type in the north. The Nasca people were one of the purest
groups belonging to this type. Wherever they lived these people of the Peru-
vian coast were wont to practice, more or less, the anteroposterior head deforma-
tion. They have spread along the valleys to the foothills of the Cordillera, and
have probably in some instances penetrated into the mountains. Meanwhile,
however, they became in many though not all localities more or less mixed, or
rather mingled, with dolicho or near dolichocephalic elements which came from
or across the mountains.

As to man’s antiquity, the results were wholly negative; no trace of man of
geological age, nor even of an ancient man of the present epoch, were discovered.

The density of the pre-Columbian population was in some localities greater,
in others probably less, than at the present time.

As to pathology, the people of the mountains were found to have been much
healthier than those of the coast. The most common disease leaving its traces
on the bones in ancient Peru was arthritis. In strictly pre-Columbian ceme-
teries there was no rachitis, syphilis, tuberculosis, or cancer. Wounds of skull
were very common. In the mountains numerous interesting instances of tre-
panation were discovered.

Further explorations in the mountainous parts of Peru are urgent.

RESEARCHES UNDER THE HODGKINS FUND.

As mentioned in my last report, a limited grant was made from the
Hodgkins fund for carrying on certain observations on nocturnal
radiation at various altitudes. The results of this research, as also
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

of several other lines of investigation in connection therewith, pro-
vided for by an additional grant, are discussed on another page by
Mr. Abbot in his report on the Astrophysical Observatory. There
was also allotted from the Hodgkins fund a grant for carrying on
aeronautical researches in connection with the Langley Aerodynami-
cal Laboratory, discussed in other paragraphs.

There was in press at the expense of this fund during the year
a paper by Dr. Leonard Hill and associates, discussing the results of
important researches made by them in London on the influence of
the atmosphere of crowded places upon our health and comfort.

SMITHSONIAN TABLE AT NAPLES ZOOLOGICAL STATION.

In order to afford an opportunity for American biologists to study
marine life under exceptionally favorable facilities, the Institution
for 20 years past has maintained a table at the Naples Zoological
Station. Investigators are assigned the use of this table for stated
periods on the recommendation of an advisory committee appointed
for the purpose. The authorities of the station have on several oc-
casions courteously allowed more than one occupant of the table
when there was overlapping in periods of appointment.

During the year covered by the present report Mr. Sidney I.
Kornhauser and Mr. Edward C. Day, both of Harvard University,
have pursued studies at the Smithsonian table.

THE HARRIMAN TRUST FUND.

Under a special trust fund, established by Mrs. E. H. Harriman,
for his investigations in natural history and ethnology, Dr. C. Hart
Merriam has equipped two offices, the principal one at Washington,
D. C., the other at Lagunitas in west central California, a convenient
center for field work on the Pacific coast and a favorable place for
the preparation of results.

His principal work during the year has been a continuation of a
monographic study of the American bears. Assistance in the way
of the loan of specimens has been rendered by all of the larger
museums of America, including the Government museums of Canada,
at Ottawa and Victoria, and by a number of sportsmen and hunters,
who have placed their private material at his disposal. This has
been still further augmented by the purchase of specimens, mainly
skulls, of rare and little known species, some of which are the only
ones in existence. In view of the fact that several species of our
large bears are already extinct and others on the verge of extinction,
the great value of this material is obvious.

In connection with the study of the big bears a new method has
been developed, namely, an intensive study of teeth from photo-
graphs. Owing to the large size of bear skulls, it is impossible to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15:

bring the teeth of several individuals near enough together to admit
a direct comparison. To obviate this difficulty, the teeth have been
photographed natural size. Series of these photographs arranged
closely side by side permit direct critical comparison of a number of
specimens at one time, favoring the recognition of resemblances and
differences not easily detected from the specimens. This method
would seem to be available in the case of other groups of large
mammals.

Owing to the desirability of completing the study of the bears as
early as possible, but little field work was undertaken. Still, a few
tribes of Indians were visited, and half a dozen vocabularies col-
lected, completing the series of vocabularies of the 25 existing lin-
guistic stocks of California and Nevada.

AMERICAN SCHOOL OF ARCHEOLOGY IN CHINA.

At a meeting held at the Smithsonian Institution on January 38,
1913, there was discussed the establishment of an American school of
archeology in China. The objects of the school as proposed are:
(1) To prosecute archeological research in eastern China; (2) to
afford opportunity and facilities for investigation to promising and
exceptional students, both foreign and native, in Asiatic archeology ;
and (3) to preserve objects of archeological and cultural interest in
museums in the countries to which they pertain in cooperation with
eXisting organizations, such as the Société d’Ankor, ete,

The management of the affairs of the school was placed in the
hands of an executive committee of five, consisting of Dr. Charles D.
Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; Mr. Charles
Henry Butler, reporter of the United States Supreme Court; Dr.
Harry Lane Wilson, of Johns Hopkins .University; Mr, Charles L.
Freer, of Detroit; and Mr. Eugene Meyer, jr., of New York. The
general committee consists of 15 gentlemen especially interested in
archeological research in China, with Dr. Walcott as chairman and
Mr. Butler as secretary. Arrangements were made for a preliminary
survey in the Chinese Republic for the information of the general
committee in considering the permanent organization of the proposed

school.
PUBLICATIONS.

The publications issued by the Smithsonian Institution and its
branches during the last fiscal year made a total of 6,260 printed
pages, and the aggregate distribution comprised 182,883 copies of
pamphlets and bound volumes.

The Institution accomplishes one of its principal objects, “the
diffusion of knowledge,” by means of its several series of publications
which record results of original researches, accounts of explorations,
the progress achieved in science and industry, and general informa-

tion in all branches of human knowledge believed to be of value to
those interested in the promotion of science and the welfare of man.

The Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, in quarto form,
and the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, in octavo, are printed
at the expense of the Smithsonian fund, and necessarily in limited
editions, being distributed chiefly to certain large libraries through-
out the world, where they are available for public reference. The
Smithsonian Annual Report, however, is printed at the expense of
congressional appropriations, and in an edition of several thousand
copies, thus permitting its wide distribution. The principal feature
of the annual report is a general appendix containing about 30 se-
lected or original memoirs illustrating the more remarkable and im-
portant developments in the physical and natural sciences, as well
as showing the general character of the operations of the Institution,

In addition to the publications mentioned above, there are several
other series of works issued under the direction of the Institution
through its various branches or bureaus. These include the Annual
Report, and the Proceedings and Bulletin of the National Museum;
the Contributions from the National Herbarium; the Annual Report
and Bulletins of the Bureau of American Ethnology; and the An-
nals of the Astrophysical Observatory, all of which are Government
publications, being printed through annual allotments by act of
Congress.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge—The chief character-
istic of memoirs printed in the Contributions to Knowledge is that
they are records and discussions of original investigations and con-
stitute important additions to knowledge. Since the establishment
of this series in 1848, about 150 of these memoirs have been published
in 35 quarto volumes. The most recent memoir of this series, re-
viewed in my last report, was the “ Langley Memoir on Mechanical
Flight,” recording the experiments of the late Secretary Langley,
which resulted in his successful demonstration of the practicability
of aerial navigation with machines heavier than air.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections—In this series 40 papers
were issued, forming parts of five volumes, the titles of which are
enumerated in the appendix herewith. Among these numerous
papers were two articles by the secretary describing further results
of his studies of Cambrian fossils, a bibliography of the geology
and mineralogy of tin, and a large number of papers descriptive of
results of the Smithsonian African expedition under Col. Roosevelt,
the Paul J. Rainey African expedition, and the Smithsonian biologi-
cal survey of the Panama Canal Zone. There were also in press at the
close of the year three additional papers on Cambrian fossils, one
of them, in particular, giving an account of the Mount Robson region ;
and a paper, as already mentioned, by Dr. Leonard Hill and other

investigators of the Physical Laboratory of the London Hospital
Medical College, discussing the results of experiments to determine
“The influence of the atmosphere on our health and comfort in con-
fined and crowded places.” The authors conclude that—

No symptoms of discomfort, fatigue, or illness results, so long as the tempera-
ture and moisture are kept low, from air rendered, in the chemical sense, highly
impure by the presence of human beings. Such air can be borne for hours
without any evidence of bodily or mental depression. * * * Heat stagna-
tion is therefore the one and only cause of the discomfort, and all the symptoms
arising in the so-called vitiated atmosphere of crowded rooms are dependent
on heat stagnation. The moisture, stillness, and warmth of the atmosphere are
responsible for all effects, and all the efforts of the heating and ventilating
engineer should therefore be directed toward cooling the air in crowded places
and cooling the bodies of the people by setting the air in motion by means of
fans. * * * The essentials required of any good system of ventilation are,
then: (1) Movement, coolness, proper degree of relative moisture of the air,
and (2) reduction of the mass influence of pathogenic bacteria. The chemical
purity of the air is of very minor importance and will be adequately insured by
attendance to the essentials.

Smithsonian Report—The completion of the annual report for
1911 was long delayed at the Government Printing Office, awaiting
a supply of the quality of paper used in that publication. The
general appendix of the volume contained 36 articles of the usual
character. The report for 1912 was in type at the close of the fiscal
year. The popularity of this work continues unabated, the entire
edition each year becoming exhausted very soon after its publication.

National Museum publications—The publications by the Museum
during the year comprised two volumes of Proceedings, pamphlet
copies of 96 articles from the Proceedings, two Bulletins, and nine
parts of volumes of Contributions from the National Herbarium.
An interesting work in press at the close of the year, prepared by
Assistant Secretary Richard Rathbun, gives a descriptive account of
the building recently erected for the departments of natural history
of the United States National Museum. The book is illustrated with
34 plates and, besides a general description of the building, includes
special chapters relating to structural details and mechanical equip-
ment,

Zoological nomenclature.—Opinions 52 to 56 rendered by the In-
ternational Commission on Zoological Nomenclature were published
in the usual form. The Institution also continues to aid the work of
this commission by providing funds for clerical services in connec-
tion with the office of its secretary in this country.

Publications of the Bureau of American Ethnology.—The publica-
tions issued by the Bureau of American Ethnology were the Twenty-
eighth Annual Report, containing papers on Casa Grande, the antiq-
uities of the upper Verde River and Walnut Creek Valleys, Ariz.,

44863°—sm 1913——2

the linguistics of Algonquian tribes; also Bulletin 52 on early man
in South America, and Bulletin 54 on the physiography of the Rio
Grande Valley, New Mexico.

The Astrophysical Observatory had completed work on volume 3
of the Annals of the Observatory at the close of the year, and it was
expected that the distribution of the edition would take place soon
after July 1.

Reports of historical and patriotic societies —In accordance with
the national charters of the American Historical Association and the
National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, an-
nual reports of those organizations were submitted to the Institution
and communicated to Congress.

Allotments for printing.—The allotments to the Institution and its
branches, under the head of “ Public printing and binding,” during
the fiscal year, aggregating $74,900, were all utilized with the ex-
ception of small balances on work in progress at the close of the year.
The allotments for the year ending June 30, 1914, are as follows:

For the Smithsonian Institution, for printing and binding annual re-

ports of the Board of Regents, with general appendixes_____________ $10, 000
For the annual reports of the National Museum, with general ap-

pendixes, and for printing labels and blanks, and for the bulletins

Committee on printing and publication—The advisory committee
on printing and publication under the Smithsonian Institution has
continued to examine manuscripts proposed for publication by the
branches of the Institution and has considered various questions
concerning public printing and binding. Twenty-two meetings of
the committee were held during the year and 138 manuscripts were
passed upon. The personnel of the committee as now organized is
as follows: Dr. Frederick W. True, Assistant Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, chairman; Mr. C. G. Abbot, Director of the Astro-
physical Observatory; Dr. Frank Baker, Superintendent of the
National Zoological Park; Mr. A. Howard Clark, editor of the Smith-
sonian Institution, secretary of the committee; Mr. F. W. Hodge,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

ethnologist in charge of the Bureau of American Ethnology; Dr.
George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, United States National
Museum; and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of biology,
United States National Museum.

Distribution of publications—On August 23, 1912, a law was
enacted requiring that all Government publications must, after Octo-
ber 1, be mailed from the Government Printing Office, mailing lists
or labels to be forwarded to the superintendent of documents for
that purpose. In accordance with the law, the Smithsonian Report
and publications of the United States National Museum and the
Bureau of American Ethnology have since been distributed direct
from the Government Printing Office. The accumulated stock of
publications, aggregating about 100,000 volumes and pamphlets from
which constant demands had been supplied, was also transferred to
the superintendent of documents during the month of September.

Catalogue of publications—There is in preparation, and nearly
ready for press, a complete list of publications of the Institution and
its branches. Partial lists have been issued from time to time but
no complete catalogue has been published. The present work will
contain about 12,000 titles, being practically a table of contents of
the entire series of Contributions to Knowledge, Miscellaneous Col-
lections and Annual Reports of the Institution, the Proceedings, Bul-
letins, and Annual Reports of the National Museum, the Annual
Reports and Bulletins of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and
the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory. The catalogue is so
arranged as to permit of ready reference to any desired subject or
the collective works of any author appearing in the several series.

LIBRARY.

During the year 12,930 volumes and parts of volumes, chiefly on
scientific topics, were added to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress. The additions to the National Museum library num-
bered 4,062 volumes and pamphlets. Additions were also made to
the libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, the Zoological Park,
the Bureau of American Ethnology, and other office libraries, includ-
ing the aeronautical library, which it is expected will be utilized
chiefly in connection with the work of the Langley Aerodynamical
Laboratory organized in May, 1913.

The appropriations for the next fiscal year provide an item of
$15,000 for beginning the construction of metal book stacks in the
main hall of the Smithsonian building to contain the library of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, a part of the National Museum
library, and certain other collections of books now stored in places
inconvenient for reference.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

In the new building of the National Museum four rooms on the
ground floor have been provided with steel book stacks and library
appliances of the latest design. To these rooms have been transferred
works needed in connection with natural history studies, while books
relating chiefly to the arts and industries and to American history are
retained in the older Museum building, where the collections of those
classes remain on exhibition.

ARCHIVES.

During the year some attention was given to improving conditions
in the archive room of the Institution, which was very badly over-
crowded. This room, on the fourth floor of the Smithsonian building,
was thoroughly overhauled and much accumulated material not re-
lating directly to the history of the Institution was removed to other
quarters. The set of Smithsonian publications formerly preserved
in this room was temporarily removed to the office of the assistant
secretary in charge of library and exchanges, thus making space for
manuscript material of importance. Two large wooden cases con-
taining papers relating to the internal affairs of the Institution and
its branches, together with other documents, were replaced by metal
eases containing drawers equipped with uniform cardboard recep-
tacles for papers, and alphabetical guide cards. It was not found
possible, however, to complete the transfer of the papers to these
receptacles during the year.

The wooden panels in the doors of the wall cases in the room were
removed and replaced by glass, so that it is possible to see.the con-
tents of the cases without opening them. A case was provided for
maps, plans, charts, and other large objects.

Cases were placed in an adjoining room for the reception of dupli-
cate vouchers and other financial papers of the several branches of the
Institution.

The large quantity of Schoolcraft papers at present in the custody
of the Institution were transferred to uniform file boxes and placed
on shelves. These papers are only partially classified.

The archives are now completely accessible, although a large
amount of work is still required to put them into thoroughly satis-
factory condition. The principal improvements needed are a com-
plete card catalogue of the several classes of papers contained in
the room, with indications of the location of each, and a uniform
card index of the contents of the bound volumes of official letters,
both originals and press copies. A reclassification of a considerable
portion of the other archives is also desirable, as well as the comple-
tion of the work of transferring papers to the new cases mentioned
above.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot
LANGLEY MEDAL.

In memory of the late Secretary Samuel Pierpont Langley and
his contributions to the science of aerodromics, the Board of Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution on December 15, 1908, established
the Langley medal, “to be awarded for specially meritorious inves-
tigations in connection with the science of aerodromics and its appli-
cation to aviation.” The first award of the medal was voted by the
Board of Regents on February 10, 1909, to Wilbur and Orville
Wright “ for advancing the science of aerodromics in its application
to aviation by their successful investigations and demonstrations
of the practicability of mechanical flight by man.” The medal was
presented to each of the brothers Wright at a meeting of the board on
February 10, 1910.

The second award of the medal was voted on February 13, 1913,
to Mr. Glenn H. Curtiss “ for advancing the art of aerodromics by
his successful development of a hydroaerodrome whereby the safety
of the aviator has been greatly enhanced,” and to Monsieur Gustave
Kiffel “ for advancing the science of aerodromics by his researches
relating to the resistance of the air in connection with aviation.”
The presentation of these medals was made on May 6, 1913. This
date was selected in order that the ceremonies incident to the presen-
tation might take place in connection with the observance of “ Lang-
ley Day,” which was established by the Aero Club of Washington in
1911, to commemorate the achievement by Mr. Langley on May 6,
1896, of mechanical flight by a heavier-than-air machine propelled
by its own power. On May 6, 1911, and again on May 6, 1912, there
were exhibition flights of biplanes and monoplanes near Washington.
On the afternoon of May 6, 1913, the celebration by the club occurred
at the Army War College immediately after the exercises in the
Smithsonian building, and consisted of a reception by the Aero Club,
followed by hydroaeroplane, biplane, and monoplane maneuvers.

The presentation exercises in the Smithsonian building preceded
the unveiling of the Langley memorial tablet and included addresses
by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell in presenting the medals, and accept-
ances by Ambassador Jusserand in behalf of M. Eiffel, and by Mr.
Glenn H. Curtiss.

In the course of his address M. Jusserand said:

We have seen France and America vie with each other not only in the con-
quest of better, greater, and safer liberty from year to year, but also in the
producing of more and more momentous inventions, improving the plane of life
of the many, reaching less faulty solutions of the great social problems.

Nothing more striking has taken place on these lines than in what concerns
the conquest of the air. It is surely appropriate to remember that one of the
very first flights ever attempted took place in Versailles, when one of the

earliest baloons rose a fortnight after the treaty definitely securing your inde-
pendence had been signed there in 1783. And you all know that Franklin, when
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

asked, What was the good of such an invention, answered, ‘‘ What is the good
of a new-born child?” The child has grown and is rapidly becoming a giant
in power. There is no branch of human activity in which France and America
have more truly vied with each other than this one, from the memorable day
of the Montgolfiére, so quickly perfected by the French physicist Charles, to
our own time.

Mr. Curtiss said in part:

As I look at the Langley models here, it becomes more evident to me than
ever before—the merit of these machines and the great work which Mr. Langley
did. We now know, as a result of M. Hiffel’s laboratory experiments, that
flying planes used by Prof. Langley had a great deal of efficiency, and it is also
generally known that the Langley machines, as he built them, had more in-
herent stability than the models which those of us who followed after Langley
used in our first flights. I can not say too much in fayor and in memory of
Prof. Langley.

LANGLEY MEMORIAL TABLET.

On May 6, 1913, the anniversary of the successful flight of the
Langley model aerodrome in 1896, the Langley memorial tablet to
commemorate the aeronautical work of the late Secretary Langley,
was unveiled in the Smithsonian building in the: presence of men
prominent in the development of aviation and a large company of
invited guests. The tablet was described in my last report. On the
oceasion of the unveiling of the tablet a memorial address was de-
livered by Dr. John A. Brashear, one of Prof. Langley’s oldest and
most cherished friends, and his warm supporter during his long in-
vestigations connected with the subject of aerial flight.

CONGRESSES AND CELEBRATIONS.

The Institution each year receives invitations to numerous scien-
tific congresses and celebrations in the United States and abroad, but
as funds are not available for the expenses of delegates, few of these
invitations can be agcepted. In some instances} however, it is pos-
sible to arrange for representation by collaborators of the Institution
who are visiting the localities, or by members of the scientific staff of
the Institution or its branches who are attending at their own expense.

Zoological Congress.—Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, Dr. Ch. Wardell
Stiles, and Dr. Herbert Haviland Field were designated to represent
the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum ahd were also
designated by the Department of State as delegates on the part of the
United States at the Ninth International Congress of Zoology at
Monaco, March 25 to 30, 1918.

Applied chemistry—The opening meeting of the Eighth Inter-
national Congress of Applied Chemistry was held in Washington on
September 4, 1912, with subsequent meetings in New York. Prof.
F. W. Clarke was designated to attend the congress as the representa-
tive of the Institution. The congress made the Secretary of the Insti-
tution one of its honorary vice presidents.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

Prehistoric anthropology.—Dr. Ale’ Hrdlitka, Dr. Charles Pea-
body, and Dr. George Grant MacCurdy were designated to represent
the Smithsonian Institution and the United States at the Fourteenth
International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archeology
at Geneva, September 9 to 15, 1912.

Hygiene and demography.—tThe Fifteenth International Congress
on Hygiene and Demography was held in Washington from Sep-
tember 23 to 28, 1912, under the auspices of the Government of the
United States, President William Howard Taft serving as honor-
ary president. Your secretary was a member of the local committee
on organization, and Mr. W. H. Holmes, of the National Museum,
served on the interdepartmental committee on exhibits.

Archeological Congress—The Third International Congress on
Archeology was held at Rome, October 9 to 16, 1912. Upon the
nomination of the Smithsonian Institution the Department of State
designated Prof. A. L. Frothingham, of Princeton, Prof. George M.
Whicher, secretary of the New York Society of the Archeological
Institute of America, and Mr. William H. Buckler, president of the
Baltimore Society of the Archeological Institute of America, as dele-
gates on the part of the United States at that congress.

Historical studies—Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, of the American
Historical Association, was designated to act as the representative of
the Smithsonian Institution at the International Congress of His-
torical Studies held in London, April 3 to 8, 1913, under the auspices
of the British Academy in cooperation with British universities,
learned societies, and institutions. .

Geological Congress.—Y our secretary, as a member of the Twelfth
International Congress of Geology, arranged to be at Toronto Au-
gust 7 to 14, 1913, and wassappointed to represent the Carnegie Insti-
tution of Washington and the Washington Academy at that congress.
Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology in the National Mu-
seum, was appointed a representative of the Smithsonian Institution.

Congress of Americdnists—Arrangements have been progressing
during the year in connection with the Nineteenth International
Congress of Americanists, which has been invited to meet in Wash-
ington in 1914, and Mr. W. H. Holmes, Mr. F. W. Hodge, and Dr.
AleS Hrdlitka have been appointed an auxiliary committee to rep-
resent the Smithsonian Institution in connection with, the prelimi-
nary details respecting the proposed meeting.

The State education building at Albany was dedicated October
16, 1912, on which occasion the secretary presented the formal con-
eratulations of the Smithsonian Institution, which is specially in-
terested in the city of Albany, for it was there that Joseph Henry,
first secretary of the institution, was born in the year 1799, and
there Henry began his researches and experiments in electricity
24. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

which in great measure made possible the wonderful electrical
achievements of the present day. ‘“ He married the intensity magnet
to the intensity battery, the quantity magnet to the quantity battery,
discovered the law by which their union was effected, and rendered
their divorce impossible.” The intensity magnet is that which is
to-day in use in every telegraph system. “ Henry’s oscillating ma-
chine was the forerunner of all our modern electrical motors. The
rotary motor of to-day is the direct outgrowth of his improvements
in magnets.”

National Academy of Sciences——The semicentennial meeting of
the National Academy of Sciences was held at the Smithsonian Insti-
tution April 22 to 24, 1913. The exercises included an address of
welcome by Dr. Ira Remsen, president of the academy, and addresses
on “The Relation of Science to the Higher Education in America,”
by President Arthur T. Hadley, of Yale University; “ International
Cooperation in Research,” by Dr. Arthur Schuster, of London; “The
Earth and Sun as Magnets,” by Dr. George E. Hale, of the Mount
Wilson Solar Observatory; and “The Structure of the Universe,”
by J. C. Kapteyn, of Groningen. At the White House, President
Woodrow Wilson and Dr. R. S. Woodward participated in the cere-
mony of the presentation of medals awarded by the academy. The
Watson medal was awarded to Prof. J. C. Kapteyn, the Draper
medal to M. Henri Deslandres, the Agassiz medal to Dr. Johan Hort,
and the Comstock prize to Prof. R. A. Millikan. There were vari-
ous social functions in connection with the meeting, including an
evening reception in the natural history building of the National
Museum. On the occasion of the meeting of the academy there was
published “A History of the First Half Century of the National
Academy of Sciences, 1869-1918,” prepared and edited by Dr. Fred-
erick W. True, assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Imperial Russian Museum.—On the occasion of the fiftieth jubilee
of the Imperial Moscow and Rumiantsef Museum your secretary
was elected an honorary member of that institution.

GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL BUILDING.

In the public buildings bill approved by the President on March 4,
1913, permission was granted to the George Washington Memorial
Association to erect a building on the square formerly occupied by
the Pennsylvania railway station in Washington. The preamble of
the original bill (S. 5494), as passed by the Senate April 15, 1912,
defined the objects of the Memorial Building as follows:

To provide a site for the erection of a building to be known as the George Wash-
ington Memorial Building, to serve as the gathering place and headquarters

of patriotic, scientific, medical, and other organizations interested in promot-
ing the welfare of the American people.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95

Whereas George Washington, on July ninth, seventeen hundred and ninety-nine,
said: “It has been my ardent wish to see a plan devised on a liberal scale
which would spread systematic ideas through all parts of this rising Empire,”
and it was Washington’s wish to materially assist in the development of his
beloved country through the promotion of science, literature, and art, and
with the firm conviction that “ knowledge is the surest basis of public happi-
ness”; and

Whereas the changing conditions that time has brought require new methods of
accomplishing the results desired by Washington and now a necessity of the
American people; and

Whereas at the present time there is not any suitable building in the city of
Washington where large conventions or in which large public functions can
be heid, or where the permanent headquarters and records of national organi-
zations can be administered; and

Whereas a building should be provided in which there shall be a large audi-
torium, halls of different sizes where all societies pertaining to the growth of
our best interests can meet, and such as it is deemed desirable may have per-
manent headquarters; and

Whereas the George Washington Memorial Association is now engaged in ob-
taining funds for the erection and endowment of a building suitable for the
purposes above set forth, to be known as the George Washington Memorial
Building: Therefore * * *

The law as passed by Congress and approved by the President
March 4, 1913, was as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled:

* * So * * * *

Src. 10. That a building is hereby authorized to be erected in the District of
Columbia, to be known as the George Washington Memorial Building.

The control and administration of said building, when erected, shall be in the
Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

The George Washington Memorial Association is authorized to erect said
building in accordance with plans to be procured by said association and to be
approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, said building to be fireproof, faced
with granite, and to cost not less than $2,000,000; it shall have an auditorium
that will seat not less than six thousand people, and such other smaller halls,
reception rooms, office rooms, and so forth, as may be deemed necessary to
carry out the purposes for which the building is erected. And the said George
Washington Memorial Association shall in addition provide a permanent endow-
ment fund of not less than $500,000, to be administered by the Board of Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution, the income from which shall, as far as necessary,
be used for the maintenance of the said building.

Permission is granted the George Washington Memorial Association to erect
said building in the north end of the reservation known as Armory Square,
bounded by Sixth and Seventh Streets west and B Street north and B Street
south. The south front of said building is to be on a line with the south front
of the new National Museum Building, in the north end of the Smithsonian
Park; and the said land is hereby set apart for that purpose: Provided, That
the actual construction of said building shall not be undertaken until the sum
of $1,000,000 shall have been subscribed and paid into the treasury of the George
Washington Memorial Association: And provided further, That the erection of
said George Washington Memorial Building be begun within a period of two
years from and after the passage of this act, and this section shall be null and

~
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

void should the George Washington Memorial Association fail to comply with
the provisions thereof which are conditions precedent to the authorization herein
granted. :

Said building may, among other purposes, be used for inaugural receptions
and special public meetings authorized by Congress.

Congress may alter, amend, add to, or repeal any of the provisions of this
section.

The need in Washington of such a structure as here authorized has
been urged on many occasions in public meetings throughout the
country. The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have.expressed
their willingness to administer it when completed. It will be a gath-
ing place and headquarters for patriotic, scientific, medical, and other
organizations interested in promoting the welfare of the American
people and the development of the country in science, literature,
and art. ;

Plans for the building are being made, and it is hoped that the
work of construction will begin within the time limit set by the law.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The operations of the National Museum are discussed with such
detail by Assistant Secretary Rathbun in the appendix to the present
report that I need here refer only to some of the more important
features of the year.

The completion of the natural history building, with its spacious
well-lighted halls, has made it feasible to vastly improve the extensive
exhibits of the departments of anthropology, biology, and geology
installed therein; while objects pertaining to the industrial arts and
to American history are now given ample exhibition room in the
older building.

Tn the zoological halls of the new building are exhibited a number
of groups of animals which are noteworthy examples of the art of
taxidermy, some of these groups being made up of specimens received
from the Smithsonian African expedition under Col. Roosevelt.
And likewise in the halls devoted to anthropological exhibits are
shown a number of racial groups of mankind, including several
representing Indians of various tribes engaged in their native games
and mechanical occupations, which seem particularly attractive to
visitors.

The department of arts and industries for many years had been
checked in its development by what seemed to.be the more urgent
demand for space for natural history exhibits. Many large and
interesting collections illustrative of the industrial arts, acquired
by the Museum during the last 30 years, had therefore necessarily
been held in storage, but the transfer of objects of natural history
to the new building has now released large halls for the installation
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 4

of instructive collections pertaining to art textiles, silk, wool, and
cotton manufactures, to arms and armor, ceramics, mineral tech-
nology, and to some other general manufacturing industries, in-
cluding an exposition of the processes and of the raw materials and
finished products.

The responses received from requests for objects desired to com-
plete particular series in this department are very gratifying and
indicate a public interest in its still broader development. The
educational character of these exhibits, and, in fact, of all objects
displayed in the National Museum, is kept constantly in mind.
Thus, a small number of specimens or objects well arranged is found
to be far better than a large display where the educational feature
is overshadowed by what may be termed a picturesque method of
installation. The style of cases, the color of the background, and
many other details must be carefully studied and worked out with
a view to proper harmony in every respect.

There has been added to the Museum collections an approximate
total of 302,133 specimens and objects, as compared with 238,000
during the year preceding. The accessions included 140,015 botani-
eal, 113,509 zoological, and 14,716 paleontological specimens, besides
a number of paintings, art textiles, useful plant products, and objects
illustrative of American history.

In geographical range the accessions covered practically the
entire world, ethnological, archeological, biological, and geological
objects being received from all parts of North and South America,
from Alaska, Siberia, China, Oceanica, Dutch East Indies, Africa,
and other lands, the results in large measure of explorations under-
taken by the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum either
directly or in cooperation with private individuals or Government
departments. Among individuals who have thus served the Museum
during the year, some of whom I have already mentioned, were Mr.
Childs Frick, who made collections, especially of birds, in Africa;
Dr. Theodore Lyman, who hunted animals in the Altai Mountains in
Asia; Dr. W. L. Abbott, who continued his collecting work in Kash-
mir and generously provided for field work in Borneo; Mr. D. D.
Streeter, jr., who explored the interior of Borneo; Mr. George Mix-
ter, who visited Lake Baikal in Siberia; and Mr. Copley Amory, jr.,
who made collections of mammals and of fossil species in Alaska.

One of the interesting additions to the mammal division was a
mounted specimen and skeleton of the rare okapi of Africa. Sev-
eral noteworthy collections of fossil invertebrates were also received,
and among accessions of vertebrate remains were a large series of
mammals from the Fort Union beds of Montana, and many genera
and species from recently uncovered Pleistocene cave deposits in
Maryland; also a series of bones from the Yukon territory containing
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

the first evidence of the former extension of the range of the camel
beyond the Arctic Circle.

The most important permanent addition to the division of history
was the gift by Mr. Eben Appleton of the “ Star Spangled Banner,”
which he had allowed to be exhibited as a loan since 1907. This great
flag, about 30 feet square, is the one that waved over Fort McHenry
in September, 1814, and inspired Francis Scott Key to write the
national anthem.

The division of physical anthropology has received several large
and valuable accessions of skeletal remains during recent years, one
of the most important recent additions being obtained in Mongolia,
where the curator was engaged in studies to discover the probable
origin of the American Indians.

The National Gallery of Art was enriched by the gift of 12 paint-
ings, 7 of them presented by Mr. William T. Evans, and by 18 paint-
ings and 2 marble sculptures received as loans from friends of the
Gallery. é

It has been the custom for many years to distribute to schools and
colleges for teaching purposes, or to exchange with other institu-
tions, such duplicate natural history specimens as are no longer
needed for scientific study by the Museum staff. During the past
year about 30,000 specimens were thus utilized for educational pur-
poses or to secure new material for the Museum.

The number of visitors to the new building during the year was
961,636 on week days and 58,170 on Sundays, the largest attendance
being 13,236 on March 5, the day following the inauguration of the
President.

The publications issued by the Museum included about 100 papers
from the Proceedings and a number of Contributions from the
National Herbarium, besides two completed volumes of Proceedings
and two Bulletins. The total distribution of earlier and current
publications was 71,600 copies.

Mention is made on another page of the fitting up of rooms in the
new building for the accommodation of such portions of the Mu-
seum library as pertain chiefly to natural history subjects, books on
other topics being retained in the older buildings. The total con-
tents of the library at the close of the year was 43,692 volumes and
72,042 papers of all kinds.

Meetings of various scientific organizations were held in the Mu-
seum auditorium and adjacent rooms, and there were several formal
receptions which* are noted in the report of the assistant secretary.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Ethnological researches have been continued in accordance with
law, among the American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, includ-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

ing the excavation and preservation of archeological remains. The
systematic researches carried on by eight ethnologists of the regular
staff and by specialists not officially connected with the bureau
covered a wide range of field work and office studies, which are
described in such detail in the appendix by the ethnologist-in-charge,
that I need here to review but briefly some of the most important
activities of the year. For the preparation of a memoir on The
Culture History of the Aborigines of the Lesser Antilles, Dr. Fewkes
visited Trinidad, Barbados, St. Vincent, and other islands of the
West Indies, where he made extensive excavations of shell-heaps,
particularly in Trinidad and St. Vincent, yielding very interesting
collections of pottery and other objects, and carried on archeologic
studies which proved to be especially important in throwing lght
on the material culture of the former aborigines of the coast adjacent
to South America.

Studies were continued in the itivestigation of Indian population,
a research covering the whole period from the first occupancy of the
country by white peoplé to the present time, and including the entire
territory from the Rio Grande to the Arctic Ocean. A monograph
in preparation on this subject includes chapters on notable epidemics,
vital statistics, and race admixture.

Further interesting studies were made in New Mexico in prepara-
tion of a memoir on the philosophy, anthropic worship and ritual,
zoic worship, social customs, material culture, and history of that
interesting and conservative Pueblo people known as the Tewa
Indians.

A large amount of additional material was also obtained concern-
ing the languages, myths, and legends of the Fox Indians and other
Algonquian tribes, and on the ceremonies and rituals of the Osage
and Pawnee Indians.

Progress has been made in the preparation of the Handbook of
American Indian Languages and the Handbook of American Arche-
ology. There is also in preparation a Handbook of Aboriginal Re-
mains East of the Mississippi.

Some of the results of investigations conducted by the bureau in
cooperation with the School of American Archeology are described
in three memoirs, now published or ready for publication, on The
Physiography of the Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico, in Relation
to Pueblo Culture, The Ethnobotany of the Tewa Indians, and
the Ethnozoology of the Tewa Indians, and there is also in process
of completion in this connection a manuscript entitled “ An Intro-
duction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs.”

The Handbook of American Indians, completed by the bureau
a few years ago, has increased the popular interest in our aborigines
to such an extent that the bureau is considering the feasibility of
issuing a series of treatises devoted to the Indians of the respective
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

States, and as a beginning for such a series there is in preparation a
Handbook of the Indians of California.

Among the publications issued during the year may be mentioned
the Twenty-eighth Annual Report; a reprint of the Handbook of
American Indians North of Mexico, ordered by resolution of Con-
gress; a bulletin on Early Man in South America; portions of Part
2 of the Handbook of American Indian Languages; and a bulletin on
Chippewa Music.

The scope of the work undertaken by the bureau is necessarily
limited by the funds available. Among investigations that are
specially desirable to extend may be mentioned the exploration and
preservation of antiquities, including the cliff dwellings in the arid
region; ethnological researches in Alaska; the extension of ethnologi-
cal investigations among the tribes of the Mississippi drainage; and
excavation and study of archeological remains in the South and West.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The work of the International Exchange Service shows a steady
gain from year to year. During the last 15 years the weight of
matter handled has increased from 317,883 pounds in 1898 to 593,969
pounds in 1918, and the total number of packages has increased dur-
ing that period from 84,208 in 1898 to 338,621 in 1913. As compared
with the year 1908, 66 per cent more packages were handled in 1913
and 678 more boxes were dispatched, but by practicing various econ-
omies and improving methods the increased work has been accom-
plished without an increase in the annual appropriation.

In addition to the international exchange of publications between
Governments and institutions of learning, the service has from time
to time been called upon by foreign Governments and societies to se-
cure information on particular subjects. To answer such inquiries
has sometimes required much correspondence. Thus, in a recent in-
stance, the minister of public works and mines in a distant country
sought information through the Department of State on laws and
regulations with respect to the boring, mining, and storage of petro-
leum in the United States, a class of data which the Smithsonian In-
stitution was able to obtain only by writing to the principal States
concerned in that industry.

In order to simplify the shipment of exchanges to the Union of
South Africa arrangements have been made whereby packages are
now shipped in bulk to the Government Printing Works at Pretoria
for distribution -instead of being sent to miscellaneous addresses in
the various provinces of the Union. This method will effect a saving
to the Institution in freight charges and improve the service with
South Africa. A similar method would be very advantageous with
the Commonwealth of Australia and is now under consideration by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

the Australian House of Representatives and the chairman of the
library committee of that country.

In Egypt there has been organized the Government publications
department at Cairo, to which consignments for distribution there
are now being forwarded. In Mexico a service of exchanges has been
established in the department of public works.

Full sets or partial sets of United States official documents are now
sent to 92 foreign depositories, the Province of Bombay, the Cor-
poration of Glasgow, Finland, British Guiana, the Free City of
Lubeck, and the Province of Madras having been added to the list
during the year. There has also been carried on since 1909, through
the Exchange Service, an interparliamentary exchange of official
journals with legislative chambers agreeing thereto, 100 copies of
the daily issue of the Congressional Record being provided for that
purpose. Thirty-two countries have so far agreed to this exchange
of their official journals.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The National Zoological Park was established by act of Congress
in 1890 “for the advancement of science and the instruction and
recreation of the people.” It was the outgrowth of a small collec-
tion of living animals which for several years had been assembled
in low sheds and small paddocks adjacent to the Smithsonian build-
ing, where they were kept primarily for scientific study, though they
were likewise a constant source of interest to the public. There was
at once a rapid increase in the size of this collection when the ani-
mals were removed to the spacious grounds provided for them in the
beautiful Rock Creek Valley, and it is evident from its increasing
popularity during the last 23 years that the establishment of this
great zoological park has been regarded as a wise investment of
public funds.

The popular interest in the park has continued to be very great.
On Sundays and holidays the walks and buildings are crowded.
During the past year the number of visitors was 633,526, and the
daily average in the month of March, 1913, was 3,900. One hundred
and forty-two classes, schools, etc, numbering 5,579 pupils, visited
the park during the year with the definite purpose of studying the
animals.

The interests of science have also been primary objects of atten-
tion in the administration of the park. A number of species of
American animals which were rapidly becoming extinct are here pre-
served in appropriate natural surroundings. In a recent report I
called attention to a much needed improvement that should be made
in the erection and equipment of a laboratory and hospital in the park
Spe ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

whereby the welfare of the animals could be more thoroughly
guarded, and where investigations of a zoological nature could be
prosecuted for the increase of practical and scientific knowledge.

The number of animals of all kinds in the park collections on
June 30, 1913, was 1,468, representing 154 species of mammals, 202
species of birds, and 31 species of reptiles, which are enumerated in
detail on another page in the report of the superintendent. The im-
portant additions during the year included a pair of young African
elephants, three dromedaries, a pair of cheetahs, several species of
gazelles, and other animals from the Government Zoological Garden
at Giza, Egypt; 7 ostriches from southern California; and 2 moose,
a male and a female, from the Rocky Mountains National Park in
Alberta.

Among the improvements completed in the park during the year
was an outdoor parrot cage constructed through the generosity of
Mr. John B. Henderson, jr., one of the regents of the Institution. An
inclosure was also built for the ostriches recently received and one
for the wood ducks and related species. Mention should also be made
of the erection of a stone building, 24 by 40 feet, equipped for the -
cooking of food for the animals by boiling or baking, and also for
cold storage. The building is abundantly lighted and thoroughly
sanitary, and is a great improvement over the inadequate quarters
heretofore used for food preparation.

An appropriation of $20,000 was included in the sundry civil act
for 1913 for the construction of a stone-faced or bowlder bridge
across Rock Creek to replace the log bridge erected in 1896 on the
line of the roadway from Adams Mill Road. A contract for the
construction of the new bridge was entered into on May 29, 1913,
and work was begun soon after the close of the fiscal year. The
bridge will be 80 feet in span and about 40 feet wide. It will be built
of reenforced concrete faced with rough blocks of the blue gneiss
found in this region, the stone for the concrete being obtained in the
park.

In the sundry civil act for the fiscal year 1914 provision is made for
the purchase of about 103 acres of land to extend the west boundary
of the park to Connecticut Avenue. The acquisition of this land has
been urged for several years as a much-needed addition to the area of
the Zoological Park.

THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The Astrophysical Observatory continued during the past year
the important investigations begun during the administration of the
late Secretary Langley to determine the solar constant of radiation
and the variability of the sun. In his account of the operations of
the observatory on another page of this report Director Abbot dis-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ao

cusses the results of these researches up to the present time and con-
cludes that the observations at Bassour, Algeria, taken in connection
with those made simultaneously at Mount Wilson, Cal., have estab-
lished the variability of the sun. He concludes also that a variability
connected with the sun-spot cycle has been shown.

Observations were also made to determine the effects of volcanic
eruptions on climate. Soon after the eruption of Mount Katmai,
Alaska, in June, 1912, the presence of dust in the upper air from this
voleano was indicated both in California and in Algeria, and in
August the direct radiation of the sun was found to be reduced about
20 per cent by the interposition of the dust cloud. Mr. Abbot and
Mr. Fowle discuss the results of their observations and the general
subject of “ Volcanoes and Climate” in a paper in the Smithsonian
Miscellaneous Collections. They conclude that a combination of
the effects of sun spots and volcanic haze accounts for all the prin-
cipal irregularities in the temperature of the earth for the last 30
years.

In connection with observations on nocturnal radiation it became
necessary to determine the temperature and humidity prevailing
above certain stations. This was accomplished with the cooperation
of the United States Weather Bureau through the use of sounding
balloons and captive balloons carrying to high altitudes self-record-
ing apparatus for measuring the temperature, pressure, and
humidity of the air.

There was completed during the year volume III of the Annals
of the Astrophysical Observatory, recording the work accomplished
from 1907 to 1913.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE.

There is administered by the Smithsonian Institution through a
small annual appropriation by Congress, the United States Bureau
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature. This is
one of the 33 regional bureaus whose function it is to collect, index,
and classify all scientific publications of the year in each country and
to send the classified references to the central bureau in London,
where, since 1901, they have been collated and published in a series
of 17 annual volumes which form an index to current scientific
literature.

The catalogue is not of a commercial character, but by economical
methods of administration, and partly through the revenue obtained
from subscriptions to the series of volumes, it is hoped that the
enterprise will be self-supporting with the exception of the general
expenses of the regional bureaus in gathering the data.

44863°—sM 1913——3
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

The United States bureau sent to the central bureau during the
past year 27,995 cards, making a total of 290,330 cards forwarded
from this country since the work was begun in 1901. The total num-
ber of classified citations received at the central bureau in London
from 1901 to 1913 was about 2,500,000.

Although the congressional appropriation for the bureau is in-
tended primarily for maintaining a purely scientific international
enterprise, yet, without added expense, the bureau is of value to the
public as a source of general information on many scientific subjects.
The Smithsonian Institution is in constant receipt of requests for in-
formation on a very great variety of topics, and since it is the pur-
pose of the International Catalogue to collect and classify the pub-
lished results of scientific investigation many of these inquiries. are
referred for reply to this bureau.

NECROLOGY.

JAMES SCHOOLCRAFT SHERMAN.

At the annual meeting of the Regents on December 12, 1912, the
following resolutions were adopted to the memory of Vice President
Sherman:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution have received the
sad intelligence of the death on October 30, 1912, of James Schoolcraft Sher-
man, Vice President of the United States and Chancellor of the Institution,,
therefore, be it
Resolved, That in the passing away of this distinguished official the country

bas lost a man whose unsullied public career and blameless private life marked.

him as one of the best exemplars of the highest type of American patriotism

and citizenship; while this Institution has been deprived of the association of a

Regent and presiding officer whose loyalty to its purposes and zeal in its interests

have been an inspiration to his colleagues.

Resolved, That we tender to the family of Mr. Sherman our respectful and
sincere sympathy in their great bereavement,

Resolved, That an engrossed copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the
family of the late chancellor.

James Schoolcraft Sherman, LL.D., born in Utica, N. Y., October
24, 1855, became a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution upon taking
the oath of office as Vice President of the United States on March 4,
1909, and was elected Chancellor of the Institution on December 8,
1910, as successor to Chancellor Melville Weston Fuller, Chief Justice
of the United States, who died July 4, 1910. Mr. Sherman received
the degree of LL.B. from Hamilton College in 1878 and LL.D. in
1903. He was admitted to the bar in 1880 and practiced his profes-
sion at Utica; was mayor of Utica, 1884-85; Member of Congress,
1887 to 1891 and 1893 to 1909, and was elected Vice President Novem-
ber 3, 1908. He had been trustee of Hamilton College since 1905,
and held important positions of trust in his native city.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

JOHN BROOKS HENDERSON.

At a special meeting of the Regents on May 1, 1913, a resolution
was adopted in memory of the Hon. John B. Henderson, who served
as a Regent from January 26, 1892, to March 1, 1911, when he felt
obliged to retire from active duties on account of failing health. His
sound judgment and wise counsel as chairman of the executive com-
mittee and as member of the permanent committee had been of great
assistance to the board throughout his long term of service. Mr.
Henderson was born near Danville, Va., on November 26, 1826, and
died at Takoma Park, District of Columbia, on April 12, 1918. He
was United States Senator from Missouri from 1862 to 1869, and
filled many other honorable positions during earlier and later periods
of his life. He had been a resident of Washington City since 1890.

Respectfully submitted.

Cartes D. Watcort, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States National Museum for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1913:

IMPORTANT MATTERS OF THE YEAR.

Although many important matters developed, as usual, in con-
nection with the operations of the Museum during last year, those
of chief general interest related to the exhibition collections in the
new building and to the progress of work in the department of arts
and industries. As explained in the last report, only the first and
second stories of the new building, with an aggregate floor area of
185,294 square feet, are being utilized at present for the permanent
installations, which, with a single exception, relate wholly to natural
history. The last of this space was opened to the public during
April, 1913, but to a certain extent the exhibits still remain incom-
plete and the arrangements provisional. The plan of three wings
particularly adapts this building to the three departments of anthro-
pology, biology, and geology, representing the organization of the
natural history collections, each of which has been allotted an entire
wing for its exhibition series, the overflow from each being continued
into the adjacent ranges.

Of the several branches which are administered in the department
of anthropology, three have been established in the new building as
constituting what is now commonly recognized in museum classifica-
tion as one of the great divisions of natural history. They are
physical anthropology, ethnology, and archeology. Physical anthro-
pology is not yet represented in the public halls, though an important
installation of a technical character has been provided in the labora-
tory. Each of the other subjects, however, has been extensively illus-
trated on a popular though none the less instructive basis, to which
purpose a total floor area of 65,941 square feet has been assigned.
Ethnology occupies the entire available space allotted to the depart-
ment in the first story, namely, the northern section of both ranges,
and all parts of the north wing surrounding the picture gallery,
which is temporary in its location here. The total area covered is
35,474 square feet. The arrangement is geographical, and the ex-

36
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. St

hibits find their key in family groups placed centrally in the halls.
The archeological collections are displayed in the second story, the
Old World series, both historic and prehistoric, occupying the eastern
side and northern end of the wing to the extent of about 7,927 square
feet, and the New World series the eastern side of the wing and
the entire east range, with a floor area of 22,540 square feet. The
exhibition of North American archeology is especially full and
important.

The classification of the biological exhibits, at present restricted
to zoology, comprises five principal and several minor subdivisions,
of which the most extensive consists of a comprehensive representa-
tion of all the main groups of animals, each arranged faunally.
Next follow a systematic series, a series illustrating comparative
anatomy and osteology which is practically subsidiary to it, a series
of domestic animals, and a faunal series for the District of Columbia.
These are supplemented by a number of special exhibits illustrating
interesting phases in zoology and noteworthy features of the collec-
tion. The entire amount of space assigned to the department is
64,398 square feet, of which the faunally arranged exhibit utilizes
41,058 square feet. The mammals in this collection occupy the first
floor of the west wing, with the exception of a small area in which
the series of birds begins, the latter extending thence through the
western section of the west range; while the reptiles, batrachians,
fishes, and invertebrates are installed in the second story of the wing.
On the northern side of the wing is the collection of comparative
anatomy and osteology, followed successively in the west range by
the systematic series, the domestic animals, and the faunal exhibit
of the District of Columbia, the special exhibits being provided for
in alcoves on the court side of the range.

The geological exhibits are classified under four subjects, namely,
systematic or physical and chemical geology, applied geology, min-
eralogy and paleontology. Besides the east wing, of which they have
entire possession, they occupy only the eastern section of the adjoin-
ing range in the first story, the combined area amounting to 47,691
square feet. Systematic geology is displayed in the range, while
applied geology, including the most complete series of building and
ornamental stones in the country, and mineralogy, with the begin-
nings of an excellent representation of gems and precious stones,
are accommodated in the second story of the wing. In the lower
story, which is wholly devoted to paleontology, the fossil vertebrates,
with many skillfully prepared remains of extinct animals and several
large and striking skeletons, occupy the large sky-lighted hall and
eastern end of the wing, the fossil invertebrates the southern side of
the wing, and the fossil plants the northern side.
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

In the matter of reorganizing the several industrial collections
which were long ago displaced through the overcrowding of the
older buildings in which they are now being rearranged, excellent
progress was made despite the limited means available. The division
of mineral technology, which had been nominally recognized for
several years and for which a large amount of valuable material
has been held in storage, was actively established, but not until late
in the year. In the division of textiles, in which the work was
started over a year earlier, the results accomplished have been suffi-
cient to very materially attract public notice. The old collection,
including also certain animal and vegetable products, was first un-
packed, and, although much of it had so greatly deteriorated as to
be rendered useless, there fFemained an excellent nucleus to build
upon, the material being chiefly serviceable for its bearing, on the
history and development of the subjects represented. It was exten-
sively drawn upon in preparing a preliminary exhibition series,
which was practically completed before the close of the fiscal year
1912. During last year there was marked activity in the acquisition
of new material, in the extension of the exhibition collections, and
in the general work of the division. Many of the leading manu-
tacturers were advised with, and their cordial approval of the plans
and the substantial support they have already given the Museum
insures beyond question the building up of a thoroughly practical
representation of the textile and allied industries. The accessions of
the year covered a wide range of materials and manufacture, and
included raw materials, intermediate stages, and finished products,
as well as illustrations of various processes. They were almost
wholly from American sources, among the exceptions being an in-
structive exhibit of the woolen industry of Bradford, England, and
another of native Filipino handicraft in the making of mats, baskets,
hats, fabrics, and other useful articles. In lines other than textiles
the additions related mainly to the utilization of rubber, and included
many testimonials to Charles Goodyear, whose name is indissolubly
connected with the origin and early advancement of this important
industry. The installation of textiles kept pace with the receipt of
materials, and by the close of the year a very notable and attractive
exhibition had been assembled, mainly in the south hall of the older
building.

COLLECTIONS.

The total number of specimens acquired during the year was ap-
proximately 302,182, of which 26,999 pertained to the several sub-
jects covered by the department of anthropology; 113,509 were
zoological, 140,015 botanical, 5,569 geological, and 14,716 paleonto-
logical; while 12 were paintings for the National Gallery of Art, and
1,312 were textiles and useful plant products for the department of

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

arts and industries. Several important loans for exhibition, consist-
ing mainly of historical and ethnological objects and paintings, were
also received.

The additions in ethnology came mainly from the Philippine
Islands and other parts of the Far East, from Paraguay and Dutch
Guiana, and from the middle and western United States. Maine,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky were chiefly rep-
resented in the contributions to prehistoric archeology, while Egyp-
tian and Greco-Roman antiquities and small lots of materials from
various European localities composed the principal acquisitions in
historic archeology. The division of physical anthropology received
valuable accessions, mainly of skeletal remains, from many sources,
the most noteworthy consisting of a large collection made by the
curator in Mongolia. In the division of mechanical technology the
most extensive additions were to the section of firearms and other
weapons, and included several early and rare pieces; while in the
division of graphic arts they were illustrative of recent methods of
pictorial reproduction. Most prominently to be noted in connection
with the division of history was the gift by Mr. Eben Appleton of
“The Star Spangled Banner,” which had been exhibited as a loan
since 1907. This witness of the gallant defense of Fort McHenry
during its unsuccessful bombardment by the British fleet on Sep-
tember 13 and 14, 1814, immortalized by the stirring verses of Francis
Scott Key, has been accorded a conspicuous place of honor in the
principal hall of history. Among other notable acquisitions were
memorials of the Washburn family and of Generals U. S. Grant and
Frederick D. Grant; a bronze cannon, with its wooden carriage,
brought to America by General Lafayette and used in the Revolution ;
over 21,000 postage stamps and postal cards, added to the large collec-
tion from the Post Office Department; the 7%¢anic memorial gold
medal issued by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission; and, as a
loan, the collection of historical china assembled by the late Rear
Admiral F. W. Dickins, United States Navy, consisting of about 500
pieces, and including a large number of fine examples of presidential
china from the administration of Washington to that of Benjamin
Harrison.

For some of its most important acquisitions the department of
biology was indebted to several expeditions to distant regions, con-
ducted at private expense. The most extensive of these, undertaken by
Mr. Childs Frick, who was accompanied by Dr. E. A. Mearns, United
States Army (retired), and others, visited Abyssinia and British
East Africa, and was absent from January to September, 1912. —
The birds obtained, numbering over 5,000, have been deposited in
the Museum. On a hunting trip to the region of the Altai Moun-
tains, in Asia, Dr. Theodore Lyman, of Harvard University, with
40 ' ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

the assistance of Mr. N. Hollister, of the Museum staff, secured about
650 specimens of mammals and birds, which have been shared be-
tween the Museum of Comparative Zoology and the National Mu-
seum. Dr. W. L. Abbott, who continued his collecting work in
Kashmir, also maintained a naturalist in Borneo to extend the field
work which he had so effectively carried on for several years. From
the former region a large number of small mammals were received
during the year, and from the latter many specimens of mammals,
birds, and reptiles. Mr. Arthur de C. Sowerby transmitted mam-
mals and reptiles from China; Mr. D. D. Streeter, jr., collected
mammals and reptiles in Borneo; Mr. George Mixter visited Lake
Baikal, Siberia, and its vicinity, securing specimens of the native
bear, of the seal peculiar to the lake, and of a number of small
mammals; and Mr. Copley Amory, jr., joining a Coast Survey party
in Alaska, obtained many mammals, including several caribou and
an interesting series of bones of fossil species. Mr. A. C. Bent in
the course of investigations in Newfoundland and Labrador made
collections of birds, and Dr. Paul Bartsch and Dr. T. Wayland
Vaughan, as guests on the Carnegie steamer Anton Dohrn, collected
marine invertebrates among the Florida Keys, as did also Mr. John
B. Henderson, jr., by means of dredgings from his yacht Holts. Mr.
Paul G. Russell, of the division of plants, who accompanied an ex-
pedition of the Carnegie Institution to the West Indies, secured for
the Museum several thousand botanical specimens.

The division of mammals was fortunate in obtaining an excep-
tionally fine mounted specimen and skeleton of the rare okapi from
the Kongo region of Africa. The principal accessions of fishes and
marine invertebrates were from explorations by the Bureau of Fish-
eries in various parts of the Pacific Ocean, consisting mainly of col-
lections that had been studied and described. Among fishes were
the types of 110 new species, while the marine invertebrates included
extensive series of crustaceans and echinoderms, besides ascidians
and plankton material from the Atlantic coast. Mollusks were re-
ceived from various localities in North America and from the Ba-
hama Islands, Venezuela, South Australia, and the Dutch East
Indies. Of insects over 37,000 specimens were acquired, including
15,000 forest insects from West Virginia, valuable material from
India and Great Britain, and about 10,000 well-prepared beetles
from the District of Columbia, which are intended to be used in
connection with the exhibition series of the local fauna. The division
of plants was enriched to the extent of 140,000 specimens. The prin-
cipal addition consisted of some 80,000 specimens of grasses, trans-
' ferred by the Department of Agriculture, which, with 12,800 speci-
mens purchased during the year and the material previously in the
herbarium, places the Museum in possession of the largest and most

comprehensive collection of grasses in this country. Other impor-
tant accessions were the Wooton collection of 10,000 plants mostly
from New Mexico, about 10,000 West Indian plants, a valuable series
from British Guiana, and the C. Henry Kain collection of diatoms,
one of the finest in the world, and supposed to be the largest in the
United States.

The more important additions to the department of geology were
illustrative of published results of investigations by the Geological
Survey, comprising rocks, ores, and minerals from some of the
Western States, and fossils from the middle Devonian of New
York, the early Devonian and Silurian of Maine, and the Ordovician
of Tennessee. Other noteworthy collections of fossil invertebrates
received were from the Silurian and Devonian of the Detroit River
region, the Silurian of Ohio, and the Tertiary of the Panama Canal
Zone, while of vertebrate remains the accessions included a large
series of mammals from the Fort Union beds of Montana, many
genera and species from recently uncovered Pleistocene cave deposits
in Maryland, and a small but interesting series of bones from the
Yukon territory containing the first evidence of the former extension
of the range of the camel on this continent beyond the Arctic Circle.
The Geological Survey transmitted a large collection of Cretaceous
and Tertiary plants from Colorado and New Mexico, containing 271
type and illustrated specimens. Large collections of Cambrian fos-
sils were made by Secretary Walcott in British Columbia and Alberta
in connection with his geological work in the Canadian Rockies.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

The permanent additions to the Gallery consisted of 12 paintings,
10 of which were gifts and 2 bequests. Of the former, 7 were re-
ceived from Mr. William T. Evans as contributions to his notable
collection of the work of contemporary American painters and are
as follows: “'The Meadow Brook,” by Charles Paul Gruppe; “ The
Mourning Brave,’ by Edwin W. Deming; “The Fur Muff,” by
Robert David Gauley; “ Water Lilies,” by Walter Shirlaw; “ Castle
Creek Canyon, South Dakota,” by Frank De Haven; and “ Christ
before Pilate” and “Suffer the Little Children to Come unto Me,”
by Otto W. Beck, the last two being pastels. The other gifts were
“Twilight after Rain,” by Norwood H. MacGilvary, presented by
Mr. Frederic F. Sherman in memory of Eloise Lee Sherman; “ The
Wreck,” by Harrington Fitzgerald, donated by the artist; and “ The
Lace Maker,” after Terburg, contributed by Miss Julia H. Chadwick.
The bequests consisted of the “ Tomb of ‘ Mahomet the Gentleman’
at Broussa,” by Hamdy Bey, from Mrs. Elizabeth C. Hobson; and a
portrait from the widow of the late Col. Albert B. Brackett, United
States Army, by G. P. A. Healy. The additions to the loan collec-
49 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

tion comprised 18 paintings and 2 marble sculptures received from
12 friends of the Gallery.

ART TEXTILES.

The lace exhibit now embraces a fairly connected series both in
respect to the varieties of laces and the development of the industry,
and it also contains some important examples which from their
quality and rarity form striking museum pieces. Though smaller
and less conspicuous in the matter of display material than some
others, it ranks high among the museum collections of the country.
The work during the year was mainly in the direction of securing
a more systematic arrangement of the collection and of more fully
labeling both specimens and cases. The collection at present consists
chiefly of loans, which have increased in number from year to year,
with the expectation of soon making the collection more permanent in

character.
MISCELLANEOUS.

Duplicate specimens to the number of about 7,300 were distributed
to schools and colleges for teaching purposes, the subjects represented
being mainly fishes, insects, marine invertebrates, rocks, ores, min-
erals, and fossils. Some 1,500 pounds of material suitable for blow-
pipe and assay work by students was also similarly disposed of.
Over 21,000 duplicates were used in making exchanges, about 85
per cent of this number being plants. Two hundred and six lots of
specimens were sent to specialists for working up both on behalf
of the Museum and in the interest of the advancement of researches
by other institutions. They comprised over 12,700 individual speci-
mens, besides several hundred packages of unassorted material,
principally of animals, plants, and fossils.

The aggregate number of visitors to the new building on week
days during the year was 261,636, a daily average of 836, and on
Sundays 58,170, a daily average of 1,118. The attendance at the
older Museum building was 173,858, and at the Smithsonian build-
ing 142,420, these figures representing a daily average of 555 for
the former and of 455 for the latter. During inaugural week in
March, 1913, the daily average for the new building was increased
to 5 395 persons, the largest attendance for any aaiie day having
bash: 13,236 on March 5

The on ae Lele of Bulletins 79 and 81 and volumes 42_
and 48 of the Proceedings, besides 105 papers issued in separate
form, of which 96 belonged to the series of Proceedings and 9 to the
Contributions from the National Herbarium. Thirty-five papers on
Museum subjects, mainly descriptive of new additions to the collec-
tions, were also published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions. The number of copies of Museum publications distributed,
including earlier issues as well as those of the year, was about 71,600.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

The furnishing of the library quarters in the new building was
completed early in the autumn of 1912, and the transfer of the books
and equipment intended to be kept there was soon afterwards accom-
plished. While designed primarily to accommodate the natural
history and anthropological publications, which comprise the major
part of the collection, this has also been constituted the main or
central library, where most of the general works of reference will be
placed and where all publications will be received and catalogued.
The library in the older building will hereafter be mainly restricted
to the subjects of history and the arts and industries. The accessions
of the year consisted of 1,690 books, 2,213 pamphlets, and 159 parts
of volumes, which increased the total contents of the library to
43,692 volumes and 72,042 unbound papers of all kinds.

The facilities afforded by the new building for meetings and other
functions were frequently availed of. The auditorium and committee
rooms were used for the regular meetings of the Anthropological
Society of Washington, the Washington Society of the Fine Arts, and
the Spanish-American Atheneum, and for a course of iectures under
the Naval War College Extension. The annual meeting and semicen-
tennial anniversary of the National Academy of Sciences were held
in April. Of congresses and other assemblages which were accommo-
dated wholly or in part in the building were the Fifteenth Interna-
tional Congress on Hygiene and Demography; the Ninth Triennial
Congress of American Physicians and Surgeons; a joint meeting of
the American Philological Association, the Archaeological Institute
of America, and the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis; a
meeting of the American Farm-Management Association; the Twen-
tieth Annual Convention of the International Kindergarten Union;
and a meeting of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs. The
Department of Agriculture had the use of the auditorium for annual
conferences on farm management and meat inspection. Besides simi-
lar functions in connection with two of the above meetings, recep-
tions were given by the Regents and Secretary to the members in
attendance at the Eighth International Congress of Applied Chem-
istry and the Sixth International Congress for Testing Materials,
and to the Daughters of the American Revolution. On the evening
of March 6 Mr. James Wilson, late Secretary of Agriculture, was
tendered a reception by the employees of the Department of Agri-
culture.

APPENDIX 2.
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the opera-
tions of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1913, which have been conducted by authority of the
act of Congress approved August 24, 1912, making appropriations for
sundry civil expenses of the Government, and in accordance with a
plan of operations approved by the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution. The act referred to contains the following provision:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archzologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employees and
the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, including payment in advance
for subscriptions, $42,000.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES.

The systematic researches were conducted by the regular staff of
the bureau, consisting of seven ethnologists, and by other specialists
not directly connected with the bureau. These operations may be
summarized as follows:

Mr. F. W. Hodge, ethnologist-in-charge, was occupied almost en-
tirely during the year with administrative affairs pertaining to the
bureau’s activities. He was able to devote some time to the prepara-
tion of the Bibliography of the Pueblo Indians, the writings relating
to the subject covering so extended a period (from 1539 to date) and
being so numerous that much remains to be done. He devoted atten-
tion also, as opportunity offered, to the revision of certain sections of
the Handbook of American Indians, but as it is the desire to revise
this work completely, with the aid of the entire staff of the bureau as
well as of other specialists, little more than a beginning of the revi-
sion has been made. Mr. Hodge continued to represent the Smith-
sonian Institution at the meetings of the United States Board on
Geographic Names, and the Bureau of American Ethnology on the
Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and publication.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, ethnologist, spent the summer months and
part of the autumn of 1912 in correcting the proofs of his monograph
on Casa Grande and of his report on the Antiquities of the Upper
Verde River and Walnut Creek Valleys, Arizona, both of which

44

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

appear in the Twenty-eighth Annual Report of the bureau, and in
completing the draft of a memoir devoted to the Symbolic Designs
on Hopi Pottery, which it is designed to publish with numerous illus- —
trations. The remainder of the autumn was occupied by Dr. Fewkes
in gathering material for an evertual memoir on the Culture History
of the Aborigines of the Lesser Antilles, these data being derived
chiefly from a study of the early literature of the subject and of the
rich West Indian collections from the island of St. Vincent in the
Heye Museum of New York City. Preparatory to the publication of
the final results, Dr. Fewkes, with the generous permission of George
G. Heye, Esq., selected with entire freedom the necessary objects for
illustration, and before the close of the fiscal year about 200 drawings
of the archeological objects in this important collection had been
finished.

In October, 1912, Dr. Fewkes sailed for the West Indies under the
joint auspices of the bureau and the Heye Museum, the special object
in view being the gathering of new archeological data through the
excavation of village sites and refuse-heaps and the examination of
local collections in the islands. Dr. Fewkes visited Trinidad, Bar-
bados, St. Vincent, Balliceaux, Grenada, Dominica, St. Kitts, Santa
Cruz, and other islands, excavating shell-heaps in Trinidad and Bal-
liceaux, and making archeological studies in other isles. The results
of the fee egations in Trinidad proved to be especially important,
owing to the light which they shed on the pebite taal culture of the
former aborigines of the coast adjacent to South America.

Extensive excavations were made in a large shell-heap, known as
Tehip-Tchip Hill, on the shore of Erin Bay in the Cedros district.
This midden is historic, for it was in Erin Bay that Columbus
anchored on his third voyage, sending men ashore to fill their casks
at the spring or stream near this Indian mound. Tchip-Tchip Hill
is now covered with buildings to so great an extent that it was pos-
sible to conduct excavations only at its periphery; nevertheless the
diggings yielded a rich and unique collection that well illustrates the
culture of the natives of this part of Trinidad. The collection con-
sists of several fine unbroken pottery vessels with painted decoration,
and more than a hundred well-made effigy heads of clay, in addition
to effigy jars and many broken decorated bowls. There were also
obtained from the Erin Bay midden several stone hatchets charac-
teristic of Trinidad and the adjacent coast of South America, a few
shell and bone gorgets, and other artifacts illustrating the activities
of the former inhabitants. It is an interesting fact that as a whole
the objects here found resemble those that have been taken from shell-
heaps on the Venezuela coast and from the Pomeroon district of
British Guiana more closely than they resemble related specimens
from the other islands of the Lesser Antilles. Several other middens
46 — ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

were examined in Trinidad, the most representative of which is situ-
ated near San Jose, the old Spanish capital. Promising shell-heaps
were discovered also at Mayaro Bay on the eastern coast.

One of the most important results of the West Indian field work
by Dr. Fewkes was a determination of the geographical distribution
of certain types of artifacts and a comparison of the prehistoric cul-
ture areas in the so-called Carib Islands. Evidence of the existence
of a sedentary culture on these islands preceding that of the Carib
was obtained, showing it to have distantly resembled that of Porto
Rico; this culture, however, was not uniform. Dr. Fewkes also found
that there were a number of subcultures in these islands. In pre-
historic time Trinidad and Tobago, it was determined, were some-
what similar culturally, just as they are similar geologically and bio-
logically, to northern South America. In Dr. Fewkes’s opinion per-
haps nowhere is the effect of environment on human culture better
illustrated than in the chain of islands extending from Grenada to
Guadeloupe, which were inhabited, when discovered, by Carib, some
of whose descendants are still to be found in Dominica and St. Vin-
cent. The earlier or pre-Carib people were culturally distinct from
those of Trinidad in the south, St. Kitts in the north, and Barbados
in the east. The stone implements of the area are characteristic and
the prehistoric pottery can readily be distinguished from that of the
islands beyond the limits named.

A large number of shell-heaps on St. Vincent were visited and
studies made of localities in that island in which caches of stone
implements have been found. Six groups of petroglyphs were ex-
amined, even some of the best known of which have never been de-
scribed. Special effort was made to obtain information respecting
the origin of certain problematical objects of tufaceous stone in the
Heye Museum, said to have been collected from beneath the lava beds
on the flank of the Soufriére.

Dr. Fewkes visited the locality on the island of Balliceaux where
the Carib of St. Vincent were settled after the Carib wars and be-
fore they were deported to Roatan on the coast of Honduras. Ex-
tensive excavations were made at the site of their former settlement
at. Banana Bay, where there is now a midden overgrown with brush.
Here much pottery, as well as several human skeletons and some
shells and animal bones, were found.

The mixed-blood survivors of the St. Vincent Carib who once lived
at Morne Rond, near the Soufriere, but who are now settled at
Campden Park near Kingstown, were visited. These still retain some
of their old customs, as making cassava from the poisonous roots of
the manihot, and preserve a few words of their native tongue. A
brief vocabulary was obtained, but Carib is no longer habitually
spoken in St. Vincent.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

The fertile island of St. Kitts and the neighboring Nevis were
found to be particularly instructive archeologically. Both have sev-
eral extensive middens and well-preserved pictographs, the former
having yielded many artifacts that illustrate the material culture
of its pre-Carib inhabitants. Through the courtesy of Mr. Connell
his large collection, which adequately illustrates the culture of St.
Kitts and Nevis, was placed at the disposal of Dr. Fewkes for the
purpose of study, and he was permitted to make drawings of the more
typical objects, one of the most instructive of which is a sculptured
torso from Nevis.

In Barbados Dr. Fewkes examined the midden at Indian River,
on the west coast, from which site the important Taylor archeological
collection was gathered. Several other middens were visited on the
lee coast from Bridgetown to the northern end of the island, where
a marly hill strewn with potsherds was observed. He also examined
the so-called “ Indian excavations” at Freshwater Bay and others
at Indian River, and visited several cave shelters on the island. The
most noteworthy of these caves are situated at Mount Gilboa and
in the Scotland district, St. Lucy Parish. To one of these, known
as the “ Indian Castle,” described in 1750 by the Rev. Griffith Hughes,
who claims to have found therein an idol and other undoubted
Indian objects, Dr. Fewkes devoted much attention. The gulches
so characteristic of Barbados were favorite resorts of the aborigines,
and, judging by the artifacts, furnished cave shelters for them.
Although uninhabited at the time of its discovery, there is evidence
of a considerable prehistoric aboriginal population in Barbados,
whose culture was influenced largely by the character of the material
from which their artifacts were made, most of them being fashioned
from shell instead of stone, a characteristic seemingly constituting
this island a special culture area.

A collection of stone implements, including celts, axes, and other
objects, was gathered at Santa Cruz. Several local collections of
archeological objects were examined, and the large midden at the
mouth of Salt River was visited. The prehistoric objects obtained
on this island and from St. Thomas resemble those from Porto Rico.

Although the Carib inhabitants of the Lesser Antilles are no
longer of pure blood, and their language is known to only a few
persons in Dominica and St. Vincent, and to these but imperfectly,
it was found that the negroes, who form more than nine-tenths of
the insular population, retain in modified form some traces of the
material culture of the Indians. Cassava is the chief food of many
of the people, and the method of its preparation has been little
changed since aboriginal times. Cocoa is ground on a stone and
made into cylindrical rolls in much the same manner as it was pre-
pared by the Indians in early times. The basketry made in Do-
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

minica was found to be the same in style and materials as is de-
scribed by the early missionaries to the Carib; while the negroes of
Nevis manufacture pottery of the same form and ornament and
burn it in much the same way as that found in the middens of St.
Kitts. In working their spells, the obia men commonly sprinkle
stone objects with the blood of a goat, and the common people re-
gard petroglyphs as “jumbies,” or bugaboos. A great number of
folk tales of a mixed aboriginal and negro type are still recounted
in the cabins of the lowly, where Carib names for animals, plants,
and places are household words.

On his return to Washington Dr. Fewkes undertook the preparation
of a report on his archeological researches in the West Indies, and
considerable progress therein had been made by the close of the
fiscal year.

Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, was occupied during the greater
part of the year with the investigation of Indian population, which
has engaged his attention for a considerable time. This research
covers the whole period from the first occupancy of the country by
white people to the present time, and includes the entire territory from
the Rio Grande to the Arctic. To make possible systematic treat-
ment the area covered has been mapped into about 25 sections, each
of which constitutes approximately a single geographical and his-
torical unit for separate treatment, although numerous migrations
and removals, and the frequent formation of new combinations, neces-
sitate a constant overlapping of the work of the sections. Several of
the eastern areas have been completed and more or less progress has
been made with each of the others. More recently Mr. Mooney has
concentrated attention on Alaska and western Canada, for the Arctic
parts of which Mr. Vilhjalmur Stefansson and Dr. Waldemar
Jochelson have generously furnished new and valuable data. In
this memoir the plan is to include chapters on notable epidemics, vital
statistics, and race admixture, and the work is intended to appear as
a monograph on the subject.

On June 18, 1913, Mr. Mooney proceeded to the Eastern Cherokee
Indians in North Carolina to continue his investigations of the med-
ical and religious ritual of that tribe, commenced a number of years
ago, as it was deemed wise to finish this part of his Cherokee studies
as soon as practicable by reason of the changes that are so rapidly
taking place among this people. Mr. Mooney was still in the field
at the close of the fiscal year.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, continued, both in the field and
at the office, his studies of the Indians formerly occupying the ter-
ritory of the southern States. He spent the month of November,
1912, with the Alabama and Koasati Indians in Polk County, Tex.,
where he recorded 250 pages of texts in the dialects spoken by these

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

two tribes, corrected several texts obtained on earlier expeditions,
and added materially to his general ethnological information regard-
ing them. In December Dr. Swanton proceeded to Oklahoma, where
he obtained about 50 pages of text in Hitchiti, a language now con-
fined to a very few persons among the Creek Indians, and collected a
few notes regarding the Choctaw.

Before his departure from Washington and after his return Dr.
Swanton spent the greater part of the time in collecting information
_ concerning the Southern tribes from early Spanish, French, and
English authorities. Considerable attention was also devoted to
reading the proofs of the Rev. Cyrus Byington’s Choctaw Dictionary,
now in process of printing, in which labor he was efficiently aided
by Mr. H. S. Halbert, of the Alabama State department of archives
and history. Dr. Swanton also commenced a general grammatical
study of the languages of the Muskhogean stock, particularly Ala-
bama, Hitchiti, and Choctaw, and in order to further this work he
was subsequently engaged in making a preliminary stem catalogue
of Creek from the material recorded by the late Dr. Gatschet, similar
to the catalogue already prepared for Hitchiti, Alabama, and
Natchez. He began also the preparation of a card catalogue of words
in Timucua, the ancient extinct language of Florida, taken from the
grammar and catechisms of Father Pareja. In May, Dr. Swanton
visited New York in order to examine rare Timucua works in the
Buckingham Smith collection of the New York Historical Society.
Through the courtesy of this society and of the New York Public
Library arrangements have been made for furnishing photostat
copies of these rare and important books, and the reproductions were
in preparation at the close of the fiscal year.

In connection with the researches of Dr. Swanton, it is gratifying
to report that he was awarded last spring the second Loubat prize in
recognition of his two publications—* Tlingit Myths and Texts ” and
“Indian Tribes of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Adjacent Coast
of the Gulf of Mexico ”—both issued by the bureau.

Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, ethnologist, devoted her time to the con-
clusion of her researches among the Tewa Indians of New Mexico
and to the preparation of a paper on that interesting and conserva-
tive people. A preliminary table of contents of the proposed memoir
indicates that her studies of the customs and beliefs of the Tewa will
be as comprehensive as the published results of her investigations of
the Sia and the Zui tribe of the same State. As at present outlined,
the work, which will soon be completed, will contain six sections, deal-
ing with the following subjects, respectively: Philosophy, anthropic
worship and ritual, zoic worship, social customs, material culture, and
history.

44863°—sm 1913——4
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, continued his studies among
the Algonquian tribes. In the middle of July, 1912, he proceeded
to the Fox Indians, at Tama, Iowa, from whom a large additional
body of mythological material was obtained; this, in connection with
the myths and legends in the form of texts gathered during the
previous season, approximates 7,000 pages. When the translation
of this material shall have been finished it will form one of the most
exhaustive collections of mythology of any Indian tribe. It is note-
worthy that these myths and tales differ essentially in style from.
those gathered by the late Dr. William Jones (scarcely any of whose
material has been duplicated by Dr. Michelson), a fact that empha-
sizes the necessity of recording such material in the aboriginal tongue.
It may be added that the myths and tales collected are also important
in the light they shed on the dissemination of myths. Study of the
social and ceremonial organization of the Fox Indians was likewise
continued, and especially full notes were obtained on their Religion
dance. Many of the songs of one of the drums were recorded on a
dictaphone and several photographs of the native ball game were
secured.

Dr. Michelson next proceeded to Haskell Institute, the nonreserva-
tion Indian school at Lawrence, Kans., for the purpose of obtaining
notes on Atsina (Gros Ventre) and several other Algonquian lan-
guages, the results of which show definitely that Atsina shares with
Arapaho all the deviations from normal Algonquian, and that Pota-
watomi is further removed from Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Algonkin
than any one of these is from the others.

Dr. Michelson next visited the Munsee, in Kansas, but found that,
unfortunately, little is now available in the way of information
except as to their language, which is still spoken by about half a
dozen individuals, though none employ it habitually.

The Delawares of Oklahoma were next visited, Dr. Michelson find-
ing that their aboriginal customs are still retained to a large extent.
Extended observations were made on several dances, and, to a lesser
extent, on the social organization. From a study of the Delaware
language, together with the Munsee dialect of Kansas, it was ascer-
tained, as had previously been surmised, that the Delaware language
of the early Moravian missionary Zeisberger represents no single
dialect but a medley of several dialects.

On his way to Washington Dr. Michelson stopped again at Tama
to obtain additional notes on the Fox Indians; at the same time he
succeeded in arranging for the acquirement of certain sacred packs
for the National Museum. He also visited Chicago and New York
for the purpose of making comparative observations on the material
culture of the Fox tribe, based on collections in the museums of those
cities.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

On his arrival in Washington, at the close of December, Dr.
Michelson undertook the translation and study of some of the Fox
myths; the results indicate that very great firmness in the word unit
in Algonquian is more apparent than real, and that the classification
of stems must be revised. Dr. Michelson also brought to conclusion
his translation of the Kickapoo myths and tales collected by the late
Dr. Jones, to which were added notes on Kickapoo grammar and
comparative notes on the myths and tales, the whole making some-
what more than 300 pages.

Through correspondence Dr. Michelson succeeded in arranging
for the acquirement of other sacred packs of the Fox Indians, which
have been deposited in the National Museum. He also aided in
furnishing information in answer to inquiries by various corre-
spondents, and from time to time supplied data for incorporation in
a new edition of the Handbook of American Indians.

From the investigations of the bureau it seemed that the Siouan
and Muskhogean languages resembled each other morphologically.
In view of these circumstances, it was deemed desirable that the
Catawba, one of the Siouan tongues, should be restudied, and ac-
cordingly, toward the close of May, 1913, Dr. Michelson proceeded
to South Carolina, where the remnant of the Catawba tribe still
reside. Unfortunately, it was found that the language is all but
extinct, not even half a dozen persons being able to recall phrases,
although isolated words can still be had in goodly number. Owing
to this paucity of text material it is hardly likely that the grammar
of Catawba will ever be completely elucidated, and as no compara-
tive study with other Siouan dialects has yet been made, it is not
practicable at present to say with which Siouan group the language
is most closely associated. A considerable number of native songs
are still remembered by the surviving Catawba, nearly all of which
Dr. Michelson succeeded in recording by dictaphone.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was occupied during the year in
translating unedited Seneca texts of myths which were collected by
himself in 1896 and at other times on the Cattaraugus Reservation
in western New York and on the Grand River Reservation in Ontario,
Canada. These myths, legends, and tales number 13 in all. In addi-
tion, Mr. Hewitt undertook the editing of two Seneca texts— The
Legend of S‘hagowé’‘not‘ha’, or The Spirit of the Tides,” and “The
Tale of Doi’danégé” and Hotkwisdadegé”’ a‘ ”’—recorded by him-
self in the form of field notes in 1896 and aggregating 95 typewritten
pages. At the close of the fiscal year about one-third of this work
was completed. To these texts interlinear translations are to be added
for the purpose of aiding in the grammatic study of the Seneca
tongue.
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

Mr. Hewitt also devoted much time to the collection and prepara-
tion of data for answers to correspondents of the bureau, especially
with reference to the Iroquoian and Algonquian tribes.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, continued his investigations
of the ethnology of the Osage Indians, giving particular attention to
their rituals and accompanying songs. He was enabled to record on
the dictaphone the songs and fragments of the rituals belonging
to the Waxobe degree of the No" ho"zhi"ga rites, of which, as noted in
the last annual report, he has been making a special study. These
rituals have been transcribed and, with the 84 songs that have been
transcribed in musical notation by Miss Alice C. Fletcher, comprise
66 typewritten pages.

Mr. La Flesche has also been able to record the No” zhi"zho*, or
Fasting degree, of the Puma and Black Bear gentes. These two
organizations are closely related; they not only use in common the
songs and rituals of the No™’ho*zhitga rites, but they even go to the
extent of exchanging gentile personal names as full recognition
of their relationship. The No’zhitzho" degree employs 12 rituals
and numerous songs, of which latter 81 have been recorded. These
songs are divided into two great groups, the first of which is known as
“The Seven Songs,” having 16 sets, and the second, “ The Six Songs,”
having 17 sets. The Osage texts of these rituals and songs cover 207
pages, about three-fourths of which have been finally typewritten.
The 81 songs have been transcribed in musical notation by Miss
Fletcher, while the translation of the rituals and the words of the
songs is In progress.

In the autumn of 1912 Mr. La Flesche was fortunate in securing
in full the Ni’k’i degree of these intricate Osage rites. Hitherto he
had been able to obtain only the beginning of this degree, but his in-
formant was finally induced to recite it in its entirety, comprising
1,542 lines. The real title of this degree is Ni’k’1 No"k’o", “ The Hear-
ing of the Words of the People.” In it the genesis of the tribe is
given in a story made up of myth, legend, and symbolism, the whole
being clearly devised to keep the people ever mindful of the necessity
of an orderly and authoritative conduct of war. It goes to show that
the principle of war was early recognized by the Osage as the surest
means by which not only tribal and individual life might be safe-
guarded against strange and hostile tribes, but also as the means by
which the tranquil enjoyment of game and other natural products of
their environment might be won. It is to this coveted tranquillity
that the closing lines of many of the rituals refer, invariably likening
it to a “serene day.” This degree employs ritual almost entirely,
there being only 10 songs. The native ritual comprises 57 type-
written pages, of which a large part has been translated.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5S

In the spring of 1913 Mr. La Flesche obtained the Rush Mat Weav-
ing degree of the Puma and Black Bear gentes. Only the “ Seven
Songs” spoken of before, with various ceremonial forms, are em-
ployed in this degree, the “ Six Songs” being entirely omitted. The
distinguishing features are the ceremonial weaving of the rush mat
for the sacred case in which were enshrined the bird and other sacred
objects, the renewal of all the articles that make up the sacred
bundle, and the ceremonial stitching of the ends of the case. In some
respects this is one of the most extraordinary degrees of the Osage
that Mr. La Flesche has yet observed, since in its performance there
are used 70 brass kettles, 70 red-handled knives, and 70 awls in mak-
ing the various articles, all of which the votary is obliged to furnish,
together with other expensive articles that constitute the fees of the
initiator and other officiating No" ho"zhi*ga, as also 70 pieces of choice
jerked meat for distribution among the members attending the initia-
tion. Three rituals not used in the other degrees are employed in
this, namely, the Green Rush ritual, the Bark ritual, and the Stitch-
ing and Cutting ritual. There are 61 pages of Osage text, about half
of which have been transcribed.

Mr. La Flesche also obtained the rituals and songs of the Washabe
Athi”, “The Carrying of a Dark Object,” with full description of
the various processions and ceremonial forms. This is a war cere-
mony, which, although not counted as a degree, is a rite to which
the seven degrees lead. The name of this ceremony is derived from
the war insignia, which is the charcoal ceremonially prepared from
certain sacred trees, and which symbolizes the black marks denoting
the birds and animals used to typify strength, courage, and fleetness.
Mr. La Flesche’s Osage informant regards this as the final act of
the seven degrees. The Osage text comprises 90 pages, nearly one-
half of which has been transcribed, together with 36 songs, which
have been transcribed by Miss Fletcher, and 7 diagrams.

Mr. La Flesche was fortunate enough to procure the sacred bundle
of the Deer gens and the reed-whistle bundle of the Wind gens; the
contents of the latter are of exceptional interest. Mrs. Brogahige,
one of the ceremonial weavers of the Osage, at considerable sacrifice
to herself, presented Mr. La Flesche two sacred looms, one of which
is used in weaving the buffalo-hair case, and the other in weaving
the rush case for the sacred bird. These packs, together with speci-
mens of ceremonially made burden straps which Mr. La Flesche c¢ol-
lected, have been placed in the National Museum.

Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist, continued the preparation of
the material for the Handbook of American Indian Languages. As
stated in the last annual report, the manuscript of the grammar of
the Chukchee language, to appear in Part 2 of this handbook, was
completed and in its final form was discussed with the author, Mr.
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

Waldemar Bogoras, during the visit of Dr. Boas to Berlin in the
summer of 1912. The results of these discussions were embodied in
the work, the manuscript was delivered, and the typesetting com-
menced. At the same time Dr. Boas studied the Koryak texts col-
lected by Mr. Bogoras, published in accordance with the plan pre-
viously outlined, at the expense of the American Ethnological
Society, and the indispensable references were embodied in the gram-
matical sketch.

The Coos grammar by Dr. Leo J. Frachtenberg was completed, so
far as the work of the editor, Dr. Boas, is concerned, the page proofs
having been finally revised.

The manuscript for the Siuslaw grammar, also by Dr. Frachten-
berg, was submitted and the editing considerably advanced; this
will be completed as soon as the entire series of Siuslaw texts are in
print, a work that has been undertaken under Dr. Boas’s editorship
by Columbia University. All the collected texts are now in type,
so that examples can be added to the manuscript of the grammar.

Dr. Frachtenberg remained in Siletz, Oreg., throughout the year
for the purpose of revising on the spot the materials on the Oregon
languages. He was engaged in collecting and arranging the Alsea
material for Part 2 of the Handbook of Languages, and in preparing
for the discussion of his Molala linguistics. The rapid disappearance
of the Calapooya may make it necessary, however, to complete the
field work on the language of this people before closing the work
on the other manuscripts, even though this procedure may entail delay
in the printing of the volume.

Dr. Alexander F. Chamberlain, of Clark University, who has
undertaken the preparation of a grammar of the Kutenai language,
expects to deliver his manuscript early in the new fiscal year. The
printing of this sketch must necessarily be delayed until the text
material is available in print.

Miss Haessler continued her preparations for a careful revision of
the Dakota Dictionary by Riggs, a work made necessary by reason
of the need of greater precision in phonetics and translation, as well
as of a more systematic arrangement of the material. Miss Haessler
expects to complete all the preliminary work by the summer of 1914,
so that, should facilities be available, she will then be able to under-
take the required field work.

Miss Frances Densmore continued her studies in Indian music,
devoting special attention to that of the Sioux, and during the year
submitted three papers, comprising 252 pages of manuscript, original
phonographic records and musical transcription of 107 songs, and 23
original photographic illustrations. Three subjects have been ex-
haustively studied and a fourth is represented in such manner that
the results may be regarded as ready for publication. The three
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

principal subjects are: The sacred stones, dreams about animals, and
the buffalo hunt. The fourth subject referred to relates to the war-
path and is represented by about 20 songs, but it awaits further study
of the military societies. A special group of songs consists of those
which have been composed and sung by the Sioux in honor of Miss
Densmore.

A study of the music of the Mandan and Hidatsa at Fort Berthold,
N. Dak., was made by Miss Densmore in the summer of 1912, in coop-
eration with the Historical Society of the State of North Dakota.
The results of this investigation consist of a manuscript of about 50
pages, with transcriptions of 40 songs.

Miss Densmore also read the proofs of Bulletin 53 (Chippewa
Music—IT), which is now in press.

Mr. W. H. Holmes, head curator of the department of anthro-
pology of the United States National Museum, continued the prep-
aration of the Handbook of American Archeology for publication
by the bureau, as far as the limited time available for the purpose
permitted. Aside from the preparation of the text and illustra-
tions for parts 1 and 2 of this handbook, Mr. Holmes made field
observations among the ancient mica mines in western North Caro-
lina and among mounds and village sites in South Carolina and
Georgia. He also visited a number of museums for the purpose of
examining the collections of archeological material, among them
being the museums of Boston, Andover, New York City, Philadel-
phia, Columbus, Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, Davenport, and St.
Louis.

Mr. D. I. Bushnell, jr., made good progress in the compilation of
the Handbook of Aboriginal Remains East of the Mississippi, the
manuscript material for which, recorded on cards, now approximates
160,000 words. The collated material has been derived from (1) replies
to circular letters addressed to county clerks in all of the States east of
the Mississippi, (2) communications from various societies and indi-
viduals, and (3) publications pertaining to the subject of American
antiquities. It is gratifying to state that there are very few areas
not covered by the material already in hand, and it is expected that
through the systematic manner in which Mr. Bushnell is prosecuting
the work the handbook will be as complete as it is practicable to make
it by the time it is ready. for publication.

The investigations conducted jointly in 1910 and 1911 by the bu-
reau and the School of American Archeology have borne additional
fruit. An extended memoir on the Ethnogeography of the Tewa
Indians, by J. P. Harrington, was received and will appear as the
“accompanying paper” of the Twenty-ninth Annual Report, now
in press. Three bulletins, namely, (No. 54) The Physiography of
the Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico, in Relation to Pueblo Culture,
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

by Edgar L. Hewett, Junius Henderson, and W. W. Robbins; (No.
55) The Ethnobotany of the Tewa Indians, by Barbara W. Freire-
Marreco, W. W. Robbins, and J. P. Harrington; and (No. 56) The
Ethnozoology of the Tewa Indians, by Junius Henderson and J. P.
Harrington, were also presented as a part of the results of the joint
expeditions and are either published or in process of printing. Mr.
Harrington also made progress in the preparation of his report
on the Mohave Indians, and Miss Freire-Marreco is expected to
submit shortly an extended paper on the Yavapai tribe. There re-
mains to be mentioned in this connection another memoir, namely,
An Introduction to the Study of the Maya Meroglyphs, by Sylvanus
G. Morley; while not a direct product of the joint work of the
bureau and the school, this is in a measure an outgrowth of it. The
manuscript, together with the accompanying illustrations, has been
submitted to the bureau, but is now temporarily in the author’s hands
for slight revision.

Since the publication of the Handbook of American Indians,
through which additional popular interest in our aborigines has been
aroused, it has been the desire to make a beginning toward the prepa-
ration of a series of handbooks devoted to the Indians of the re-
spective States. The opportunity was fortunately presented toward
the close of the fiscal year, when the bureau was enabled to enlist the
aid of Dr. A. L. Kroeber, of the University of California, who has .
kindly consented to undertake the preparation of the initial volume
of the series, to be devoted to the Indians of California. It is planned
to present the material in each volume in as popular a form as prac-
ticable, in order that it may be made of the greatest use to schools,
and it is hoped that the means may be soon available to make pos-
sible the extension of the series to other States.

Under a small allotment from the bureau, Mr. James Murie con-
tinued his studies of Pawnee ceremonies. He devoted special atten-
tion to the medicine rites, and on June 13, 1913, submitted a descrip-
tion of the ritual pertaining to the “ Purification of the Buffalo
Skull ”.

The transcription of the manuscript French-Miami Dictionary in
the John Carter Brown Library at Providence, R. I., to which at-
tention has been directed in previous reports, was finished by Miss
Margaret Bingham Stillwell, who submitted the last pages of the
vocabulary (which number 1,120 in all) early in January, 1913.
The bureau is under obligations to Mr. George Parker Winship,
librarian of the John Carter Brown Library, for his generous co-
operation in placing this valued document at the disposal of the
bureau and to Miss Stillwell for the efficient manner in which this
difficult task was accomplished.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

In the latter part of the fiscal year Mr. Jacob P. Dunn, of Indian-
apolis, in whose hands the French-Miami Dictionary was placed for
study, commenced the annotation of the transcription and the addi-
tion of English equivalents. This necessitated a journey to Okla-
homa, where Mr. Dunn enlisted the services of a Miami Indian as
an interpreter. The result of these studies consists of (a) the
French-Miami-English Dictionary, from Adbbaiser to Cajeux; (6)
The History of Genesis, Chapter I, being Peoria text with Miami-
English translation; (¢) English-Miami Dictionary, from Abandon
to Aim; (d) Wissakatcakwa Stories, recorded in Peoria by the late
Dr. Gatschet, for which Mr. Dunn has made an interlinear trans-
lation.

The compilation of the List of Works Relating to Hawai was
continued by Prof. Howard M. Ballou, of the College of Hawaii,
who from time to time has submitted additional titles. The record-
ing of the material by more than one person necessarily resulted in
more or less inconsistency in form; consequently the manuscript,
which consists of many thousands of cards, has been in need of edi-
torial revision in order to insure uniformity. For this revision the
bureau has been fortunate in enlisting the services of Mr. Felix
Neumann, an experienced bibliographer, who is making progress in
the work.

PUBLICATIONS.

The editorial work of the bureau has been conducted as usual by
Mr. J. G. Gurley, editor. The following publications were issued
during the year:

Twenty-eighth Annual Report, containing “ accompanying
papers” as follows: (1) Casa Grande, by Jesse Walter Fewkes;
(2) Antiquities of the Upper Verde River and Walnut Creek Valleys,
Arizona, by Jesse Walter Fewkes; (8) Preliminary Report on the
Linguistic Classification of Algonquian Tribes, by Truman Michelson.

Bulletin 30, Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico,
edited by Frederick Webb Hodge. By concurrent resolution of
Congress, in August, 1912, a reprint of this bulletin was ordered in
an edition of 6,500 copies, of which 4,000 were for the use of the
House of Representatives, 2,000 for the use of the Senate, and 500
for the use of the bureau. This reprint, in which were incorporated
such desirable alterations as could be conveniently made without
affecting the pagination of the work, was issued in January, 1913.

Bulletin 52, Karly Man in South America, by AleS Hrdlicka, in
collaboration with William H. Holmes, Bailey Willis, Fred. Eugene
Wright, and Clarence N. Fenner.

Bulletin 54, The Physiography of the Rio Grande Valley, New
Mexico, in Relation to Pueblo Culture, by Edgar Lee Hewett, Junius
Henderson, and Wilfred William Robbins.
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

The work on the other publications during the year may be sum-
marized as follows:

Twenty-ninth Annual Report (“ accompanying paper,” The Ethno-
geography of the Tewa Indians, by John Peabody Harrington).
Manuscript prepared for the printers and nearly half of the com-
position finished.

Thirtieth Annual Report (“accompanying papers”: (1) Animism
and Folklore of the Guiana Indians, by Walter E. Roth; (2) Tsim-
shian Mythology, by Franz Boas; (3) Ethnobotany of the Zuni
Indians, by Matilda Coxe Stevenson). Editing of the third paper
and to a considerable extent that of the first paper completed.

Bulletin 40, Handbook of American Indian Languages, by Franz
Boas—Part 2. Work on the Coos section nearly finished and com-
position of the Chukchee section begun. Two sections (Takelma and
Coos) are now “ made up,” aggregating 429 pages.

Bulletin 46, A Dictionary of the Choctaw Language, by Cyrus
Byington, edited by John R. Swanton and H. S. Halbert. The
editors have revised two galley proofs of the Choctaw-English sec-
tion of this dictionary and have practically finished preparation for
the printers of the English-Choctaw section. The first part of this
bulletin is now in process of paging.

Bulletin 53, Chippewa Music—II, by Frances Densmore. Manu-
script edited and the several proofs read, including proofs of 180
pieces of music. At the énd of the year the bulletin was held in the
Printing Office awaiting receipt of the necessary paper stock.

Bulletin 55, Ethnobotany of the Tewa Indians, by Barbara Whit-
church Freire-Marreco, Wilfred William Robbins, and John Pea-
body Harrington. Manuscript edited and the work in galley form at
the close of the year.

Bulletin 56, Ethnozoology of the Tewa Indians, by Junius Hender-
son and John Peabody Harrington. Manuscript edited and the work
in page form at the close of the year.

In accordance with the act of Congress approved August 23, 1912,
the entire stock of publications of the bureau, with the exception of
a few copies of each available work which have been retained at the
Smithsonian Institution for special purposes, was transferred to the
Government Printing Office in October, 1912, for distribution from
the office of the superintendent of documents on order from the
bureau. It has been found that this plan of distribution is highly
successful, and, of course, much less expensive to the bureau.

The correspondence relating to publications, of which 15,070 were
distributed during the year, was conducted under the immediate
supervision of Miss Helen Munroe, of the Smithsonian Institution.
The distribution of the publications may be summarized as follows:

The demand for the Handbook of American Indians (Bulletin 30)
continues unabated, by reason of the wide scope of the work, its
popular form of treatment, and its usefulness to schools. There is an
increasing demand for publications relating to Indian arts and crafts,
and to archeology. Theactivityintheestablishment of organizations
of Camp Fire Girls throughout the country has resulted in a flood of
requests for information relative to Indian customs, names, ete.

ILLUSTRATIONS.

As in the past, the preparation of illustrations for use in connection
with the publications of the bureau, as well as the making of photo-
graphic portraits of the members of visiting deputations of Indians,
continued in the immediate charge of Mr. De Lancey Gill, illustrator,
whose work during the year included the making of negatives of 113
visiting Indians and of 93 miscellaneous ethnologic subjects; he also
developed 298 negatives exposed by members of the bureau in their
field work, printed 975 photographs for official publication, exchange,
and presentation to Indians, and prepared 105 drawings for repro-
duction as illustrations for the publications of the bureau.

The tribes or pueblos represented by Indians who visited Washing-
ton during the year are: Acoma, Apache, Cheyenne, Chippewa,
Cochiti, Crow, Isleta, Kiowa, Osage, Passamaquoddy, Ponca, San
Juan, Santa Clara, Shoshoni, Sioux, Taos, and Wichita. Among the
more important Indians whose portraits were made may be men-
tioned Plenty Coups and Medicine Crow (Crow tribe), Big Man
and Iron Bear (Brulé Sioux), Hollow Horn Bear, Red Cloud, and
Red Hawk (Teton Sioux), Daybwawaindung (Chippewa), and Two
Moons (Cheyenne). Many requests are made by correspondents for
prints from the large collection of negatives in possession of the
bureau, but it has not been possible to supply these, owing to lack
of means, although in many cases they are desired for educational
purposes. The series of photographs of representative Indians, from
55 tribes, which was made during the last fiscal year for special ex-
hibition at the New York Public Library, has been borrowed from
the bureau by the Public Library Commission of Indiana for exhibi-
tion in the public libraries throughout the State. In the work of the
photographic laboratory Mr. Gill was assisted by Mr. Walter J. Sten-
house.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.
LIBRARY.

The library of the bureau continued in immediate charge of Miss
Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mrs. Ella Slaughter. During the
year the accessions comprised 562 volumes (of which 129 were pur-
chased) and 244 pamphlets, bringing the total number of volumes in
the library to 18,532, and the pamphlets to 12,744. The periodicals
currently received by the bureau, of which there are several thousand
unbound parts, number 629; of these all but 18 are obtained in ex-
change for the bureau’s publications. Special attention was paid
during the year to filling lacune in the periodical series.

The cataloguing kept apace with the new accessions, and some
progress was made in cataloguing ethnologic and related articles in
the earlier serials. A monthly bulletin for the use of the members of
the bureau staff was compiled and posted by the librarian, who also
made a beginning in the preparation of a list of writings on the
music of American Indians.

As in the past, it was necessary to draw on the collections of the
Library of Congress, about 300 volumes having been borrowed dur-
ing the year. On the other hand, the library of the bureau is fre-
quently consulted by officers of the departments of the Government,
as well as by students not connected with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.

While many volumes are still without binding, the condition of
the library in this respect has greatly improved during the last few
years; 493 volumes were bound at the Government Printing Office
during the year.

COLLECTIONS.

The following collections were made by the bureau or by members
of its staff during the fiscal year and transferred to the National
Museum:

54311. Six photographs (unmounted) taken by A. J. Horswill, San Jose, Min-
doro, P. I., among the natives of Mindoro Island. Gift to the bureau by
Munn & Co., New York.

54465. Sacred pack of the Fox Indians of Iowa. Purchased fer the bureau by
Dr. Truman Michelson.

54691. Five pieces of cotton painted with Assyrian subjects. Received by the
bureau from an unknown source.

54798. Three sacred looms and seven burden straps of the Osage Indians. Col-
lected by Francis La Flesche.

54933. Three fragments of Indian pottery found at Red Willow, Nebr., by Mrs.
Ada Buck Martin, by whom they were presented.

54934. Sacred bundle of the Fox Indians. Purchased through Dr. Truman
Michelson.

54946. Two sacred bundles of the Osage Indians. Purchased by Francis La

Flesche.

55420. Pair of Osage ceremonial moccasins and an Osage ceremonial ‘ pipe.”
Presented by Francis La Flesche,

PROPERTY.

As stated in previous reports, the property of the bureau of great-
est value consists of its library, manuscripts for reference or publi-
cation, and photographic negatives. A reasonable number of cam-
eras, dictagraphs, and other apparatus, chiefly for use in the field,
as well as a limited stock of stationery and office supplies, necessary
office furniture, and equipment, are also in possession of the bureau.
The sum of $893.21 was expended for office furniture (including fire-
proof filing cases) during the year, $452.57 for apparatus (including
typewriters, cameras, dictagraphs, etc.), and $258.45 for books and
periodicals.

The manuscripts of the bureau, many of which are of extreme
value, are deposited in metal cases in a small room in the north
tower of the Smithsonian Building, which should be made as nearly
fireproof as possible. Requests for a small appropriation to protect
the manuscripts against possible destruction have been made in the
past, but unfortunately the means have not been granted. The
manuscripts, which have been in the immediate care of Mr. J. N. B.
Hewitt, have increased from time to time during the year, chiefly
by the temporary deposit of materials preparatory to editing for
publication. Mention may here be made, however, of the gift of
some manuscript Chippewa letters from the Rev. Joseph A. Gilfillan,
and the acquirement of a photostat copy of the Motul-Maya Diction-
ary, made at the expense of the bureau from the original in the John
Carter Brown Library, at Providence, R. I., as elsewhere noted.
Mention may also be made of various vocabularies or parts of vocabu-
laries, 23 items in all, which were restored to the bureau by Mrs.
Louisa H. Gatschet, who found them among Dr. Gatschet’s effects.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Quarters —Since the beginning of 1910 the offices of the bureau
have occupied nine rooms in the north tower of the Smithsonian
Building, and a room (the office of the ethnologist-in-charge) on the
north side of the third floor of the eastern wing, while the library
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

has occupied the entire eastern gallery of the large exhibition hall
on the first floor, and the photographic laboratory part of the gal-
lery in the southeastern section of the old National Museum building.
While the natural lighting of the rooms in the north tower, by reason
of the thickness of the walls and the narrowness of the windows, is
inadequate, and the distance from the library and the photographic
laboratory makes them not readily accessible, the office facilities are
far better than when the bureau was housed in cramped rented
quarters. Aside from the photographic laboratory and one room in
the north tower, no part of the bureau’s quarters is provided with
running water. It is presumed that after the rearrangement of the
large exhibition hall in the Smithsonian building and its adaptation
to general library purposes the facilities of the bureau library will
be greatly improved.

Office force-—The office force of the bureau has not been augmented,
although the correspondence has greatly increased owing to the grow-
ing demand on the bureau for information respecting the Indians.
The copying of the rough manuscripts, field notes, etc., prepared by
members of the bureau, as well as the verification of quotations,
bibliographic citations, and similar work of a minor editorial nature,
necessitate the employment of temporary aid from time to time.
Most of the answers to correspondents who desire information of a
special character have been prepared by the ethnologist-in-charge,
but every member of the bureau’s scientific staff is frequently called
on for the same purpose to furnish information pertaining to his
particular field of knowledge.

RECOMMENDATIONS.

Tt is difficult to extend the systematic researches of the bureau
along new and necessary lines without an increase of appropriations.
When a special research is undertaken, several years are often re-
quired to finish it, consequently the prospective income of the bureau
for a considerable period is required to carry out adequately the work
in hand. Opportunities are often presented for conducting investi-
gations in new fields which have to be neglected owing to lack of
means. An increase in the appropriations of the bureau has been
urged for several years, but unfortunately the estimates have not
been met with additional funds.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 3.
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1913.

The appropriation made by Congress for ie support of the service
during the year, including the allotment for printing and binding,
was $32,200 (the same amount as appropriated for the past five
years), and the repayments from private and departmental sources
for services rendered aggregated $4,249.13, making the total available
resources for carrying on the system of international exchanges
$36,449.13.

The work of the service is increasing at such a rapid rate that it
will be necessary in the near future to ask Congress to supply addi-
tional funds. More money is needed to meet freight charges on the
increased number of boxes now shipped abroad, and also for miscel-
laneous incidental expenses incurred in connection with the work of
the service. In 1913, 66 per cent more packages were handled than
in 1908, when the appropriation was first placed at $32,200, and 678
more boxes were dispatched. By means of various economies and
improvements in methods this increase in the volume of business has
been provided for without adding to the total cost of the service; but
little more can be done in this direction.

During the year 1913 the total number of packages handled was
338,621, an increase of 23,129, as compared with the preceding year.
The weight of these packages was 593,969 pounds, an increase of
25,257 pounds.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are in-
dicated in the following table:

64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

As was somewhat fully explained in last year’s report, the dis-
parity between the number of packages dispatched and those re-
ceived in behalf of ‘the Government is not so great as indicated by
these figures. Packages sent abroad usually contain only a single
publication each, while those received in return often comprise many
volumes. In the case of publications received in exchange for par-
liamentary documents and some others the term “ package ” is applied
to large boxes containing a hundred or more publications. No lists
of these are made in the Exchange Office, as the boxes are forwarded
to their destinations unopened. It is also a fact that many returns
for publications sent abroad reach their destinations direct by mail
and not through the Exchange Service.

Many governmental and scientific establishments and individuals,
both in this country and abroad, have sought the aid of the Interna-
tional Exchange Service during the year in procuring, as gifts or
exchanges, certain especially desired publications. The correspond-
ence which this work entails upon the Exchange Service is consider-
able and is growing in volume from year to year. Sometimes infor-
mation collected by this Government, but not to be found in pub-
lished reports, is requested. In these instances the various govern-
mental bureaus furnish the desired data in typewritten form. As
an example of a request of this kind received during the year, a case
may be mentioned in which valuable statistics concerning blister
copper were supplied by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau
of Mines for transmission to the high commissioner of the Common-
wealth of Australia for the use of his home Government. Another
request of this character which was complied with was one received
through the Department of State from the minister of public works
and mines of New Zealand for publications containing the laws and
regulations with respect to the boring, mining, and storage of petro-
leum in the United States. In this instance, while the Bureau of
Mines was in a position to furnish information on the mining of
petroleum on Indian reservations, it was necessary for the Institution
to write to the principal States having laws on the subject in question
in order to obtain the desired data. It may, however, be added in
this connection that the Bureau of Mines is engaged in collecting,
arranging, and annotating all the laws, both National and State,
relating to all branches of mining, including the petroleum industry,
and that a copy of this work, when issued, will be furnished the
Institution for presentation to the minister of public works.

The Department of State, in referring a communication from the
librarian of the Brazilian Press Association at Rio de Janeiro request-
ing aid in the establishment of a library in that city to be composed
entirely of the works of American writers, stated that while the
department itself had no facilities for obtaining such publications it

was naturally interested in having the more important works of
American writers, as well as the governmental documents con-
taining statistical information, placed within easy reach of our
neighbors in the Latin-American countries, and that it would be
gratifying to the department if the Smithsonian Institution
should find it practicable to send to the association such works and
statistics regarding science, literature, agriculture, industry, com-
merce, etc., as might seem suitable. The desire of the Brazilian
Press Association was brought to the attention of certain govern-
mental establishments and also of many scientific and literary organi-
zations throughout the United States. The majority of these organi-
zations gave the matter favorable attention, some of them sending
complete sets of their publications and adding the name of the Ameri-
can library to their lists to receive future issues. The Smithsonian
Institution, I need hardly add, contributed a selection of its own
publications. Altogether, more than 1,200 publications were received
and transmitted to the Brazilian Press Association through the Inter-
national Exchange Service as a nucleus for the proposed library.

The chief of the bureau of publications of the Department of
Agriculture and Forestry, Peking, China, while attending the Seven-
teenth International Dry Farming Congress as a delegate from his
Government, forwarded to this Institution, for distribution among
the various State agricultural experiment stations, a number of copies
of three issues of an agricultural journal published by his bureau,
with the request that such bulletins as the experiment stations might
issue from time to time be sent to his bureau in exchange. This
matter was brought to the attention of the various stations, most of
which complied with the request by sending copies of their bulletins
and listing the name of the Chinese Department of Agriculture to
receive their publications regularly in the future.

Many requests for documents are received through the various
exchange bureaus abroad, whose services are made use of by this
Institution in procuring foreign publications for correspondents in
this country. In this connection it may be mentioned that the Gov-
ernment of India invariably requires that requests from establish-
ments in this country for any extended series of Indian official docu-
ments be made through the Exchange Service. In such instances
the status of the society or establishment making the request is looked
into, and statistics and other information relative thereto are fur-

-mshed the Government of India with a recommendation, when
_ deemed advisable, that the desired documents be furnished.

The foregoing are only a few of the important instances in which

the Institution has aided foreign establishments in obtaining pub-
. lications, in pursuance of a policy of international helpfulness, which
44863°—sM 1918——5 '
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

is of benefit to the larger intellectual and economic interests of both
the United States and foreign countries. Many other requests of
similar nature have been received from correspondents in this country
and abroad.

The Institution continues to assist the. Library of Congress in com-
pleting its collections of foreign governmental documents.

Mention was made last year of the fact that packages containing
scientific and literary publications received from establishments and
individuals in the United States for transmission through the Ex-
change Service to miscellaneous addresses in the various Provinces of
the Union of South Africa were forwarded to certain governmental
establishments in those Provinces for distribution, and that the Govy-
ernment of the Union had been approached with a view to having
only one agency for the entire Union. It is now gratifying to state
that this request has been complied with, the Government Printing
Works at Pretoria having been designated to carry on the exchange
work. Packages received in the future for addresses in any of the
Provinces of the Union will therefore be transmitted to the Govern-
ment Printing Works for distribution. This change will effect a
saving to the Institution in freight charges, and will also, I have no
doubt, improve the service with South Africa. Ifa similar arrange-
ment could be made with the Commonwealth of Australia it would
have decided advantages over the present method of forwarding con-
signments to six different addresses in that Commonwealth for dis-
tribution. The matter is now being considered by the Speaker of the
House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, who is
also chairman of the library committee. The Institution has brought
to the attention of that official the advantages to be derived from
having one central exchange agency in Australia and has urged him
to use his best endeavors to have the matter favorably considered by
his Government.

The Egyptian Exchange Agency has been transferred from the
Egyptian Survey Department to the newly formed Government Pub-
lications Department, consignments for distribution in that country
now being forwarded in care of the Superintendent of the Govern-
ment Publications Office, Printing Department, Cairo. It should be
stated as a matter of record in this connection that the businesslike
basis upon which the exchange service between Egypt and the United
States has been placed during the Survey Department’s five years’
connection therewith has resulted in the prompt delivery of packages
to correspondents in both countries.

A circular was received during the year from the Republic of
Mexico, stating that a Service of Exchanges had been established in
the Department of Public Works.

A part of the contents of a consignment forwarded under date of
May 14 (boxes Nos. 1640-1646 and 7896) was damaged by water
while in transit to the Central Statistical Commission in Vienna.
Steps will be taken to duplicate as many of the damaged publications
as are available for distribution.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL
DOCUMENTS.

In accordance with treaty stipulations, and under the authority
of the resolutions of Congress of March 2, 1867, and March 2, 1901,
setting apart a certain number of documents for exchange with for-
eign countries, there are now sent regularly to depositories abroad
56 full sets of United States official publications and 36 partial sets.
During the year the Province of Bombay and the Corporation of
Glasgow were added to the list of recipients of full sets; and Finland,
British Guiana, the Free City of Liibeck, and the Province of Madras
to the list receiving partial sets. While Finland and the Province
of Madras were added to the list of countries receiving partial sets
in November, 1912, the Library of Congress has, so far as it was
possible to do so, completed the series from 1902 to that time.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL JOURNALS.

The interparliamentary exchange of official journals is carried on
under a resolution of the Congress approved March 4, 1909, setting
aside such number as might be required, not exceeding 100 copies,
of the daily issue of the Congressional Record for exchange, through
the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, with the legislative cham-
bers of such foreign Governments as might agree to send to the
United States current copies of their parliamentary records or like
publications. The purpose of this resolution was to enable the in-
stitution, on the part of the United States, to more fully carry into
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

effect the provisions of the convention concluded at Brussels in 1886,
providing for the immediate exchange of the official journal.

The Governments of the Province of Buenos Aires, Liberia, and
Queensland have entered into this exchange during the year. A
complete list of the Governments to which the Congressional Record
is now sent is given below:

Argentine Republic. Italy.

Australia. Liberia.

Austria. New South Wales.
Baden. New Zealand.
Belgium. Portugal.

Brazil. Prussia.

Buenos Aires, Province of. Queensland.
Canada. Roumania.

Cuba. Russia.

Denmark. Servia.

France. Spain,

Great Britain, Switzerland.
Greece. Transvaal.
Guatemala. Union of South Africa.
Honduras. Uruguay.
Hungary. Western Australia.

There are, therefore, at present 32 countries with which the imme-
diate exchange is conducted. To some of these countries, however,
two copies of the Congressional Record are sent, one to the upper
and one to the lower House of Parliament—the total number trans-
mitted being 37.

RULES GOVERNING THE TRANSMISSION OF EXCHANGES.

The circular containing the rules governing the transmission of
exchanges has been revised, and is here reproduced for the informa-
tion of those who may wish to make use of the facilities of the serv-
ice in the forwarding of publications.

In effecting the distribution of its first publications abroad, the Smithsonian
Institution established relations with certain foreign scientific societies and libra-
ries, by means of which it was enabled to materially assist institutions and indi-
viduals of this country in the transmission of their publications abroad, and also
foreign societies and individuals in distributing their publications in the United
States.

In recent years the Smithsonian Institution has been charged with the duty
of conducting the official Exchange Bureau of the United States Government,
through which the publications authorized by Congress are exchanged for those
of other Governments; and by a formal treaty it acts as intermediary between
the learned bodies and scientific and literary societies of the contracting States
for the reception and transmission of their publications.

Attention is called to the fact that this is an international and not a domestic
exchange service, and that it is designed to facilitate exchanges between the
United States and other countries only. As exchanges from domestic sources
for addresses in Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, and other territory

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

subject to the jurisdiction of the United States do not come within the designa-
tion ‘“‘international,” they are not accepted for transmission.

Packages prepared in accordance wilh the rules enumerated below will be
received by the Smithsonian Institution from persons or institutions of learning
in the United States and forwarded to their destinations abroad through its
own agents or through the various exchange bureaus in other countries. The
Smithsonian agents and many of these bureaus will likewise receive from corre-
spondents in their countries such publications for addresses in the United States
and territory subject to its jurisdiction as may be delivered to them under rules
similar to those prescribed herein, and will forward them to Washington, after
which the Institution will undertake their distribution.

On the receipt of a consignment from a domestic source it is assigned a
“record number,” which number is placed on each package contained therein.
After the packages have been recorded they are packed in boxes with packages
from other senders intended for the same countries, and are forwarded by fast
freight to the bureaus or agencies abroad which have undertaken to distribute
exchanges in those countries. To Great Britain and Germany shipments are
made weekly; to all other countries at intervals not exceeding one month.

Consignments from abroad for correspondents in the United States and its
outlying possessions are distributed by mail under frank.

The Institution assumes no responsibility in the transmission of packages
intrusted to its care, but at all times uses its best endeavors to forward exchanges
to their destinations as promptly as possible.

RULES.

The rules governing the Smithsonian International Hxchange Service are as
follows:

1. Consignments from correspondents in the United States containing pack-
ages for transmission abroad should be addressed ‘“ Smithsonian Institution,
International Exchanges, Washington, D. C.”

2. In forwarding a consignment the sender should mail a letter to the Insti-
tution, stating by what route it is being shipped, and the number of boxes or
parcels which it comprises. A list giving the name and address of each con-
signee should also be furnished.

3. Packages should be legibly addressed, using, when practicable, the lan-
guage of the country to which they are to be forwarded. In order to avoid
any possible dispute as to ownership, names of individuals should be omitted
from packages intended for societies and other establishments.

4. Packages should be securely wrapped in stout paper and, when necessary,
tied with strong twine. Cardboard should be used in some instances to protect
plates from crumpling.

5. Letters are not permitted in exchange packages

6. If donors desire acknowledgments, packages may contain receipt forms to
be signed and returned by the establishment or individual addressed. Should
publications be desired in exchange, a request to that effect may be printed on
the receipt form or on the package.

7. Exchanges intended for transmission abroad must be delivered to the
Smithsonian Institution with all charges to Washington prepaid.

8. The work carried on by the International Exchange Service is not in any
sense of a commercial nature, but is restricted to the transmission of publica-
tions sent as exchanges or donations. Books ordered through the trade are
therefore necessarily excluded.

9. Specimens are not accepted for distribution, except when permission has
been obtained from the Institution,

SEPTEMBER 27, 1913.
APPENDIX 4,
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Str: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the opera-
tians of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1913.

The general appropriation made by Congress for the improve-
ment and maintenance during that year was $100,000. The cost of
food for the animals was $20,235, which is somewhat less than
during the previous year, being due to the decline in prices of forage
from the extremely high rates which then prevailed. The expendi-
tures for upkeep were greater than usual, especially as to out-door
cages, inclosures, and fences.

ACCESSIONS.

During the previous year, owing to the necessity of providing a
fireproof building for the central heating plant and making certain
urgently needed small improvements, only a small sum was used for
the purchase of animals. During the present year several important
animals have been added, including a pair of young African ele-
phants, three dromedaries, a pair of cheetahs, several species of
gazelles, and other animals, purchased from the Government Zoologi-
cal Garden at Giza, Egypt. These were engaged some time before
the end of the fiscal year, but, as explained: below, they did not finally
reach the park until a little after the end of the period covered by
this report.

Seven ostriches from southern California were purchased, and
two moose, a male and a female, were obtained by exchange from
the Rocky Mountains National Park in Alberta, Canada. The ac-
cessions, with the animals from Giza, included 15 species not previ-
ously represented in the collection.

The total amount expended for purchase and transportation of
animals was $6,900.

Mammals and birds born and hatched in the park numbered 78
and included polar, grizzly, and Alaskan brown bears, alpaca, llama,
American tapir, chamois, harnessed antelope, deer of several species,
with some other mammals and various birds.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ane

EXCHANGES.

The number of exchanges was smaller than usual. As already
mentioned, two moose were received from the Rocky Mountains
National Park and several animals from dealers.

ANIMALS FROM GIZA.

In the latter part of March, 1913, an offer of some desirable ani-
mals was received from the Government Zoological Garden at Giza,
Egypt. This offer included two young African elephants, a male
and a female, and a number of other less important animals. The
two elephants were engaged for the park, together with three drome-
daries and two Arabian baboons. As the Egyptian authorities
required the animals to be accepted at their gardens, it was thought
advisable to send the head keeper of the park to receive them and
accompany them during transportation. He left Washington May
15, 1912, and arrived at Giza on June 19. On his arrival he found
that several other desirable animals were available there and was
authorized by cable to secure them for the park, so that there were
altogether 21 animals in the shipment. It was necessary to go to
London to arrange for transportation, and on the way from there
to Egypt the zoological gardens at Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Ant-
werp; Cologne, and Rome were visited.

LOSSES OF ANIMALS.

The most serious loss was among the ruminants. An eland, a
bontebok, a Coke’s hartebeest, and a harnessed antelope died from
tuberculosis; a moose and a reindeer from enteritis; two tahr goats
from pneumonia; and an American bison, 21 years old, from arterio-
sclerosis. A fur seal also died from enteritis and a grizzly bear
that when captured, 19 years before, weighed 730 pounds was killed
because of its general decrepitude. A number of birds were lost
through the depredations of raccoons and other animals living at
large in the park. The night herons had increased to such an extent
in the flying cage that they interfered with the nesting of other
birds there, and the greater part of them (114) were disposed of,
a few as gifts to other zoological collections.

Of animals that died in the park, 107 were transferred to the
National Museum. Autopsies were made as heretofore by the Patho-
logical Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Department of
Agriculture.?

VISITORS.

The number of visitors to the park during the year, as deter-
mined by count and estimate, was 633,526, a daily average of 1,731.
This was nearly 100,000 more than during the fiscal year 1912. The
largest number in any one month was 120,908, in March, 1913, an
average per day of 3,900.

Dyring the year 142 classes, schools, etc., with a total of 5,579
pupils, visited the park, a monthly average of 465. These were
mainly from the District of Columbia and neighboring States, but
other States, from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts,
to Tennessee and South Carolina, were represented, and “Corn
Growers” belonging to 18 States.

IMPROVEMENTS.

The construction of a house for the storage and preparation of
food, which was begun toward the close of the previous year, was
completed early in this year and equipped with a large range for
cooking and baking, a small cold-storage room, dumb-waiter, etc.
The total cost of building and equipment was $3,615, of which
$3,050 was paid from this year’s appropriation. The building is of
stone, 24 feet wide and 40 feet long,and has one story and a basement,
both with concrete floors. It is abundantly lighted and thoroughly
sanitary. It is located at the rear of the temporary bird house, so
that the building and theyard about itare screened from public view,
while still convenient of access. This improvement had been much
needed, as the only place previously available for the preparation of
food was the cellar of the lion house, where both light and ventila-
tion were far from satisfactory.

An inclosure and shelter house were built between the lion ‘house
and the small-mammal house to afford temporary quarters for the
small flock of ostriches recently aequired. The house is 16 feet
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

wide and 24 feet long, and the adjoining inclosure, which is nearly
circular, is about 100 feet in diameter.

A new inclosure, with a pool, for wood ducks and nearly related
species, was built in the valley near the flying cage.

The suspension footbridge across Rock Creek near the northern
entrance to the park having become unsafe, a new bridge of similar
construction was built there.

A bridle path was laid out near the bank of the creek throughout
its entire length in the park, and a rustic walk, mainly parallel to the
roadway, was built from the concrete bridge to the north entrance.

Early in the year the first section of a retaining wall was built
in the ravine opposite the point at which Ontario Road reaches the
park, and later a second section was built above this, giving the wall
a total height of 18 feet.

A small retaining wall was built, also, at the mouth of the little
run at the northern edge of the park near Klingle Road to prevent
further erosion there and protect valuable forest trees which are
being undermined.

A small amount of riprapping was done at three places on the
banks of the creek.

Just before the close of the year work was begun on the old ele-
phant barn to fit it and the adjoining yard, then occupied by tairs,
for the temporary accommodation of the two young African ele-
phants which had been secured from the zoological garden at Giza.
A new yard, with a pool, for the tapirs was built next to the new
elephant house, the work on this being well under way at the close
of the year.

The cost of these improvements was as follows:

Through the generosity of Mr. John B, Henderson, jr., there was
completed in the autumn of 1912 an outdoor cage for parrots which
had heretofore been confined in the bird house. The cage is 24 by
40 feet, and about 26 feet high, has a steel framework and is covered
with strong wire netting of special construction. Several species
of cockatoos and macaws, and one species of Amazon parrot, in all 28
specimens, were placed in the cage, and, with few exceptions, have
been thrifty and appear to enjoy their outdoor freedom.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

MAINTENANCE OF BUILDINGS, INCLOSURES, ETC.

It was necessary to make quite extensive repairs during the year,
so that the expenditures for upkeep were somewhat larger than usual.
New concrete floors were laid in two of the largest bear yards, and
the pools rebuilt. The concrete base of the partitions between the
several yards was also built up sufficiently to bring the metal work of
the partitions above the damp floor.

A section of the boundary fence of the park was largely rebuilt
and other portions repaired, and much of the metal work of cages
and inclosures was repainted, including the flying cage and eagle
cage, bear yards, antelope yards, and the outside cages of the small-
mammal house.

NEW BRIDGE ACROSS ROCK CREEK.

The sundry civil act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, con-
tained the following item: “ For the construction of a rough-stone
faced or bowlder bridge across Rock Creek to replace the present log
bridge on the line of the roadway from Adams Mill Road entrance
and Cathedral Avenue, $20,000.” The act also includes the follow-
ing provisions: “ Hereafter all plans and specifications for the con-
struction of buildings in the National Zoological Park shall be pre-
pared under the supervision of the municipal architect of the District
of Columbia, and all plans and specifications for bridges in said
park shall be prepared under the supervision of the engineer of
bridges of the District of Columbia.”

In accordance with this requirement the matter of preparing plans
and specifications for the bridge was taken up with the engineer of
bridges very soon after the sundry civil act was approved (August 24,
1912). A considerable amount of preliminary work had already been
done when the engineer of bridges died. The matter was taken up
again with his successor and plans and specifications were prepared
and advertisements made for proposals April 28, 1913. A contract
for the construction of the bridge was entered into May 29, 1913.
The old bridge was removed as soon as possible, and work on the
new bridge was begun about the middle of June. The bridge is to be
of reinforced concrete, faced with rough blocks of the blue gneiss found
in this region. Stone for the concrete is to be obtained in the park.
The span of the bridge is to be 80 feet and the total length at the
road level 114 feet. The bridge will be 39 feet 6 inches wide from
outside to outside, with a width of 36 feet 6 inches between the para-
pets. There will be a macadam roadway with concrete sidewalk
on either side, but the construction of roadway and sidewalks will be
deferred until the earth fill has thoroughly settled. The work on the
main portion of the bridge covered by the contract will amount to
about $10,800, while the cost of material furnished by the park, prep-
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

aration of plans, superintendence, and other expenses will probably
bring the total cost up to $15,300. The appropriation, therefore,
will be sufficient to add wing walls if desirable, and to complete the
approaches. It is expected that all work under the contract will be
finished and the temporary roadway built in time to open the bridge
for use by October 30. It has been necessary to close the road to
vehicles during the construction of the bridge.

Most of the members of the old log bridge, which was erected in
1896, were found to be in surprisingly good condition, but it was
so much decayed at some vital points as to be dangerous for use.

ALTERATION OF THE WEST BOUNDARY OF THE PARK.

Tn the last annual report, as in several previous reports, attention
was called to the urgent need of acquiring additional land along the
western side of the park and the great desirability of extending the
park to Connecticut Avenue. The matter was presented to Congress
and an appropriation has been made for the purchase of the pri-
vately owned land lying between the western boundary of the park
and Connecticut Avenue from Cathedral Avenue to Klingle Road,
the land in the included highways also to become a part of the park.
The land to be purchased amounts to about ten and two-thirds acres
and that in the highways to about two and two-thirds acres.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report on the opera-
tions of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the year
ending June 30, 1913:

EQUIPMENT.

The equipment of the observatory is as follows:

(a) At Washington there is an inclosure of about 16,000 square
feet, containing five small frame buildings used for observing and
computing purposes, three movable frame shelters covering several
out-of-door pieces of apparatus, and also one small brick building
containing a storage battery and electrical distribution apparatus.

(6) At Mount Wilson, Cal., upon a leased plot of ground 100
feet square, in horizontal projection, are located a one-story cement
observing structure, designed especially for solar-constant measure-
ments, and also a little frame cottage, 21 feet by 25 feet, for observer’s
quarters.

During the year there was erected upon the observing shelter at
Mount Wilson a tower 40 feet high above the 12-foot piers which
had been prepared in the original construction of the building. This
tower is now being equipped as a tower telescope for use when ob-
serving (with the spectrobolometer) the distribution of radiation
over the sun’s disk. The cost of the tower and its apparatus has thus
far been about $1,400.

Other pieces of apparatus for research have been purchased or
constructed at the observatory shop. The value of these additions
to the instrumental equipment, not counting the tower above men-
tioned and its equipment, is estimated at $1,500.

WORK OF THE YAR.

1. ON THE SOLAR CONSTANT OF RADIATION.

When Volume IT of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory
was published in 1908 the standard scale of measurement of solar
radiation had not yet been established. Several supposedly standard
pyrheliometers for the purpose of fixing the true scale of radiation
measurement were constructed and tried at this observatory, as men-

87
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

tioned in former reports. The results obtained agreed closely to-
gether and were checked by observations with known quantities of
heat. In October, 1912, another type of standard pyrheliometer,
which we called the water-stir pyrheliometer, was devised, con-
structed, and used. It proves to give values for the standard scale of
radiation almost identical with those which we had before obtained,
and in this instrument, as in the others, known test quantities of heat
were introduced and measured within less than 1 per cent. In view
of all these experiments with standard pyrheliometers, it is now felt
that the standard scale of radiation is at length fully established.
Accordingly, a publication entitled “ Smithsonian Pyrheliometry Re-
vised ” was issued February 1, 1913, giving the results of all the
definitive experiments on the standard scale of radiation and also
the experiments made to fix the scales of all the secondary pyrheli-
ometers in use at the Astrophysical Observatory or furnished by
the Smithsonian Institution to observers in this country and abroad.

A small correction in the determinations of the solar constant of
radiation made at Mount Wilson and elsewhere was found to be
required owing to a residual effect of water vapor in the atmosphere
which had not been entirely eliminated. This correction sometimes
reaches as great a magnitude as 2 per cent. It has now been applied
to all the measurements made at the various stations which have been
occupied since 1902, and all the solar-constant measurements, about
700 in number, have been reduced to the new standard scale of pyrhe-
hometry.

The mean value of the solar constant of radiation at the earth’s
mean distance from the sun from about 700 measurements, some at
Washington, others at Mount Wilson, others at Bassour, Algeria, and
still others at Mount Whitney, Cal., and covering the years from 1902
to 1912, has now been taken. J¢ és 1.932 calories per square centi-
meter per minute.

2. THE VARIABILITY OF THE SUN.
(a) Attending sun spots.

Tn connection with the reduction of the measurements of the solar
constant of radiation mentioned above, mean values were taken for
each month during which observations had been made at Mount
Wilson. These monthly mean values, extending from the year
1905 to the year 1912, have been compared with the so-called Wolff
sun-spot numbers for the same months. The result shows, as indi-
cated in the accompanying illustration, that increased solar-constant
values attend increased sun-spot numbers. An increase of radiation
at the earth’s mean distance from the sun of 0.07 calorie per square
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89

centimeter per minute appears to attend an increased spottedness of
the sun represented by 100 Wolff sun-spot numbers.

(0) Short interval irregular variability.

The observations which had been begun in the year 1911 and con-
tinued in the year 1912 at Bassour, Algeria, simultaneously with
similar observations at Mount Wilson, Cal., were concluded in
September, 1912. The observations obtained at the two stations have

now been completely reduced and compared. The results given in
the accompanying diagram show conclusively that if high values of
the solar radiation (outside the atmosphere) are found from Cali-
fornia observations, the values found from Algerian observations
will be high also, and vice versa. In other words, the fluctuation of
the “ solar-constant” values which had been found in California in
former years are now shown to be no local phenomenon due, per-
haps, to atmospheric disturbances, but rather a phenomenon which
is general over the earth’s surface and which must be attributed to
causes outside the earth altogether. It would be conceivable that
such a cause might be the interposition of meteoric dust or other
matter between the earth and the sun; but other evidence, which is
more fully explained in Volume III of the Annals of the Astro-
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

physical Observatory, shows that we must attribute the changes to
the sun itself and not to the interposition of matter between the
earth and the sun. Thus we may conclude that the sun is variable,
having not only a periodicity connected with the periodicity of sun
spots, but also an irregular, nonperiodic variation, sometimes run-
ning its course in a week or 10 days, at other times in longer periods,
and ranging over irregular fluctuations of from 2 to 10 per cent of
the total radiation in magnitude.

3. THE EFFECTS OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

Violent eruption of Mount Katmai, Alaska, occurred on June 6,
7, and 8, 1912. The solar observations made at Bassour, Algeria,
and at Mount Wilson, Cal., began to indicate the presence of dust
in the upper air from this volcano about June 20, 1912. The effects
of this dust became more and more considerable, so that in August
the direct radiation of the sun was reduced by the interposition of
the dust cloud by about 20 per cent, both at Bassour and Mount
Wilson. <A study of the influence of Mount Katmai and other
volcanic eruptions was published by Messrs. Abbot and Fowle in
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, volume 60, No. 29, 1913.
It was shown that not only the volcano of Mount Katmai, but also
other great eruptions of former years, have materially decreased the
direct radiation of the sun, and apparently altered the temperature
of the earth. Various observers have shown that the presence of
sun spots is attended with a decreased terrestrial temperature. In
the paper just mentioned it is shown that quite as important an

:
q

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

influence is attributable to the presence of volcanic haze; and that
a combination of the effects of sun spots and volcanic haze accounts
for all the principal outstanding irregularities in the temperature
of the earth for the last 30 years.

4. VOLUME III OF THE ANNALS OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The principal work of the year was the reduction of observations
and the preparation for publication of Volume III of the Annals of
the Astrophysical Observatory. (Quarto; pp. XI-+-241; tables, 70;
inserted plates, 7; text figures, 32.) The manuscript was forwarded
to the Public Printer on April 1, and the first completed copy of the
book was received on July 3, 1913. About 1,400 copies have been
distributed to libraries and individuals throughout the world.

In brief, the experiments described therein, which include the
work of the observatory from 1907 to 19138, appear—

(a) To have established the scale of measurement of radiation to
within 1 per cent.

(6) To have established the solar constant of radiation to within
1 per cent.

(c) To have shown by two independent methods that the sun’s
emission is not uniform but varies with an irregular periodicity of
from 7% to 10 days on the average and with irregular amounts seldom
if ever exceeding 10 per cent.

(d) To have shown that the sun also varies in connection with the
sun-spot cycle. The solar emission appears to be increased at the
earth’s mean distance from the sun by about 0.07 of a calorie per
square centimeter per minute for an increase of 100 Wolff sun-spot
numbers.

(e) A marked effect of volcanic dust in the upper atmosphere on
the radiation of the sun and on the temperature of the earth is
indicated.

(f) Studies of the radiation of the sky, the effects of water vapor
on the solar radiation, the distribution of radiation over the sun’s
disk, the probable temperature of the sun, and other subjects are
included.

5. STUDIES OF THE TRANSMISSION OF LONG WAVE RAYS BY WATER VAPOR
IN THE EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE.

Mr. Fowle’s experiments on the transmission of radiation through
long columns of air containing measured quantities of water vapor
were temporarily discontinued owing to the need of completing the
publication of Volume III of the Annals. He, however, published
a paper on the quantity of water vapor found above the Mount Wil-
son station.?

1 Astrophysical Journal, vol. 57, p. 359, 1913.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

Toward the end of the fiscal year a vacuum bolometer was pre-
pared for use in continuing the experiments on the transmission of
very long wave rays through atmospheric water vapor. It is pro-
posed to push this work in the immediate future.

6. THE CALIFORNIA EXPEDITION,

A grant of money from the Hodgkins fund having been made by
the Institution to Mr. A. K. Angstrém for observations of nocturnal
radiation at different altitudes, several other lines of investigation
were arranged to be included in connection with these researches.
In the first place measurements were proposed on the total radiation
from the sky by day. For this purpose and with the aid of a small
grant from the Hodgkins fund Mr. Abbot devised and tested a
special sky-radiation apparatus. This instrument comprises two
blackened strips of metal, which are exposed successively at the
centers of two metal plates in such a way that the whole hemisphere
of the sky is free to shine on the exposed blackened strip, but nothing
can come from below the horizon toward the strips. Each strip is
at the center of a hemispherical glass inclosure, which serves the
purpose of preventing the exchange of rays of long-wave lengths
(associated with the temperature of such objects) between the black-
ened strip and the sky. Thus the apparatus serves to measure the
quantity of radiation, originally coming from the sun, which has
become diffusely scattered toward the horizontal surface by the
molecules and dust particles found in the atmosphere.

Secondly, in order to determine the temperature and humidity
prevailing above the stations occupied by Mr. Angstrém’s expedi-
tions, the Institution procured a large number of sounding balloons,
and arrangements were made with the Weather Bureau for flying
these balloons from Santa Catalina Island, carrying with each ascen-
sion self-recording apparatus of the Weather Bureau for measuring
the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the air. Captive balloons
belonging to the Weather Bureau were also arranged to be sent up
at Lone Pine, Cal., and at Mount Whitney, Cal., while Mr. Angstrém
was occupying these two stations.

As certain writers have expressed doubt whether measurements of
the solar constant of radiation made by Langley’s method of high
and low observations with the spectrobolometer really furnish the
solar radiation values as they would be found outside our atmosphere,
it seemed desirable to check these results by observing at the highest
possible altitudes the actual intensity of the solar radiation.
For this purpose Mr. Abbott designed a form of pyrheliometer,
similar in principle to the’ silver-disk pyrheliometer, but which
is automatic and self-recording, and can be attached to a sound-
ing balloon, and thus carried to very great heights. Five copies
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

of this instrument were prepared at the observatory shops by Mr.
Kramer and Mr. Abbot, and these were sent with the expedition to
California. In anticipation it may be said that the five instruments
were sent up on successive days, beginning July 30, 1913, and at the
time of writing this report two of them have been recovered. Each of
the two had a readable record of the ascension. <A preliminary re-
_ duction of the results shows that, beginning at an altitude of about
6,000 meters and separated by altitude intervals of 2,000 or 3,000
meters for successive exposure, four determinations of the solar
radiation were obtained in each of the ascents. The rough computa-
tion mentioned results as follows: First ascent: 1.44, 1.60, 1.70, and
1.88 calories per square centimeter per minute. Second ascent: 1.62,
1.64, 1.76, and 1.89 calories per square centimeter per minute.

These results are subject to later recomputation, but they indicate
at least that our solar-constant work of 1902-1912 by high and low
sun observations on homogeneous rays, according to Langley’s
methods, gives results of the same order of magnitude as those
obtained by direct pyrheliometric observations at extremely high
altitudes.

PERSONNEL.

No change has occurred in the staff of the observatory, except that
Miss F. E. Frisby completed her temporary service as computer on
June 30, 1913, and Mr. A. K. Angstrém served as temporary bolo-
metric assistant in Algeria from July 1, 1912, to September 30, 1912.

SUMMARY.

The work of the observatory has been uncommonly successful.
Volume III of its Annals has been published, including the work of
the years 1907 to 1912. The observations at Bassour, Algeria, taken
in connection with those made simultaneously at Mount Wilson, Cal.,
have established the variability of the sun. <A variability connected
with the sun-spot cycle has also been shown. The mean value of the
solar constant of radiation has been fixed, it is thought, within 1 per
cent. From about 700 observations, extending over the time interval
from 1902 to 1912 and taken at different altitudes from sea level to
4,420 meters, the mean value is 1.932 calories per square centimeter per
minute. Pyrheliometers have been sent up by means of sounding
balloons to very great altitudes, and preliminary results indicate that
they give values of the solar radiation similar to those found by high
and low sun observations on homogeneous rays.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on work
performed for the Smithsonian Library during the fiscal year ending

June 30, 1918:
ACCESSIONS.

The accessions to the library are obtained mainly by exchange of
Smithsonian publications, or by gift. During the fiscal year 1913,
33,161 packages of publications were received as exchanges and gifts,
of which 29,065 packages were transmitted by mail and 4,096 through
the International Exchange Service. In addition to letters written
in acknowledgement of publications received in response to the re-
quests of the Institution for exchange, some 5,000 publications were
acknowledged on the regular printed forms.

The following number of accessions for the Smithsonian deposit
in the Library of Congress were recorded during the year: 3,379
volumes, 1,407 parts of volumes, 5,990 pamphlets, and 450 charts;
total, 11,226 publications. The numbers in the accession catalogue
ran from 508,789 to 513,026, the parts of serial publications entered
on the card catalogue numbered 21,081, and 1,256 slips were prepared
for completed volumes. The various publications sent to the Library
of Congress as soon as received and entered filled 257 boxes and com-
prised 30,350 separate pieces, including parts of periodicals, pam-
phlets and complete. volumes. Besides these, about 1,704 parts of
serials needed to complete sets were obtained by exchange and sent to
the Library of Congress separately.

As in previous years, public documents presented to the Institution
were sent to the Library of Congress without being stamped or
recorded. Publications of this class to the number of 9,866 were
transmitted in this manner during the year.

The Smithsonian Office Library and the small collections of books
maintained by the Astrophysical Observatory and the National Zoo-
logical Park received accessions amounting altogether to 473, di-
vided as follows: Smithsonian Office, 314 volumes, 37 parts of vol-
umes, and 19 pamphlets; Astrophysical Observatory, 90 volumes, 21
parts of volumes, and 69 pamphlets; National Zoological Park, 13
volumes and 10 pamphlets.

1Only a portion of these are included in the foregoing statistics of accessions, as
periodicals are not entered jm the accession record until volumes are complete.

94
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95
EXCHANGES.

Through correspondence, 140 new periodicals were added during
the year to the great collection of scientific journals contained in the
Smithsonian deposit, together with 1,704 parts needed to complete
volumes in the various series.

The matter of the completion of sets in the Smithsonian deposit
received special attention. Revised want lists for Belgium, Den-
mark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland were taken up, and, so far as possible, the needed parts
were supplied. These lists were additional to the regular want cards
received separately from the Library of Congress. As a result of
the work carried on in this direction during the year, 192 parts of 60
different publications were sent to the Library of Congress to com-
plete sets of periodicals in the Smithsonian deposit and 1,475 missing
parts needed to complete volumes of 173 different series of publica-
tions of learned societies and scientific institutions. For other divi-
sions of the Library of Congress 37 parts of 16 sets were supplied.

In exchange for annual reports of the American Historical Asso-
ciation a number of publications of European historical societies
were obtained for the library, as in previous years.

READING ROOM.

The rearrangement of the reading room in the Smithsonian build-
ing mentioned in last year’s report was completed. Two new oak
tables have been provided, a large one for readers and a smaller one
with bins for periodicals. All the doors have been removed from
the cases of pigeonholes for periodicals which stand against the
walls and proper space made for desks and aisles. By these changes
the appearance of the room has been much improved and the period.
icals made more readily accessible. The latest issues of about 262
domestic and foreign scientific periodicals are now constantly at
hand and are consulted by the staff of the Institution and _ its
branches, the scientific officers of various governmental establish-
ments in Washington, and students generally. The series of large
accession books formerly kept in the reading room have been re-
moved to the adjoining office and placed in a special case. A partial
rearrangement of the contents of the room farther to the east was
effected during the year for the purpose of making the encyclopedias,
dictionaries, gazetteers, and other books of general reference more
readily accessible. This room contains the transactions of the vari-
ous academies of the world and other similar series which are con-
stantly needed for reference by the scientific staff of the Institution.
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

AHRONAUTICAL LIBRARY.

The Institution possesses an excellent collection of literature relat-
ing to the subject of aeronautics, which is kept in the room last men-
tioned. This very valuable series of publications is rich in period-
icals, especially those of early date. During the year all the books
were reclassified and the volumes of periodicals were collated and
made ready for binding.

ART ROOM AND EMPLOYEES’ LIBRARY.

No additions to the works on art contained in this room were made
during the year and the arrangement remained unchanged. All
works relating to other subjects than art have been eliminated, and
those properly belonging in the room are in good condition and
readily accessible.

No changes were made in the small collection of general literature
known as the employees’ library for the reasons mentioned in last
year’s report.

NEW STEEL BOOKSTACKS.

The estimates for the fiscal year 1914 contained an item of $40,000
for the erection of metal bookstacks in the main hall of the Smith-
sonian building, to contain the library of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, a part of the National Museum library, together with
books belonging to other branches of the Institution, and certain
collections of Smithsonian books used by the scientific and adminis-
trative staff. Toward the close of the fiscal year covered by this
report Congress appropriated the sum of $15,000 for beginning this
work, and arrangements were immediately made to secure a design
for the bookstacks. In accordance with the plan proposed, a floor
space at each end of the hall measuring 50 feet by 26 feet will be
devoted to the stacks, which will be arranged in three tiers and reach
from the floor to the ceiling. In order to increase the shelf capacity
and at the same time preserve the appearance of the hall, a series of
bookeases about 8 feet high will be carried along the north and south
walls, connecting with the stacks at each end. The object of this
arrangement is to concentrate the various collections of books as far
as practicable and at the same time to preserve the symmetry of the
hall, and to leave the central portion open for exhibits and for va-
rious Smithsonian gatherings. A portion of the space will probably
be needed for the preservation and display of the personal relics of ~
James Smithson and for objects illustrating the work of the several
branches of the Institution.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97
CATALOGUE OF SMITHSONIAN PUBLICATIONS.

A contract was entered into during the year for the preparation
of a complete catalogue of the publications of the Institution and its
branches in book form. It is expected that the manuscript will be
finished within a few months and that means will be found to print
and issue the catalogue without serious delay.

LIBRARIES OF THE GOVERNMENT BRANCHES.

United States National Museum.—In accordance with the plans ap-
proved last year, four rooms at the northeast corner of the new
building of the National Museum on the ground floor (Nos. 24, 26,
27, and 28) were fitted with steel bookstacks and other library appli-
ances of the latest design for the reception of the portion of the
Museum library needed in connection with the study and classifica-
tion of the natural history and other collections in that building.
The three rooms on the north side of the corridor not being separated
by partitions, the entire space of 107 feet by 21 feet was divided into
three portions of unequal dimensions, the western portion being as-
signed for a general reading room, and also for the card catalogues,
reference books, charging desk, etc. The middle portion, of smaller
dimensions, for quiet reading; and the larger eastern portion for the
general stacks. The stacks are in two tiers separated by a glass floor.
In the middle room the arrangement is similar, except that a large
table occupies the central floor space. A gallery which extends
around three sides of the general reading room also supports stacks,
and on the ground floor additional shelving occupies the east wall of
this room. Open shelves for current numbers of periodicals occupy
the space under the windows. Two steel manuscript cases have been

_ placed in the middle room, and a small lift for raising books to the

upper or mezzanine floor, and suitable staircases have also been pro-
vided. <A special feature of the stack room is that every second stack

is but 34 feet high instead of 7 feet. This arrangement reduces the

total shelf capacity a little, but provides a place on which to lay
books when they are being rearranged or used by readers. As the
members of the staff and other students are permitted to consult books
in the stack room, the provision is a necessary one.

The room on the south side of the corridor (No. 27) was arranged
as an office for the assistant librarian and the cataloguers. Bookstacks

“extend around the walls of the room on three sides, and there are

two additional stacks, dividing the room practically into three.

The steel stacks were completed about October 15, 1912, and the
moving of books from the old quarters was begun immediately. The
task of placing the books on the new shelves occupied about a month,

44862°—sm 19183——7
98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

during which time they were, nevertheless, available for use by
readers and the delivery of books to the sectional libraries was not
interrupted. For moving, the books were tied together in lots of con-
venient size for handling, and each lot received a number. It was
then a simple matter to put the books in their proper places on the
shelves in the new library. After they were in place, the library
was fortunately able to employ temporary assistants to go over them
all for the purpose of checking up the various series and ascertaining
whether the volumes were all present and in their proper sequence.

The arrangement of the cards belonging to the Zurich catalogue of
scientific literature has been perfected, and they are now available for
reference.

In accordance with the plans decided upon, as mentioned in last
year’s report, the books on museum administration, technology, his-
tory, botany, and some other subjects were allowed to remain in the
old quarters, where they would be most readily accessible to the mem-
bers of the staff and others working in those lines. It is the inten-
tion, however, to transfer the botanical books to the new stacks in the
Smithsonian Building as soon as the latter shall have been com-
pleted.

This portion of the library was rearranged and recatalogued as
rapidly as possible, and with the aid of additional help the publica-
tions had been classified on the shelves at the close of the year and
about one-half of them recatalogued. The following work in this
direction was accomplished during the year: Books catalogued,
1,370; pamphlets, 2,416; total number of cards made, 3,132. Com-
pleted volumes of periodicals catalogued, 2,938; parts of publications,
19,059; total number of cards made, 1,117.

During the year 881 volumes were prepared for binding and sent
to the Government bindery for that purpose.

Many important gifts were received by the library during the year,
and the following members of the staff presented publications: Sec-
retary Charles D. Walcott, Dr. Theodore N. Gill, Dr. William H.
Dall, Mr. Robert Ridgway, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Dr. J. C. Crawford,
Dr. O. P. Hay, and Mr. W. R. Maxon.

The Museum library now contains 43,692 volumes, 72,042 unbound
papers, and 122 manuscripts. The accessions during the year covered
by this report consisted of 1,690 books, 2,213 pamphlets, and 159
parts of volumes. The number catalogued, exclusive of those men-
tioned above, was as follows: 782 books, 892 complete volumes of
periodicals, and 2,229 pamphlets.

The number of books, periodicals, and pamphlets borrowed from
the general library amounted to 25,846, among which were 3,888
obtained from the Library of Congress, 117 from the Department of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 99

Agriculture, 71 from the Army Medical Museum and library, 59
from the United States Geological Survey, and 19 from other libra-
ries. Publications to the number of 4,832 were assigned to the sec-
tional libraries of the Museum during the year.

The following is a complete list of the sectional libraries now
existing:

Administration. Marine invertebrates.
Administrative assistant’s office. Materia medica.
Anthropology. — Mechanical technology.
Biology. Mollusks.

Birds. Oriental archeology.
Botany. Paleobotany.
Comparative anatomy. Parasites.

Fditor’s office. Photography.
Ethnology. Physical anthropology.
Fishes. Prehistoric archeology.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphie arts. Superintendent’s office.
Insects. Taxidermy.
Invertebrate paleontology. Textiles.

Mammals. Vertebrate paleontology.

The records of the Museum library consist of an author’s catalogue,
an accession book, a periodical record on standard cards, and a lend-
ing record. This lending record is on cards and includes books
borrowed from the Library of Congress and other libraries for the
use of the staff.

The library is largely dependent upon the exchange of Museum
publications as a means of increase. During the year many letters
asking for missing parts and for new exchanges were sent out, and
a number of sets were completed in this way and new publications
also added to the library.

Bureau of American E'thnology.—tThe report on this library will
be made by the ethnologist in charge and incorporated in his general
report on the operations of the bureau.

Astrophysical Observatory——The small collection of books con-
stituting the reference library of the Astrophysical Observatory was
rearranged in the cases in the main hall of the Smithsonian Building,
to which they were transferred from one of the tower rooms. During
the year 90 volumes, 21 parts of volumes, and 69 pamphlets were
received. This collection of books will eventually be placed in the
new steel stacks, for which an appropriation was made at the last
session of Congress.

National Zoological Park.—A small number of books on zoological
subjects are kept in the office of the superintendent of the park.
During the year 13 volumes and 10 pamphlets were added.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Bureau of the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature for the year ending June 30, 1913.

The International Catalogue of Scientific Literature now consists of
33 regional bureaus, anew bureau representing the Argentine Republic
having been recently established at the Universidad de Buenos Aires.
It appears probable that Bolivia will soon also be represented by a
regional bureau. The following-named countries are represented by
regional bureaus supported in most cases by direct governmental
grants: Argentine Republic, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cuba, Den-
mark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hungary,
India and Ceylon, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New South Wales, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Queensland, Russia, South
Africa, South Australia, Spain, Straits Settlements, Sweden, Swit-
zerland, United States of America, Victoria and Tasmania, and
Western Australia.

These bureaus, acting through the London Central Bureau, form
the organization of the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture, whose duty it is to collect, index, classify, and publish a current
catalogue of the world’s scientific literature. The London Central
Bureau assembles, edits, and publishes the classified references sup-
plied by the regional bureaus.

The enterprise was begun in 1901 and since then there have been
published annually 17 volumes, one each year for the following-named
branches of science: Mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry,
astronomy, meteorology, mineralogy, geology, geography, paleon-
tology, general biology, botany, zoology, anatomy, anthropology,
physiology, and bacteriology.

All of the first 9 annual issues of the catalogue have been pub-
lished, 14 volumes of the tenth issue, and 2 volumes of the eleventh,
a total of 169 regular volumes in addition to several special volumes
of Schedules and Lists of Journals.

The annual subscription price for a complete set of 17 volumes is
$85. The receipts from the sale of the catalogue are used for the
maintenance of the central bureau, which pays for editing and print-

101
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913,

ing the catalogue. The balance sheet for the ninth annual issue
showed a credit for that issue of about $1,500 over and above ex-
penses. This is considered a satisfactory showing in view of the fact
that undertakings of this kind are in no sense commercial and can
hardly be expected to meet necessary expenses without aid from an
endowment or some similar source. The enterprise was begun with-
out a working capital other than the sums advanced from time to
time by the Royal Society of London. As interest is paid on all sums
so advanced the financial showing is not what it would have been had
the enterprise possessed a working capital. The sum needed to
completely pay off all obligations and leave a substantial balance for
the maintenance of the central bureau is only about $75,000, and it
would be difficult to find an object more deserving of assistance and
encouragement than this International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture whose purpose is to aid research and investigations in scientific
fields by furnishing a current classified index to the literature of
science. Some idea of the extent of the work may be gained from the
fact that about two and one-half million classified citations were re-
ceived by the central bureau from ,the regional bureaus since the
beginning of the enterprise in 1901, of these over 290,000 were pre-
pared by the regional bureau of the United States.

During the year 27,995 cards were sent from this bureau to the
London Central Bureau, as follows:

Control over the catalogue is vested in a body known as the Inter-
national Convention which has held two meetings in London, the
last being in 1910. In the intervals between the meetings of this
body the administration of the catalogue is directed by the Interna-
tional Council expected to meet in London once in threg years and to
which each country represented by a regional bureau is requested to
send a representative.

Meetings of the International Council were held in 1904, 1907, and
in 1909, and a meeting of the International Convention was held
in 1910, so that a meeting of the International Council was planned
for 1913. This meeting, by a vote of the executive committee, was
postponed until 1914, as a number of new plans for the reduction of
cost and increasing the efficiency of the catalogue were either just
going into effect, or had been in operation but a short time, and it
was felt that the later date would give the members of the council
a better opportunity to judge their value.

Leonarp C. GUNNELL,

Assistant in Charge.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE LANGLEY AERO-
DYNAMICAL LABORATORY.

OFFICIAL STATUS.

Authorization —On May 1, 1918, the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, approving a general scheme submitted by Secretary
Walcott, authorized the secretary, with the approval of the executive
committee, to reopen the Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory; to
appoint an advisory committee; to add, as means are provided, other
laboratories and agencies; to group them into a bureau organization ;
and to secure the cooperation with them of the Government and. other
agencies.

Functions.—The committee is to advise as to the organization and
work of the Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory and of the bureau
organization when adopted, and the coordination of their activities
with the kindred labors of other establishments, governmental and
private; it is to plan for such theoretical and experimental investiga-
tions, tests, and reports as may serve to increase the safety and
effectiveness of aerial locomotion for the purposes of commerce,
national defense, and the welfare of man. But neither the com-
mittee nor the Smithsonian Institution will promote patented devices,
furnish capital to inventors, or manufacture commercially, or give
regular courses of instruction for aeronautical pilots or engineers.

The organization, under regulations to be established and fees to °
be fixed by the secretary, approved by the Smithsonian executive
committee, may exercise its functions for the military and civil de-
partments of the Government of the United States, and also for any
individual, firm, association, or corporation within the United States;
provided, however, that such department, individual, firm, associa-
tion, or corporation shall defray the cost of all material used and of
all services of persons employed in the exercise of such functions.

With the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, the com-
mittee is to collect aeronautical information, such part of the same as
may be valuable to the Government, or the public, to be issued in
bulletins and other publications.

Membership and Privileges—The advisory committee is to be
composed of the director of the Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory, —
when appointed, and one member to be designated by the Secretary —

of War, one by the Secretary of the Navy, one by the Secretary of —

Agriculture, and one by the Secretary of Commerce, together with

such other persons, to be designated by the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, as may be acquainted with the needs of aeronau- —

tics, the total membership of such committee not to exceed 14.

The members of the advisory committee, as such, are to serve

without compensation, but will have refunded the necessary expenses

incurred by them in going to Washington to attend the meetings of

the committee and returning therefrom, and while attending the
meetings.

Approval of the President—On May 9, 1913, the President of the
United States, by request of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-

tution, approved the designation of representatives of the above-

named departments to serve on the advisory committee.
ORGANIZATION.

Officers.—The advisory committee, as constituted at its organiza-
tion meeting, convened by Secretary Walcott at the Smithsonian
Institution, May 28, 1913, comprises a chairman, a recorder, and
12 additional members, all of whom are to serve for one year. The
officers are to be elected annually on or about May 6, and the mem-
bers for the ensuing year are to be appointed prior to the date of
such election.

The chairman. has general supervision of the work of the advisory
committee, presides at its meetings, receives the reports of the sub-
committees, and makes an annual report to the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. Said report must include an account of

_the work done for any department of the Government, individual,
firm, association, or corporation, and the amounts paid by them to
defray the cost of material and services, as hereinbefore mentioned.

The recorder keeps the minutes of the meetings of the committee

and assists the chairman in conducting correspondence and preparing
reports pertaining to the business of the committee.
Subcommittees.—The chairman, with the approval of the advisory —
committee, may appoint standing and special subcommittees to per]
form such functions as may be assigned to them.
The standing subcommittees may have assigned to them investiga-

tions and tests of a permanent character, which they may prosecute —

{
}
;

from year to year and on which they are to make quarterly reports —

to the chairman, followed by an annual report. Each subcommittee
comprises a chairman, who must be a member of the advisory com-
mittee, and others, chosen by him from that committee or elsewhere.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. TL
AGENCIES, RESOURCES, AND FACILITIES.

Smithsonian Institution—The advisory committee has been pro-
vided by the Smithsonian Institution with suitable office headquarters,
an administrative and accounting system, library and publication
facilities, lecture and assembly rooms, and museum space for aero-
nautic models. The Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory has an
income provided for it not to exceed $10,000 the first year (of which
$5,000 has been allotted), and $5,000 annually for five years.

United States Bureau of Standards.—For the exact determina-
tion of aerophysical constants, the calibration of instruments, the
testing of aeronautic engines, propellers, and materials of construc-
tion, the committee has the cooperation of the United States Bureau
of Standards, from which the Secretary of Commerce has designated
one representative.

This bureau has a complete equipment for studying the mechanics
of materials and structural forms used in air-craft; for standard-
izing the physical instruments—thermometers, barographs, pressure
gauges, etc.—used in air navigation; and for testing the power,
efficiency, etc., of aeronautical motors in a current of air representing
the natural conditions of flight.

In these general branches the technical staff of the bureau is pre-
pared to undertake such theoretical and experimental investigations
as may come before the advisory committee on behalf of either the
Government or private individuals or organizations.

United States Weather Bureau.—For studies of and reports on
every phase of aeronautic meteorology, besides the usual forecasting,
the committee has the cooperation of the United States Weather
Bureau, from which the Secretary of Agriculture has designated one
representative.

This bureau has an extensive library of works on or allied to
aeronautics, an instrument division for every type of apparatus for
studying the state of the atmosphere, a whirling table of 30-foot
radius for standardizing anemometers, a complete kite equipment
with power reel, and a sounding balloon equipment with electrolytic
hydrogen plant, all of which are available for scientific investigations.
For special forecasts, anticipating field tests or cross-country voyages,
the general service of the bureau may be called upon.

War and Navy Departments.—These departments, while especially
interested in aeronautics for national defense, can be of service in
advancing the general science. Each has an aeronautical library;
each has an official representative in foreign countries who reports
periodically on every important phase of the art, whether civil or
military; each has an assignment of officers who design, test, and
operate air craft, and who determine largely the scope and character
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

of their development; each has its aeronautic station equipped with
machines in actual service throughout the year. Besides various
aviation establishments, the War Department has a balloon plant at
Fort Myer, Va., and at Omaha, Nebr.; the Navy has its marine model
basin, useful for special experiments in aeronautics, its extensive
shops at the Washington Navy Yard, available for the alteration or
repair of air craft or the manufacture of improved military types,
and at Fort Myer three lofty open-work steel towers suitable for
studies in meteorology or aerodynamics in the natural wind. Further-
more, the Navy Department has detailed an officer for special re-
search in aeronautics at one of the principal engineering schools.
Because of their fundamental interest in aeronautics, each of these
departments has two representatives on the advisory committee,
and each will be able to place at the service of the committee one or
more skilled aviators and aeroplanes for systematic experimentation.

PRESENT NEEDS.

In presenting the needs of the organization, it is well to remark
that the Smithsonian Institution possesses the unique character of
being a private organization having governmental functions and
prerogatives. It can receive appropriations directly from Congress;
it can be the recipient or the custodian of private funds for the in-
crease and diffusion of knowledge; it can deposit such private funds
with the United States Treasury, or place them otherwise, as may be
required by the donor. Likewise, it can be the recipient or custodian
of material objects representing any province of nature or any
branch of human knowledge or art. This unique character allows the
public to anticipate or supplement the cooperation of Congress in
promoting the aerodromical (aeronautical ) work of the Tasticanees

Endowment funds.—Persons approving the purpose of the organi-
zation and desiring its continuity and permanence can not do better
than to provide for it a steady income, either for general or for
specific use. Individual endowment funds bearing the name of the
giver or other person, and presented to the Smithsonian Institution,
or placed in its custody at the disposal of the committee, may be
recommended; also collective funds bearing the name of a society,
organization, or section of the country, whether in the interest of
scientific progress or of national defense.

Temporary funds.—F or the prompt achievement of definite results,
funds may well be offered for immediate application, both of prin-
cipal and interest; as, for example, for the erection of laboratories or
other buildings; for the purchase of experimental air craft, or appa-
ratus, instruments, etc.

Most needed is an expansion of the Langley Aerodynamical Labo-
ratory providing a large and a small wind tunnel, ampler shops, and

 . a. ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 119

instrument and model rooms. Adjacent to this, or forming a part
of it, may well be the headquarters of the committee, with the col-
lections of aeronautic publications and exhibits, and with designing
rooms where plans for air craft may be matured by fabricators in
consultation with the technical staff. This new building, if placed
on the Smithsonian grounds, should be of good architecture and cost
not less than $100,000.

Of immediate importance is an air-craft field laboratory, adjacent
to ample flying space of land and water, and adapted to assembling,
adjusting, and repairing several full-scale land and water aeroplanes,
and subjecting them to indoor tests and measurements, as of stress,
strain, factor of safety, center of gravity, moment of inertia, work-
ing condition, etc. One such plant suitably located would serve all
governmental and civilian requirements for the present. A suitable
site is the public land in Potomac Park in the vicinity of the Smith-
sonian Institution. Here might be held air-craft competitions under
the auspices of the Government.

Prizes and awards—As a stimulus to the highest aeronautic
achievement, or as an honorable recognition thereof, suitable prizes
or awards might advantageously be offered. Provision should be
made for liberal cash prizes for competitive tests of motors, pro-
pellers, etc., in a purely scientific way not trenching upon the prov-
ince of aero clubs.

Fellowships—¥ or the prosecution of special aeronautic investiga-
tions in cooperation with the advisory committee, educational insti-
tutions and scientific or engineering organizations should be pro-
vided with research fellowships whose incumbents may have the
counsel of the committee and the advantage of its equipments.

Until adequate appropriations have been made by the Government
the activities of the organization and committee will have to be
sustained largely by private resources.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS.

The secretary announced the appointment, by jeint resolution of
Congress, approved by the President, of Dr. Andrew D. White, to
serve until June 26, 1918, and of the Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks, to

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.

Senator Bacon, chairman of the executive committee, presented
the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June

ANNUAL REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTHE.

Senator Bacon, chairman, submitted the report of the executive
committee for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912.
On motion, the report was adopted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF PERMANENT COMMITTHE.

The secretary, on behalf of the committee, presented the following
report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1912:

Research Corporation.—The development of the Research Corpo-
ration, which is handling the Cottrell patents offered to the Insti-
tution for the benefit of research, has been progressing steadily
during the past year.

The corporation was organized under the laws of the State of
New York on February 26, 1912, in essential accordance with the
plans explained at the last meeting of the board, on February 8, 1912.

At present a number of installations are being made for the precipi-
tation process that in the near future will bring in a revenue to the
corporation.

The work of the corporation has grown so rapidly that it has been
found necessary to increase the technical staff and office accommo-
dations in New York.

Tt must be understood that in the development of any business of
this character several years are required for experimentation and the
installation of machinery for getting it on a successful working
basis.

The George W. Poore bequest.—Three independent appraisals have
been made of the valuation of the real estate embraced in the Poore
bequest, and a recent offer for the purchase of a few of the lots has
been recommended for acceptance by the permanent committee.

“\
PROCEEDINGS OF REGENTS. 127

A recent report from the executor shows that the estate is being
settled as rapidly as possible.

Avery bequest.—Since the last meeting an offer of $5,335 net has
been received for an unimproved lot on East Capitol Street, and
has been accepted.

On motion, the report was adopted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The secretary presented his annual report on the operations of
the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 380, 1912.

He stated, in relation to the publications issued by the Institution,
that since the last annual meeting of the Regents there had been
printed by the Institution and its branches a total of 161 publica-
tions, aggregating about 7,000 pages of text and 650 plates of illus-
trations. Of this aggregate 90 volumes and pamphlets (2,369 pages
and 193 plates) pertained to the Institution proper; 68 volumes and
pamphlets (3,500 pages and 397 plates) related directly to the work
of the National Museum; and 3 volumes (1,041 pages and 68 plates)
were descriptive of investigations by the Bureau of American
Ethnology. The total number of copies of all publications dis-
tributed during the year was about 180,000.

On motion, the report was accepted.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTER ON THE LANGLEY MEMORIAL TABLET.

Senator Lodge, chairman of the committee, submitted the follow-
ing report:

“ Your committee on the Langley memorial tablet begs to report
that Mr. John Flanagan’s design, which was accepted by the board
at the annual meeting on December 14, 1911, has been cast in bronze,
and is now in the place selected for it, the north vestibule of the
Smithsonian building.”

In this connection the secretary read the following letter:

DECEMBER 10, 1912.
Hon. CHARLES D. WALCOTT,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

DeEar Dr. WAtcotTT: I have the pleasure of informing you that the Aero Club
of Washington expects to celebrate Langley Day on Tuesday, May 6, 1913, by
holding an aviation meet on the Potomac River front, probably at the Wash-
ington Barracks, and will be pleased to have the Smithsonian Institution
participate in that event and any functions which may be associated with it.

The Army and Navy aviators and various wealthy aero clubmen at large,
who own and operate land and water aeroplanes, have expressed their wish to
fly on that occasion.

Invitations to the meet will be sent to the officers (and their wives) of the
Aero Club of America and to the presidents of the 20 or more affiliated clubs,
in addition to the usual Washington list, comprising representatives of the
official and social life of the city.
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

If the Smithsonian Institution contemplate any ceremony for that date or
thereabout, the board of management of the Aero Club will be pleased to
accommodate its plans to any you may have in view for that time.

Very truly, yours,
A. F. ZAHM,
Secretary Aero Club of Washington.

The secretary said that in view of the facts set forth in Dr. Zahm’s
letter it had occurred to him that the Langley Day celebration would
be a very appropriate time for the unveiling of this tablet.

On motion, the report of the committee was accepted with thanks,
and the committee requested to arrange for the unveiling of the
tablet on Langley Day.

THE LANGLEY MEDAL.

The secretary stated that at the annual meeting on December 15,
1908, the board had established the Langley medal, the first of which
had been awarded to the Wright brothers on February 10, 1910.
The committee was now considering another award, and would be
ready to report its recommendations at the meeting of the board in
February next.

THE SECRETARY’S STATEMENT.

National Museum.—The work of installation in the exhibition
halls of the new building has been pushed with so much vigor since
the beginning of the year that in the course of another month the
last of these halls, being those devoted to the mammals and to prehis-
toric archeology, should be ready for the public.

Evans collection.—It is extremely gratifying to note the continued
and very material interest of Mr. William T. Evans, of New York,
in the welfare of the National Gallery of Art. Beginning in 1907
with a tender of 50 paintings by contemporary American artists,
and twice increasing the extent of his offer, first to 100 paintings and
later to 100 artists, Mr. Evans has recently completed this important
gift, which comprises a total of 139 paintings. The collection is not
only the most prominent feature of the gallery now installed in
Washington but is also a remarkable presentation of modern Ameri-
can art.

Senator Lodge submitted the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, by the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, That the
secretary be directed to convey to Mr. William T. Evans the expression of their
sense of deep obligation for his continued and valuable donations to the National
Gallery of Art, constituting a collection representative to a remarkable degree
of the work and talent of contemporary American painters.
PROCEEDINGS OF REGENTS. 129
SMITHSONIAN EXPEDITIONS.

A brief résumé of the results obtained follows:

Biological survey of the Panama Canal Zone.—This survey was
completed and the work accomplished was very valuable to science.
It included collections and observations of vertebrate animals, land
and fresh-water mollusks, and flowering plants (including grasses)
and ferns. Collections had been made of fishes, reptiles, and amphib-
ians, birds and mammals, and special studies and collections had
been made of the microscopic plant and animal life of the fresh
waters of the zone. Pamphlets had been issued from time to time
describing new forms of animals and plants, and as soon as the mass
of material could be worked up a more general account of the results
of the survey would be accomplished.

Rainey African expedition—The Paul J. Rainey expedition re-
ferred to at the last meeting came to a successful close during the
winter of 1911-12. Mr. Edmund Heller, a Smithsonian naturalist
and a member of the Smithsonian African expedition, accompanied
Mr. Rainey and reported collections as follows:

During the entire expedition Mr. Heller was Mr. Rainey’s guest.
Mr. Rainey gave him all the native assistants that he could use and
accorded him perfect freedom as regards choice of collecting ground.

_ Mr. Heller was thus able to visit the exact regions from which ma-

terial was most needed to supplement that procured by the Smith-
sonian African expedition. After studying the mammals in the
_ British Museum Mr. Heller reported that the United States National
_ Museum now had the finest series of East African mammals in the
world.

Eighty lions were secured on the expedition, which more than
tripled the highest previous record for Africa.

The Childs-Frick African expedition—This expedition left New
York in October, 1911, and arrived at Djibouti, on the Red Sea, in
_ French Somaliland, November 22. As previously stated, it was ac-
- companied by Col. Edgar A. Mearns, United States Army, retired,
» who was a member of the Smithsonian African expedition.

The Frick party traversed the territory lying north of that visited
by: Col. Roosevelt and Mr. Rainey, covering at the samé time certain
_ parts of Abyssinia, northern British East Africa, and the: meres

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

lying about Lake Rudolf. The expedition ended about September 1, |
1912, and the party sailed for America on September 16, |

The collections as a whole embraced plants, mammals, birds, rep-—
tiles, bactrachians, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, and other inverte-
brates. About 5,000 birds were obtained for the National Museum.

Borneo expedition—The board would recall that Dr. W. L. Ab-
bott, a collaborator of the United States National Museum, very
generously contributed the sum of $5,000 for carrying on an expedi-
tion to Dutch East Borneo. Reports had been received that the ex-
pedition was successful, but as yet the specimens acquired had not
been shipped. )

Lyman Siberian expedition—The expedition to the Altai Moun-
tains, in Siberia, which was financed by Dr. Theodore Lyman, of
Cambridge, Mass., left Washington May 21, 1912, and returned Sep-
tember 16, 1912. As arranged, Mr. Ned Hollister, a naturalist in
the National Museum, accompanied Dr. Lyman. The expedition re-
sulted in the securing of 350 mammals, 300 birds, and 100 miscel-
laneous specimens. |

The mammals would remain in the National Museum, while the
birds were intended for the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam-
bridge. The scientific work was entirely in charge of Mr. Hollister,
assisted by an experienced alpinist, Conrad Kain. The region cov-
ered lay in the Kurai district, Government of Tomsk. The collection
of mammals was one of the mcst important received in recent years, as
the region was hitherto unrepresented in the Museum, and the fauna
was of special interest on account of its close relationship with that
of the United States.

British Columbia expedition.—Under the direction of the secretary
an expedition was undertaken in British Columbia north of the
Yellowhead Pass route of the new Grand Trunk Pacific Railway.

Outfitting at Fitzhugh, the party entered the high mountain
ranges northwest of the Yellowhead Pass, 275 miles north of the
forty-ninth parallel—the boundary between the United States and
Canada. Two of the young men of the party collected mammals,
the skins and skulls of which are now in the National Museum.

The special work of the secretary was to determine upon the best
locality for a geological section of the mountain ranges forming the
main mass of the Canadian Rockies in this region. A general section
was carried across the main range in such a manner as to ascertain
that there was a thickness of some 12,000 feet of Cambrian fossil-— |
iferous sedimentary rocks and 3,000 feet of Ordovician strata above.
In other words, the main mountain peaks and ridges of this region,
one of the most picturesque known in America, were carved by the
action of rain, frost, snow, and ice from this great series of sandstones
and limestones. ;

PROCEEDINGS OF REGENTS. 1B)

Large collections were also made from the famous Burgess Pass
fossil locality.

Algerian eupeditionIn 1911 the attention of the board was
called to the work of Director Abbot, of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, in connection with studies of the sun as a variable star. He was
sent to Bassour, Algeria, to observe the so-called “solar constant of
radiation,” while similar observations were made at the Mount
Wilson (Cal.) station by Assistant L. B. Aldrich. These measure-
ments had been reduced and strongly confirm the supposed variability
of the sun.

In May, 1912, Mr. Abbot returned to Algeria, while Aid F. E.
Fowle made observations in California. The results were not yet
reduced, but little doubt was felt that they would be quite sufficient
to fully prove the supposed variability of the sun.

A most interesting observation was made by Messrs. Abbot and
Fowle in connection with this work. It will be recalled that on
June 6, 1912, a volcanic eruption took place in Alaska. Mr. Abbot
noted on June 19 (only 13 days after the eruption) a smoky appear-
ance in the sky, which rapidly increased. Throughout the remainder
of his stay in Algeria the sky assumed a whitish hazy appearance
and the quantity of the direct radiation from the sun was reduced
about 25 per cent below that he had observed in the preceding year.
Similarly, Mr. Fowle observed the same appearances beginning with
June 21, but owing to the greater elevation of his station on Mount
Wilson the decrease in the intensity of the direct solar radiation
was not quite so great as had been found in Algeria. Similar effects
were noted in Washington, beginning June 11, and have lasted ever
since.

Mr. Abbot made in Algeria some measurements of the radiation
diffused from the sky, and he drew the conclusion that the total
radiation of the sky and the sun combined was less during the sum-
mer of 1912 by about 7 or 8 per cent than generally during the same
months. This defect in the quantity of the radiation available to
warm the earth would naturally have produced a decrease in the

earth’s temperature. Hence the pronounced coolness of the past

summer seems to be explained as due to the world-wide dissemina-
tion of a blanket of volcanic dust from the Alaska eruption.

Lake Baikal region, Siberia.—Mr. George Mixter, of Boston, Mass.,
an experienced big-game hunter, volunteered to get material for the
Museum at and near Lake Baikal during the summer of 1912 and was
appointed a collaborator for two years. He reports the capture of

‘two bear, several Baikal seal, various small mammals, and a collec-

tion of fish from the lake, but no specimens have been received. He
has not yet returned.
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

British North Borneo.—Mr. D. D. Streeter, jr., of Brooklyn, N. Y.,
volunteered to collect in British North Borneo for the Museum and ~
was appointed collaborator for two years. He left New York about —
April 15, 1912, and has sent a few reptiles and bats taken in Algeria
on his way eastward.

Alaskan boundary.—Mr. Copley Amory, jr., of Cambridge, Mass.,
volunteered to accompany the Coast and Geodetic Survey party en-
gaged in surveying the Alaskan-Canadian boundary. He was ap-
pointed collaborator of the National Museum and joined the party
in the field about July 10, 1912, remaining throughout the season.
He reports excellent results, including the capture of six or more
caribou, probably of a species hitherto known from a few skulls only,
but no specimens have yet been received.

North China—Mr. A. de C. Sowerby is making collections in
North China for the National Museum through the liberality of a
gentleman who desires that his identity be not disclosed. Mr. Sow-
erby’s work has been interrupted by the Chinese revolution, but he
has recently sent in six wild sheep, two Manchurian wapiti, and a
few other mammals, birds, and reptiles collected in northern Shansi
in May, 1912.

Siberia and Mongolia.—\ would ask the board’s attention to the
anthropological researches conducted in Siberia and Mongolia by
Dr. AleS Hrdlicka, Curator, division of physical anthropology,
United States National Museum, as mentioned on page 11 of the
annual report. Dr. Hrdiléka is now preparing for an expedition
to South America, where he will work in conjunction with the
Panama-California Exposition of San Diego. His specimens will
ultimately find their way to the National Museum.

DONATION OF JOHN B. HENDERSON, JR.

The secretary stated that Mr. Henderson had donated the sum of
$500 for the construction at the Zoological Park of an outside cage
for the parrots, in which these birds were now thriving satisfactorily.

Mr. Choate offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian In-
stitution are hereby tendered to their colleague, Mr. John B. Henderson, jr.,

for his generosity in providing the funds requisite for the construction of an
open-air cage for certain birds at the National Zoological Park.

GIFT OF MRS. EDWARD H. HARRIMAN.

The secretary announced the gift to the Institution by Mrs. Ed-
ward H. Harriman of a set of the publication, The North American
Indian, by Edward 8. Curtis, a project involving 20 volumes and
an expenditure from first to last of nearly $1,000,000.

Hight volumes and portfolios had been issued and delivered to the
Institution, and the remaining 12 would be received as printed.

Judge Gray offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian In-
stitution be tendered to Mrs. Edward H. Harriman for the gift of a set of

The North American Indian, by Edward S. Curtis, and especially for the kindly
feeling that prompted her in bestowing this valuable work upon the Institution.

SMITHSONIAN AFRICAN EXPEDITION.

The secretary spoke as follows:

“Considerable interest is being taken by the public in relation
to the disposition of the collections made by the Smithsonian African
expedition under the leadership of Col. Theodore Roosevelt, also as
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

to the people who contributed the money for paying the propor-
tionate share of the expenses of the three men sent out by the Smith-
sonian with Col. Roosevelt.

“The collections, when received, were distributed to the various
departments of the National Museum to which they pertained; the
birds were sent to the bird department, the large animals to the
mammal] department, the plants to the botanical department, and so
on. A number of groups of the large mammals have been prepared,
and a number of individual specimens mounted for exhibition pur-
poses. The greater portion of the specimens have been placed in
the study series, and the duplicates will be distributed by exchange
or otherwise.

“The groups of large mammals now mounted will shortly be
placed on exhibition in the new museum mammal hall where the
larger animals will be exhibited. Those that were on exhibition have
been temporarily withdrawn, in order to assign them to their proper
place in the classification in the hall, which is closed temporarily
pending the arrangement of the cases containing the specimens.

“Tt now seems an opportune time to make a final statement relat-
ing to the expedition, and with this in view the secretary recently
communicated with the parties who contributed to the fund, and has
thus far received replies from the following that they have no objec-
tion to their names being given to the public. In this connection the
secretary wishes to state that up to this week Col. Roosevelt has not
known who the contributers were, with the exception of Mr. Carnegie
and possibly one or two personal friends.

“Tt has not been the custom of the Institution to publish the
names of contributors to research work or expeditions conducted
under its direction until such enterprise had been completed, and only
then when the contributor had no objection to such publication.

“The contributors include Mr. Edward D. Adams, of New York
City; Hon. Robert Bacon, of Boston, Mass.; Mr. Cornelius N. Bliss,
of New York City; Mr. James Campbell, of St. Louis, Mo.; Mr.
W. Bayard Cutting, of New York City; Mr. Andrew Carnegie, of
New York City; Mr. Cleveland H. Dodge, of New York City; Mr.

“From the contributions the Smithsonian’s three-fifths’ share of
all the expenses were paid; the other two-fifths were paid by Col.
Roosevelt, which covered all his personal expenses and those of his
son and their proportionate two-fifths’ share of the total expenses
of the expedition.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1913

141
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GznrraL Aprenpix to the Annual Report of the ~
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the institution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of
its history, been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for 80 years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-

inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,

meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and dis-
cussion. This method has been continued in the present report for
1913.

THE EARTH AND SUN AS MAGNETS:

By Dr. GrorcGe. ELLERY HALE,’
Mount Wilson Solar Observatory.

[ With 8 plates. ]

In 1891 Prof. Arthur Schuster, speaking before the Royal Insti-
tution, asked a question which has been widely debated in recent
years: “Is every large rotating body a magnet?” Since the days of
Gilbert, who first recognized that the earth is a great magnet, many
theories have been advanced to account for its magnetic properties.
Biot, in 1805, ascribed them to a relatively short magnet near its
center. Gauss, after an extended mathematical investigation, sub-
stituted a large number of small magnets, distributed in an irregu-
lar manner, for the single magnet of Biot. Grover suggested that
terrestrial magnetism may be caused by electric currents, circulating
around the earth and generated by the solar radiation. Soon after
Rowland’s demonstration in 1876, that a rotating electrically charged
body produces a magnetic field, Ayrton and Perry attempted to
apply this principle to the case of the earth. Rowland at once
pointed out a mistake in their calculation, and showed that the high
potential electric charge demanded by their theory could not possibly
exist on the earth’s surface. It remained for Schuster to suggest
that a body made up of molecules which are neutral in the ordinary
electrical or magnetic sense may nevertheless develop magnetic prop-
erties when rotated.

We shall soon have occasion to examine the two hypotheses ad-
vanced in support of this view. While both are promising, it can
not be said that either has been sufficiently developed to explain com-
pletely the principal phenomena of terrestrial magnetism. If we
turn to experiment, we find that iron globes spun at great velocity
in the laboratory fail to exhibit magnetic properties. But this can:
be accounted for on either hypothesis. What we need is a globe of
great size, which has been rotating for centuries at high velocity.
The sun, with a diameter 100 times that of the earth (fig. 1), may

revision and to insert the results of recent observations, but he has been prevented by

throw some light on the problem. Its high temperature wholly pre-
cludes the existence of permanent magnets, hence any magnetism it
may exhibit must be due to motion. Its great mass and rapid linear
velocity of rotation should produce a magnetic field much stronger
than that of the earth. Finally, the presence in its atmosphere of
glowing gases and the well-known effect of magnetism on light
should enable us to explore its magnetic field even at the distance of
the earth. The effects of ionization, probably small in the region of
nigh pressure beneath the photosphere and marked in the solar atmos-
phere, must be determined and allowed for. But with this important
limitation the sun may be used by the physicist for an experiment
which can not be performed in the best equipped laboratory.
Schuster, in the lecture already cited, remarked:

The form of the corona suggests a further hypothesis which, extravagant as
it may appear at present, may yet prove to be true. Is the sun a magnet?

Summing up the situation in April, 1912, he repeated:

The evidence (whether the sun is a magnet) rests entirely on the form of
certain rays of the corona, which—assuming that they indicate the path of pro-
jecting particles—seem to be deflected as they would be in a magnetic field, but
this evidence is not at all decisive.

There remained the possibility of an appeal to a conclusive test
of magnetism—the characteristic changes it produces in light which
originates in a magnetic field.

Before describing how this test has been applied, let us rapidly
_ recapitulate some of the principal facts of terrestrial magnetism.
You see upon the screen the image of a steel sphere (fig. 2), which
has been strongly magnetized. If iron filings are sprinkled over
the glass plate that supports it, each minute particle becomes a mag-
net under the influence of the sphere. When the plate is tapped, to
relieve the friction, the particles fall into place along the lines of
force, revealing a characteristic pattern of great beauty. A small
compass needle, moved about the sphere, always turns so as to point
along the lines of force. At the magnetic poles it points toward
the center of the sphere. Midway between them, at the equator, it
is parallel to the diameter joining the poles.

As the earth is a magnet it should exhibit lines of force resembling
those of the sphere. If the magnetic poles coincided with the poles
of rotation, a freely suspended magnetic needle should point ver-
tically downward at one pole, vertically upward at the other, and
horizontally at the equator. A dip needle, used to map the lines
of force of the earth, is shown on the screen. I have chosen for
illustration an instrument designed for use at sea, on the non-
magnetic yacht Carnegie, partly because the equipment used by

Dr. Bauer in his extensive surveys represents the best now in use,
and also because I wish to contrast the widely different means em-
ployed by the Carnegie Institution for the investigation of solar and
terrestrial magnetic phenomena. The support of the dip needle is
hung in gimbals, so that observations may be taken when the ship’s
deck is inclined. The smallest possible amount of metal enters into
the construction of this vessel, and where its use could not be avoided,
bronze was employed instead of iron or steel. She is thus admirably
adapted for magnetic work, as is shown by the observations secured
on voyages already totaling more than 100,000 miles. Her work
is supplemented by that of land parties, bearing instruments to re-
mote regions where magnetic observations have never before been
made.

The dip needle clearly shows that the earth is a magnet, for it
behaves in nearly the same way as the little needle used in our ex-
periment with the magnetized sphere. But the magnetic poles of
the earth do not coincide with the geographical poles. The north
magnetic pole, discovered by Ross and last visited by Amundsen
in 1903, lies near Baflfins Bay, in latitude 70° north, longitude
97° west. The position of the south magnetic pole, calculated from
observations made in its vicinity by Capt. Scott, of glorious memory,
in his expedition of 1901-1904, is 72° 50’ south latitude, 153° 45’
east longitude. Thus the two magnetic poles are not only displaced
about 30° from the geographical poles; they do not even lie on the
same diameter of the earth. Moreover, they are not fixed in posi-
tion, but appear to be rotating about the geographical poles in a
period of about 900 years. In addition to these peculiarities, it
must be added that the dip needle shows the existence of local mag-
netic poles, one of which has recently been found by Dr. Bauer’s
party at Treadwell Point, Alaska. At such a place the direction of
the needle undergoes rapid change as it is moved about the local
pole.

The dip needle, as we have seen, is free to move in a vertical
plane. The compass needle moves in a horizontal plane. In general,
it tends to point toward the magnetic pole, and as this does not
correspond with the geographical pole, there are not many places on
the earth’s surface where the needle indicates true north and south.

_ Local peculiarities, such as deposits of iron ore, also affect its direc-

_ tion very materially. Thus a variation chart, which indicates the

- deviation of the compass needle from geographical north, affords an

excellent illustration of the irregularities of terrestrial magnetism.

_ The necessity for frequent and accurate surveys of the earth’s mag-

: netic field is illustrated by the fact that the Carnegie has found errors
i of 5° or 6° in the variation charts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

In view of the earth’s heterogeneous structure, which is sufficiently
“strated by its topographical features, marked deviations from the

SANG s
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

uniform magnetic properties of a magnetized steel sphere are not at
all surprising. The phenomenon of the secular variation, or the
rotation of the magnetic poles about the geographical poles, is one
of the peculiarities toward the solution of which both theory and
experiment should be directed.

Passing over other remarkable phenomena of terrestrial mag-
netism, we come to magnetic storms and auroras, which are almost
certainly of solar origin.

Here is a photograph of part of the sun, as it appears in the tele-
scope (fig.3).1 Scattered over its surface are sun spots, which increase
and decrease in number in a period of about 11.3 years. It is well
known that a curve, showing the number of spots on the sun, is closely
similar to a curve representing the variations of intensity of the
earth’s magnetism. The time of maximum sun spots corresponds
with that of reduced intensity of the earth’s magnetism, and the
parallelism of the two curves is too close to be the result of accident.
We may therefore conclude that there is some connection between the
spotted area of the sun and the magnetic field of the earth.

We shall consider a little later the nature of sun spots, but for the
present we may regard them simply as solar storms. When spots are
numerous the entire sun is disturbed, and eruptive phenomena, far
transcending our most violent volcanic outbursts, are frequently
visible. In the atmosphere of the sun, gaseous prominences rise to
great heights. This one, reaching an elevation of 85,000 miles, is
of the quiescent type, which changes gradually in form and is abun-
dantly found at all phases of the sun’s activity. But such eruptions
as the one of March 25, 1895, photographed with the spectrohelio-
graph of the Kenwood Observatory, are clearly of an explosive na-
ture. As these photographs show, it shot upward through a distance
of 146,000 miles in 24 minutes, after which it faded away.

When great and rapidly changing spots, usually accompanied by
eruptive prominences, are observed on the sun, brilliant displays of
the aurora (fig. 6) and violent magnetic storms are often reported.
The magnetic needle, which would record a smooth straight line on
the photographic film if it were at rest, trembles and vibrates, draw-
ing a broken and irregular curve. Simultaneously, the aurora flashes
and pulsates, sometimes lighting up the northern sky with the most
brilliant display of red and green discharges.

Birkeland and Stérmer have worked out a theory which accounts
in a very satisfactory way for these phenomena. They suppose that
electrified particles, shot out from the sun with great velocity, are
drawn in toward the earth’s magnetic poles along the lines of force.
Striking the rarified gases of the upper atmosphere, they illuminate

1 Figs. 3, 4, and 5 represent the same region of the sun, photographed at successively
higher levels. , F
EARTH AND SUN AS MAGNETS—HALE. 149

them, just as the electric discharge lights up a vacuum tube. There
is reason to believe that the highest part of the earth’s atmosphere
consists of rarified hydrogen, while nitrogen predominates at a
lower level. Some of the electrons from the sun are absorbed in
the hydrogen, above a height of 60 miles. Others reach the lower-
lying nitrogen, and descend to levels from 30 to 40 miles above the
earth’s surface. Certain still more penetrating rays sometimes reach
an altitude of 25 miles, the lowest hitherto found for the aurora.
The passage through the atmosphere of the electrons which cause
the aurora also gives rise to the irregular disturbances of the mag-
netic needle observed during magnetic storms.

The outflow of electrons from the sun never ceases, if we may
reason from the fact that the night sky is at all times feebly illumi-
nated by the characteristic light of the aurora. But when sun spots
are numerous, the discharge of electrons is most violent, thus ex-
plaining the frequency of brilliant auroras and intense magnetic
storms during sun-spot maxima. It should be remarked that the
discharge of electrons does not necessarily occur from the spots
themselves, but rather from the eruptive regions surrounding them.

Our acquaintance with vacuum-tube discharges dates from an early
period, but accurate knowledge of these phenomena may be said to
begin with the work of Sir William Crookes in 1876. A glass tube,
fitted with electrodes, and filled with any gas, is exhausted with a
suitable pump until the pressure within it is very low. When a high-
voltage discharge is passed through the tube, a stream of negatively
charged particles is shot out from the cathode, or negative pole, with
great velocity. These electrons, bombarding the molecules of the
gas within the tube, produce a brillant illumination, the character of
which depends upon the nature of the gas. The rare hydrogen gas
in the upper atmosphere of the earth, when bombarded by electrons
from the sun, glows like the hydrogen in this tube. Nitrogen, which
is characteristic of a lower level, shines with the light which can be
duplicated here.

But it may be remarked that this explanation of the aurora is
only hypothetical, in the absence of direct evidence of the emission
of electrons by the sun. However, we do know that hot bodies emit
electrons. Here is a carbon filament in an exhausted bulb. When
heated white hot a stream of electrons passes off. Falling upon this
electrode the electrons discharge the electroscope with which it is
connected. Everyone who has to discard old incandescent lamps
is familiar with the result of this outflow. The blackening of the
bulbs is due to finely divided carbon carried away by the electrons
and deposited upon the glass.

_ Now, we know that great quantities of carbon in a vaporous state
exist in the sun and that many other substances also present there
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

emit electrons in the same way. Hence we may infer that electrons
are abundant in the solar atmosphere.

The temperature of the sun is between 6,000° and 7,000° C., twice
as high as we can obtain by artificial means. Under solar condi-
tions, the velocity of the electrons emitted in regions where the pres-
sure is not too great may be sufficient to carry them to the earth.
Arrhenius holds that the electrons attach themselves to molecules or
groups of molecules and are then driven to the earth by lght
pressure.

In certain regions of the sun we have strong evidence of the
existence of free electrons. This leads us to the question of solar
magnetism and suggests a comparison of the very different condi-
tions in the sun and earth. Much alike in chemical composition, these
bodies differ principally in size, in density, and in temperature. The
diameter of the sun is more than 100 times that of the earth, while
its density is only one-quarter as great. But the most striking point
of difference is the high temperature of the sun, which is much
more than sufficient to vaporize all known substances. This means
that no permanent magnetism, such as is exhibited by a steel magnet
or a lodestone, can exist in the sun. For if we bring this steel magnet
to a red heat it loses its magnetism and drops the iron bar which it
previously supported. Hence, while some theories attribute ter-
restrial magnetism -to the presence within the earth of permanent
magnets, no such theory can apply to the sun. If magnetic phe-
nomena are to be found there they must result from other causes.

The familiar case of the helix illustrates how a magnetic field is
produced by an electric current flowing through a coil of wire. But
according to the modern theory, an electric current is a stream of
electrons. Thus a stream of electrons in the sun should give rise to a
magnetic field. If the electrons were whirled in a powerful vortex,
resembling our tornadoes or waterspouts, the analogy with the wire
helix would be exact, and the magnetic field might be sufficiently
intense to be detected by spectroscopic observations.

A sun spot, as seen with a telescope or photographed in the ordi-
nary way, does not appear to be a vortex. If we examine the solar
atmosphere above and about the spots, we find extensive clouds of
luminous calcium vapor, invisible to the eye, but easily photographed
with the spectroheliograph by admitting no lght to the sensitive
plate except that radiated by calcium vapor. These calcium floceuli
(fig. 4), like the cumulus clouds of the earth’s atmosphere, exhibit no
well-defined linear structure. But if we photograph the sun with the
red light of hydrogen, we find a very different condition of affairs
(fig. 5). In this higher region of the solar atmosphere, first photo-
graphed on Mount Wilson in 1908, cyclonic whirls, centering in sun
spots, are clearly shown.

The idea that sun spots may be solar tornadoes, which was strongly
suggested by such photographs, soon received striking confirmation.
A great cloud of hydrogen, which had hung for several days on the
edge of one of these vortex structures, was suddenly swept into the
spot at a velocity of about 60 miles per second. More recently
Slocum has photographed at the Yerkes Observatory a prominence at
the edge of the sun, flowing into a spot with a somewhat lower
velocity.

Thus we were led to the hypothesis that sun spots are closely
analogous to tornadoes or waterspouts in the earth’s atmosphere
(fig. 7). If this were true, electrons caught and whirled in the spot
vortex should produce a magnetic field. Fortunately, this could be
put to a conclusive test through the well-known influence of mag-
netism on light discovered by Zeeman in 1896.

In Zeeman’s experiment a flame containing sodium vapor was
placed between the poles of a powerful electromagnet. The two
yellow sodium lines, observed with a spectroscope of high dispersion,
were seen to widen the instant a magnetic field was produced by pass-
ing a current through the coils of the magnet. It was subsequently
found that most of the lines of the spectrum, which are single
under ordinary conditions, are split into three components when the
radiating source is in a sufficiently intense magnetic field. This
is the case when the observation is made at right angles to the lines
of force. When looking along the lines of force, the central line
of such a triplet disappears (fig. 8), and the light of the two side com-
ponents is found to be circularly polarized in opposite directions.
With suitable polarizing apparatus, either component of such a line
can be cut off at will, leaving the other unchanged. Furthermore, a
double line having these characteristic properties can be produced
only by a magnetic field. Thus it becomes a simple matter to detect
a magnetic field at any distance by observing its effect on light
emitted within the field. If a sun spot is an electric vortex, and the
observer is supposed to look along the axis of the whirling vapor,
which would correspond with the direction of the lines of force, he
should find the spectrum lines double, and be able to cut off either
component with the palarizing attachment of his spectroscope.

I applied this test to sun spots on Mount Wilson in June, 1908,
with the 60-foot tower telescope, and at once found all of the char-
acteristic features of the Zeeman effect. Most of the lines of the
sun-spot spectrum are merely widened by the magnetic field, but
others are split into separate components (fig. 9), which can be
cut off at will by the observer. Moreover, the opportune formation
of two large spots, which appeared on the spectroheliograph plates
to be rotating in opposite directions (fig. 10), permitted a still more
exacting experiment to be tried. In the laboratory, where the polar-
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

izing apparatus is so adjusted as to transmit one component of a
tine doubled by a magnetic field, this disappears and is replaced by
the other component when the direction of the current is reversed.
In other words, one component is visible alone when the observer
looks toward the north pole of the magnet, while the other appears
alone when he looks toward the south pole. If electrons of the same
kind are rotating in opposite directions in two sun-spot vortexes, the
observer should be looking toward a north pole in one spot and to-
ward a south pole in the other. Hence the opposite components of
a magnetic double line should appear in two such spots. As our
photographs show, the result of the test was in harmony with my
anticipation.

I may not pause to describe the later developments of this investi-
gation, though two or three points must be mentioned. The intensity
of the magnetic field in sun spots is sometimes as high as 4,500
gausses, or 9,000 times the intensity of the earth’s field. In
passing upward from the sun’s surface the magnetic intensity de-
creases very rapidly—so rapidly, in fact as to suggest the existence
of an opposing field. It is probable that the vortex which produces
the observed field is not the one that appears on our photograph, but
lies at a lower level. In fact, the vortex structure shown on spectro-
heliograph plates may represent the effect rather than the cause of
the sun-spot field. We may have, as Brester and Deslandres suggest,
a condition analogous to that illustrated in the aurora: Electrons,
falling in the solar atmosphere, move along the lines of force of the
magnetic field into spots. In this way we may perhaps account for
the structure surrounding pairs of spots, of opposite polarity, which
constitute the typical sun-spot group. The resemblance of the struc-
ture near these two bipolar groups to the lines of force about a bar
magnet is very striking, especially when the disturbed condition-of
the solar atmosphere, which tends to mask the effect, is borne in
mind. It is not unlikely that the bipolar group is due to a single
vortex, of the horseshoe type, such as we may see in water after
every sweep of an oar.

We thus have abundant evidence of the existence on the sun of
local magnetic fields of great intensity—fields so extensive that the
earth is small in comparison with many of them. But how may we
account for the copious supply of electrons needed to generate the
powerful currents required in such enormous electromagnets? Neu-
tral molecules, postulated in theories of the earth’s field, will not
suffice. A marked preponderance of electrons of one sign is clearly
indicated.

An interesting experiment, due to Harker, will help us here.

the rods projecting from the furnace are connected toa galvanometer.
Harker found that when one of the carbon terminals within the fur-
nace was cooler than the other a stream of negative electrons flowed
toward it from the hotter electrode. Even at atmospheric pressure
currents of several amperes were produced in this way.t

Our spectroscopic investigations, interpreted by laboratory experi-
ments, are in harmony with those of Fowler in proving that sun
spots are comparatively cool regions in the solar atmosphere. They
are hot enough, it is true, to volatilize such refractory elements as
titanium, but cool enough to permit the formation of certain com-
pounds not found elsewhere in the sun. Hence, from Harker’s ex-
periment, we may expect a flow of negative electrons toward spots.
These, caught and whirled in the vortex, would easily account for
the observed magnetic fields.

The conditions existing in sun spots are thus without any close
parallel among the natural phenomena of the earth. The sun-spot
vortex is not unlike a terrestial tornado, on a vast scale, but if the
whirl of ions in a tornado produces a magnetic field, it is too feeble
to be readily detected. Thus, while we have demonstrated the ex-
istence of solar magnetism, it is confined to limited areas. We must
look further if we would throw new light on the theory of the mag-
netic properties of rotating bodies.

This leads us to the question with which we atatteel: Ts the sun
a magnet, like the earth? The structure of the corona, as revealed at
total eclipses, points strongly in this direction. Remembering the
lines of force of our magnetized steel sphere, we can not fail to be
struck by their close resemblance to the polar streamers in these
beautiful photographs of the corona (fig. 11) taken by Lick Observa-
tory eclipse parties, for which I am indebted to Prof. Campbell.
Bigelow, in 1889, investigated this coronal structure and showed that
it is very similar to the lines of force of a spherical magnet. Stormer,
guided by his own researches on the aurora, has calculated the tra-
jectories of electrons moving out from the sun under the influence
of a general magnetic field and compared these trajectories with the
coronal streamers. The resemblance is apparently too close to be the
result of chance. Finally, Deslandres has investigated the forms and
motion of solar prominences, which he finds to behave as they would
in a magnetic field of intensity about one-millionth that of the earth.
We may thus infer the existence of a general solar magnetic field.
But since the sign of the charge of the outflowing electrons is not
certainly known, we can not determine the polarity of the sun in
this way. Furthermore, our present uncertainty as to the propor-
tion at different levels of positive and negative electrons and of the

1 King has recently found that the current decreases very rapidly as the pressure in-
creases, but is still appreciable at a pressure of 20 atmospheres.
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

perturbations due to currents in the solar atmosphere must delay the
most effective application of these methods, though they promise
much future knowledge of the magnetic field at high levels in sa
solar atmosphere.

Of the field at low levels, however, they may tell us little or noth-
ing, for the distribution of the electrons may easily be such as to
give rise to a field caused by the rotation of the solar atmosphere,
which may oppose in sign the field due to the rotation of the body of
the sun. To detect this latter field, the magnetic field of the sun as
distinguished from that of the sun’s atmosphere, we must resort to
the method employed in the case of sun spots—the study of the
Zeeman effect. If this is successful it will not only show beyond
doubt whether the sun is a magnet; it will also permit the polarity
of the sun to be compared with that of the earth, gives a measure of
the strength of the field at different latitudes and indicate the sign
of the charge that a rotating sphere must possess if it is to produce a
similar field.

I first endeavored to apply this test with the 60-foot tower tele-
scope in 1908, but the results were too uncertain to command con-
fidence.

Thanks to additional appropriations from the Carnegie Institute
of Washington, a new and powerful instrument was available on
Mount Wilson for a continuation of the investigation in January,
1912. The new tower telescope has a focal length of 150 feet (fig.
12). To prevent vibration in the wind, the ccelostat, second mirror,
and object glass are carried by a skeleton tower, each vertical and
diagonal member of which is inclosed within the corresponding
member of an outer skeleton tower, which also carries a dome to
shield the instruments from the weather. In the photograph we
see only the hollow members of the outer tower. But within each
of them, well separated from possible contact, a sectional view would
show the similar but more slender members of the tower that sup-
port the instruments. The plan has proved to be successful, per-
mitting observations demanding the greatest steadiness of the solar
image to be made.

The arrangements are similar to those of the 60-foot tower. The
solar image, 164 inches in diameter, falls on the slit of a spectro-
graph (fig. 13) in the observation house at the ground level. The
spectrograph, of 75 feet focal length, enjoys the advantage of great
stability and constancy of temperature in its subterranean vault
beneath the tower. In the third order spectrum, used for this in-
vestigation, the D lines of the solar spectrum are 29 millimeters
apart. The resolving power of the excellent Michelson grating is
sufficient to show 75 lines of the iodine absorption spectrum in this
space between the D’s. Thus the instruments are well suited for

the exacting requirements of a difficult investigation. For it must
be borne in mind that the problem is very different from that of
detecting the magnetic fields in sun spots, where the separation of
the lines is from 50 to 100 times as great as we may expect to
find here. Thus the sun’s general field can produce no actual separa-
tion of the lines. But it may cause a very slight widening, which
should appear as a displacement when suitable polarizing apparatus
is used. This is so arranged as to divide the spectrum longitudi-
nally into narrow strips. The component toward the red end of
the spectrum of a line widened by magnetism should appear in one
strip, the other component in the next strip. Hence, if the sun has
a magnetic field of sufficient strength, the line should have a dentated
appearance. The small relative displacements of the lines on suc-
cessive strips, when measured under a microscope, should give the
strength of the magnetic field.

The above remarks apply strictly to the case when the observer is
looking directly along the lines of force. At other angles neither
component is completely cut off, and the magnitude of the displace-
ment will then depend upon two things: The strength of the mag-
netic field and the angle between the line of sight and the lines of
force. Assuming that the lines of force of the sun correspond with
those of a magnetized sphere, and also that the magnetic poles coin-
cide with the poles of rotation, it is possible to calculate what the
relative displacement should be at different solar latitudes. These
theoretical displacements are shown graphically by the sine curve on
the screen (fig. 14).

We see from the curve that the greatest displacements should be
found at 45° north and south latitude, and that from these points
they should decrease toward zero at the equator and the poles. Fur-
thermore, the curve shows that we may apply the same crucial test
used in the case of sun spots; the direction of the displacements,
toward red or violet, should be reversed in the northern and southern
hemispheres.

TI shall not trouble you with the details of the hundreds of photo-
graphs and the thousands of measures which have been made by my
colleagues and myself during the past year. In view of the diffuse
character of the solar lines under such high dispersion and the ex-
ceedingly small displacements observed, the results must be given
with some reserve, though they appear to leave no doubt as to the
reality of the effect. Observations in the second order spectrum
failed to give satisfactory indications of the field. But with the
higher dispersion of the third order 11 independent determinations,
made with every possible precaution to eliminate bias, show opposite
displacements in the northern and southern hemispheres decreasing
in magnitude from about 45° north and south latitude to the equator.
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

Three of these determinations were pushed as close to the poles as
conditions would permit, and the observed displacements may be
compared with the theoretical curve (fig. 14). In view of the very
small magnitude of the displacements, which never surpass 0.002
Angstroms, the agreement is quite as satisfactory as one could expect
for a first approximation.

The full details of the investigation are given in a paper recently
published.t| The reader will find an account of the precautions taken
to eliminate error, and, I trust, no tendency to underestimate the
possible adverse bearing of certain negative results. It must remain
for the future to confirm or to overthrow.the apparently strong
evidence in favor of the existence of a true Zeeman effect, due to the
general magnetic field of the sun. If this evidence can be accepted,
we may draw certain conclusions of present interest.

Taking the measures at their face value, they indicate that the
north magnetic pole of the sun les at or near the north pole of rota-
tion, while the south magnetic pole les at or near the south pole of
rotation. In other words, if a compass needle could withstand the
solar temperature, it would point approximately as it does on the
earth, since the polarity of the two bodies appears to be the same.
Thus, since the earth and sun rotate in the same direction, a negative
charge distributed through their mass would account in each case
for the observed magnetic polarity.

As for the strength of the sun’s field, only three preliminary deter-
minations have yet been made, with as many different lines. Disre-
garding the systematic error of measurement, which is still very
uncertain, these indicate that the field strength at the sun’s poles is
of the order of 50 gausses (about 80 times that of the earth).

Schuster, assuming the magnetic fields of the earth and sun to be
due to their rotation, found that the strength of the sun’s field should
be 440 times that of the earth, or 264 gausses. This was on the sup-
position that the field strength of a rotating body is proportional to
the product of the radius and the maximum linear velocity of rota-
tion, but neglected the density. Before inquiring why the observed
and theoretical values differ, we may glance at the two most prom-
ising hypotheses that have been advanced in support of the view
that every large rotating body is a magnet.

On account of their greater mass, the positive electrons of the
neutral molecules within the earth may perhaps be more powerfully
attracted by gravitation than the negative electrons. In this case
the negative charge of each molecule should be a little farther from
the center of the earth than the positive charge. The average linear
velocity of the negative charge would thus be a little greater, and
the magnetizing effect due to its motion would slightly exceed that

EARTH AND SUN AS MAGNETS—HALE. £57

due to the motion of the positive charge. By assuming a separation
of the charges equal to about four-tenths the radius of a molecule
(Bauer), the symmetrical part of the earth’s magnetic field could
be accounted for as the result of the axial rotation.

This theory, first suggested by Thomson, has been developed by
Sutherland, Schuster, and Bauer. But as yet it has yielded no ex-
planation of the secular variation of the earth’s magnetism, and the
merits of other theories must not be overlooked.

Chief among these is the theory that rests on the very probable
assumption that every molecule is a magnet. If the magnetism is
accounted for as the effect of the rapid revolution of electrons within
the molecule, a gyrostatic action might be anticipated. That is, each
molecule would tend to set itself with its axis parallel to the axis of
the earth, just as the gyrostatic compass, now coming into use at sea,
tends to point to the geographical pole. The host of molecular mag-
nets, all acting together, might account for the earth’s magnetic field.

This theory, in its turn, is not free from obvious points of weak-
ness, though they may disappear as the result of more extended in-
vestigation. Its chief advantage lies in the possibility that it may
explain the secular variation of the earth’s magnetism by a preces-
sional motion of the magnetic molecules.

On either hypothesis, it is assumed, in the absence of knowledge
to the contrary, that every molecule contributes to the production of
the magnetic field. Thus the density of the rotating body may prove
to be a factor. Perhaps the change of density from the surface to the
center of the sun must also be taken into account. But the observa-
tional results already obtained suggest that the phenomena of ioniza-
tion in the solar atmosphere may turn out to be the predominant in-
fluence.

The lines which show the Zeeman effect originate at a compara-
tively low level in the solar atmosphere. Preliminary measures indi-
cate that certain lines of titanium, which are widely separated by a
magnetic field in the laboratory, are not appreciably affected in the
sun. As these lines represent a somewhat higher level, it is probable
that the strength of the sun’s field decreases very rapidly in passing
upward from the surface of the photosphere—a conclusion in har-
mony with results obtained from the study of the corona and prom-
inences. Thus it may be found that the distribution of the electrons
is such as to give rise to the observed field or to produce a field oppos-
ing that caused by the rotation of the body of the sun. It is evident
that speculation along these lines may advantageously await the ac-
cumulation of observations covering a wide range of level. Beneath
the photosphere, where the pressure is high, we may conclude from
recent electric furnace experiments by King that free electrons,
though relatively few, may nevertheless play some part in the pro-
duction of the general magnetic field.
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

In this survey of magnetic phenomena we have kept constantly in
mind the hypothesis that the magnetism of the earth is due to its
rotation. Permanent magnets, formerly supposed to account for
the earth’s magnetic field, could not exist at the high temperature
of the sun. Displays of the aurora, usually accompanied by mag-
netic storms, are plausibly attributed to electrons reaching the earth
from the sun, and illuminating the rare gases of the upper atmos-
phere just as they affect those in a vacuum tube. Definite proof of
the existence of free electrons in the sun is afforded by the discovery
of powerful local magnetic fields in sun spots, where the magnetic
intensity is sometimes as great as nine thousand times that of the
earth’s field. These local fields probably result from the rapid revo-
lution in a vortex of negative electrons, flowing toward the cooler
spot from the hotter region outside. The same method of observa-
tion now indicates that the whole sun is a magnet, of the same
polarity as the earth. Because of the high solar temperature, this
magnetism may be ascribed to the sun’s axial rotation. It is not
improbable that the earth’s magnetism also results from its rotation,
and that other rotating celestial bodies, such as stars and nebule,
may ultimately be found to possess magnetic properties. Thus, while
the presence of free electrons in the sun prevents our acceptance of
the evidence as a proof that every large rotating body is a magnet,
the results of the investigation are not opposed to this hypothesis,
which may be tested further by the study of other stars of known
diameter and velocity of rotation.

numberless local magnetic fields, caused by electric vortices in the solar “ pores,’’ though
at first sight improbable, deserves further consideration.
THE REACTION OF THE PLANETS UPON THE SUN.'

By P. Pursrux,’
Member of the Institute, Astronomer at the Paris Observatory.

The popular preconception that the earth, with the sun rotating
about it, was the center of the universe, was overcome only through
the persistent efforts of astronomers and physicists. We will not
here review these memorable discussions, but will note merely the
result. Everyone capable of connected and geometrical reasoning
will become convinced that the position of the earth, face to face
with the sun, is that of a humble satellite, and that our globe, forced
to escort our daytime star in its mysterious course through space,
receives from this star its law of annual movement and at the same
time its indispensable ration of heat and light.

Going from one extreme to another, the sun was believed to be _
independent of the relatively minute planets which it carries along
with itself. It seemed that a fictitious observer, placed at its center
or on its surface, would have no occasion to suspect the existence of
other celestial bodies. Further protected against any perceptible
action from the stars by their immense distance, the sun must lavish
its splendor, with no pay in return, and follow unperturbed its
undeviated path through space.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE PLANETS ON THE MOTION OF THE SUN.

This conclusion was in some respects too radical. An account of
this matter could be rendered only when the penetrating genius of
Newton showed that the curved trajectory of a projectile, the revo-
lution of the moon about the earth, and the revolution of the earth
around the sun were three manifestations of the same law. This
law holds everywhere. Further, it is not a special privilege of the
center of any system. The bond exists, real though slight, between
any two particles whatever. The sun, as well as the humblest
_ planet, because of this bond, must undergo periodic variations in its
speed as well as in its shape.

Have we to-day at our disposal sufficiently delicate means of obser-
vations to detect these changes? In Newton’s time such means were
probably lacking. The caprices of our atmosphere furnished a ready
explanation of the apparent fluctuations in solar radiation. The
spots had been observed on the sun’s disk, sometimes few, sometimes
many, but no law had been assigned to them. Further, the tradi-
tional fixity of the constellations led to the belief that the sun main-
tained a complete immobility with reference to the stars.

But the problem plainly stated aroused new attempts at its un-
raveling. Bradley, a fellow countryman and a disciple of Newton,
showed that much greater precision could be obtained in the measures
of the angular distances of the stars than had before been gained.
Less than a century later, W. Herschel could affirm that the con-
stellations do alter their form, and the best determination of these
changes may be explained by attributing to the solar system a regular
rectilinear motion. The ambition of astronomers, increasing with
success, tries to-day to show that this movement is not rigorously
uniform, and even though shielded from the action of the stars, pays
tribute to the universal attraction in periodic oscillations.

It is pretty safe to predict what will be the most marked of these
oscillations. It is not the center of the sun itself which possesses
the uniform rectilinear motion, but the center of gravity of the
system formed by the sun and all the planets. The oscillation would
be small if only the earth need be considered. There is, however, a
giant planet, Jupiter, whose mass exceeds that of all of the other
planets taken together and is nearly one one-thousandth that of the
sun. Describing its orbit at the rate of 12 kilometers per second,
Jupiter forces the sun to rotate about an imaginary center with a
velocity a thousand times less. This is apparently a very small
amount, but not at all negligible with respect to the velocity of
translation of the solar system, which is 20 kilometers per second.
Consequently the speed of the solar system toward a point in the
constellation Hercules is sometimes accelerated, sometimes slowed,
by one part in one thousand in an interval of six years.

Very few of the stars are near enough to us for the parallactic dis-
placement relative to the more distant stars and due to this motion
of the sun to be appreciable in six years. Consequently, to measure
one one-thousandth part of this displacement is beyond the resources
of precise astronomy. We may be pretty sure, though, that some
day we will thus obtain, at the same time with a measure of the
mass of Jupiter, a new confirmation of the principle of the universal
attraction of gravitation.

Meanwhile help comes in another way. What the micrometer for
a long time will probably be unable to give, the spectroscope is al-
ready furnishing. Although the variation of 30 meters per second,
REACTION OF PLANETS UPON SUN—PUISEUX. 161

which we wish to detect in the motion of the sun, requires years to
change sensibly the apparent position of a star, it takes only a moment
to alter the quality of its light. Whatever the distance, the light
waves will come to us sometimes more frequently, sometimes less; their
path through a prism will consequently be found altered and the
fine metallic lines of the spectrum recorded by a photograph will be
displaced relatively to those of a stationary source, such as an elec-
tric spark used for comparison.

The earliest happy applications of this principle were due to Hug-
gins and to Vogel. It was used to separate numerous double stars
composed of pairs of suns so close to each other and so distant from
us that each pair appeared as a single star. But the brightness of
each was sufficient to record a spectrum and the relative velocities
were sufficiently variable so that two spectrum lines of the same
chemical origin separated periodically. Subsequently another class,
yet greater in number, was found in which the spectrum lines were
not doubled, but showed a periodic oscillation. In this case we may
suppose that one of the two stars, while not bright enough to reg-
ister its spectrum, is yet heavy enough to sway its associate. The
period is usually several weeks or days. The displacements of the
lines correspond to velocities of the same order as those of the
planets, from 10 to 100 kilometers per second. Because of the ex-
treme accuracy and care in the use of spectroscopes, certain as-
tronomers can now measure velocities to a fraction of a kilometer.

The time will come when pairs like the sun and Jupiter can be
detected, however distant they may be, provided only that the prin-
cipal star is bright enough to record its spectrum. Campbell, who
is the leader in this class of research, estimates that on the average
one star in three will be found spectroscopically double. It is very
probable that even more stars art double since we can see no reason
why a planet like Jupiter should be exceptional. We may predict
that all stellar spectra will be found thus variable even after cor-
recting for the orbital movement of the earth. We may then gather
photographic evidence of the existence of planets about the stars as
well as the periodic oscillation of our sun due to Jupiter. The earth
of course will produce a similar effect only less in amplitude and
period. But who would dare to put a limit to the skill of our opti-
cians or the patience of our astronomers in a path so definitely
marked out?

THE PLANETS AS THE CAUSE OF THE SOLAR CYCLE.

To find that we disturb the sun is of course something to elate us.
We will feel perhaps a more tangible satisfaction if we can find
that we cause changes in the aspect of its surface, disturbances visi-
ble by direct and not indirect evidence in the field of the microscope.

We will now consider a deforming action dependent also on
Newton’s law but of a differential nature and consequently propor-
tional to the inverse cube instead of the inverse square of the distance.
This difference helps to compensate for the inferiority of the mass
of the earth with reference to the greater planets and gives it a chance
for an honorable rank in this contest.

We have under our eyes an encouraging phenomenon. The attrac-
tion at the surface of the earth due to the sun is but a small fraction
compared to the weight of a body here, and the yet feebler attraction
due to the moon can not lighten a body by one one-hundred thou-
sandth part of its weight. Yet we see the moon exerting this power
and indeed with three times more strength than is felt from the sun, in
deforming our globe. This action can be detected upon the atmos-
phere, the oceans, and even the solid crust of the earth. The seas,
however, are what render it most evident to our eyes. Under favor-
able conditions, for instance, in the Bay of Mount St. Michel, on the
French coast, we see the sea following faithfully the passage of the
moon across the meridan. The sea’s level changes at the flood some
20 meters in a few hours, displacing the shoreline several kilometers.
The work thus developed, if we could only put it to use economically,
would be enough to render useless all our oil wells and all the engines
in the world.

We may find that no planet is as favorably situated to trouble the
sun as the moon is the earth. But perhaps we should not be so ex-
acting. We see upon the sun no such liquid seas which might be
made to extend or contract their domains. The weight there to be
conquered is great, 27 times greater than here. Despite that, we
see chances that the sun may react as actively, or even more actively,
than the earth, under the action of a distant body. ‘We are indeed
led by several converging paths of reasoning to think that the sur-
face layers of the sun are to a great depth formed of extremely tenu-
ous mobile matter, little subject to the action of weight and all
ready, consequently, to obey the least force.

A first piece of evidence along this line is the development of spots,
rents which seem to appear in the luminous veil of the solar surface,
reaching in a few days an extent of ten, twenty, or thirty thousand
kilometers and disappearing with equal rapidity. In the spectrum
of these spots there is an increase in the number and intensity of the
absorption bands, leading us to think that various metallic molecules
of considerable atomic weight are spouted out in torrents, carried
along by currents of the lighter hydrogen.

More impressive yet is the appearance of protuberances—clouds
which develop and remain at heights where they could not be sus-
tained by the dense and refringent atmosphere. Much less bright
REACTION OF PLANETS UPON SUN—PUISEUX. 163

than the disk, they have a special spectrum and during total eclipses
are the principal source of light. We can now photograph them at
any time about the edge of the disk by an ingenious method devised
in 1868 by Janssen and by Lockyer and since singularly perfected.
On many occasions we have been assured by incontestable evidence
that protuberances can mount in a few hours in the form of vertical
jets, narrow at the base to prodigious heights—50,000 to 100,000
kilometers or even more. Generally, however, before attaining such
heights the protuberances expand into sheaves or stratified layers.
At times they seem to be the seat of violent explosions, are scattered,
and disappear very quickly. The spectroscope shows us that cal-
cium vapor, despite its atomic weight 40 times heavier than that of
hydrogen, rises very high in the protuberances. The displacements
of the spectrum lines also furnish confirmation of the enormous
velocities (100 kilometers or more per second) which the deforma-
tions of the contours suggest.

Total eclipses, during which protuberances first attracted atten-
tion, are even now the only occasions when we can see another inter-
esting phase of solar activity—the solar corona. Sometimes it
appears as a halo somewhat equally distributed around the disk, at
other times as gigantic streamers stretching out distances several
times the diameter of the sun. The forms of these rays indicate that
the matter of which they are composed shows no haste in falling
back into the sun. This matter is evidently very sparse and has very
Little absorptive action on light, for, despite its irregular distribution,
it causes no difference in the appearance of the various parts of the
disk. Its mobility must be very great since in the interval of two
or three years between eclipses its structure completely changes, as
our photographs assure us.

Spots, protuberances, and corona are subject to a great variation
which takes place regularly about nine times in a century. After a
period when the sun’s disk appears entirely immaculate, spots re-
appear in both hemispheres at latitudes from 20° to 30°, then, always
increasing, they invade the equatorial regions, becoming at the max-
imum 20 times more numerous on the average than in a minimum
year. Then, as the decline commences, the numerical predominance,
which the Northern Hemisphere at first seemed to show, passes to the
Southern Hemisphere. The spots first disappear in the high lati-
tudes and then diminish all over the sun.

The protuberances pass through a similar cycle, except that dur-
ing the period while their number increases their mean latitude tends
_to increase in each hemisphere. Toward the epoch of spot maximum,
and only then, it is not rare to see great protuberances even near the
poles, where spots never appear.
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

The corona during the same period always undergoes a definite
evolution. Toward the epoch of sun-spot minimum the polar rays
are fine and vertical like the bristles of a brush. The jets in the mid-
dle and mean latitudes are much longer and bent toward the Equator.
At the maximum period there is little difference with the latitude.
During the transition years the poles and the Equator are almost
clear and the rays are developed only in the middle latitudes, giving
the whole a rectangular appearance.

The more we reflect upon these facts the less are we led to regard
the sun as a monarch, inaccessible, and shut up in a tower of ivory.
It, like the earth, must have seasons connected with the revolution of
the planets and tides connected with its own rotation. To sift out at
least the more active of these external influences is a legitimate task,

even though it is not an easy one.

' First, do we find one or several bodies which could be held responsi-
ble for a cycle of 11 years? The stars seem to be beyond considera-
tion, since in that period there is no appreciable change in their
linear or angular distances.

We could, as did John Herschel, blame one or several swarms of
meteors, imagined for the purpose. Describing very eccentric orbits,
they might graze the surface of the sun, causing the spots. Suitably
choosing their revolution periods, inclinations, eccentricities, and the
distribution of the matter in their orbits, we could explain the
phenomenon in all its details. We must confess that the permanence
of swarms of meteors put every 11 years to such a violent test does not
seem probable. There is no doubt that meteors fall into the sun in
great numbers. But we have no direct proof that this happens
periodically and so as to produce visible effects. Such proof we feel
that we must demand for this very supple and convenient hypothesis.
As these swarms have not been detected, we must leave them and
direct our investigations to the planets.

The most important of these planets brings a coincidence at first
sight very seductive. Nearly every 11 years Jupiter, in a determinate
sense, crosses the plane of the solar equator; also in every 11 years
the numerical predominance of the spots passes from the northern
to the southern hemisphere of the sun. The same interval separates
the return of Jupiter to its least distance from the sun and the return
of the sun-spot numbers to their extreme value.

We must not hurry, though, to sing our victory. It is not an
approximate concordance but a precise one which we should demand.
The periods in years are 11.86 for the revolution of Jupiter and
11.13 for the sun-spot cycle. For the second period, which is less
well defined, the incertitude is in the hundredths. For more than a
century we have careful records of spot numbers which reappear
regularly. Now, in the course of a century the difference of eight
REACTION OF PLANETS UPON SUN—PUISEUX. 165

months between the periods brings them from complete coincidence
to an absolute discordance. What now remains of our hoped-for
proof if the nearest approach of the planet must sometimes condition
an increase of spots, sometimes their disappearance?

We may suppose that Jupiter’s action, though preponderant, is
modified by a somewhat slower disturbing force which increases the
interval between successive maxima. But the statistics of the num-
ber and extent of the spots, analyzed with the view of finding such
a force, assigns to it such a long period that we have no clue as to
its origin. A priori the most probable disturbing body would seem
to be Saturn. It must act in the same sense as Jupiter, although to
less extent. The spot maxima or minima should be particularly pro-
nounced when the two planets are in conjunction with the sun—that
is, every 20 years. Here again the evidence is negative.

We get an even less favorable answer from the rest of the planets.
Hither their, revolution periods are too short to render an account
of an 11-year fluctuation or their distances too great for their action
to be sensible compared with that of Jupiter.

THE PLANETS AS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN THE SOLAR CYCLE.

No planet, then, or combination of planets seems to be the princi-
pal cause of the solar cycle. We may, however, suppose that this
or that planet may for a brief time trouble the cycle by rendering
the distribution of spots irregular in longitude.

The sun rotates with reference to the fixed stars once in 25 days.
The planets revolve about it in the same direction, but more slowly.
Therefore, to an observer on the sun, the successive passages of a
planet over his meridian occur in periods somewhat longer than 25
days, tending to approach this (sideral revolution) as the planet’s
distance increases. This is called the synodical rotation. That cor-
responding to the transit of the earth is 27.35 days.

Considering now the extreme mobility of the solar surface, we will
see whether each planet does not produce a tidal wave which passes
over the sun’s surface with the corresponding synodical rotation
period and capable of producing visible disturbances.

According to the elementary law of Newton, the relative impor-
tance of the tidal waves for the various planets is given by what we
may call the deforming factor, the product of the mass by the inverse
cube of the distance. If we make the value of this factor unity for
the earth, the mean values for the planets are as follows:

166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

We see that the most active cause for a tidal wave lies in Jupiter,
followed closely by Venus. Mercury and the earth come next, the
remaining planets being much less active.

Although the earth comes only in the fourth rank, we will con-
sider it first because we are better situated for examining its effects.
At each instant we can consider the sun as divided into two equal
hemispheres, one visible, the other not. The limiting meridians turn
uniformly over the surface of the sun in 27.35 days, the synodical
period.

Let us first suppose that the earth has no physical influence on the
development of the spots. The ratio between the total sun-spot
areas in the two hemispheres may happen to have any value what-
ever; but the mean value taken over a long period of time embrac-
ing many synodical rotations, say for a whole solar-spot cycle, should
differ very little from unity.

We can not at any given moment count or measure the spots on
the invisible hemisphere. But we can count the spots which appear
on the eastern border and compare these with those which disap-
pear in the corresponding time limit at the western border. The ratio
of the two numbers would have a tendency to surpass unity if it is
at a time of decrease in spots and to be less than unity if in the in-
creasing phase. But taken over a whole cycle, the mean value should
differ very little from unity.

Now, let us suppose that the earth does have a physical influence,
for instance, to fix our attention, that the presence of the earth above
the horizon of some point on the sun favors the development of a
spot at that point. As this development is certainly not instanta-
neous, any more than is its disappearance, more spots will be born in
the visible hemisphere than in the opposite one. Consequently, more
spots will disappear over the western border than appear at the
eastern. The inverse inequality will be observed, provided we observe
over a sufficiently long period, if the presence of the earth causes the
disappearance of spots.

Instead of comparing the eastern with the western border we could
compare the two halves of the visible disk, the right with the left,
and the result would be equally decisive. Practically, if the action
of the earth on the solar surface is real, the action will necessarily
take a certain time to become manifest. Considerable masses must
be moved, masses doubtless subject to interior friction. It is so rela-
tive to terrestrial tides which at any point of the earth suffer a
variable retardation, but always very marked with reference to the
passage of the moon over the meridian. If the earth has no influence,
the two halves—the right and left—would, if considered over a sufii-
cient time, show the same number and same area of spots. If the
earth has a real influence there will be found a persistent and sys-
tematic mequality.
REACTION OF PLANETS UPON SUN—PUISEUX. 167
RESEARCHES OF MRS. MAUNDER, 1907.

Mrs. Maunder undertook to answer this question, utilizing the
photographs due to a cooperation of English observatories for the
interval 1889 to 1901, extending from one spot minimum to the next.
At the beginning and the end the sun seemed absolutely free from
spots. In every instance the rare survivors which could be found at
the beginning and the end of the period upon the visible hemisphere
could not vitiate the conclusions derived from all the observations.

The tables obtained at Greenwich comprised—

(1) The positions and areas of the groups for each day.

(2) The history, day by day, of each important group; the areas
are expressed in millionths of the visible hemisphere and are cor-
rected for the effect of perspective; the mean duration of a group is
about six days; 2,870 groups were studied.

Mrs. Maunder divided the visible hemisphere at each instant into
14 vertical zones, each 13.2° wide and numbered in the inverse order
of their appearance. For each zone and the entire period the sum
representing the area of the spots was made. These results were com-
pared for zones symmetrical to the central meridian. There was thus
made manifest a systematic variation from two points of view:

(1) Despite the perspective correction, there was a constant pro-
gression on each side in passing from the limb to the central zone, as
if the perspective correction had been insufficient.

(2) For each pair of zones there was a constant decrease in passing
from the eastern to the corresponding western zone. The same thing
was noted when in a similar manner the northern and southern hem-
ispheres were treated separately.

Various reasons make the measures on the extreme zones less trust-
worthy, but even if we omit them the same conclusions result. If
refraction in the solar atmosphere plays a part it would unduly en-
rich the extreme zones. Accordingly, if a correction is made for it,
it but increases the first anomaly. Neither anomaly can be due to
errors of observation or reduction.

If we do not like this process of treatment we need not depend
upon the areas of the spots but count simply the number of groups
visible in each zone, omitting those of long life which necessarily
appear in both halves. Here again, for all pairs of zones, the eastern
one shows a greater number than its corresponding western one.

We next ask whether there is, either in the visible or in the invis-
ible half, an habitual and systematic excess in the number of spot
births over deaths. A priori, it seems as if it must be so for one or
the other hemisphere during the phase of increasing spots, but that
an equilibrium must be established when a complete cycle is con-
sidered.

a)
ae

168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1913.

To throw light on this point Mrs. Maunder associated on each
half of the disk the two extreme zones and compared the number of
groups of spots which had been seen in each of the two double zones.
The predominance was clearly in the eastern pair. There are
throughout a cycle more spots seen near the eastern border, and
consequently for the whole visible hemisphere and whole cycle there
is an excess of disappearances over appearances of spots. The oppo-
site must hold on the invisible hemisphere, since at the beginning
and end of a cycle the sun is entirely free from spots.

Neglecting the extreme zones, where the disappearances may be
more subject to error, there was obtained for each zone the number
of spots which were seen in it for the first time and the number seen
in it for the last time. The following result was noted:

As we go from east to west, crossing the visible hemisphere, there
is an almost constant diminution in the number of spot appearances
over a whole spot cycle and as nearly constant and even greater aug-
mentation in the number of disappearances.

When we compare two symmetrical regions of the disk, the number
of births found in one is generally smaller than the number of dis-
appearances in the corresponding region on the other side of the cen-
tral meridian.

If we were dealing only with numbers, the departures noted might
be considered as resulting from a psychological cause. It is probable
that there is in an observer a certain, perhaps unconscious, laziness
which keeps him from recording new appearances and prolonging
old spots unless absolutely necessary. It is always more agreeable
to register a disappearance which simplifies work rather an appear-
ance which augments it.

Thus, when a new small spot appears for the first time, there is
a tendency to include it among those already noted rather than to
regard it as an advance guard or germ of a new group. If the first
impression is wrong, then there results an unjustified diminution of
births in the visible hemisphere.

In a similar manner, if a small group approaches a more important
group, either by expansion or derivation, there will be a tendency
not to consider it separately and to cease counting it as soon as the
separation between it and the larger group ceases to be distinct. We
are thus led to credit fictitious disappearances to the visible hemi-
sphere.

Both these considerations lead us to record more disappearances
than births. But these errors in counting do not explain why the
total area of spots is regularly found greater in the eastern half of
the visible disk. Considering all of Mrs. Maunder’s results we are
led to think that the presence of the earth above the horizon of a
place on the sun tends to make spots there disappear.
REACTION OF PLANETS UPON SUN—PUISEUX. 169
CHECK METHODS.

This result is in a way too beautiful. We had hoped to find only
a small influence and we find one so decided that there is little room
left for the other planets. Accordingly, search has been justly made
for other proofs. We may, for instance, compare—

(1) Only the areas, in the east and west halves, of the groups of
long life which have been completely followed across the disk. Here,
again, without exception, for all symmetrical pairs of zones, the ad-
vantage remains with the eastern half of the disk.

(2) We may retain only the groups of long life seen in more than
two successive rotations, neglecting the first and last appearances,
keeping only the intermediate appearances. It is evident that in
this way no appearance can be omitted or fictitious disappearance be
registered. Despite these safeguards, the eastern portion still re-
tains its advantage in the proportion of 19 parts in 100.
