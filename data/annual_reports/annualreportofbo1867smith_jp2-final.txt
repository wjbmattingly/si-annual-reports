PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

{PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847. ]

-

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan
of Organization.

1. Witt or SmitHson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.’’

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government
of the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of
the testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and, 2d, to
diffuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally; can be easily reduced to practice; receive modifications, or
be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the
construction of the building; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be
benefited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expend-
iture on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION LI.

Plan of organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge; and,

2. To publish occasicnally separate treatises on subjects of general ©
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.
I. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of vol-
umes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

knowledge, resting on original research; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
the branch to which the memoir pertains ; and to be accepted for
publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
«nd the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a favorable decision is made. ;

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the trans-
actions of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to
all the colleges and principal libraries in this country. One part of
the remaining copies may be offered for sale, and the other carefully
preserved, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand
from new institutions.

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

Il. By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that in
course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contribations to Knowledge.

4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving
the problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determina-
tion of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and of
light; chemical analyses of soils and plants; collection and publica-
tion of scientific facts accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places cele-
brated in American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the
different races of men in North America ; also, explorations and ac-
curate surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people
of our country.
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year i
all branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally in-
teresting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some
of the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals,
as the income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of
knowledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.

8. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publi-
cations, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his
report ; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on
the title-page of the report. ‘

4, The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific in-
stitutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports :*

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4. Application of science to arts.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world; penal reform, &c.

Ili. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.
12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

II. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the

* This part of the plan has been but partially carried out.
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 1]

direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges, previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of Rage ave and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum ; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation
of a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be re-
quired, consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions
and proceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the
more important current periodical publications, and other works
necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those
mentioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the
United States should be procured, in order that the valuable books
first purchased may be such as are not to be found in the United
States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art
casts of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-
pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Con-
gress, will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and
to exhibit new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also
be invited to give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15,
1855, viz:

Resolved, That the Tth resolution passed by the Board of Regents,
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the
income between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

fesolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance and a compliance in good faith with the law.
RE P.O T

THE SECRETARY, PROFESSOR HENRY,
1867.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: The close of the year 1866 completed the second de-
cade of the actual operations of the Smithsonian Institution. It was
chartered in August, 1846; though but little more was accomplished
during that year than a discussion of plans, and the appointment of
the Secretary, the principal executive officer.

On thus commencing a new decade in the history of the Institu-
tion, we may pause a few moments to recall some facts relative to
the character, the acceptance, and the administration of the endow-
ment of Smithson, which it is important always to keepin view. This
will be evident when we reflect on the changeable character of the
bodies constituting the guardians of the trust. Not asingle Regent
on the list of those originally appointed is now amember of the board,
and indeed, with perhaps one single exception, all the members of
Congress and the principal officers of the general government have been
changed, and in some cases many times in succession. Under these
circumstances it becomes desirable that frequent reference should be
had to the original principles on which the Institution was founded,
as well as to those on which its affairs are now conducted.

The endowment was one of no ordinary character; it was confided
to our government not by one of its own citizens, but by a distin-
guished foreigner, the scion of an ancient house renowned for its
achievements in English history. It was not given in trust to our
government to be disposed of for the exclusive benefit of a portion
of our own people, or even for that of the whole nation, but in behalf
of the general family of mankind, for the benefit of men of all coun-
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tries and of all times. It was not restricted in effect to the diffusion
of a knowledge of old truths, but primarily designed for the exten-
sion of the boundaries of thought by the promotion of the discovery
of new powers of nature, of new principles and new laws of the uni-
verse. Nor was the acceptance of the trust an ordinary occurrence.
It became a constitutional question whether the Congress of the
United States was legally authorized to assume the responsibility and
discharge the duty of a trustee for such a purpose; nor was it until
after the expression of many doubts as to the result, that the accept-
ance was finally resolved on. Again, one of our most distinguished
citizens, Hon. Richard Rush, who had previously represented our
government at the court of St. James, was chosen as the agent to
effect a transfer of the funds to this country, and this he was enabled
to do without the delay of protracted legal proceedings, through the
courtesy of the court of chancery in granting a decree to that effect,
after a mere formal suit to satisfy the requirements of law.

A trust of so novel a character, confided by a prominent citizen of
England, not to his own government, but to that of the United States,
could not fail to attract general attention and place in a conspicuous
light before the world, the integrity, intelligence and executive
ability of the party accepting an office of so much responsibility and
difficulty as that of the trustee of this endowment.

The obligation became more impressive in consideration of the
fact that the trust was accepted after the decease of him by whom it
was confided, and who could, therefore, give no further indications of
his intentions than those expressed in the terms of his will. It was,
consequently, of the firstimportance that these terms should be critically
studied, logically interpreted, and the intentions deduced from them
be strictly followed. Unfortunately, however, at the time the be-
quest was accepted, the public at large were so little acquainted with
the distinctions of science, or so little regardful of the precise ideas
to be attached to the terms which it employs, that it is scarcely a
matter of surprise that the intention of Smithson, as expressed by the
words ‘‘for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men’’
should have been misinterpreted, and that the act of Congress organ-
izing the Institution should include provisions which have since been
generally recognized as incompatible with the leading objects of the
bequest.

It is, however, a sacred duty on the part of the government,
which it owes to its own character for candor and equity, to cor-
rect, as far as possible, any errors which misapprehension or inad-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

vertence may have engrafted on its legislation, and to remove any
burdens which may have been injuriously imposed on the endow-
ment; and we doubt not from what has been done in the last few
years, that Congress will in due time fully vindicate the integrity of
its purposes, and enable the legacy of Smithson to perform all the
good which his most ardent desire could have anticipated.

It has been evident from the first that it was the intention of Con-
gress to deal not only justly but liberally with the Institution. It
restored the fund with interest when temporarily lost by a loan to
one of the western States, and provided for its subsequent security
by declaring it forever a deposit in the treasury of the United States,
on which six per cent. interest, payable semi-annually, should be
allowed. It furnished from the public domain grounds for a spacioug
park, as well as a site for a large building; and to increase, as it was
thought, its popularity, the new Institution was made the custodian of
the national museum. These acts, though prompted by a liberal
spirit, proceeded on the erroneous idea then prevalent, that the inten-
tions of Smithson could be properly carried out by an institution con-
sisting of objects of a material and local character. Fortunately, how-
ever, Congress did not restrict the expenditure of the income of the
fund to these, but allowed the Regents at their discretion to devotea
portion of it in such other manner as in their opinion might be best
fitted to carry out the intentions of the donor.

After much deliberation, with a view to reconcile conflicting opin-
ions, an arrangement was effected by which two distinct systems
were provisionally adopted. The first of these which was included
in the law of organization, contemplated the expenditure of the in-
come in the formation and embellishment of an extensive park, or
pleasure ground, in which rare and ornamental trees and shrubs of
different species should be cultivated; in the erection and mainte-
nance of a castellated building, which, from its dimensions and im-
posing architectural design, should be an ornament to the city and a
monument to the founder; in the formation of a gallery of art in which
should be exhibited choice specimens of painting, sculpture and en-
graving; in the establishment of a library consisting of works on all
subjects; and, finally, in the support of a national museum containing
the collections of the United States Exploring Expedition, and all the
specimens that might be accumulated from other sources for the illus-
tration of all branches of natural history, geology, ethnology, etc.

The objects included in this system are all in themselves highly
interesting and very desirable for the embellishment and intellectual
improvement of the capital of the United States, but they are not in
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

accordance with the will of Smithson, and fail entirely to realize his
higher and more comprehensive conceptions. They do not serve to
‘increase knowledge,’’ or, in other words, to add new truths to the
existing stock; nor do they ‘‘ diffuse knowledge among men,”’ since
they are local in character, and fail to promote the general welfare
of mankind. Neither could they all be properly supported from the
limited income of the Smithson bequest. A library, and more
especially a museum, worthy of the nation, would, either of them,
in time, absorb the whole of the annual income.

The other system, above referred to, or that which has been
denominated the system of active operations, was suggested by the
desire to strictly realize the intentions of Smithson, both as regards
the increase and the diffusion of knowledge; and this it was proposed
to effect by instituting experiments or researches in all departments
of science; by making explorations relative to geology, natural his-
tory, ethnology, and meteorology, and by diffusing an account of the
results of all these, through the press, to every quarter of the globe.
It further includes in its design the collection and labelling of large
numbers of duplicate specimens, to illustrate the branches above
mentioned, not merely to be deposited in a national museum, but,
also, to be distributed to colleges, academies, and other establish-
ments, for educational purposes; and, lastly, embraces in its plan an
extended arrangement for international exchanges, through which
the discoveries of science and the products of literature of the old
and new worlds, become the common elements of intellectual pro-
gress. This system, which is immediately suggested to those familiar
with scientific language, by the terms of the bequest, is a living,
active organization, calculated to produce, unceasingly, results of
which the value will everywhere be known and be properly appre-
ciated. It was not, however, adopted, even provisionally, as a
prominent feature of the organization without strenuous opposition,
particularly on the part of the advocates of the proposition to apply
the Smithson endowment to found a national library. Indeed the
ideas which it involved were in advance of the times. That an
institution could be established which might have an important bear-
ing on the welfare of the world without the adventitious aid of pal-
pable objects, was not generally comprehended.

But though restricted in its operations by limited resources and
subjected to popular opposition, the system has proved in its opera-
tion to be eminently practical, and has established for the Institution
a reputation as wide as civilization itself. It has connected the name
of Smithson with the progress of almost every branch of science, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 1%

has thus furnished the means of perpetuating his memory far more
effectually than could be done by architectural or other local monu-
ments, however ample in dimensions or comprehensive in destgn.

Instead of being, as has been supposed, adverse or neutral as
regards the interests of the city of Washington, it has given it a
reputation as a centre of scientific operations, and has led to a series
of improvements which, in time, cannot do otherwise than promote
its renown and add to its prosperity. It does not oppose an antago-
nism to the local objects before mentioned, but seeks to establish
them on a more liberal scale by other instrumentalities. While it has
distributed its publications and specimens with unprecedented liber-
ality, it has been fully repaid with articles of a similar character.
Through its exchanges it has collected a library of scientific refer-
ence superior to any in this country, and equal to any which can be
found abroad. Assoonas Congress shall furnish the means of support-
ing a national museum, it will supply this with all the foreign and
domestic specimens necessary for comparison and illustration.

The two systems, at first carried on harmoniously, though in a
limited way and not without mutual embarrassment, were soon
found in practice to be radically incompatible with each other. As
it was impossible suitably to control the expenditure on the local
objects, it has been the constant policy of the Directory of the Insti-
tution to obtain relief from these burdens. It was in accordance with
this that the government was solicited to resume the care of the |
grounds, on which had been expended annually a considerable por-
tion of the income, and to make these grounds part of a general
park extending from the Capitol to the Potomac. It was for this
purpose that the Institution was instrumental in procuring the ser-
vices of Mr. Downing, whose plan of the grounds in question would
have been completed had not the work been interrupted by his un-
timely death. This work, we trust, will soon be resumed under
more favorable auspices.

It was also in accordance with the policy under consideration that
the valuable library which, from its rapid increase by exchanges, had
already exceeded the means at the disposal of the Institution for its
support, was incorporated with that of Congress.

Happily the necessity for supporting a gallery of art has been ob-
viated by the enlightened munificence of a citizen of Washington, W.
W. Corcoran, esq., who has erected a building and made provision
for the support of such an establishment to which the collections in
this department already formed by the Institution may be trans-
ferred.

2s
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The next important desideratum is the relief of the fund of Smith-
son from the greatest of all the burdens which have been imposed
upon it, that, namely, of the expense involved in the care and exhibition
of the national museum. for carrying on the active operations a
building not to exceed a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars would
have been amply sufficient, both in regard to the accommodations neces-
sarily required and the architectural embellishments which might be
thought requisite for such a structure; while the present building, the
erection of which was especially urged on the ground of the necessity of
providing accommodations on a liberal scale for a national museum
and library, has cost to the present time $450,000, or, in other words,
besides the $240,000 of accrued interest originally appropriated to
the building, an outlay of not less than ten thousand dollars annually
for twenty years has been devoted to the same purpose, and this ex-
penditure must, without the relief desired, be not only continued
but increased for years to come.

Though great advances have been made in the favor with which
the Institution is regarded by the public, and the increased facilities
which have been afforded by the transfer of the objects we have
mentioned to the care of government, yet the absorption of the income
by the museum and the building is so great and accelerative that
unless Congress, in justice to the trust, takes upon itself the charge
of these objects or provides for their maintenance the active opera-
tions must be greatly diminished in efficiency, if not ultimately
abandoned. The reputation of the Institution and of the country is
however too much involved in the continuance of the active operations
to allow them to be abolished or even restricted. Every academy, every
college, every lyceum in the United States, as well as all the literary
and scientific institutions of Europe, Asia, and even those of Africa
and Australia, are interested in the continued success of the system.
Furthermore, it be truly said that to devolve the care of a national
museum on the Smithson fund is not only an act of injustice to the
bequest, but is at once injurious to the reputation of the institution
and that of the government, since the means which the former can
devote to this purpose after defraying other expenses are entirely inade-
quate to the support of a museum entitled to the name of ‘‘national.’’
A public museum, properly organized as a means of popular educa-
tion, or as an aid tothe advancement of science, should not only be
furnished with extensive apartments for the proper accommodation
and exhibition of the articles, to be increased from time to time, but
it should also be provided with several professors, each learned in a
special branch of general natural history. So extended have these
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

departments of science become that noone individual can be profoundly
acquainted with more than one or two of them; hence, in order that
a director should properly perform the duties of a curator of an
establishment of this kind, he should have a corps of learned assistants.
For example, for the preservation and practical use ofan herbarium, the
constant attendance and supervision of a botanist is requisite, whose
duty it will be to classify the specimens, to render them unassailable
by insects, to arrange them for study or exhibition, and to be always
present to assist those who may desire to examine them, either for ele-
mentary study or original research. Without a number of assistants in
the line of natural history, a museum must principally consist of mere
articles of curiosity, of comparatively little use in the way of valuable
instruction. It is evident, however, that a corps of such assistants,
supported on permanent salaries, iv addition to the other expenses of
the museum, would soon absorb the whole of the Smithson income.

What has been said has reference merely to the impropriety of
attempting to maintain a museum worthy of the nation at the expense
of the Smithson fund, and is not intended to disparage the value
of a complete representation of the natural products of America, with
such foreign specimens as may be required for comparison and gene-
ralization. This we think of great importance, particularly as a
means of developing and illustrating our industrial resources, as well
as of facilitating the study of the relations of our geology, mineralogy, -
flora and fauna to those of the old world; and, indeed, the wants of the
government appear to demand a collection of this kind, since the Med-
ical Department, the Agricultural Department, and the General Land
Office are each rapidly accumulating articles of illustration, and find
the necessity for the permanent employment of persons well skilled in
the branches to which their specimens pertain. With these the
national museum, of a general character, would maintain relations of
co-operation and mutual assistance.

It will be seen in previous reports, that from the first, in order to
compensate in some degree for the great outlay on local objects,
measures were adopted for the increase of the capital of the endow-
ment. These principally consisted in deferring the completion of
the building for a series of years, and in the meanwhile investing
the money appropriated for it8 construction, as well asa portion of
the annual income, saved by judicious and economical management,
in government and State stocks. These stocks, however, were not
permanently secured, and were in danger of being disposed of inju-
diciously, upon casual or inadequate considerations. It has, there-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

fore, been a matter of solicitude to obtain for them a permanent
investment.

In view of this, a petition was presented to Congress by the board
of regents, asking permission to make additions to the principal of the
Smithson fund. This petition was granted by the act of February 8,
1867, allowing the regents to increase the principal in the treasury
of the United States, by savings, donations, and otherwise, to any
sum not exceeding a million dollars, the additions to be subject to
the same conditions as the original bequest. In accordance with this
law the regents authorized the sale of all the stocks owned by the
Institution, excepting those of Virginia, and the application of the
proceeds to the increase of the principal to $650,000, which amount
is now the permanent fund of the Institution. In addition to this the
Institution has $72,500 in Virginia State bonds, the marketable value
of which is about $30,000.

The fund first paid into the treasury from the Smithson bequest
was $515,169; the remainder of the legacy, which had been left in
Hngland as the principal of an annuity to the mother of the nephew of
Smithson, was $26,210 63, making in all, from the bequest of Smith-
son, $541,379 63. The capital has, therefore, been increased
more than a hundred thousand dollars, notwithstanding the expendi-
ture of $450,000 on the building.

Tt will be seen by the reports of the building committee and archi-
tect, that the main building of the Institution, which consists of a
large central edifice, 200 feet long, 50 feet wide, with two projecting
towers and a middle space in front, and a single large tower in the
rear, to which portions the damage by fire was principally confined, will
be entirely restored in the course of a few months, with the excep-
tion of the large hall in the second story. These parts of the building,
in which it is proposed to deposit the more valuable coliections, are
entirely of fire-proof materials. The cost of this reconstruction will
amount to $125,000, exclusive of that of the fitting up of the large
room just mentioned. The accommodations which will be afforded are
amply suflicient for the active operations of the Institution for all
coming time, and also for the museum, provided but few additions be
made to the number of specimens exhibited; but if the increase be
continued—and it is almost impossible” to prevent, even if desired,
the growth of an establishment of this kind—the completion of the
main hall and the fitting it up with cases will become necessary, at
an expense of at least $50,000. The other parts of the building,
namely, the two wings and connecting ranges, with six towers, will
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

also require, in time, for rendering them fire-proof, a further cust of
not less than $50,000.

The question then occurs, from what sources are the funds neces:
sary for this purpose to be derived? Fortunately the permanent
capital of the Institution is now secure and cannot be expended. The
income, however, which, in justice and good faith, ought to be applied
to the ‘‘increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,’’ should not
be mortgaged, as it were, for years to come, in providing accommoda-
tions for the government collections. Surely the intelligence of the
general public and the moral sense of the community will justify
Congress in making seperate provision, on a proper scale, for the
support and extension of a government museum.

The large drafts upon the income since the fire and the high prices
of labor and materials have interfered with as vigorous a prosecu-
tion of the active operationsas was exemplified in previous years, and
have induced us to discontinue some enterprises in which we were
engaged, and to postpone others until a more favorable opportunity.
It will be seen, however, by the following report of the operations
of the Institution for the past year that much has been accomplished
in the way of sustaining and advancing the reputation of the estab-
lishment:

Publications.—The greater part of the expenditures on publica-
tions during the past year has been for the printing and paper of
an edition from the stereotype plates of volume XIV of the Contribu-
tions to Knowledge, and volumes VI and VII of the Miscellaneous
Collections. These volumes had been published in previous years in
a sufficient number of copies to supply foreign exchanges, but owing
to the large demands on the income of the funds on account of the
repair of the building, we were unable at the time to distribute
copies to American libraries. The edition which has now been
printed will, however, serve to make up all our deficiencies in this
respect.

Of the two works mentioned in the last report as being in the
press, the first, entitled ‘‘ Astronomical, Magnetic, Tidal, and Me-
teorological Observations within the Arctic Circle, by Isaac I. Hayes,
M. D.,’’ has been completed and a small edition printed. A full
description of this paper was given in the report for 1865. It
forms a quarto volume of 283 pages, illustrated with six charts
and fifteen wood-cuts. The principal chart shows the discoveries,
tracks and surveys of the Arctic expedition of 1860 and 1861, pro-
jected on ascale of 1 to 1,200,000. Another chart shows the vi-
cinity of Port Foulke, the winter-quarters in 1860 and 1861 of the

expedition, projected ona scale of 1 to 170,000; a third gives the
Iso-magnetic lines in the vicinity of Smith’s strait, and three other
plates illustrate the series of tides at Port Foulke.

The second work published during the year is ‘‘ Results of Me-
teorological Observations made at Brunswick, Maine, between 1807
and 1859, by Parker Cleaveland, L.L.D., Professor in Bowdoin
College.’? Another quarto work in press, and nearly ready for dis-
tribution, is entitled: ‘‘ Results of Meteorological Observations made
at Marietta, Ohio, between 1826 and 1859, inclusive, by 8. P. Hil-
dreth, M. D.; to which are added, results of observations at Ma-
rietta, by Mr. Joseph Wood, between 1817 and 1823,’’ which have
been reduced and discussed at the expense of the Institution, by
Charles A. Schott. For an account of these works see the part of
this report relative to meteorology.

Additional copies of the following works have been printed during
the year from the stereotype plates: Draper’s Telescope ; Whittle-
sey’s Drift; Meek’s Check list of Fossils; Catalogue of Birds; Chi-
nook Jargon ; List of Coleoptera ; Review of American Birds; List of
Publications ; List of Foreign Correspondents. sal

The following are the rules of distribution of the Smithsonian pub-
lications:

1. They are presented to all learned societies of the first class
which publish transactions, and give copies of these, in exchange, to
the Institution.

2. To all foreign libraries, of the first class, provided they give in
exchange their catalogues and other publications, or an equivalent,
from their duplicate volumes.

3. To permanently endowed colleges in actual operation in this
country, provided they furnish in return meteorological observations,
catalogues of their libraries and of their students, and all other pub-
lications issued by them relative to their organization and history.

4. To all States and Territories, provided they give in return
copies of all documents published under their authority.

5. To all incorporated public libraries in this country, not included
in any of the foregoing classes, now containing 10,000 volumes, and
to smaller libraries where a whole State or large district would be
otherwise unsupplied.

Institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particular
branches of knowledge receive such articles published by the Insti-
tution as relate to their objects. Portions of the series are also given
to institutions of lower grade not entitled under the above rules to

the full series, and also to the meteorological correspondents of the
Institution.

For the purpose of collecting materials for the preparation of a
report on the present condition of school architecture, a letter was
addressed to the officers of public instruction in our principal cities,
requesting the use of the architectura illustrations of their most
approved school-houses. This request was readily complied with,
and a considerable number of wood cuts had been received, when
Congress organized the Department of Education, to which it was
thought proper to transfer them, with the understanding that they
should be used in the report to be published under the direction
of the Commissioner. The thanks of the Institution are due to
Messrs. Philbrick, of Boston; Shippen, of Philadelphia; Van Bok-
kelen, of Baltimore; Swett, of San Francisco; Pickard, of Chicago;
Randall, of New York; Brooks, of Springfield, Illinois; and Hart, of
Trenton, New Jersey, for the promptness of their compliance with
our request, as well as for the illustrations actually furnished.

The report for the year 1866, with the appendix, was printed by
order of Congress, and the usual number of ten thousand extra
copies struck off for distribution, 4,000 by the Institution and
6,000 by the members of the Senate and House of Representatives.
It is believed that few, if any, of the government documents are
more in demand by the public than this report, and it has become
impossible to supply all who make application for it. Unless a
larger number be ordered by Congress, the distribution must in
future be more strictly conformable to the rules which have been
adopted, viz:

Ist. To colleges, libraries and societies’ publishing transactions.

2d. To contributors to the library, museum or meteorological de-
partment of the Institution.

3d. To persons engaged in teaching or in special research, and
to collaborators of the Institution.

The changes in the population of the country are so rapid that we
cannot be guided by a permanent list. As a general rule, the dis-
tribution can only be made to those who make special application
for each volume, excepting donors to the museum and meteorological
observers.

The volume for 1866 contains, in addition to the report of the
Secretary, giving an account of the operations, expenditures and
condition of the Institution for the year, and the proceedings of the
Board of Regents to February 22, 1867, the following articles:

Meteorology. —In order to advance those branches of science
which depend especially upon instrumental observations, two kinds
of labor are necessary; that which is devoted to the making and
recording observations, and that which is expended in reducing and
discussing them. The first, which frequently requires a large num-
ber of observers, as in the case of simultaneous meteorology, fortu-
nately can be performed by persons having a limited amount of scien-
tific training, although the precision and value of their observations
are much enhanced by a critical knowledge of the principles upon
which the observations depend; while the discussion and reduction
require a knowledge of mathematical analysis, possessed by compara-
tively few; and hence it is not surprising that the accumulation of
crude observations should be far in advance of their philosophic dis-
cussion, or that at the present time the great desideratum in meteo-
rology is a full discussion, on a general plan, of all the series of obser-
vations which have been recorded. If this were properly executed, we
should be prepared to commence a new era in this branch of science,
and to direct attention to new points of investigation, from indica-
tions furnished by the discussions.

In consideration of this state of meteorological data we have .con-
cluded, in view of the improvement of the funds, to resume the gen-
eral discussion of the material which the Institution has already ac-
cumulated. We have accordingly commenced this work by the
reduction and discussion of all the observations on the rain-fall of the
North American continent, the results of which are much called for
on account of their agricultural, manufacturing, commercial, and san-
itary applications. Observations from upwards of twelve hundred
localities are now in the hands of the computers, and it is expected
that the results will be ready for publication towards the close of
1868. After having discussed all the observations which have been
previously recorded, we shall then be prepared to commence a new
and more extended series relative to precipitation, and for this pur-
pose we have had prepared a large number of measuring scales, con-
sisting of slips of box wood graduated to the tenth of an inch, to
be distributed very generally over the country, with instructions for
the observation and record of rain-fall. After carefully considering the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

several forms of rain gauges, we have decided to recommend the
general adoption of a simple cylindrical vessel of three or four inches
in diameter and nine inches high, the depth to be measured by
plunging to the bottom a small slip of soft wood on which the water
mark can be distinctly observed, and measuring this by the scale
before mentioned, the depth being recorded to the quarter of a tenth
of aninch. Special instructions will be given that the rain be meas-
ured immediately after the fall or before any sensible evaporation
has taken place. We have adopted the simple cylinder of uniform
diameter as being less liable to errors of observation than any other
form.

Although the separate observations are not read with the same
minuteness as in the case of gauges in which the depth of rain is mag-
nified by a receiver of less diameter than the orifice of the gauge, yet
the average we find from experience in the case of a long series gives
equally reliable results with those in which instruments of apparently
greater precision are employed.

After the completion of the rain tables, our computers will com-
mence the discussion of the temperature of the North American con-
tinent. Were our funds sufficient, we should be glad to include in
the investigation all the observations made on this continent during
the various expeditions to the arctic regions, undertaken by the Brit-
ish government, few of which have, as yet, received that thorough
examination necessary to obtain from them the general truths which
constitute real contributions to science.

We have mentioned in previous reports that the meteorological sys-
tem of the U. S. army was about to be reorganized under the Surgeon
General. This work has been carried on during the year, and a series
of standard instruments has been constructed by James Green, of
New York, under the direction of Dr. Craig, for distribution to the
various posts. Fifty barometers and one hundred and fifty thermom-
eters and rain gauges will be substituted for those now in use.

The number of Smithsonian observers during the year 1867 was
385, and this will probably be increased during the year 1868,
so that a more rapid and accurate accumulation of data relative to
the meteorology of this country will be obtained than at any time
heretofore.

The Department of Agriculture has continued during the past year
to publish the monthly bulletin of meteorological observations, which
is still received with much interest by farmers, as well as by meteo-
rological observers. The preparation of the meteorological notes for
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

\
the present, as for previous years, has been in charge of Mr. Wm. Q.
Force.

The importance of meteorological observations in their connection
with agriculture is becoming better appreciated by the public, and
we think it probable that in due time our government will follow the
example of foreign countries in maintaining a more perfect series of
observations than has as yet been established. The average temper-
ature of the year and of the different seasons, the amount and fre-
quency uf rain, the time of early and late frosts, the length of the
‘‘orowing summers’ and the recurrence of years of abnormal drought
or of low temperature, are all elements of great value in comparing
the relative capacity of different parts of the country for special
productions.

We have repeatedly stated in previous reports that our eastern sea-
board is far more favorably situated in regard to the prediction of
the occurrence of storms than the western coast of Europe, since it
has been conclusively shown that the principal disturbances of the
atmosphere in the temperate zone move from west to east. During
the past year the attempt has been made by the Institution to
resume with the co-operation of the telegraph lines the system of
telegraphic indications of the weather which was interrupted by
the war. We have, however, been unsuccessful, and indeed it can
scarcely be expected that without some remuneration to the companies,
the use of the telegraphic wires and the time of the operators should
be given for the purpose.

The discussion and reduction of long series of observations of the
weather at particular places have been continued. The contributions
of this kind completed during the past year are deductions from the
meteorological observations made at Brunswick, Maine, and Marietta,
Ohio. The discussions and reductions were made at the expense of
the Institution by Mr. Charles A. Schott, on the same plan as that
adopted in the discussion of the observations in the Arctic Regions
by Kane, McClintock and Hayes.

Between the years 1807 and 1859 inclusive, meteorological records
were made with great regularity by the late Professor Parker Cleave-
land, of Bowdoin college, at Brunswick, Maine, and after his death
were consigned to this Institution for reduction and publication. The
observations, though not intended by their author to be of a strictly
scientific character, were yet found sufficiently valuable to warrant
the expenditure of considerable labor in preparing them for the press.

Brunswick is on the Androscoggin river, about 25 miles N. 40° E.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

from Portland, Maine, in latitude 43° 54! 5, longitude 69° 57’ 4, and
74 feet above high water. The observations were made at 7 a. m.,
1 p.m. and 6 p. m., and relate to indications of the thermometer and
barometer, direction of the wind, state of the weather, amount of
rain and snow, character of clouds, occurrence of thunder-storms,
fogs, frost and hail, earthquakes, auroras, ete.

From these observations the mean temperature of each day of each
month is deduced and arranged in tables. The mean temperatures,
however, require a small correction in order to reduce them to the
mean temperature of the day which would be given from twenty-four
or hourly observations instead of only three observations. In the dis-
cussion of the temperature the correction applied on account of the
irregular hours was deduced from a series of observations taken at
every hour of the twenty-four at Toronto and Montreal, which are
found to have been subjected to the same fluctuation of temperature
as Brunswick. To understand this, perhaps the following expla-
nation is necessary: By adding all the temperatures observed at
each hour of the day, for example all at 6 o’clock, into one sum, and
dividing these by the whole number of observations at this hour, we
obtain the average or mean temperature of that hour, and by repeat-
ing the process for every other hour we obtain a series for each hour
of the twenty-four; also, by adding together all the average tempera-
‘tures of each hour of the day and dividing by twenty-four, we obtain
the mean temperature of the day. If the mean temperature of the
day be compared with the mean temperature of each hour, some of
the latter will be a little above and others a little below the former;
and as these differences are found to be the same over a large extent
of country, we may apply them to observations made at one, two, or
three hours, so as to get the same result which would be obtained had
the observations been made at every hour during the twenty-four.
Thus it has been found, from several series of hourly observations in
different parts of the United States, that those made at Ta. m., 2
and 9 p. m., give a nearer approximation to the mean temperature of
the day than those made at any other hours. We dwell some-
what on this point because the idea has been prevalent that the best
times for determining the mean temperature are at sunrise, noon and
sunset. But since sunrise and sunset are variable hours, it is obvious
that corrections similar to those we have mentioned above cannot be
readily applied to them.

The observations at Brunswick, having been duly corrected in the
way we have mentioned, present, during a period of ji/ty-two years,
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

a mean temperature of 44° 4’ Fahrenheit, which reduced to the level
of the sea becomes 44° 6’,

The lowest mean temperature for any year occurred in 1859, and
was 40°.31, and the highest was in 1840, 51°.60, giving a range of
11°.29, which is considerably larger than at places farther south in
the United States. <A table is given of the fluctuations of the annual
mean temperatures, which, with others of a similar character, is
directly available for the study of the secular changes of the tempera-
ture; or, in other words, for ascertaining whether within the period
of instrumental observations the annual temperature has undergone
any sensible variation. No indications of this, however, have been
found. On the contrary, it appears from the observations made
between 1807 and 1832, inclusive, that the annual temperature
was 44°.10, and between 1833 and 1859, inclusive, it was 44°.70,
a difference readily accounted for from errors of observation and
change of instruments, and too insignificant to substantiate a change
in climate. It has been observed in other parts of the earth that
the annual temperature undergoes a periodical change at certain
seasons of the year, and in this country it has been suppesed that a
similar change occurs, viz., a cold period about the end of May, and
a warm one in October. The discussion of the observations for 52
years does not indicate any such periodical fluctuation at these times.

According to the average of 52 years, the warmest day falls on the
22d of July, or 31 days after the summer solstice, and has a mean
temperature of 67°.7.

The coldest day on an average is the 18th of January, or 28 days
after the winter solstice, having a temperature of 19°.9 Fahrenheit.
On an average, the 20th of April and the 24th October have the same
temperature as the mean of the entire year. The lowest record for
the whole time is 30° below zero, and the highest 102° above.,

The northwest wind on an average reduces the temperature 4°.6.
The north lowers it 3°.1, and the northeast 3°.8. The southwest
wind, on the contrary, elevates the temperature above its normal
value 29.6. In summer the effect of rain and fog is to lower the
temperature 6°.5. In winter, snow, sleet or rain increases the tem-
perature 49.3. From 54,097 observations, the following is the pro-
portional number of winds in 1,000:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

From this it results that the most frequent are the northwest and
southwest, the former in winter and the latter in summer. The
least number of days in which rain fell was in February, the greatest
in May. The greatest number of days in which snow fell was in Jan-
uary. The earliest snow occurred on the 26th September, 1808, and
the latest on the 8th of June, 1816. On an average, snow falls in
Brunswick on some day in May once in five years, and in October once
every other year. The average number of rainy days is 64. The average
number of snowy-days is 30. The average amount of rain and snow is
44.68 inches. The greatest amount of rain during any one day was 84
inches, November 4, 1845. The greatest fall of snow was on the 10th
of March, 1819, and. measured 30 inches. The greatest number of
rainfalls occur while the wind is from the northeast, and the least
number while it is from the west. The northeast wind in winter is
almost constantly accompanied by rain or snow, while in summer the
southeast surpasses it as a vehicle of rain, a result evidently due to
the position of the place of observation with respect to the ocean.
The number of storms of thunder and lightning recorded during 51
years is 472, or about 9a year. The greatest number occurred in
July and August, the least in January and February. The total num-
ber of fogs is 1,135, or 22in a year, the most dense of which occur in

ummer, the least dense in winter.

July is the only month in which no frost is recorded. The earliest
frost observed was August 3d, and the latest June 19th. Onan
average, the spring frost ceases after the first week in June, and the
autumn frost commences after the first week in September. There
were 34 hail storms—the greatest number in January, the least in
August. The records notice the occurrence of seven earthquakes
and 86 auroras, the greatest number of the latter in September and
October.

The aurora also exhibits a maximum andaminimum. The maxi-
mum occurred in 1808, 1818, 1830, 1838, 1848, 1857, giving differ-
ences of 10, 12, 8, 10, and 9 years. This indicates an average
period of about 10 years. Unfortunately the temperature of the
barometer is not given, and therefore a reduction on account of
the expansion of the mercury is not possible, and consequently the
only use which has been made of the record has been to exhibit the
monthly extreme values, together with their annual variations.

The barometric maxima reach their greatest value in December
and their least value in June. The minima occur in August. The
monthly range is the greatest at the period of greatest cold, in Jan-
uary, and the least range at the period of greatest heat, in July.
oa REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The observations at Marietta, Ohio, extend from 1817 to 1823,
by Mr. Joseph Wood, and from 1826 to 1859, inclusive, by Dr. 8. P.
Hildreth, the whole presenting an almost unbroken series of 40
years. Marietta, the oldest town in the State of Ohio, is situated at
the junction of the Muskingum and Qhio rivers, in latitude 39° 25’,
longitude 81° 29’ west, about 580 feet above tide-water.

The registers embrace records of temperature, wind, pressure of
the atmosphere, face of the sky, cloudiness, and precipitation in snow
and rain. The observations of Mr. Wood were made at sunrise, 2
p.m. and sunset, and by Dr. Hildreth generally at 6 a. m., 2 and 9
p- m., in summer, and 7a. m., 2 and 9 p.m., in winter. Deviations
in both series from these hours are noted and corrections applied
in the reductions.

Unfortunately a small portion of the manuscripts was lost by the
fire which destroyed a part of the Smithsonian building in January,
1865. This loss was partly supplied by the monthly means which
had been published by Dr. Hildreth in Silliman’s Journal.

During the 40 Marietta years a mean temperature is shown of 52°. 46.
The mean temperature of 1828, the warmest year during the whole
period, was 55°.38, and that of the coldest, 1856, was49°. 71, show-
ing a range or variationof temperature of 5°.67, which is about
the usual range of annual temperature, as indicated by shorter periods
in our latitude. The discussion indicates no change of annual tem-
perature during the whole period of 40 years, the mean temperature
of the first 20 years being the same as of the last 20 years. Neither
do these observations indicate any change in the temperature of
summer or winter by comparing the first 20 with the second 20
years. We think it probable, however, that a full discussion of all
the records collected by the Institution would show some slight change
in the average temperature of summer and winter due to the exposure
of the surface by the clearing away of trees, although no indications
of a similar kind may be given in the mean temperature of the year.

The greatest fluctuation of temperature is in February, and the
least in July and August. The lowest temperature during the whole
period was 23 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit, at 7 o'clock a. m.,
January 20, 1852; the extreme highest 102 degrees at 3 p. m., July
14,1859. These observations give an extreme range of temperature
of 125 degrees, which, when compared with that of Europe, may be
considered excessive; but, compared with that of other parts of
Americaand Asia, is not unusual. From all the observations it appears
that, on an average, the warmest day of the year is the 23d of July,
and the coldest the 15th of Januaty, while the days which have the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

same temperature as the mean of the whole year are the 14th of
April and the 15th of October.
The average temperatures of the seasons are as follows:

There have been observed by the meteorologists of Europe varia-
tions in the ordinary march of the change of temperature. Of these
there is one about the beginning of December, and another about the
middle of May, which are most conspicuous. The cause of such
abnormal change of temperature must be either local or general; if
the latter, its influence must be felt, perhaps, with some modification
in all parts of the globe. The observations were examined in regard
to these abnormal changes; but though they indicate a normal
temperature ‘about the beginning of December, they show a remarka-
ble depression of temperature between the 20th and 28th of Novem-
ber, which is preceded by an elevation on the 22d. A similar de-
pression, however, is not observed in the series for Brunswick.

The direction of the wind is recorded for 27 years to eight points
of the compass, and the result as to the relative frequency of each
in proportion to 1,000 is shown in the following table:

8. é W. E. S.W. N. E. INCU WW. 8. E.
173 | 217 135 52 213 39 87 84

From this it appears that the majority of the winds are from the
north and southwest, while the northeast and east winds are the least
frequent. The south wind is more frequent in summer, and the west |
and northwest in winter. This differs slightly from the winds in
Brunswick, Maine, where the wind of the greatest frequency is that
from the northwest, and next from the southwest. The difference is
probably due principally to the configuration of the surface.

The result of another investigation indicates an apparent secular
change in the direction of the wind, similar to the one noted at Bruns-
wick; but as the epochs are different, the subject requires the discus-
sion of more extended observations at different places.

The discussion of the connection of the direction of the wind-with.

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the temperature, from observations of 2,340 days, exhibits the fact
that the warmest winds are from the southeast, south and southwest,
all others being cold; the extreme difference being 15 degrees in win-
ter and 8} in summer. The comparison of the direction of the wind
and rain shows that the southwest wind in summer and the southeast in
winter are accompanied by the greatest amount of precipitation, and
that fair weather generally attends northerly winds throughout the
entire year. In summer the easterly and in winter the westerly
winds are also attended with fair weather. The average annual
quantity of rain and melted snow is 423 inches; the least amount
observed in any one year is 32°.46, and the greatest 619.84, varying
much less than is recorded of Brunswick. The greatest amount of rain
in any one month isin June, and the least in January. The average
number of rainy days in a year is 86. The quantity of rain is more
equally distributed throughout the year than at Brunswick. The
greatest fall of rain recorded on any one day was 4.25 inches, on the
3d July, 1844. The largest fall of snow, 15 inches, yas on the 4th
of December, 1833.

The indications of the barometer show a regular progression in the
weight of the atmosphere, which attains its greatest value in January
and its least between July and August.

Hthnology.—The subject of ethnology has, during tae past year,
continued to occupy aconsiderable share of the attention of the Institu-
tion. Renewed efforts have been made, by means of circulars and
correspondence, to increase the collection of specimens illustrative
of the different races of men inhabiting or who have inhabited this
continent.

The very extensive collections of ethnological articles from almost
every part of the world, made by the United States exploring ex-
pedition under Captain (now Admiral) Wilkes, having been placed in
charge of the Institution, not only afford a basis for a comparison of
the different modes of life and stages of advancement among exist-
ing tribes, but an important means of determining the ethnological
relations of the natives of the present day to those whose ancient
remains lie thickly strewn over our whole continent. For example,
implements of stone and of bone are almost everywhere found, the
workmanship of races that have long since disappeared, and of which
the use would be difficult of determination, were not similar imple-
ments as to form and material found in actual use at the present day
among savages, particularly those inhabiting the various islands of the
Pi cific ocean. Our object is to collect well-characterized specimens,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

illustrative of the remains of ancient industry; first, for the formation
of a collection as perfect as possible to be preserved in the national
museum; and second, for duplicates to present to other institutions,
with which we maintain relations of reciprocity. It may be observed
that, in making exchanges of specimens, the object is not alone to
enrich our museum, but to furnish the means throughout the world
of a more comprehensive comparison, and consequently to facilitate
the study of the various stages of the development of human inven-
tion.

During the past year large and valuable collections have been
received from the northwest coast and from within the Arctic Circle,
illustrative of the Indians and Esquimaux of these regions. We
have been particularly desirous to awaken an interest in the explo-
ration of the shell-heaps which have been found at various points
along our coast. These are now known to be of an artificial character,
and are frequently rich in specimens of the industry of the earlier
inhabitants of this country. As to the archeological value of these
shell-mounds, considerable difference of opinion prevails. They are
even regarded by some as the work of known tribes of Indians, con-
cerning whom we possess other and better sources of information;
but, even if this be so, they would serve to illustrate peculiarities of
customs, and should, in all cases, be explored and the materials
found in them carefully preserved. From the specimens derived
from the shell-deposits on the coast of Norway, the Scandinavian
archeologists were enabled to divide the stages of civilization into
three principal periods, namely: the stone age, the bronze or transi-
tion age, and the ironage. Thése divisions have been generally
admitted as characteristic of the principal stages of human develop-
ment, though they are not regarded as successive periods in the
general advancement of the world, since the inhabitants of one country
may be in the condition of the stone age, while those of others are in
the full enjoyment of all the advantages of the iron epoch. -

This division furnishes a ready means of classifying the various
archeological objects, so as to exhibit the comparative civiliza-
tion in different places at the same or at different epochs, and,
though it may be superseded by a more philosophic classification, it
forms an important step in the gradual advancement of a new sci-
ence. Indeed, it has lately been proposed to divide the stone age
into two—the paleolithic, or first stone age, aud the neolithic, or
second stone age; and from the discoveries which have been made
of late, and which have been so cumulative, we can _ scarcely
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

question the conclusions to which they all seem to point, namely:
that though the remains of man are found in a very recent geologi-
cal period, yet, in a historical point of view, the antiquity of these
remains is much greater than was formerly supposed. Those which
belong to the paleolithic age are usually found in beds of gravel
and loam, extending along river valleys and reaching a height some-
times of 200 feet above the present water level. That these beds
were not deposited by the sea is proved by the fact that the
remains which occur in them are those of fresh water, and not of
marine animals. These deposits contain fragments of such rocks only
as oceur in the area drained by the river itself, and consequently
at the time the deposit was formed the topography of western
Europe could not have been very different from what it is at present.
That the climate, however, was much more severe than it is now
is shown by the character of the animals of which the bones are
found in abundance, namely: the musk-ox, the woolly-haired rhi-
noceros, the lemming, and the reindeer—all arctic animals. The
great antiquity of the period is inferred from several indications.
The extinction of the large animals must have been a work of time,
and neither in the earlier writings, nor in popular traditions, do
we find any indication of their presence. Again the beds of gravel
and loam, which in most cases are deposited in regular strata, would
require a long succession of seasons, since we see how little effect
is produced at the present time in the course of a number of years.

In these deposits mingled with the regular strata are found stone
implements indicating the presence of reasoning beings previous to
the time at which the strata were deposited. According to Sir John
Lubbock, about 3,000 flint impiements have been found in what he
denominates the paleolithic age, in northern France and southern
England, but no traces of pottery, nor evidence of the use of metals,
nor even of polished stone implements, have yet been met with.

The neolithic age commences with a knowledge of a higher degree
of art, at a period when polished axes, chisels, gouges, and other
implements of stone, as well as hand-made pottery, were extensively used
in western Europe. The objects peculiar to this period do not occur
in the river drift gravel as in the previous period, except some of the
simpler ones. The implements are remarkably numerous in Den-
mark and Sweden, while the paleolithic types are absolutely
unknown there. It has hence been inferred that these northern
countries were not inhabited by man during the earlier periods. The

Danish shell-mounds belong to this period, as well as those of our own

country, and hence it becomes an important object of inquiry to
determine whether any real types of the palwolithic age exist in North
America. The two stone ages, however, are characterized by the
use of stone or bone, to the exclusion of metal.

It is evident, from the specimens which have been collected, that
there was a period when bronze was extensively used for arms and
implements. This is particularly manifest in the examination of
tumuli, in which stone and bronze implements are found existing
together. Some of the bronze axes, in many cases, appear to be
mere copies of those of stone, as indeed is the iron axe used by the
pioneers in clearing the American forest.

The bronze age is also distinguished from the stone age by the bones
of animals which are found mingled with the implements. Those
of wild beasts prevail in the former, while those of tame beasts are
most numerous in the iatter. No articles of bronze have been found in
this country, though those of copper, showing a less advance in art,
are frequently found in ancient mounds.

The iron age appeared when the metal was first used for weapons
and cutting instruments, and gradually extends into the twilight of his-
tory. From all the remains which have been found, it is evident that
neither bronze nor stone implements were used in northern Europe
at the commencement of the Christian era, and that the inhabitants
of these regions were not as low in the scale of civilization as the
accounts of their conquerors would seem to place them.

Exchanges. —The system of international scientific and literary
exchanges, to facilitate the correspondence between learned institu-
tions and individuals of the Old and New World, has been fully main-
tained during the past year, 1,083 boxes and packages having been
sent out, and 782 received since the date of the last report, most of
them with a large number of sub-parcels enclosed.

These packages, as in former years, contain the publications of
institutions, public documents, transactions of societies, scientific
works presented by individuals, specimens of natural history, eth-
nology, &c. This part of the operations of the establishment has
found much favor with the public. ‘‘ We have nothing of the kind,”
says a recent English publication, ‘‘in this country, and the difficulty
in exchanging books and specimens is much felt. The comparative
cheapness of freight is more than made up by the complicated
agencies and other extra charges, which can scarcely be avoided even
by those initiated in the secrets of the business. The sending one

or two volumes or a small packet of specimens into Germany is often
prevented by the difficulties and expense attending it.”’

At stated periods the following circular is distributed to institu-
tions and individuals in America :

‘¢The Smithsonian Institation is now making preparations to send
copies of its publications to the different libraries and societies in
Europe and other parts of the world with which it is in correspond-
ence. Asin previous years, it will undertake the transmission and
safe delivery of the publications of other American institutions on
the following conditions :

“1st. The volumes or publications to be put up in compact packages,
enveloped separately for each particular address. They must not be
sealed, although they can be pasted up or tied. Unsealed letters
relating to the contents of the package may be placed inside or sent
separately. Jn no case will sealed letters or packages be forwarded by
the Institution.

‘od. The packages must be addressed legibly, in full, Gf German,
they must be in Roman character,) and the name of the donor must .
be indorsed on each.

‘©3d. The parcels must be delivered in Washington free of expense to
the Smithsonian Institution. ‘

‘‘Ath, A detailed and full invoice of all the addresses on the par-
cels must be sent separately, in advance, by mail.

‘5th. The parcels should conform as nearly as possible in length
and breadth to the corresponding dimensions of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge, if in quarto, or to half this size, if octavo.
Octavo pamphlets should not be folded. No single package should
exceed six inches in thickness.

‘*6th. No charge will be made for the expenses of sending from
Washington, if the parcels be of moderate bulk. In any case the
proportion of actual expenses will only be called for.

‘‘Tf desired, the Smithsonian Institution will make the selection
of the most suitable recipients of any publications. In this case
nothing but the name of the donor need be marked on the parcels.

‘‘The next transmission of packages from the Smithsonian Institu-
tion will take place about the Ist June.

‘Parcels should be in hand a month earlier, and the lists sent by
mail at the earliest possible moment. These will be wanted con-
siderably in advance of the parcels, in order to make out the com-
plete invoices for each different address before commencing to pack
the boxes.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

‘‘ Unless the above conditions are severally and strictly observed
the parcels cannot be forwarded.

The cost of this system would far exceed the means of the Institu-
tion, were it not for important aid received from various parties
interested in facilitating international intercourse and the promotion
of friendly relations between distant parts of the civilized world.
The liberal aid extended by the steamship and other lines, men-
tioned in previous reports, in carrying the boxes of the Smithson
exchanges free of charge, has been continued, and several other
lines have been added to the number in the course of the year. The
names of this class of patrons of the Institution are given in the fol-
lowing list : |

Pacific Mail Steamship Company, North German Lloyd Steamship
Company, Hamburg American Steamship Company, General Trans-
Atlantic Steamship Company, Inman Steamship Company, Cunard
Steamship Company, Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Panama
railroad, California and Mexico Steamship Company.

Important favors have also been conferred during the year by the
Adams, the Harnden, and the Wells & Fargo Express Companies;
Mr. S. Hubbard, of San Francisco, and. Mr. George Hillier, of the
New York custom-house.

As in previous years, the agents of the Institution are: Dr. Felix
Flugel, in Leipsic; Mr. Gustave Bossange, in Paris; Mr. Wm. Wesley,
in London; Mr. Fred Miiller, in Amsterdam. ;

In view of the delays incident to the transmission of packages to
Italy, the Institution has embraced a proposal from the Royal Insti-
tute of Milan, conveyed through the friendly intervention of the
American minister, Hon. G@. P. Marsh, to take charge of the ex-
changes with that country, and a number of boxes have accordingly
been shipped to Milan, via Genoa, during the year.

Besides these agents, our countryman, Mr. James Swaim, now resid-
ing in Paris, has kindly consented to act as a special agent in super-
intending the construction of such articles of philosophical apparatus
as the Institution may require,

During the session of 1866~’67 an act was passed by Congress pro-
viding for the reservation of fifty complete sets of all the works pub-
lished at the expense of the United States, to be placed provisionally
in the hands of the Joint Library Committee of Congress, in order to
be exchanged, through the Smithsonian agency, for corresponding
publications of other nations. The object in this was to secure regu-
larly and systematically, at the least possible expense, all reports and
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

other documents relative to the legislation, jurisprudence, statistics,
internal economy, technology, &c., of all nations, so as to place the
material at the command of the committees and members of Con-
gress, heads of bureaus, &c. No appropriation was made for meet-
ing the necessary expenses, which, of course, could not be borne by
the Smithsonian fund, since all the returns were to belong to the
Library of Congress; but as a year would necessarily elapse before
any documents would be ready for distribution, it was thought proper
to defer further action until the present season. In the mean time,
however, a circular was issued by the Institution with the view of
ascertaining what governments would enter into the proposed arrange-
ment, and already replies have been received from a large number,
all embracing the opportunity offered of procuring the national pub-
lications of the United States, and proffering complete series of their
own in return. Some of these, indeed, have already sent large pack-
ages of their works without awaiting further action on the part of
our government. Among them, one large box of books from the
government of Victoria, Australia, has been received and the contents
deposited in the Congressional Library.

In view of the great importance of securing the foreign works
in question, we regret to learn that a difficulty has arisen in
reference to the fifty sets referred to. The Public Printer does not
consider himself authorized to furnish them without further legisla-
tion, since the distribution of the regular edition is already directed
by law, and he cannot supply the fifty sets in question unless the
regular edition be increased by that number. The attention of the
Library Committee has been called to this subject, and it is probable
that they will give it due consideration, as well as that of an appro-
priation to meet the necessary expenses.

The following is a list of governments which have responded
favorably to the proposed international exchanges of documents, &c.:

France, Belgium, Great Britain and Ireland, Switzerland, Spain,
Costa Rica, Netherlands, Chile, Denmark, Argentine Confederation,
United States of Colombia, Wurtemburg, Finland, Hamburg, Baden,
Sweden.

At the suggestion of Hon. John Bigelow, late American minister
to France, a request was made by the Institution that some of the prin-
cipal publishers of school-books in this country would furnish copies of
their elementary text-books, in order that these might be presented
to Professor H. Laboulaye, of the College of France, for examination,
with a view to the application of some of their peculiar features to

the purposes of instruction in his own country. The character of
this distinguished professor, and his known admiration of American
institutions, secured for this request the prompt and liberal response
of several publishers, a list of whom, with the number of works con-
tributed, is as follows:

Professor Laboulaye, in acknowledging the receipt of these 174
volumes, says: ‘These books form the admiration of all who take an
interest in education, and I hope that France will profit by this
example. We have excellent things at home by which you in turn
might profit, but we have seen nothing comparable to your readers,
your object-lessons, your graphics, and your geographical series.’’

Explorations and Collections. —The system of explorations mentioned
in the preceding reports has been continued as in previous years, with
the co-operation, in some cases, of other institutions and of persons
interested in special branches of natural history. The objects of
these explorations are to collect information and illustrations of the
natural history, the ethnology, meteorology, and physical geography
of the various parts of the continent of North America. The organ-
ization of these expeditions has been specially in charge of Professor
Baird, who has devoted, with his wonted zeal, a large amount of
labor to the preparation of outfits and to the care and arrangement
of the specimens obtained. We shall give an account of these sev-
eral explorations under the names of the districts within which they
Lave been prosecuted.

British and Russian America.—In previous reports a statement has
been given relative tothe scientific department of the expedition organ-
ized by the Western Union Telegraph Company, for the purpose of
effecting an electric communication between the United States and
Europe, across Behring’s Straits, and we have now to express our
regret that the enterprise has been abandoned. We have, too, to
deplore the sudden death of Mr. Kennicott, the director of the natu-
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ral history department of the expedition, which took place in May,
1866, at Nulato, on the lower Yukon. In this dispensation of Provi-
dence, science has lost an ardent and successful votary, and the Insti-
tution one of its most valued collaborators. It is to him that we owe
our introduction to the most important sources of information relative
to the fur countries, and it is principally through his exertions that
. the museum of the city of Chicago, of which he was the director,
received its endowment end organization.

After the death of Mr. Kennicott, Mr. W. H. Dall succeeded him
as chief of the scientific corps, and has since been occupied in ex-
ploring the Yukon river from Fort Yukon to its mouth. He is still
engaged in this work, but will probably return in the autumn of 1868.

To the co-operation of Col. Bulkley, the chief of the survey, and
of Messrs. Scammon, Ketchum, Fisher, Smith, and others mentioned
in the list of donors to the collections, much of the success of the oper-
ations relative to natural history is due. The collections themselves
were made principally by Messrs. Kennicott, Dall, Bischoff, Bannister,
and Elliott. Since the return of the surveying parties all the maps
and reports relating to the geographical part of the work have been
placed in possession of this Institution, with a view to their being
elaborated in the form of a memoir for publication.

The explorations under the auspices of the telegraph company
were made partly in Nicaragua during the transit of the scientific
corps across the Isthmus, partly in the vicinity of San Francisco while
the expedition was in process of being organized, partly in Kam-
tschatka and in British Columbia, but chiefly in the island of Sitka
and on Norton Sound and the Yukon river.

The collections from the Yukon and Norton Sound region, as well
as those from both sides of Behring’s Straits, are very extensive and
valuable. Among the results most interesting to the naturalist is
the discovery at Norton Sound and at Nulato of three genera of birds*
previously supposed peculiar to the Old World.

The collections of the telegraph expedition at Sitka were made
by Mr. Ferdinand Bischoff, during a stay of about fourteen months,
and are of great extent and value. Desirous of having a collection of
specimens from Kamtschatka for comparison with those from the
shores of Russian America, the Institution, conjointly with the Chicago
Academy of Sciences, engaged the services of Mr. Bischoff for that
purpose, and furnished him with a complete outfit, while the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, in its usual spirit of liberality as regards

the interests of science, gave hima free passage to San Francisco.
Thence he sailed, still free of expense, in one of the vessels of the
Russian Telegraph Company, but no stop being made at Kamtschatka,
he was obliged to proceed to Plover Bay, the telegraphic depot on
the Asiatic side of the straits, where he failed not to make some inter-
esting collections. Returning with the vessel to San Francisco in Octo-
ber, he was directed to proceed to Mazatlan, and there, under the direc-
tion of the valued correspondent of the Institution, Colonel Grayson,
he is now engaged in prosecuting his researches, but intends to return
in the spring and proceed to Kodiak, where he will probably remain
for a year, collecting specimens and exploring the country. It is
proper to mention that he was also provided with a free passage to
Mazatlan, through the kindness of Mr. Halliday, on the vessels of the
Mexican, Oregon, and California line.

It was known that the Institution had for several years been dili-
gently engaged in gathering specimens and collecting information to
illustrate the character of the northwest portion of the American conti-
nent, and consequently, when the question of the acquisition of Alaska
by the United States came under discussion, it was to the Institution
that reference was chiefly made by the State Department and the Sen-
ate for information in regard to the country. Two of our collaborators,
then on a visit to the Institution, Mr. Henty Bannister, who had spent
a year in Norton Sound, and Mr. Bischoff, who had passed the same
length of time at Sitka, were called upon to give evidence before the
Committee on Foreign Relations, and were, in effect, the only persons
examined who were acquainted with the region from personal observa-
tion. Professor Baird also gave valuable information as to the zoology
of the country, from the materials which had previously been collected
by the Institution.

For the purpose of obtaining additional information relative to the
new Territory of Alaska, an expedition was organized by the Treas- »
ury Department, under the charge of Captain W. A. Howard of the
revenue service, and, at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury,
instructions for research into the physical and natural history of the
country were furnished by the Smithsonian Institution, The expedi-
tion left San Francisco on the revenue steamer Lincoln, under command
of Captain T. W. White, during the summer of 1867, and spent several
monthsin its explorations. It was accompanied by a special party
from the Coast Survey under charge of Mr. George B. Davidson, who
has since communicated a valuable memoir on the country to the
Superintendent of the Coast Survey, which has been printed by Con-
gress. Important collections in natural history and ethnology have
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been supplied to the Institution by Captains Howard and White,
and Mr. Davidson.

The officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, especially at posts in
the Mackenzie river district, have continued during the past year to
make contributions in the way of information and specimens. Prom-
inent among these may be mentioned, as in previous years, Mr. R.
McFarlane of Fort Anderson, to whom we are indebted for an almost
exhaustive collection of materials from the Arctic coast; Messrs. James
Lockhart, Strachan Jones, C. P. Gaudet, W. Brass, J. and A. Flett,
R. McDonald, J. McDougall, and James Sibbiston. To Mr. B. R,
Ross the Institution owes a valuable contribution from Hudson’s bay,
embracing the, first specimens of a large bird, the bernicla leucopsis,
known to have been found in North America. It is intended to
embody the result of the observations of our correspondents in Arctic
America in a memoir, which will form an interesting addition to the
ethnology, natural history and physical geography of the country.

It may be said to the honor of the officers of the Hudson’s Bay and
Northwest Companies, that though secluded for years from civilized
society, they manifest in general no want of interest in subjects which
pertain to a wide range of human culture; and it may be claimed on
the other hand for the Smithsonian Institution, that it has been not
slightly efficient in enlivening their isolated and monotonous life by
the incitements and facilities it has afforded them for the study and
observation of the phenomena and objects of nature.

Mr. Donald Gunn, our veteran correspondent in the Red River set-
tlement, has made, at our request, an expedition to the lakes west of
Lake Winnipeg, and obtained some rare and valuable specimens not
previously in our collection. An account of his journey is given in
the appendix to this report, and will, we doubt not, be read with inter-
est, if only as the production of a man who has spent his life far
removed from the centres of refined civilization.

Among the collections received through the telegraph expedi-
tion was a valuable series of specimens gathered on the northern
end of Vancouver’s island by Mr. A. W. Heisen, an American resi-
dent, these being the first ever received from that region.

Western America.—Mr. J. G. Swan, of Neaah Bay, Washington
Territory, whom we have mentioned as favoring the Institution with
an interesting memoir on the Makah Indians, has continued his valua-
ble contribution of marine animals and ethnological specimens. Ex-
tensive series of marine invertebrates and eggs of birds have been
received from Dr. P. A. Canfield, of Monterey, and Dr. Cooper has
furnished some rare eggs and nests. The remainder of a large col-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

lection made by Dr. Coues in the vicinity of Prescott, Arizona, has
also come to hand. Reports forming valuable contributions to the
general natural history of the Territory have been published by Dr.
Coues in the proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, and in the American Naturalist, based on the specimens in
the Smithsonian collection. Dr. EK. Palmer, formerly associated with
Dr. Coues in collecting in the vicinity of Prescott, and devoting
himself while there especially to the plants and insects, has since
spent some time in southern Arizona at Camp Grant, and procured
copious collections in all branches of natural history, as well as full
series of objects made or used by the Apache Indians, which he
has presented to the Institution.

Interior mountain regions.—Dr. C. Wernigk has made explorations
in Colorado and Montana, and presented specimens to the Institution
for determination and addition to the collections.

During the summer of 1867, Dr. F. V. Hayden was engaged in a
geological survey of Nebraska, under the direction of the Commis-
sioner of the Land Office, and made extensive collections of fossils and
other specimens, which Mr. Meek, of the Institution, is now engaged
in determining. Dr. Minor, of the Winnebago reserve, has supplied
many specimens of ethnology and zoology. To Mr. Allan Mudge and
Dr. Crocker, of Kansas, we are also indebted for important contri-
butions from the last-named State, During the past year an explo-
ration of the geology of the region along the 40th parallel of latitude,
and eastward from California, was authorized by Congress at the
request of the War Department, and the expedition was placed by
the Secretary of War under the charge of Mr. Clarence King, who,
for several years, had been the assistant of Professor Whitney in the
geological survey of California. On application by Mr. King, the
Institution took charge of the preparation of the natural history outfit
of the expedition, made arrangements to receive all its collections, and
to give such necessary facilities for working up the results as are
usually afforded to the scientific parties of the government. Besides
the regular assistants, Mr. King is accompanied by Mr. Robert Ridg-
way as zoologist, and Mr. Bailey as botanist. The collections already
received are of much interest. The labors of the survey have so far
been devoted to the examination of the celebrated Comstock lode
of Nevada.

astern and Southern States.—Collections of more or less extent
have been received from various contributors east of the Mississippi
river, which will be found detailed in the list of donations. Dr. H.
B. Butcher has completed his explorations in the vicinity of Laredo,
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Texas, and has furnished a series of specimens, of which the collec-
tion of birds is especially valuable as throwing light on the distribu-
tion of species.

West Indies.—In connection with explorations in the. West Indies,
the Smithsonian Institution has to deplore the loss of Dr. Henry
Bryant, of Boston, one of its most highly prized coadjutors in the
work of American explorations. Not alone did he freely contribute
of his abundant means, but he gave his personal services indefat-
igably to the extension of knowledge in the field of natural history.
In both these respects the Institution had enjoyed his uniform
co-operation as it shared the fruits of his successful labors. These
labors had been principally conducted in Labrador, and on the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, in Florida, in the Bahamas, in Cuba, and in Jamaica;
and it was while pursuing his researches in Porto Rico that he met
with an untimely death, occasioned probably by excessive exertion
in an insalubrious climate. He died 2d January, 1867, at the lit-.
tle village of Arecibo, in the last-named island. Dr. Bryant contem-
plated a memoir on the birds of the West Indies, and was, at the
time of his death, engaged in the prosecution of this object. His
entire collection of the birds of the West Indies has been intrusted
to Prof. Baird for determination, and after this has been effected it 1s
the design of Mrs. Bryant to present a series of each species to the
principal museums at home and abroad, in conformity with the in-
tention of her lamented husband.

From Jamaica collections have been sent by Mr. W. T. March, in
continuation of many previous contributions, and from Cuba by Mr.
Bishop. Mr. A. E. Younglove spent several months in Hayti, and
obtained a valuable series of birds and reptiles, embracing several
new species. Mr. H.M. Allen, United States consul at Bermuda,
has also given attention to the birds and marine animals of the islands,
and has sent specimens.

Towards the close of the year an appropriation was made for a
special exploration relative to the geology of the island of Petite
Anse, in the Gulf of Mexico, near Vermillion bay, and the adjoining
region, by Professor E. W. Hilgard, of the University of Mississippi.
The immediate inducement for this exploration was the discovery of
a stratum of rock salt on this island, together with the remains of
extinct animals associated with specimens of human industry. The
exploration was commenced too late in the season to be fully prosecuted.
The weather, however, proved unusually favorable, the sugar-cane
having bloomed on the Louisiana coast for the first time in 27 years.
The exploration suggested many new questions, which can only be
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

a
answered by further investigation. The following is an abstract of
the results already obtained :

“The Port Hudson deposit described by Carpenter, Lyell, and others,
is the cypress swamp equivalent of the ‘ bluff formation,’ just as the
existing cypress swamps correspond to the Mississippialluvium. The
three islands, (out of the chain of five,) which were examined; con-
sist of outliers of ‘orange sand,’ which has resisted denudation;
on and around which, strata precisely similar to those of Port Hud-
son have subsequently been deposited. The rock-salt of Petite
Anse island underlies the orange sand, and is, therefore, anterior to
the drift, and it may probably be reached at points much higher
above tide level than has been supposed, obviating the chief difli-
culty (that of drainage) heretofore experienced in working the
deposit, the lowest part of which only has thus far been explored.
While the precise position of the deposit, as regards the inferior
formations, cannot now be determined, the results of the boring of the
New Orleans artesian well render the conclusion almost unavoidable,
in view of the absence of all signs of disturbance on the coast, that
the salt deposit is of an age corresponding to that of the strata pen-
etrated in this boring, which there is reason to believe are post-ter-
tiary. Apart from all these comparatively ancient deposits, the entire
delta is underlaid at or near tide levels by a cypress swamp deposit,
as it would seem, of later date ; and beneath these, as well as the
more ancient deposits of a similar nature, there are beds of gravel of
a composition similar to that of the main or Mississippi branch of the
great stream of the orange sand epoch, which here appears to have
divided into two branches, one reaching the gulf inthe region of
Vermillion bay, the other on or near the Sabine. Important
information was obtained concerning the formations of northern Lou-
isiana, which, while of course corresponding in general to those of
Mississippi, differ so far as to promise a ready determination of
the age of the grand gulf groups, which thus far remains in doubt,
notwithstanding that those groups cover nearly half of the State of
Mississippi, filling the space between the eocene and postpleiocene
deposits. All that is known of it, is, that during its formation, palms
flourished on the borders of an immense lake or everglade, which
either bordered, or itself represented, the present gulf of Mexico.
After what has been observed in Louisiana, there is less difficulty
in accounting fo. the total absence of animal fossils from this forma-
tion in Mississippi.’’ But the problem to be solved regarding its age,
extent, and relations to the eocene and quaternary shores of the gulf
is one of so much interest that while in Louisiana Mr. Hilgard was
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

impressed with the importance of a more extended exploration than
was at first contemplated, which, starting from the northern border
of the marine eocene, above Vicksburg, should proceed diagonally
across to the locality where petroleum has been found on the bor-
ders of Texas. So great was the interest manifested in regard to
these matters wherever he went in Louisiana, that, were the affairs
of the country at all settled, he has no doubt it would be easy to pro-
cure an appropriation or even subscription for the purpose.

Mexico.—The regular correspondents of the Institution in this
country have continued their co-operation. Colonel Grayson, of
Mazatlan, has furnished specimens from the vicinity of that city,
and from other points in Western Mexico. At the joint expense of
the Smithsonian Institution and the Boston Society of Natural History,
he visited, last spring, the island of Socorro, one of the Revilligideo
group, some hundreds of miles southwest of Cape San Lucas, and
made an exploration of its natural history, obtaining several new
species of birds. Returning via San Blas, he met with a severe loss
in that city by the death of his son, the companion of his scientific
labors, who was murdered by some unknown persons. The result of
Colonel Grayson’s investigations will shortly be published in the pro-
ceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History.

Professor Sumichrast and Mr. Botteri, of Orizaba, and Dr. Sarto-
rious, of Mirador, have continued their valuable contributions, the
jatter gentleman in addition furnishing meteorological records.

Central America.—The collaborators in this part of the continent
still continue active. From Guatemala Mr. Henry Hague has sent
large collections of birds and mammals, and Dr. Van Patten, of ver-
tebrata generally. From Costa Rica, the contributions of Dr. A. Von
Frantzius, Mr. Endres, José Zeledon, and Mr. Juan Cooper embrace
ample series in certain branches of zoology, while Mr. F. Lehmann
has furnished an interesting collection of fossils and minerals. é

The last of the collections made in Yucatan by Dr. Arthur Schott,
during the exploration of that country instituted by Governor Salazar,
have reached the Institution, and with the first portions received,
furnish an excellent idea of the natural history of the northern part
of the peninsula, the southern part of which will be illustrated by
Dr. Berendt’s researches.

As mentioned in a preceding report, Dr. H. Berendt, who has
been many years one of our collaborators, undertook an exploration of
the little-known interior of the Peninsula of Yucatan, under the
auspices of the Institution, and at the expense partly of subscrip-
tions by various societies and individuals. He first passed up the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Balize river, and thence to the region about Lake Peten, where he
remained until the summer of 1867, making collections in natural
history, and prosecuting researches in anthropology and geography.
He visited the United States towards the end of the year, but will
return shortly to Guatemala to complete his labors and to bring back
his extensive collections.

An important collection of antiquities has been presented by the
Hon. C. N. Riotte, late United States minister to Costa Rica. Mr.
Geo. N. Lawrence, of New York, a collaborator of the Institution, is
at present occupied in preparing a catalogue of the birds of Costa
Rica, based chiefly upon the Smithson collection, which will prob-
ably include 500 species. To Dr. Von Frantzius the acknowledgments
of the Institution are especially due for his valuable scientific cor-
respondence and intelligent aid and supervision in conducting the
explorations of the Institution in his adopted country.

Mr. Hardiman, of San Salvador, has contributed the first collection
of birds received from that country. Mr. Osbert Salvin has presented
aseries of the birds of Veragua, collected by his correspondent,
Mr. Arcé. Dr. Kluge, of Aspinwall, and Captain J. M. Dow, of
Panama, have also continued their aid. The services of the latter in
attending to the interests of the Smithsonian Institution on the Isth-
mus of Panama and the west coast of Central America, in issuing
supplies, receiving and forwarding collections, &c., are of great value,
and deserve the special acknowledgments of the Board of Regents.

South America.—The principal exploration in South America under
the auspices of the Institution has been that of Prof. James Orton,
of Rochester University, undertaken especially in the interest of the
Lyceum of Natural History of Williams College, Massachusetts.
The Institution lent the scientific instruments, supplied a considerable
portion of the outfit, and took charge of the transportation and recep-
tion of the collections. Two parties were organized. The one under
the immediate direction of Prof. Orton proceeded to Guayaquil via
Panama, the other under Mr. W. B. Gilbert went to Venezuela. The
party under Prof. Orton, after remaining some time at Guayaquil,
where most of them were taken sick with yellow fever, finally arrived
at Quito. Here they had the misfortune to lose one of their mem-
bers, Colonel Phineas Stanton, a gentleman of many accomplish-
ments, who volunteered to accompany the expedition as an amateur
artist. After exploring in Pechincha and other localities on the
plateav. of Ecuador, they crossed to the head-waters of the Amazon,
descending by Marafion to Para, and thence returned home. The

4s
59 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Venezuela division prosecuted their researches for a time in the
district of Caraccas, and then returned via the Orinoco river. All
the collections of both parties have been sent to the Institution
for identification, and have been distributed for that purpose among
the naturalists of the country.

A collection principally of birds and butterflies, made in the neigh-
borhood of Bogota, was conveyed to the Institution through the
attentive care of Hon. A. A. Burton, late United States minister.
Many of the species are new as regards that locality. From Chile there
has been received a collection, nearly complete, of birds prepared and
determined by Prof. A. R. Phillippi, Director of the National Museum
at Santiago. The series is of special. value as containing types of
many of the new species described by Prof. Phillippi and his asso-
ciate, Dr. Landbeck.

An important Smithsonian exploration has been made during the
last year in the Province of Buenos Ayres by Mr. W. H. Hudson,
who has transmitted large collections of birds, which have been
referred to Mr. P. L. Sclater and Mr. Osbert Salvin. of London, for
examination, these gentlemen having been especially occupied in
the stndy of South American birds. Mr. A. de Lacerda, of Bahia,
has continued his valued contributions from that portion of Brazil.

With the exception of the Russian telegraph expedition at Plover
bay, and on the Asiatic side of Behring’s straits, the explorations we
have enumerated have been confined to the American continent and
its islands. This is in accordance with a settled policy of the Insti-
tution, to the effect that the natural and physical history of the Old
World shall be relinquished to the explorers of Europe.

The following remarks by George Bentham, esq., president of the
Linnean Society of London, present the scientific importance of
explorations in this country in so clear a lhght that I may be
excused for quoting them at length: “The peculiar condition
of the North American continent requires imperatively that its
physical and biological statistics should be accurately collected
and authentically recorded, and that this should be speedily done.
Vast tracts of land are still in what may be called almost a
primitive state, unmodified by the effects of civilization, uninhab-
ited, or tenanted only by the remnants of ancient tribes, whose
unsettled life never exercised much influence over the natural pro-
ductions of the country. But this state of things is rapidly passing
away; the invasion and steady progress of a civilized population,
while changing generally the face of nature, is obliterating many of
the evidences of a former state of things. The larger races of wild
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Bl

animals are dwindling down, like the aboriginal inhabitants, under
the deadly influence of civilized man. Myriads of the lower orders
of animal life, as well as of plants, disappear with the destruction of
forests, the drainage of swamps, and the gradual spread of cultiva-
tion, and their places are occupied by foreign invaders. Other races,
no doubt, without actually disappearing, undergo a gradual change
under the new order of things, which, if perceptible only in the
course of successive generations, require so much the more for future
proof an accurate record of their state in the still unsettled condition
of the country. In the Old World almost every attempt to compare
the present state of vegetation or animal life with that which existed
in uncivilized times is in a great measure frustrated by the absolute
want of evidence as to that former state ; but in North America the
change is going forward, as it were, close under the eye of the observer.
This consideration may one day give great value to the reports of the
naturalists sent by the government, as we have seen, at the instance
of the Smithsonian Institution and other promoters of science, to
accompany the surveys of new territories.’’

The total number of contributors to the collections of the Institution
in 1867 was 163. The total number of primary boxes or packages
received was 320. The general character of these additions will be
learned from the table at the end,of the report; they vary from
single specimens to boxes filled with a variety of objects, the latter
being far the most numerous. Among the most important may be
mentioned the collections of the Russian telegraph expedition, those
of Dr. Butcher, of Mr. Carmiol, of Colonel Grayson, of Professor

‘Sumichrast, of Dr. Hayden, of Mr. Hudson, and of Dr. Palmer.

To the Zoological Garden of Hamburg, Dr. W. H. Sigel, director,
the Institution is indebted for the present of a number of European
house sparrows, which had been asked for with the view of natural-
izing them in Washington and vicinity, in order to secure the aid of
these nimble and voracious birds in ridding the fruit and shade trees
of this region from noxious insects. Although 300 were embarked,
only five reached the Institution (in August last) alive. These were
immediately liberated and have remained in the proximity of the
building during the winter. For further notice of these sparrows see
general correspondence.

The Institution is indebted to Mr. T. A. Randall, of Warren, Pa.,
for a large number of living menopoma allegheniensis from the Allegheny
river. Such of these as survived were sent to several of the Zoologi-
cal Gardens of Europe, and aaa: will probably be transmitted in the
ensuing spring.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

Philadelphia ; general collections of myriapoda. Professor Jeffries
Wyman, Cambridge ; skulls of Pacific coast Indians. The insects have
been sent to the Entomological Society of Philadelphia to be iden-
tified and preserved.

Professor Baird has continued, as other duties would permit, his
investigations in regard to the birds of America, of which 450 pages
have already been printed, under the title of ‘‘ Review of American
Birds in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.’’ The object of
this work is to define the absolute and comparative characters of the
birds of America, and especially to trace with minute detail their
distribution during the breeding season, and the extent and character
of their migrations. He has also been engaged in digesting and col-
lating for publication by the Institution the mass of original notes
coutributed by Mr. Kennicott, Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Ross, and others,
relative to the natural history of the regions north of the United
States, which are believed to embody much original information.

The records of the Institution have also been largely drawn upon
for materials required by part 2 of the North American Oology of
Dr. Brewer. As explained in previous reports, the object of this work
alzo is to present, in addition to the description of the nests and eggs
of the species, a complete account of their habits and geographical
distribution during the breeding season.

For the promotion of these objects, circulars and pamphlets con-
taining the necessary instruction to collectors have been issued for
several years past, and large returns obtained, which will greatly
extend our present knowledge. The notes containing information
attached to the specimens received by the Institution have been
carefully transcribed, and systematically arranged, so as to supply
conveniently any information required on the subjects referred to.

In all cases in which specimens have been presented or lent to
investigators for facilitating their researches, or enabling them to
pursue certain lines of investigation, it is required that full credit for
the favor conferred, as far as the facts may justify it, shall be given
to the Institution by the authors in their resulting publications. In
most cases this recognition has been fully complied with, but in a
few we are sorry to say the acknowledgments have not been of the
character or extent to which the Institution was entitled.

The distribution of the duplicate specimens of the collections has
been carried on as rapidly as practicable during the year. The most
important series sent off have consisted of skins and eggs of arctic birds,
skins of mammals, shells, minerals, and ethnological specimens. The
54 _ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

minerals were arranged and labelled for the purpose by Professor
Egleston, the shells by Dr. P. P. Carpenter, the ethnological objects
by Dr. E. Foreman. As the collections generally become reduced to
order, identified, and duplicates eliminated, further distributions will
will take place. According to the account of Professor Baird, nearly
a quarter of a million of different specimens have thus been sent
away to places where they are likely to be of use. It should be
borne in mind that in nearly every instance these specimens had pre-
viously been identified and labelled by the highest authorities, and
in fact served as types or standards of special reference.

The foregoing account of the disposition of the specimens collected
by the Institution will serve to illustrate the spirit and policy of the
establishment, as well as the working of the system of active opera-
tions in its relation to the advancement of natural history. The
same policy, but with more efficiency, would be continued, were Con-
gress to take charge of the museum, or make separate provision for
its maintenance.

Besides the investigations in the line of natural history, several
others have been commenced, at the charge and under the direction
of the Institution and are still in progress. George Gibbs, esq., has
been engaged in collating and arranging for publication all the Indian
vocabularies which have been collected by the Institution. An
appropriation has been made for a systematic exploration of mounds
and ancient remains in certain localities, of which an account will be
given in the next report. As is seen under the head of meteorology,
the labors of Mr. Schott have been continued in the reduction and
discussion of observations. An appropriation has been made to assist
Prof. Wm. Ferrel in a series of investigations relative to the tides;
and another to Prof. Newcomb, of the National Observatory, to defray
the expense of numerical calculations for his discussion of the obser-
vations of the planet Neptune. The Secretary, in connection with
General Poe, of the Light-house Board, devoted a part of his summer
vacation to investigations in regard to the penetration of sound, in
its relation to fog-signals. The remainder of the same vacation, as
well asa considerable amount of other time, was devoted to the
examination of subjects referred to him by the government, as pre-
siding officer of the National Academy of Sciences.

In addition to the collaborators in natural history already mentioned,
the Institution during the past year has been favored with the gratui-
tous services of a number of other gentlemen in reporting upon ques-
tions proposed for solution,in examining memoirs, and in the prepara-
tion of articles for the report. Among these may be mentioned Prof.
REPORT QF THE SECRETARY. 55

G.J. Brush, of Yale College; Dr. Gray, of Harvard; Profs. Newcomb
and Harkness, of the Naval Observatory; Drs. Woodward and Craig,
of the Surgeon General’s Office; Prof. Schaeffer and Mr. Taylor, of
the Patent Office; Mr. Gibbs, of Washington; Mr. C. Rau, of New
York; Prof. Chace, of Brown University.

National Museum.—Much time has necessarily been consumed dur-
ing the past year in repairing the damage sustained by the specimens
and the gallery of exhibition in consequence of the conflagration of
the upper part of the building in 1865. The defective state of the
temporary roof permitted a large amount of moisture to enter the
walls, which kept the hall in a constant state of dampness, covering
the specimens with mould. The entire collection has, however, been
examined, dried, and cleaned; the shelves and the interior of the
cases, with the stands of the specimens, whitened; the ceilings and
walls frescoed, and new paint applied to most of the woodwork.

The most important work connected with the museum has been the
labelling and preliminary arrangement of the extensive collection of
ethnological objects, and the separation of the duplicates. All the
collections of vertebrata as received have been catalogued and put in
place; many osteological specimens cleaned; bottles of alcoholic speci-
mens washed, &c. The labelling and registering of the collection has
been continued as rapidly as possible, 13,221 entries having been
made during the year.

This museum is principally made up of the type specimens of the
collections made by the various expeditions organized by the govern-
ment, as well as those projected and supported by, the Smithsonian
Institution itself, and owes but little to donations, and still less to
purchases. There is, however, a large debt due the Institution from
foreign museums, in the way of exchange, which we have no doubt will
be cheerfully discharged as soon as they are informed that Congress
has made provision for the support of a museum on a more extended
scale than that which the Smithsonian is able to maintain. Besides
the increase of the museum from the addition of type specimens
derived from the various collections examined and described during
the year, a number of foreign donations have been received, among
which are specimens of the products of the iron mines and man-
ufactures of Sweden, presented by Hon. G. V. Fox, late Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, and from the same donor large and beautiful
specimens of graphite from eastern Siberia, both rough and wrought,
as well as exemplifications of the rocks associated with it.

It may be recollected that when the government museum was
transferred to the Institution, it was stipulated that an appropriation
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

should be annually made for it in this new depository, equivalent to
the cost of its support while in the Patent Office; and the appropria-
tion for this purpose had been limited until the last session of Congress
to the sum of $4,000. But this sum, on account of the rapid increase
of the collections and the great advance in prices, is not now nearly
sufficient even for the preservation of the specimens, to say nothing
of the equitable claim which the Institution might rightfully advance
for interest on the money which it has expended in providing the
accommodations for this museum. It is but just to say that, in view
of the peculiar condition of our affairs, the appropriation was, last
year, temporarily increased to $10,000; but even were this .con-
tinued, it would be still quite inadequate to the suitable maintenance
of a national museum.

National Library.—The transfer of the library of the Institution to
the care of Congress, authorized in 1866, was completed during the
last year. The reasons for making this transfer were given in full
in the last report, but it may be proper briefly to recapitulate some
of the leading points.

first. The collection and support of a large library is not in strict
conformity with the will of Smithson, as now generally interpreted.

Second. The whole of the income would in time not be more than
sufficient to meet the wants of a rapidly growing library, the tendency
being to absorb more and more of the funds with the increase of the
number of the books, and hence even a library adequate to the wants
of the various departments of government can only be properly
supported by the appropriations of Congress. The government has
already commenced such a library, and even if there were no objec-
tions to expending the income of the bequest of Smithson in the pur-
chase of books and the maintenance of a library, it would be unneces-
sary to establish two libraries in such close proximity.

Third. By combining the two libraries in one, the expense of
accommodation, of care and of management will be much diminished,
and a greater facility as to consulting the works afforded.

Fourth. The portion of the Smithsonian building in which the library
was deposited is not fire-proof, and was filled to overflowing, while fur-
ther accommodations and protection could not be afforded without
encroachment on the funds which had been set apart as the perma-
nent capital.

Fifth. By the terms of the transfer, the cataloguing, binding, and
entire care and management of the books are at the expense of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 57

government, and consequently an important portion of the income is
made available for active operations.

Sixth. The transfer has furthermore tended to awaken an interest
in the library of Congress, which cannot fail to render it, under
the energetic superintendence of the librarian, Mr. Spofford, worthy
of the nation. At the last session of Congress an appropriation of
$100,000 was made for the purchase of the library of Mr. Peter Force,
consisting of books relating to America, and with these additions the
library of Congress is the largest in the United States,* and may even
now with propriety be denominated, as we have ventured to call it,
the National Library.

By the law authorizing the transfer, the Institution is at liberty to
draw any books it may require for its use either from its own collec-
tion or from those of Congress. It is proposed, as soon as the
regents’ room is properly provided with cases, to keep in the Institu-
tion such books as are most frequently required for consultation in its
operations, and fortunately a considerable number of these are dupli-
cates in the two libraries.

Seventh. The books transferred to the National Library are in
many cases such as could not be obtained by purchase, and are pres-
ents to the Institution from the old libraries of Europe, consisting of
transactions and other publications of learned societies, forming a
special collection not only ranking first in this country, but one of the
best in the world.

Neither is it the value of the books already transferred which is to
be considered, but also the perpetual increase of the several series of
scientific transactions in their continuations from year to year which
are regularly supplied in exchange for the publications of the Insti-
tution.

The collections of transactions of societies contain the record of
the actual progress of the world in all that essentially pertains to the
mental and physical development of the human family, and as it has
been the aim of the Smithsonian Institution from the first to establish
exchanges with all societies of this character, the list of those now
in the national library includes, with scarcely any important excep-
tion, the whole series of the world, and affords tne means therefore of
tracing the history of at least every branch of positive science since
the days of the revival of letters until the present time.

The use of this library for the purpose of research will soon be
much facilitated and its treasures bronght more generally into requi-

58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sition by the publication of the classified index of all the physical
papers in the transactions of learned societies and in scientific peri-
odicals which has been in course of preparation for the last ten years
by the Royal Society of London, and of which the printing of the first
volume has just been completed. It may be recollected that the
preparation of this index resulted from a letter addressed to the Brit-
ish Association in 1855, by the Secretary of this Institution, setting
forth the advantages to science of such a work, that the matter was
referred to a committee of the Association, reported favorably upon,
and recommended for execution to the Royal Society. As soon as
this work is published copies will be procured by the principal libra-
ries and institutions in this country. Any person, then, desiring to
investigate a special point in any branch of science, will be able to
find a reference to the transactions, journals or proceedings in which
it is contained ; and as the most perfect set of these is to be found in
the Naticnal Library, it will become a centre of information on scien-
tific subjects. It may also be remarked that the National Library is
now accessible to all persons during every week-day in the year, with
the exception of one month devoted to cleaning and arranging.

~In the arrangement of the compound library the principal part of
the Smithson collection, that is, the scientific transactions, will forma
department by itself in which works of asimilar character previously
belonging to the library of Congress will be incorporated, while the
miscellaneous books of the Institution will be arranged with the works
of a similar class already in that library. A complete catalogue of
all the transactions belonging to the Smithson library up to 1866 was
prepared and published by the Institution, and a general catalogue
of the whole National Library is now in the press, in which the books
of the Institution are designated by the letter—S.

Some idea may be formed of the value of the annual contributions
from the exchanges of the Institution, when it is mentioned that it
includes the publications of 1,081 sccieties, besides large donations
from governments, libraries, and individuals, and that these publica-
tions are principally of a very expensive character, illustrated by
costly engravings and in many cases by colored plates. The following
is a statement of the number of establishments in different parts of
the world which have contributed to the Smithson library, and which
it is expected will continue their contributions from year to year for
an indefinite period.

To the list ef correspondents during the past year we may add the
Institute of Egypt, founded at Alexandria, in 1859, from which we
have received the first volume of its transactions and several numbers
of its proceedings. These works form, as it were, an epoch in the
history of modern civilization, which, originally cradled in the valley
of the Nile, now returns, after having changed the condition of
western Hurope, to the place of its birth, destined, we trust, to rouse
from its long apathy ‘‘the country in which Pythagoras courted
wisdom and Herodotus unveiled the sources of history.’? <A library
and collections have been formed, which are rapidly increasing, and
which even now it is stated are capable of rendering essential service
to the explorers of the valley of the Nile. Although the Frencb lan-
guage has been adopted for the reports and also for correspondence
between the members of the society and the learned institutions of
the west and east, yet the contributions of authors are presented in
their original form and style, and hence the present volume includes
memoirs in French, Italian, Greek, and Arabic, with illustrations in
the lieroglyphic, Coptic, and Hebrew. ‘To some of these memoirs,
explanations, rather than strict translations, are appended.

Among the more interesting additions to the library during the
year is the work of Dr. Hochstetter, on New Zealand. This gentle-
man was one of the scientific corps of the celebrated Austrian explor-
ing expedition on board the Novara, and when the vessel arrived in
New Zealand, he was left, at the request of the governor of the colony,
to make a geological exploration of the islands. The results of his
labors are embodied in a special work, which conveys a great amount
of information relative to the geography and natural history of the
country. Originally published in the German language, an English
translation has appeared in Stuttgardt, made by Mr. Edward Sauter,
of Little Rock, Arkansas, to whom we are indebted for a copy of the
work.

But perhaps the most valuable donation received during the past
year is that from Hon. G. V. Fox, late Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, through the Department of State. It consists of articles pre-
sented to him on the occasion of his recent visit to Russia as the bearer
to the Emperor of a resolution of Congress congratulating his Majesty
on his escape from assassination. They embrace 179 volumes, finely
bound, many in quarto and large octavo ; 15 atlases and albums,
some ‘‘eagle,’’ others ‘‘elephant’’ folio size, all bound in cloth or
morocco ; 72 maps, some in covers and cases ; 4 city plans, in cases,
and 12 pamphlets—making in all 283 pieces, illustrating the physi-
cal geography, ethnology, and resources of the Russian empire.
The character of this gift will be properly appreciat.d when it is
stated that, by a joint resolution of Congress, Mr. Fox was author-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ized to accept these books as additions to his own library, but, with
commendable liberality, he has presented them to the Smithsonian
Institution, to form part of the collections deposited in the National
Library. They are principally in the French and Russian languages,
and we have availed ourselves of the services of Mr. H. H. Kalusow-
ski, of the Treasury Department, for the means of access to a knowl-
edge of their rich contents.

Before concluding the history of the Institution for 1867, it be-
comes my duty to recall a painful event, which was announced to the
Board at its meeting in February last. [allude to the death of Alex-
ander Dallas Bache, the head of the United States Coast Survey, and
one of the original members of the Board of Regents. On the occa-
sion of the announcement of this bereavement, which was received
with emotions of profound sorrow, the following resolutions, pre-
sented by Hon. J. W. Patterson, of New Hampshire, were unanimously
adopted :

‘¢ Resolved, That the highest honor is due to the memory of our
respected and beloved associate, Professor ALEXANDER DaLuas BAcuE,
who, through so many years of active life, has devoted, unselfishly
and with untiring energy, great talents, profound acquirements and
undeviating integrity to the advance of art, science, education and
philanthropy.

‘¢ Resolved, That in the death of our lamented associate this Institu-
tion, of which he was a regent, and one of the executive committee
from its first organization to the time of his death, has lost an efficient
collaborator, a sagacious counsellor and zealous supporter.

‘« Resolved, That the members of the Board, in common with the
Secretary, lament in his departure the loss of a warm and tried per-
sonal friend, and that they will always cherish the memory of his
genial and sympathetic disposition, his gentle and prepossessing man-
ners, his refined taste, high moral perceptions and unswerving advo-
cacy of the right.

‘* Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to
the widow of the deceased, and that the Secretary prepare a suitable
eulogy for insertion in the next annual report.’’

In compliance with the resolution of the board, I have collected
materials for a memoir of my lamented friend, Dr. Bacne, and pre-
pared as full an account of his life and labors as my time and ability
would permit. The duty thus devolved upon me would have been
accepted with alacrity as a means of gratifying my feelings of regard
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : 6a

and veneration had it not been associated in my mind, from the first,
with a sense of its difficulty and responsibility. I was aware that it
was not enough to narrate the events of his life, and to give a
recital of his numerous and diversified labors; but that it would also
be necessary to analyze his mental and moral constitution, as well as
to trace the influence which his career has had, and will continue to
have, on the advancement of science and education in this country.
To fulfil this satisfactorily, though a duty not to be declined, is a
labor requiring much care, and involving much solicitude. The
sketch which I have prepared has been sent to Gen. Sabine for
insertion in the proceedings of the Royal Society of London, and in
view of my other pressing duties, it will be difficult for me to present
the complete eulogy to the board at its present session. I therefore
crave the indulgence of being allowed to defer the publication until
the appearance of the report for 1868.
Respectfully submitted:
JOSEPH HENRY,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 71

D.—Copy of circular relative to exchanges of government documents.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, U. S. A., Afay 16, 1867.

A law has just been passed by the Congress ef the United States anthoriz-
ing the exchange, under direction of the ‘Smithsonian Institution, of a certain
number of all United States official documents for the corresponding publica-
tions of other governments throughout the world; the returns to be placed in
the national library at Washington. The works to be distributed under this
law will consist of reports and ‘proceedings of Congress, messages of the Presi-
dent, annual reports and occasional publications of departments and bureaus,
&c., the whole relating to the legislation, jurisprudence, foreign relations, com-
merce, statistics, arts, manufactures, agriculture, geography, hydrography, &C.,
of the United States, and including everything, of whatever nature, published,
either by direct order of Congress or by any of the departments of the govern-
ment. The series will embrace a large number of volumes each year, the most
of which are bound.

The object of the law above mentioned is to procure for the use of the Con-
egress of the United States a complete series of the publications of other goy-
ernments, to include the documents of special bureaus or departments, as well
as the general publications, of whatever nature, printed at the public expense,
and also embracing all such works as are published by booksellers with the aid
of grants or subscriptions from governments. The law is not retrospective,
although it may cover some of the publications of the last session of Congress.

Some time will necessarily elapse before the first transmissions can be made;
but in order to organize a plan of exchange, to be presented for consideration
to the Library Committee and the librarian of Congress, | beg leave to ask
your advice as to the best method of accomplishing “the objects above stated.
It is important to ascertain what governments are willing to enter into the pro-
posed exchange, and whether any one bureau or branch “of government or pub-
lie library in each country will undertake to collect all the national publica-
tions, as above mentioned, and transmit them to Washington, or whether sepa-
rate arrangements must be made with more than one office. ‘Che former plan
is considered preferable, as diminishing the labor involved, and may possibly
be adopted by enactment, as has been done by the United States. Whatever
method be most feasible, you will confer a favor by giving us such information
on these and other points as may serve for our euidance i in further action.

Information is also desired as to the titles and character of the regular offi-
cial publications of each country, and their average number and extent in each
year, as well as the names of the different bureaus or offices from which they
emanate.

The Smithsonian Institution, in behalf of the Library of Congress, is pre-
pared to promise, if necessary, the delivery of the above-mentioned publica-
tions free of charge for freight. It will also name an agent in each country
who will receive the parcels or boxes containing the exch: ges returned, and
transmit them to Washington.

Besides the exchange of complete series of national publications, the law of
Congress above stated authorizes the distribution of works on special subjects
to the different bureaus having them in charge, as finance, statistics, patents,
agriculture, &e., provided that copies of their publications be given in return.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOSEPH HENRY,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,

The Board of Regents having directed the sale of the United States 7.30
bonds, as also the Indiana, Georgia, and Washington bonds, the proceeds to be
applied to the increase of the permanent capital, this was accordingly done
through the agency of the bankers of the Institution. The act of Congress of
February 8, 1867, passed in accordance with the memorial of the Board of
Regents, (see report for 1866, page 74,) authorized the Institution to deposit
with the Secretar y of the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest,
the residuary legacy of Smithson, together with other sums not exceeding, with
the original, $1,000,000. From part of the proceeds of the sale of the United
States and State stocks referred to, the sum of $108,620 37, with the residuary
legacy, $26,210 63, making $134,831, was deposited in the treasury of the
United States; thus making the total amount of the Smithson fund perpetually
in the United States treasury, bearing 6 per cent. interest, payable semi-annu-
ally, $650,000.

The Commissioner of Agriculture continues to pay one-half of the salary of
the clerk employed to take charge of the meteorological statistics.

The appropriation annually made by Congress “for the care and preservation
of the collections of the exploring and surveying expeditions of the govern-
ment” has been expended, as heretofore, under the direction of the Secretary of
the Interior, and as the amount was increased for the year ending July 1, 1868,
from $4,000 to $10,000, a part of this has been applied to the pr eservation of
that part of the building devoted to the collections, and other purposes.

The State of Virginia has paid four per cent. interest on its stock, reserving
two per cent. in Richmond, to be paid whenever the conflicting claims between
the old State and the new State of West Virginia should be settled. All the
interest due on the stock of the State up to the Ist of January, 1867, amount-
ing to $19,260, has been funded by the issue of new bonds bearing six per cent.
interest, none of which has, however, yet been paid. The total amount of Vir-

ginia stock now held by the Institution is $72,760, which it is considered ad yis-
able to retain for the present.

The current income of the Institution is now deposited in the First Nativnal
Bank of Washington, the payment of bills being by checks drawn by the Sec-
retary, in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Board at its last
annual session.

The following may be considered an approximate estimate for the year 1868.

In couclusion, the committee have the satisfaction of again calling attention
to the fact that all the expenditures from the organization of the establishment
to the present time, including $450,000 on the building, the publication and
caistribution of 200,000 quarto and octavo volumes; the collection of a library
of 60,000 works ; a museum containing 1,000,000 specimens; and the distribu-
tion to other institutions of 250,000 specimens, have been made exclusively
from the income and its investments, and that the bequest has been increased
by an addition this year of $108,620 37, making the total capital invested in
United States and other securities $722,760.

Attention is called to the expense of the National Museum, consisting of the
collections of various government exploring expeditions. In addition to the
appropriation by Congress for this object, from the income of the Institution
the sum of $7,606 20 has been expended during 1867.

The committee have examined 680 vouchers, embracing several thousand
items, for payments during the year for legitimate purposes of the Institution,
and find them correct and conformed to the rules adopted by the Regents on
the 22d of February, 1867.

WASHINGTON, April 14, 1868.
REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE FOR 1867.

It was stated in the report presented to the Board at its last session that it
was proposed, during the year 1867, to roof the main building and towers and
finish the interior of all the rooms, halls, staircases and main “entrance, leaving
the large room of the upper story, over the museum, unfinished until funds
could be provided for the purpose and its future use be ‘determined.

In accordance with this proposition the iron work of the roof over the museum
was erected early in the spring, and covered with slate, fastened to the iron
purlines with wire, and plastered inside with wall plaster. The iron gutters, as
well as the roof, were found perfectly secure from leakage during the hardest
summer rains. The severe test of ice and snow during the present winter has
shown the necessity for additions in the arrangements for conducting the water
from the roof. Plans for this purpose are now under discussion with the archi-
tect for persevering in the original plan, or adopting scme additional security
that the late severe season has indicated to be advisable.

The adaptation of new to old work, in restoring the building from the
destructive effects of the fire, by substituting incombustible materials for wooden
partitions, floors and roofs, has been att ended, as was foreseen, with much labor
and expense, as well as making additional means indispensable for rendering
the roof-surfaces, valleys, and gutters water-tight in winter, when covered with
snow, and occasions nly ice, as well as the summer rains. Like the public build-
ings generally in this city, (and we may say elsewhere,) where battlements
extend above the eaves with gutters behind them upon the roof, or resting upon
the walls, much inconvenience, and at times damage, arises from les aks, the
result of such a system. It is experienced in the Smithsonian building in con-
sequence of the stone battlements capping all its exterior walls. The present
architect’s original design, approved by the committee, is set forth in his report
of the operations of the year, annexed hereto. Neither time nor the funds of the
Institution would permit his carrying this part of his plan into operation ; and
until it is done, together with some additions that the late inclement season has
pointed out as advisable and necessar y, the building is not secure, nor the pro-
perty within it, from dampness and moisture.

The introduction of the proposed warming apparatus for all the apartments
is the next most essential particular to be undertaken, to be commenced when-
ever the funds of the Institution will justify.

The security of the several apartinents and contents are in a great measure
dependent upon such an apparatus as a substitute for the stoves temporarily in
use, and for which no permanent smoke-flues or other arrangements were pro-
vided.

All the rooms in the north tower, forming three suites of three in each, with
two rooms on the entrance floor, one for the janitor and the other fora recep-
tion room for visitors, have been completed and are now used and oceupied as
offices for conducting the operations of the Institution. The several apart-
ments in this north tower, above these offices, have also been completed. ‘The
roofs and apartments in the south tower have also been finished and are now
occupied. The lower one, or that on the first floor, forms a part of the general
museum and is now devoted to the reception of the larger and most weighty

articles of ethnology, such as the stone images from Central America and tha
stone sarcophagus from Syria.

The apartments on the next story have been fitted up with shelves, bins, and
other fixtures for the transaction of the business of the literary and scientific
exchanges, packing and distributing the same.

The apartments next above have been finished for the meetings and conven-
ience of the Board of Regents; and those on the three remaining floors have
also been finished and appropriated to storage and such other purposes as may
become necessary. In this tower are also provided an elevator, with conven-
ient mechanical power for removing books, specimens, ete., to and from the
basement and four stories above it; water-closets and other necessary con-
veniences, with arrangements for the use of the Potomac water for general pur-
poses and in large quantities in case of fire.

To increase the accommodation, two additional floors have been added to the
original subdivision of the stories of the north and south towers. To furnish
light to the new rooms in the south tower, circular windows have been opencd
through the walls, without interfering with the original architectural effect of
the exterior, thus furnishing sufficient light for the purpose for which these
apartments are intended.

The result of the year’s labor has been to provide ample space and con-
venient accommodation to subserve all the wants of the Secretary of the Tnsti-
tution, to enable him to carry the views of Smithson into effect for the present
and several years to come.

The floor-surface in 57 apartments of the building, not including the Secre-
tary’s quarters, is 66,252 square feet, or one and fity-two hundredths of an acre,
a space, so far as now can be foreseen, abundantly sufficient for the wants of
the Institution, only requiring to be adapted therefor, from time to time, in
details, furniture and special finish.

The following is a detailed statement of the expenditures on the building
during the year 1867:

REPORT OF THE ARCHITECT.

WASHINGTON, January 6, 1868.

Srrs: I have the honor to report the progress made in the reconstruction of
the buildings during the calendar year 1867.

The absolutely fire-proof roof of the main building, consisting of a slate cover-
ing, plastered inside and fastened by wire to a well-braced wronght-i -iron frame,
has been firmly putin place. Many difficulties had to be overcome, since the out-
lines of the building, more especially the shape of gable walls and topping out of
side walls, on which that most important feature of the medizeval roof, the sys-
tem of guttering, depends, were prearranged upon the more pliable plan of a com-
bustible frame and wooden sheathings. However, no pains were spared to
accommodate the new conditions to the original architecture of the building.
The different hips and valleys were made secure and water-tight by wide strips
of sheet-copper and sheet-lead laid upona solid foundation of sheet-iron of proper
width, fastened by wire to the rafters. The gutters consist of wrought-iron,
rolled into proper shape, and of a section vouched for by the Phoenix Iron Com-
pany. ‘The connections of the sections of gutters, lengthwise, have been made
so as to allow for expansion, and the connections of the gutters, sidewise, with
the slate roof are effected by galvanized sheet-iron plates riveted to vertical
flanges on the inner side of the gutter, and bent so as to follow up the pitch of the
roof, sustained by the lowest courses of iron purlines for the slating. The mode
adopted has effectively carried off the water of the heaviest rain storms of the sum-
mer, but, being of a novel design, has not fully stood the test of an extraordinary
SS een followed by a rainfall which was freezing as fast as it came down.
This action of the elements caused a thorough freezing up of the northern gutters
encased inside the battlements of the side wall, and with the consequent effect of
the sun upon the upper part of the roof, the melted snow in its downward course
forced its way underneath the frozen face and, for want of an outlet, backed up
underneath the galvanized sheet-iron described above. Plans have been laid
before the building committee with a view to remedy this defect as developed by
severe tests.

The ridge of the roof, another important feature, has been effectively secured
by a layer of sheet-lead, capped by rolled iron, shaped to the angle formed by
the ridge of roof and batted down to the roof frame.

In connection with the frame of the roof, for considerations of solidity as well
as of economy, all the necessary and somewhat complicated iron stays, links and
purlines have been inserted, forming the outlines of an appropriate and well-
shaped ceiling in keeping with the features of a fire- -proof hall, 200 feet in
length by 50 ‘feet in width. Whilst the details of this ceiling are left an open
question ‘for the decision of the committee, its main features consist of a boldly
coved and bracketed cornice, Smarts by broad panelled friezes, the inner
members of which are formed so as to subdivide the whole ceiling into three
panels, each extending through the whole width of the building and worked out
again into more minute details.

” After the roof was well secured, the tracery of the double windows in the side
walls was carefully taken out, the numerous weakened parts of the cut stone
work supplied by new material and workmanship, and the whole work reset,
106 REPORT OF THE ARCHITECT.

anchored and leaded, in the most substantial manner. Immediately following
this work the frames and sash of these windows were made and inserted, strictly
in keeping with the general style of the building.

The ceiling of the museum in lower story being now beyond accident, it was
repaired, and received, with the side walls and intermediate archings, a plain
frescoing. ‘The towers and buildings, north and south of the main building, were
being roofed in at the close of last year’s report. In the early part of the season
the brick arches for the fire-proof floors were turned, conereted, and the floors
laid. During the summer they have all been finished ready for oceupancy.
The carriageway leading to the northern main entrance has been paved, mainly
with flagging on hand, the unsightly ceiling repaired and appropriately decorated
the roof las been put in order ‘and the unstable battlements securely fastened.

The northern main entrance door leads to the vestibule, which has an orna-
mental tiled floor of alternate colors; is finished octagonally, four sides being
occupied by niches designed for receiving statuary; it has a marble case, and is
finished in oak and frescoed in complementary colors.

The vestibule is flanked to the east by the janitor’s room, which is floored with
German tile, and to the west by the reception room, which is fished in imita-
tion of walnut and has a floor of encaustic tiles. ‘The three stories above the
vestibule and adjoining rooms are fitted up for tiers of three communicating off-
ces, each tier forming a compartment, secured by fire-proof iron doors, consisting
of two layers of sheet-iron, with intermediate frame and air-space. Wooden
flooring on top of the fire-proof arches lias been preferred for office purposes.
The higher stories of the towers form rooms of a miscellaneous character, are
approached by iron stairs and floored with pressed bricks on the concrete. The
main stairs and stairway have been finished with tiled floors and landings,
plastered and frescoed.

South of the main building a hoist has been introduced, extending from the
basement up to the fourth story. Private stairs cut to shape from old stone on
hand reach up to the same height, and iron stairs, similar to those in north
towers, lead up to the higher stories. The first story contains vestibule and
general accommodations. The second story contains a properly fitted-up pack-
ing room and bathroom. ‘The third story contains the regents’ room. ‘The
fourth, fifth and sixth stories are finished for storerooms and miscellaneous pur-
poses.

All modern and useful improvements have been introduced in the restored and
newly fitted rooms. In the introduction of Potomac water provisions have been
made for fireplugs of sufficient size in the different stories, north and south of
the main building, and the water can be shut off from any one section without
incommoding the rest of the buildings. The same provision is made for the
gashght aurangements. Speaking tubes lead in all directions, tending to facili-
tate the transaction of business.

No funds being at disposal to introduce a contemplated modern and improved
heating apparatus for the whole of the buildings, one of the functions of which
would have been to perfect the satisfactory working of the new gutters by means
of exhaust pipes at and around the inlets to the down-spouts, stoves were set in
the fall of the year which will heat the offices and other newly created rooms
for any length of time that may be found necessary.

The roof and gutters of the east wing were found to be totally out of repair
and so arranged as to be difficult of remodelling. The slate roof had to be
taken up and relaid, the gutters were overhauled, renewed and soldered. Other
necessary repairs and alterations of a minor nature, demanded by the exigency
of the case, were attended to.

The areas of casemate doors and windows around the main buildings were all
out of repair. ‘Their cappings were broken and laid so low that the surface water
of the surrounding grounds backed into the basement. ‘They were put in order

OF

THE BOA RD’Or REGin fs:

WAsHINGTON, January 15, 1868.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, fixing the time of beginning of the annual session on the third Wed-
nesday of January in each year, a meeting was called for this day. Present,
Hon. J. V. L. Pruyn, General Richard Delafield, Professor L. Agassiz, Hon.
Peter Parker, and Professor Henry, the Secretary.

The Secretary presented the following joint resolution of the Senate and
House of Representatives of the United States:

[PUBLIC RESOLUTION No. 5.]

A RESOLUTION for the appointment of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Con-
gress assembled, That the vacancies in the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
of the class ‘‘ other than members of Congress”’ be filled by the appointment of Theodore
D. Woolsey, of Connecticut, William B. Astor, of New York, John Maclean, of New Jersey,
and Peter Parker, of the city of Washington.

Approved, January 11, 1863.

The Secretary stated that on the 7th of January the Speaker of the House
of Representatives had appointed the following Regents: Hon. J. A. Garfield
of Ohio, Hon. L. P. Poland of Vermont, and Hon. J. V. L. Pruyn of New York.

No quorum being present, the Board, after examining the building and col-
lections, adjourned to meet on Wednesday evening, January 22, 1868, at 74
o'clock.

WASHINGTON, January 22, 1868.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 73 o’clock p. m. in the Regents’
room of the Smithsonian Institution. Present, Hon. B. F. Wade, Hon. R.
Wallach, Hon. L. Trumbull, Hon. G. Davis, Hon. J. A. Garfield, Hon. L. P.
Poland, Hon. J. V. L. Pruyn, Prof. L. Agassiz, Rey. Dr. John Maclean, General
Richard Delafield, Hon. Peter Parker, and Professor Henry, the Secretary.

Mr. Wade was called to the chair. The minutes of the last meeting were
read and approved.

The Secretary stated that a vacancy existed in the Executive Committee, on
account of the death of Professor Bache.

On motion it was

Resolved, That Hon. Peter Parker be elected to fill the vacancy in the Execu-
tive Committee.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 109

The Secretary made a statement relative to the finances of the Institution, the
sale of the State stocks, ete.

Gen. Delafield, on the part of the Executive Committee, presented the annual
account of receipts and expenditures for 1867, and stated that a detailed report
would be submitted at a future meeting.

The Secretary presented a statement in regard to international exchanges of
literary, scientific and government publications. The act of Congress, passed
at the last session, directing that 50 copies of every government publication
should be given to the Smithsonian Institution to be exchanged for the publica-
tions of foreign governments, had not been carried out, as the public printer did
not consider that the act referred to authorized the printing of extra copies of
the works, and all the regular edition was already disposed of according to exist-
ing laws. Further legislation was therefore required.

Mr. Pruyn stated that the subject had been referred to the Library Committee
of Congress, of which he was a member, and that he would do all in his power
to promote the object desired.

Professor Agassiz, from the committee appointed at the meeting of February 1,
1867, presented a report, which, on motion of Mr. Wallach, was accepted.

After remarks by several Regents, on motion of Mr. Poland, the report was
laid on the table and made the special order for the next meeting.

On motion of General Garfield the report was ordered to be printed. '

The Board then adjourned to meet on Monday evening, January 27, 1868.

WASHINGTON, January 27, 1868.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution was held
at 7$ o'clock p. m., in the Regents’ room. Present, Chief Justice Chase, (the
Chancellor,) Hon. B. F. Wade, Hon. Richard Wallach, Hon. J. A. Garfield,
Hon. L. P. Poland, Hon. J. V. L. Pruyn, Professor Agassiz, Hon. Peter Parker,
and Professor Henry, the Secretary.

The Chancellor took the chair, and the minutes of the last meeting were read
and approved.

The Secretary presented the report for the year 1867.

Professor Agassiz presented a printed and revised copy of the report of the
special committee on the use of the new room, made at the last meeting, which
was read as follows:

Report of the committee appointed to consider what will be the best use for the large
room in the second story of the main building of the Smithsonian Institution.

The influence the Smithsonian Institution has exercised from its origin upon
the progress of science in the United States has been so marked and so deep,
that in considering any step connected with the organization of the Institution,
it is of the utmost importance to keep in view its bearing upon the advancement
of knowledge generally. To those not familiar with the active operations of
the Institution, the growing recognition of the difference between the increase
and diffusion of knowledge, and the consequent establishment by Congress of a
National Academy, mainly organized for the purpose of enlarging the boundaries
110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

of science among us, are in themselves sufficient evidence of its beneficent power.
The large and unique library lately transferred from the Institution to the library
of Congress, and the extended intercourse between the Institution and all the
learned bodies scattered over the globe, bear equally impressive testimony to the
wide-spread action of the Institution.

In attempting to determine the most appropriate use to which the large build-
ing of the Smithsonian, and especially the large unappropriated hall in the second
story, may be put, your committee has been led to consider the probable course
the Institution may follow whenever its resources become consolidated and its
means, gradually freed from their temporary application to subordinate purposes,
are exclusively devoted to the special object pointed out in the will of Smithson,
viz: “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” The policy which
has led to the transfer of the Smithsonian library to that of Congress suggests
the propriety. of severing also the museum from the Smithsonian Institution,
inasmuch as a museum is no more contemplated by the will of Smithson than a
library. The accumulation of books and specimens has been a natural conse-
quence of the organization of an institution exclusively devoted to the fostering
of intellectual pursuits. But in proportion as their number increased they claimed
a larger and larger part of the attention and means of the Institution until it
became a matter of serious consideration how far the possession of such objects
should be embraced in its general plan and scope.

As far as the library is concerned the question has been settled. It has become
evident that, in consequence of the judicious distributing of its published contri-
butions and miscellaneous works, the Smithsonian has acquired the most com-
plete collection of learned transactions in existence; so extensive, indeed, that
its preservation and natural extension would have encroached upon the specified
obligations of the Institution. The disposition made of it leaves the students of
science in the fullest enjoyment of this invaluable store of information, while it
relieves the Smithsonian of a serious burden. Now your committee is satisfied
that the museum,of natural history, and the other collections preserved in the
Smithsonian, stand in precisely the same relation to the Institution as the library
did, and that it may be equally desirable to give them up, and with them the
largest part if not the whole of the building, could this be done without injury
to the collections and to the cause of natural history. However, it does not appear
advisable to adopt such a course immediately; but it seems wise to keep it in
view as a probability, doing meanwhile whatever is most likely to contribute to
the advancement of science.

A few facts concerning the operations of the Institution should be borne in
mind in this connection. In the same manner as the Smithsonian has distributed
its various publications broadcast among learned institutions and individual sei-
entific men, and obtained in return the magnificent library above alluded to, it
has also distributed an immense number of specimens, and fostered in this way
scientific research both at home and abroad. But for these latter contributions
scattered over the whole civilized world it has neither claimed nor received ade-
quate returns. All the duplicates of these treasures obtained at home from the
various government exploring expeditions and surveys have been given away with

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. abs id

the understanding that the time may come when the progress of science among
us would make it desirable that returns in kind should be expected.

The Smithsonian Institution has now been in operation for twenty years. In
acknowledement of its published Contributions to Knowledge it has received the
splendid library which now adorns the Congressional library. Is it not time that
the rights accrued in consequence of the distribution of specimens by the Insti-
tution should be called in; that this great outstanding debt, as it may well be
called, should be collected before the recipients of these manifold gifts have passed
away, and the benefits thus conferred by the Smithsonian are altogether forgot-
ten; when the Institution might find it difficult to obtain, without new offerings,
that which at this moment it may claim as its due ?

Should this Board approve the recommendation of this committee, no time
ought to be lost in giving notice to all the various institutions with which the
Smithsonian is in regular correspondence, that this is henceforth to be the regu-
lar policy of the Institution. On the other hand it is indispensable that we
should make the necessary preparations for receiving these objects, and also
determine beforehand the ultimate destination of the extensive collections which
no doubt will flow in as soon as we are prepared to take care of them. Your
committee is of opinion that the great hall in the second story of the building
should be used for the reception of these collections, and the smaller rooms in
the towers, as far as not needed for other purposes, as laboratories to identify,
arrange, classify, and distribute these collections for the greatest advantage of
science among us, until suitable arrangements can be made for the organization
of a great national museum, to which the whole should in the end be transferred.

It is self-evident that the collections likely to come in will soon outgrow tho
capacity of the Smithsonian Institution and its ability to take care of them, with-
out applying its income to objects for which it was not intended. But the diffi-
culty of disposing of these scientific treasures is no sufficient ground why the
Smithsonian should surrender its large claims on other scientific institutions ; for,
in so doing, it would simply deprive the country of scientific objects, which other
museums would be glad to receive should the Smithsonian be obliged to give
them up before the country demands and organizes a great national museum in
Washington.

To sum up these remarks, your committee receommends—

1st. That the distribution of specimens carried on by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution be continued and extended, but that at the same time proper returns be
required whenever the specimens are not given out in aid of original researches
or for educational purposes.

2d. That the expenses for such operations be liraited to the resources especi-
ally appropriated for the purpose, and not allowed to encroach upon the regular
active operations of the Institution. E

3d. That the great hall of the second story of the building, and such other
rooms as are not required for the regular operations of the institution, be devoted
to the preservation of the scientific collections.

All of which is respectfully submitted in behalf of the committee.

L. AGASSIZ.
142 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

On motion of Mr. Garfield, after remarks by Messrs. Pruyn, Agassiz, Chase,
Wade, Parker, Wallach, Garfield, and the Secretary, the recommendations of
the committee, after modification, were adopted unanimously, as follows :

1st. That the distribution of specimens carried on by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution be continued and extended, but that at the same time proper returns for
the past as well as for the future be required, whenever the specimens are not
given out in aid of original researches or for educational purposes.

2d. That the expenses for such operations be limited to the resources spe-
cially appropriated by Congress for the purpose, and not allowed to encroach
upon the regular active operations of the Institution.

3d. That the great hall of the second story of the building, and such other
rooms as are not required for the regular operations of the Institution, be
devoted to the preservation of the scientific collections.

On motion of Mr. Garfield, the following resolution was adopted :

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to report to the Regents, at their
next meeting, what amount of appropriation should be asked of Congress for
the care of the museum and for fitting up the great hall for the safe-keeping
and exhibition of specimens.

Messrs. Wade, Garfield, Pruyn, Poland, and the Secretary were appointed as
the committee. .
The Board adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-

tution are hereby given to the directors and officers of the above-named compa-
nies for this liberal and enlightened action.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted by the Secretary
to each of the companies.

Professor Henry submitted a statement as to the proposed researches and
publications during the present year.

Hon. Mr. Parker stated that the city councils had under consideration the
ceding of the canal, which bounds the Smithsonian grounds to the north, to a
private company, and as this might affect the interests of the Institution he
thought some action should be taken in regard to it.

On motion of General Garfield, it was

Resolved, That the Executive Committee be instructed to ascertain what:
measures are proposed to be taken by the city authorities of Washington in.
regard to the. canal, so far as concerns the Smithsonian Institution.

The Chancellor called attention to the fact that a committee was appointed
“at the last meeting to prepare estimates for the completion of the large hall
and for obtaining an adequate appropriation from Congress for the care of the:
government collections, and expressed the desire that this committee should.
act immediately in regard to the matter.

The Secretary, on behalf of the committee, stated that on consultation with the-
architect it was thought that $50,000 would be required for finishing the large
room and supplying it with cases, and that at least $10,000 annually ought to be-
appropriated for the care of the museum. Whereupon it was

Resolved, 'That a memorial be presented to Congress asking appropriations in
accordance with the report of the committee.

The Secretary gave an account of the establishment of a scientific society in
Egypt publishing valuable transactions which had been received by the Insti-
tution.

114 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The Secretary read a copy of the memorial which had been prepared in
accordance with the directions of the Board, signed by the Chancellor and Sec-
retary, and presented to Congress,* as follows :

To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled :

In behalf of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the
undersigned beg leave respectfully % submit to your honorable body the fol-
lowing statement, and to solicit such action in regard to it as may be deemed
just and proper :

The act of Congress organizing the Institution ordered the erection of a
building which should accommodate, on a liberal scale, besides a library and a
gallery of art, a museum, consisting of all the specimens of natural history,
geology, and art, which then belonged to the government, or which might there-
after come into its possession by exchange or otherwise. Although the majority
of the Regents did not consider the maintenance of these objects to be in accord-
ance with the intention of Smithson, as inferred from a strict interpretation of
the terms of his will, yet in obedience to the commands of Congress they pro-
ceeded to erect a building of the necessary dimensions, and to take charge of
the government collections.

The erection and maintenance of so large and expensive an edifice, involving
an outlay of $450,000, and the charge of the government museum, have proved
a grievous burden on the Institution, increasing from year to year, which, had
not its effects been counteracted by a judicious management of the funds, would
have paralyzed the legitimate operations of the establishment, and frustrated
the evident intention of Smithson.

It is true that Congress, at the time the specimens were transferred to the
Institution, granted an appropriation of $4,000 for their care and preservation,
that being the equivalent of the estimated cost of the maintenance of these
collections in the Patent Office, where they had previously been exhibited.
But this sum, from the rise in prices and the expansion of the museum by the
specimens obtained from about fifty exploring expeditions ordered by Congress,
scarcely more than defrays, at the present time, one-third of the annual expense.
In this estimate no account is taken of the rent of the part of the building
devoted to the museum of the government, which, at a moderate estimate,
would be $20,000 per annum.

Besides the large expenditure which has already been made on the building,
at least $50,000 more will be required to finish the large hall in the second
story, necessary for the full display of the specimens of the government. But
the Regents do not think it judicious further to embarrass the active operations
for several years to come, by devoting a large part of the income to this object,
and have, therefore, concluded to allow this room to remain unfinished until
other means are provided for completing it.

It is not by its castellated building nor the exhibition of the museum of the
government that the Institution has ‘achieved its present reputation, nor by the
collection and display of material objects of any kind that it has vindicated the
intelligence and good faith of the government in the administration of the
trust ; “it is by its explorations, its researches, its publications, its distribution of
specimens and its exchanges, constituting it an active, living organization, that
it has rendered itself favorably known in every part of the civilized w orld, has
made contributions to almost every branch of science, and brought more akon

ever before into intimate and friendly relations the Old and the New Worlds.

A central museum for a complete representation of the natural products of
-America, with such foreign specimens as may be required for comparison and

generalization, i is of ereat importance, particularly as a means of developing

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 115

and illustrating our industrial resources, as well as of facilitating the study of
the relations of our geology, mineralogy, flora and fauna, to those of the Old
World. But the benefit of such an establishment is principally confined to this
country, and does not partake of the cosmopolitan character of an insutution
such as Smithson intended to found, and therefore ought not to be supported
from his bequest.

The Board of Regents are confident that upon a full consideration of the case,
your honorable body will grant an adequate support for the collections of the
government, and also an appropriation for finishing the repairs of the building,
and eventually, when the financial condition of the country will permit, for the
independent maintenance of a national museum.

It may not be improper, in addition to what has been said, to recall the fact
that the Smithsonian Institution has transferred, without cost, to the library of
Congress, one of the most valuable and complete collections of the transactions
of scientific and learned societies and serial publications in existence, consisting
of at least 50,000 works, which, with the annual continuations of the same
series, must render Washington a centre of scientific knowledge, and the library
itself worthy of the nation; and that it has also presented to the government its
valuable collection of specimens of art, illustrating the history of engraving
from the earliest periods. It is prepared to render a similar service to a national
museum, by the exchanges from foreign museums te which it has been a liberal
contributor, and which may be obtained as soon as meaus are provided for their
transportation and accommodation.

It may also be mentioned that the Institution has rendered important service
to the government through the scientific investigations it has made in connection
with the operations of the different departments, and it is not too much to say
that, through the labors of its officers, it has been the means of saving millions
of dollars to the national treasury.

In conclusion, your memorialists beg leave to represent, on behalf of the
Board of Regents, that the usual annual appropriation of $4,000 is wholly
inadequate to the cost of preparing, preserving, and exhibiting the specimens,
the actual expenditure for that purpose in 1867 having been over $12,000 ; and
they take the liberty of respectfully urging on your honorable body the expe-
diency of increasing it to $10,000, and that a further sum of $25,000 be appro-
priated at this session of Congress towards the completion of the hall required
for the government collections.

And your memorialists will ever pray, &c.

S. P. CHASE,
Chancellor Smithsonian Institution.

JOSEPH HENRY,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

On motion, the action of the Chancellor and Secretary in relation to the
memorial was approved.

The Secretary gave an account of the correspondence of the Institution, and
as an illustration of its diversified character read the letters which had been
received that day.

On motion of Mr. Maclean, the annual report of the Secretary was accepted,
and the officers of the Institution authorized to transmit it to Congress.

A motion of Mr. Wallach, in behalf of the Executive Committee, to increase
the salary of the Secretary, was referred back to the same Committee, with
instructions to make a report on the whole subject of the compensation of the
officers of the Institution at the next meeting.

Adjourned, to meet at the call of the Secretary.

Boston, Massacuuserts, May 29, 1866.

Remarks were made by the president and by the librarian on the aid ren-
dered by the Smithsonian ‘Institution in effecting the exchanges of the academy;
and, on motion of the librarian, it was voted : That the thanks of the academy
be presented to the Smithsonian Institution for the generous and efficient aid

From George H. Knight.

CINCINNATI, Ont0, July 10, 1866.

The system of weights and measures being on the tapis, ought we not to save
posterity a world of trouble by once for all ‘dethroning ten as the metrical num-
ber in favor of eght—a number susceptible of indefinite bisection, itself a cube,
(2°,) and whose square is a cube, (4°?)

‘Two with its multiples is the natural division in measures; witness the old dry
measure: 2 gills==one jack; 2 jacks=one pint; 2 pints=one quart; 2 quarts=
one pottle; 2 pottles=one gallon; 2 eallous—one peck; 4 pecks—one bushel ;
8 bushels=one-quarter; 4 quarters=one chaldron, &c.

The system would, of course, abolish the two digits, 8 and 9. Hight would
be represented by the sign 10, and nine by 11, while 8.x8.=100. I am not
unaware of the prodigious labor involved in such a change—a labor too great
for an age which expends more on litigation than on its wheat crop; but I never-
theless believe it will be undertaken by some future age at a far greater sacrifice.

From E. C. Bolles, Secretary of the Portland Society of Natural History.

PortLAND, MAINE, August 24, 1866.

The Portland Society of Natural History has always felt that the Smithsonian
Institution was its best friend. Unnumbered instances of a generous regard,
rising to munificence in the time of our loss and trial; wise counsels never out
of place; wonderful facilities for scientific interchange most cheerfully granted,
all compel us to this belief; and it is in obedience to this conviction that we lay
before you, at the earliest possible moment, a statement of the present condition
of our society, which, in the terrible calamity well known throughout our land,
has been almost the greatest sufferer of all.

The destructive fe of July 4th consumed our building and collections, leav-
ing, from the peculiar construction of the former, scarcely a vestige of the interior
of the hall. We 1 regret to say that this loss was entirely unnecessary. ‘I'he
structure was eminently fire-proof, separated by 20 feet on each side from the
buildings on the right and left. A large wooden house on the right had been

5 5 5
entirely burned without danger to our property ; the library had been quietly and

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 117

safely removed; in the event of possible danger there seemed time enough to
secure the cabinets, which were already so : arranged as to be readily carried out,
when an ill judged explosion of pow der in the building on the left blew out the
few windows in our premises, and drove the burning mass of splinters and boards
quite over the lower floor of our lecture-room, and left this, of course, in a moment,
only a sheet of flame. This unexpected blow, almost destroying several mem-
bers of the society, rendered all further efforts to save our property vain.

You will be pleased to learn that all our books and pamphlets, including our
own and the Smithsonian publications, were saved. I wish that I could say as
much for the collections, but, excepting about 100 species of shells, withdrawn
for a special purpose and not then returned, all was lost.

And now we beg to assure you that the society still lives. Not even this
second trial by fire shall destroy our existence and work. Although since that
night of disasters ev ery one’s heart and brain have been overtaxed, we have not
lost a single meeting. One result you will see in the enclosed appeal, which
document we have circulated among such men of science as were catalogued in
the “ Naturalist’s Directory.” We find ourselves almost penniless. Our city is
too well drained of its resources to afford more than a few scanty crumbs of aid.
What response will be made to our petition we do not as yet know; certain it is
that if this machinery fails we shall try some other. Our fortune, by its very
hardness, rouses and stimulates us. We are very anxious to have some building
of our own, however humble, rather than multiply risks by sharing with other
organizations the common shelter of one roof. We feel better to- day, because
no part of our loss is to be charged upon our own want of forethought or imme-
diate care.

Our present location might again serve us were it not for public demands and
interference. ‘The walls of our building are as good as when first built; but
the city, in making the street in front of us wider, cuts off about 20 feet of our
building, reducing the dimensions of our land too much to leave the rest of use
tous. I need scarcely add that, under the most favorable terms of sale, we
cannot close our business matters up to have more than $2,500 remain above our
mortgage debt.

But we ought not to tax your patience further. We shall be most grateful
for your sympathy, suggestions, aid. Situated as we are, there is not another
institution of science that has been forced to record two such terrible chapters of
misfortune. But we mean, if Providence blesses our labors, to make it true that
no local society of natural history shall leave in years to come a better chapter
of hard-earned prosperity and fame.

[Norr.—We are happy to state that this society is again in a flourishing con-
dition, and that permission has recently been given to it by the city government
to occupy, free of charge, rooms in the new city hall building; also, that the
Smithsonian Institution has presented it with another very complete set of its
duplicate specimens of natural history —J. H.]

society, | have the honor to acknowledge the safe arrival of the several books
enumerated in the invoice numbered S040, 1866, which I beg to enclose receipted ;
aud I have much pleasure in conveying to the honorable the officers and Regents
118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

of the Smithsonian Institution the assurance that the president and the council
of the Bath and West of England society entertain not only a very high sense
of the valuable services conferred on the scientific world Ly the labors and pub-
lications of the Smithsonian Institution, but they cannot too highly applaud the
enlightened liberality which has actuated the conductors of the Smithsonian
Institution in the establishment of such an admirable system of organization for
facilitating the mutual interchange of the publications of the learned and other
societies in various parts of the great continent of America and the United King-
dom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Acting in a reciprocal spirit, I have much pleasure in transmitting, through
your recognized agent, several volumes of the Bath and West of England society’s
journals, in order to complete the set in the library of your Institution, more espe-
cially as the earlier volumes can now be obtained only very rarely, as the society’s
stock is entirely exhausted.

From Dr. Brehm, the director of the Zoological Gardens.

HameburG, September 11, 1866.

T am in receipt of your letter dated the 2d of last month, in which you state
that a specimen of the American great horned owl is offered for the accep-
tance of the zoological society of this city, by the Smithsonian Institution ;
and I have the satisfaction of stating that the bird has arrived in good health
and condition, and the society is very much obliged, and will do itself the pleas-
ure of returning the compliment if you will indicate in what manner it can be
done.

If I might further intrude on the kindness of the Institution, it would be to
say that some of your common finches (fringillide ) would be very acceptable,
as the birds usually imported are only such as, e. g : Cardinalis virginianus, Spiza
cimis, Astragalinus tristus, and Cocoborus ludovicianus. But we get overdone
with these birds of dealers, and which are popular with private purchasers, who
do not value the less externally attractive and common birds which I am anx-
ious to possess. Some of the small owls I should also like to have from America,
together with any of your ducks, (Anas,) excepting the “summer duck,” which,
for the same reason as I have above given in regard to other birds, are imported
into Europe in quantities.

It is remarkable that the “snow goose,” though abounding in the United
States in any number of thousands, is not in any European zoological garden.
Will you please to think of me with special attention with regard to this bird ?

Report on an improved system of numeration, by W. B. Taylor, Esq.

UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE,
Washington, March 22, 1867.

I have examined the paper referred to, on the subject of an improved numera-
tion for arithmetical operations, and have, respectfully, to offer the following
remarks: The proposal is simply to interpolate six additional “ digits” (if the
term may be allowed) between the nine and the ten of our common arithmetical
scale, in every order or place of figures; in other words, to substitute a senide-
nary for the received denary radix of numeration. This suggestion has been
made, I believe, more than once before. In 1859, Mr. J. W. Nystrom, of Phila-
delphia, published an essay on what he called the tonal system, (ton being
the name he assigned to the senidenary fen,) advocating the adoption of the
number 16 as the basis of a universal arithmetic and metrology.

All who have given the subject of weights and measures much consideration
will agree in the proposition that a scheme of continual bisections and doublings
would prove a great convenience in all the operations of concrete arithmetic, and

~ were it not for the enormous labor of a reconstruction, and the great time required

for its general introduction among civilized nations, some such reform might be
accepted as advantageous or desirable.

So early as the beginning of the last century, the illustrious Leibnitz elaborated
a scheme of binary arithmetic, (whose only characters were 1 and 0 ,) and pub-
lished a treatise in its exposition and support. A paper of his upon ‘the subject
will be found in the Memoirs of the Academie Royal des Sciences for the year
1703, page 85, in which he says he had himself employed this ratio of computa-
tion for many years, and that he regarded it as “la perfection de la science des
nombres;” an opinion which, from such an authority, is entitled to very high
respect.

It may well be questioned, however, whether the senidenary scale favored by
your correspondent would fulfil the true desideratum—a minimum of arithmetical
labor. There are considerations tending to show that even our present denary

ratio is too high for the most complete and general facility. In balancing the

two opposite conditions of conciseness of expression, and simplicity of construc-
tion, it must be borne in mind that while the number of places required to express
a given value is diminished, simply as the logarithm of the radix increases,
the mental labor required in using any scale is increased in a considerably higher
ratio than the arithmetical increment of the radix; probably in a geometrical
progression, or as some low power of the base. I am inclined to believe, there-
fore, that as between the binary and senidenary systems, the former is decidedly
to be preferred; that the economy of places or of expression in the latter w ould
prove but a trival compensation for its much larger range and variety of symbols
and the far greater complexity of all the tables and processes necessary in its
employment.

Tor all popular uses, either the quarternary or octonary scale would probably
be found much more convenient than either of these suggested extremes, and
certainly much more available for the distribution of w eights and measures.

In 1719, Swedenborg published an Octonary Computus, and a project of an
octaval system of weights, measures, and coins. It is said that Charles XII, of
Sweden, had contemplated the experimental adoption of the scheme not long
before his death, in 1718.

It may not be considered irrelevant to here briefly compare the four different
scales above mentioned with our established scale, in point of expressiveness.

Or to compare them in the expression of very large values, as for example, of
such a sum as the number of grains of sand required to constitute a globe as
large as our earth, (which, assuming 10 millions of grains to the cubic inch,
would not exceed 659 quintillions, an expression requiring 33 places of ficures,)
we should find that the senidenary scale would require 28 figures, (a reduction
quite insignificant,) the octonary ‘would require 37 figures, (an excess equally
insignificant, with only half the number of digits, and probably not one-fourth
the ‘ifficnlty ,) the quarternary 55 figures, and the binary 110 figures.

In conclusion, I would express the opinion that the arithmetical scale suggested
by your correspondent does not promise a convenience which would justify the
subversion of the existing system of enumeration in its favor.

From Count de Luk, President of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

St. Pererspure, May 13, 1867.

Having received, through the kind attention of his excellency Gaara Clay,
the letter which you did me the honor to address to me under date of the 25th
of March last, from the city of Washington, I lost no time in communicating its
purport. to the Imperial Academy of Sciences. That body has accepted, with
the most lively acknowledg ments, the offer which you make, in the name of the
Smithsonian Institution, to enrich the museums of the academy with the gift of
duplicates of the objects of natural history, collected in the Russian possessions
in America, as well as of those which M. “Bischoff shall have an opportunity of
collecting in Kamtschatka and the province of the Amour.

At the same time I deemed it iny duty to address to General Korsakoff, gov-
ernor general of Siberia, a request that he would have the goodness to give such
orders that M. Bischoff shall find, during the expedition which he contemplates,
assistance and protection on the part of the local authorities. By an official
despatch of the 25th of April, M. Korsakoff informs me that he has written on this
subject to the governors of the provinces which M. Bischoff has the intention of
visiting, and has, at the same time, conveyed to me an open order (in the Russian
language) which it will be proper that M. Bischoff shall carry with him and pro-
duce to the local authorities in case of need, that he may secure their protection
and assistance, be enabled to procure from the magazines of the state provisions
at the legal rates, and be received on board the vessels of the empire. ‘This docu-
ment I have the honor of transmitting with the present communication, and beg,
sir, that you will accept the assurance of my most distinguished consideration.

Lerpsic, May 17, 1867.

Enclosed I send you the prospectus of the Schlagintwait collection of ethno-
graphic heads of India and higher Asia, which, in view of the purpose now enter-
tained of forming a°comprehensive museum of such representations, cannot fail
to be of interest to the Smithsonian Institution.

The price of the collection is, as has been already stated, somewhat high, and
is established at the following rates:

1. Single heads, according to the choice of the purchaser, for 11 thalers.

2. At least 25 heads taken at one time, at 9 thalers.

3. The complete collection, 275 heads and 37 impressions of hands and feet,
taken at one time, 2,348 thalers.

In case of a commission for the above purpose I would hold myself in readi-

ness to superintend the transmission in the best and most expeditious manner.

From W. Alfred Lloyd.

Hamepure, May 25, 1867.

The sparrows will be sent in about two months from this date, when the
young birds born this spring will be strong enough for travelling. ‘They are not
very easy to keep in captivity, and I must try to find out by previous observa-
tion what will be the best manner of forwarding them. You shall, of course,
have due notice and proper instructions, and I will place them in the care of a
trustworthy person, to whom a premium can be offered, varying in amount
according to the number delivered alive and in good health. This is the plan I
adopt with regard to the transport of living aquarium animals, and thank you
very much for kindly trying to send me some. I mentioned sea anemones and -
madrepores, they being easier to send alive than some other animals, but I should
be glad to have any American invertebrata, particularly marine, as | try to make
the aquarium of our society a kind of museum of the lower aquatic forms of life.
I think I did send you a pamphlet containing a list of those I have already
obtained, chiefly from England and the north of Europe, and | am now desirous
to get things from places further afield. I believe many of your marine crustacea
might be forwarded with no very great amount of difficulty, but the only exam-
ples I have yet obtained are Cenobita Diogenes, from Cuba, and Limularpoly-
phemus, from New York. TI have still some of the last named, but they are too
big for my accommodations, and I am anxious to see very young specimens—
say a couple of inches long. Last week I almost got some crabs from the South
Sea islands. ‘They appear to be situated somewhere about grapsus or gonople.
These three forms of crustacea reached Europe alive because of their habit of
living much out of water, not usually ¢mmersed in fluid, but only kept damp, so
that the fact or accidence of their own avoidance of being kept actually below
the surface of the water caused their gills to be sufficiently aerated on the voy-
age, as it is evident that thin films of water presented to the atmosphere are
more quickly oxygenated and acted upon than large masses, because of the pre-
sentation of greater surfaces to the action of the atmosphere, just the same com-
paring together dissimilar processes that a lump of sugar placed in water as a
solid lump takes a much longer time to dissolve than if the same quantity were
powdered, because when in the form of powder the water has an infinite number
of surfaces to act upon all at once. For this reason I keep all difficult marine
animals in shallow water. A cubic foot of fluid, arranged as a cube, pre-
sents to the atmosphere a surface of 144 square inches, whereas, if the same cubic
foot be spread out so the depth is but three inches, the surface presented is 576
122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS

inches, and the amount of oxygen absorbed by the atmosphere in contact with it
and the health of the animals immersed in it (always supposing they have enough
space in which to move) is according to the arithmetical expression of the case.
Even deep-sea creatures obtained from the greatest depths to which dredges and
sounding lines have ever penetrated try to get to the surface of the aquarium
they are placed in, to seek the air which the enormous pressure gave them in the
waters they inhabited in nature, and appear to suffer no inconvenience by the
removal of that pressure, their tissues being vascular and permeated by the water
on all sides. I trouble you with these particulars as being useful hints in the
sending of any aquatic animals, as sailors and others are so apt to keep them in
deep water, i. e., deep water relatively to the surface exposed afforded by the
vessel they are brought in. I have often thought that a large tub containing
masses of rough cleaned sponge, (such as is used for stable purposes, ) would
answer well in bringing over some crustacea, and perhaps sea anemones. Some
small holes should be bored in the side of the tub about three inches from the
bottom, and then, if a quantity of sea-water were daily or oftener poured over
the sponge and animals, it would find its way out at the holes and leave the
sponge saturated with moisture. Each mass of sponge would be a kind of lung
perforated with openings in all directions, and the fluid contained in the sponge
would thus have a very large surface exposure to the surrounding air, and the
crabs would climb upon and absorb it, while the three inches of water below
would effectually prevent desiccation. ‘Twenty or thirty small crabs so brought
to Europe in a tub of about four feet diameter, covered over the top with a net,
would be very nearly in the condition, chemically speaking of, as many birds or
other lung-breathing creatures. The sponge too would, I think, prevent injury
to the animals by the motion of the ship. We know far too little of the habits
of invertebrate aquatic forms of life from parts of the world distant from us, as
we have not given sufficient consideration to the proper means of transporting
them. What is wanted is not only water but air in the water, and if on board
ship the appliances are somewhat rude, so that the fluid cannot be kept as pure
as it might be kept on land, then shallowness and the presentation of great sur-
faces of fluid to the purifying influences of the atmosphere are the best means of

getting over the difficulty. We shall be very thankful for the promised meno-
poma.

From W. Alfred Lloyd.

Hampurae, July 13, 1867.

By the steamer Borussia, leaving here this evening, the “ Zoologische Gessell-
chaft,” of Hamburg, sends for the acceptance of the Smithsonian Tustitution at
Washington a collection of upwards of 300 living sparrows, in‘accordance with
a wish expressed by you, as you desire these birds to multiply in your country
that they may consume the insects that devour corn, vegetables, and fruit grow-
ing in the ground. Will you please report on their arrival and say how many,
if any, reached you alive; then this society will pay the man in charge a propor-
tionate premium for himself. The freight is free between our two Institutions
by all the vessels of the Hamburg New York company. Please return the cages,
and, if you wish, we will send more in them, and continue to forward you sup-
plies till we succeed, if success be possible. Sparrows from England have been
sent, after some trials, to Australia, and they are there thriving, I believe. If
any ill-luck should happen to the present consignment, please try to find out the
cause of it, in order that in renewing our attempt we may learn from experience
of the past. T have heard something of the value of transporting such birds
to long distances confined in small cages, with two or three in each, but no
reason was given for it, and therefore I cannot see why such a system should be

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 123

right or wrong; but if you find a good cause for it, let mo know and I will
adopt the plan, or any other.

You were, in your letter of April 24th last, so kind as to say you would
endeavor to forward my wish in procuring from America some living marine
animals for our aquarium here, and I should be glad to know what suecess you
have yet met with. Some weeks ago I sent you a letter setting forth at full
length my views on the transport ‘of non- lung- breathing animals, and I trust
that the explanations I ventured to trouble you with may be of some service in

etting over difficulties. We know very little of non- -European zoophytes in a
ieving state, and, as I may have told you, American sea anemones have been
brought over only once, though such animals from Britain have several times
been sent to your country and to Australia.

T am exceedingly anxious to obtain some of your Helian thoid polypes, your
sea anemones and madrepores; and no matter how common they may be with
you, they are sure to be interesting and valuable to me, unless it is positively
known beyond all doubt that they are identical with European species, and
even then the very fact of the identity would be of interest. So please send me
any. Of course you have got Gosse’s “Actinotoba Britannica,” 8vo, 1860.
It is the text-book for British Actineas and Madrepores; and I am told that
Rhodactinea is exactly the same as our Act. mesembry anthemone. I should
like to prove this. I have also heard that our Actinotoba dianthus is “ very near
your M. marginatum,” and this, too, I should like to clear up.

Arachnaclis, the only SW imming anemone known, is reported to be very abund-
ant with you; it finds a place in the lists of our British fauna, but I do not know
any one who has ever seen it, and I fear it is too small and delicate, and too near
in texture and habit to the Acalaphe to be brought here alive. Bisidiam and
Haleampa, too, are two of your minute forms I should like to get.

Our two commonest British corals, Caryophyllea and Balamphyllea, are exceed-
ingly hardy in transport, and if your stony corals are anything like ours the send-
ing them over is a matter of no great difficulty.

“We have but one really denotoid coral in ‘Britain, Laphohelia prolifera, and
its corrallam even is very rare indeed, and no British naturalist has ever seen it
alive. ‘Tropical (American and other) branching corals are constantly being
brought to Europe by tons weight, but never once has a single living specimen
been imported i in good health. Lately I went to much expense in tr ying to get
some from the Navigators’ islands, but they all arrived without a ‘particle “of
fleshy matter on them. You may judge from this what a great prize F should
deem an Astrangia colony here in Hamburg, and this is found in abundance,
I believe, in Massachusetts bay. It is right to name the name of the man who
for the first and only time brought sea anemones from your countr y—Captain
H. W. Wendt. In my blazing zeal I have had his photographie portrait framed ;
and, common sailor though he looks, he is in my eyes a greater man than all the
political fellows who go raving up ‘and down various countries. The species
were Phymactis florida and Phi ymactis pluvia, from Iguazee, in Peru, and described
in Dana’s great work in quarto and folio on Captain Wilkes’s United States
exploring expedition.

The Echinodermata of any kinds, hard or soft, would, I fear, not travel, but
I need not say how much I should value a living Echinar achinus, of which only
oue example of one species (IE. Placenta) has ever been found in Britain. With
you it is very common.

Fishes from America are not to be hoped for, I am afraid, though I have got
two alive, (Pimelodus catus and Leneiscus p ygmaeus. ) But some of the crustacea
might, I imagine, be got over alive; for example, Homarus Americanus. And
judging from it, T should i imagine your edible crabs and your soldier crabs to be
different specifically from ours.

But pray assist me in preventing the importation of Limulus polyphemus
124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

(horseshoe crab,) which come over here in such numbers that lately I have with
them stocked all the marine aquaria of England and the continent of Europe,
and I do not know what to do with those I now have over. I do not like to
see the poor things dying by inches, and my mind revolts at plunging animals
full of life and health into spirits. It would be well if Limulas were less hardy.

ATHENS, August 12, 1867.

We have learned, through M. Rangabé, our envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary near the government of the Union, that the directorship of the
Institution of Smithson is desirous of entering into relations of exchange with
our museum of natural history, with a view to obtaining the natural productions
of Greece. We lose no time in expressing the pleasure which this information
has given us, and the gratification we shall experience in forming and iaintain-
ing such relations, which cannot fail to be of great advantage to our own museum,
inasmuch as our collections are at present but scantily provided with objects
pertaining to the natural history of North America. As regards duplicates of
the objects of our own country, we have in readiness for offering to the Institu-
tion: a series of fossil bones of different mammifers (Hippotherium grande ;
Rhinoceros partygnathus; Sus erymanthius; several species of antelope, &c.,
&e.,) of the pleocene formation of Pikermi, in Attica; a collection of impres-
sions of fossil plants of the eocene formation of Koumi, in Enbir; preparations
of several kinds of birds of Greece; eggs of different Greek birds; marine
shells, fresh-water and terrestrial.

We beg to be instructed as to what the Institution would desire, or rather
what it would prefer to receive in the first instance, in order that we may be
able at once to make a first remittance. We should be glad, at the same time,
to know by what channel, by what means, and to what address our remittances
must be forwarded. It would be esteemed a favor if the authorities of the Insti-
tution would inform us in a compendious note what objects it possesses in dupli-
cate and at its disposal for exchange, so that we might indicate in turn our own
desiderata.

We have the honor of subscribing ourselves, with assurances of the most dis-
tinguished consideration, -

J have had the pleasure of receiving, in behalf of the Academy of Sciences at
Stockholm, your letter of the 29th of May last, accompanying your remittance,
through M. Fligel of Leipzic, of a collection of very rare birds of the Arctic
regions of your continent—a collection which your distinguished Institution has
had the goodness to present to our academy.

The package arrived in the month of August, durmg my absence on certain
commissions of the academy, and was transmitted to M. Sandevall, intendant of
the national museum of natural history, who presented it to the academy at its
first meeting in autumn, pronouncing its contents to possess great value for the
museuni.

Permit me to convey to you the thanks of the academy for this acceptable
donation.

I beg to thank you most sincerely for your kindness and liberality in sending
from time to time for my inspection, through Mr. Lawrence, of New York, speci-
mens of humming-birds belonging to the Smithsonian Institution, which he has
designated as new species. By these acts of condescension you are greatly aid-
ing the cause of science, since it is only by the actual comparison of such exam-
ples with the older known species of this extensive family in the collections of
this country that the fact of their being new can be satisfactorily determined.

Care Evizaseru, MArne, January 4, 1868.

I am very much pleased with the selections in your reports, and hope that
some means may be taken for their more extended circulation. While at asummer
resort, Rye Beach, New Hampshire, of some celebrity, attention was called to
the gradual approach of the sea upon the land. Some 20 rods below high-water
mark, at an exceeding low tide, may be seen the stumps of quite large trees
embedded in the sand, and from the general appearance one would suppose that
the trees had been felled from those stumps. I made inquiry of the oldest
inhabitants if they had any information relative to them; they had none; that,
in their time and that of their fathers’, these had been noticed, seeming not much
further out to sea than at the present time. There is no growth within 800 yards.
The country around has been settled since 1623. About two miles from this
used to be a fine sand beach, which has disappeared. The inhabitants thought

the constant play of the sea had worn it, but from what I saw I rather inferred
that the gradual approach had not been noticed, and I believe at some other
pots there is unmistakable evidence. If these facts are of any use to science,
they are at your disposal.

Costa Rica.

Sawn Jos& pE Costa Rica, February 8, 1868.

We have received through M. the minister of public instruction a magnificent
collection of the scientific memoirs of the Smithsonian Institution, which will
form the most precious part of the library of our university. I am authorized to
keep it in the laboratory, and I can assure you that, as far as we are concerned,
the object of the publication will be fully attained. It will essentially serve to
augment our stores of knowledge, especially in meteorology and geology. The
minister has, I believe, already written to the Smithsonian Institution in the name
of the Costa Rican government. Permit me, sir, specially to offer you my own
acknowledgments and to say how greatly I felicitate myself at seeing our labor-
atory placed in the relationship of exchange with one of the first scientific bodies
of the world. Regarding neither the paucity of the present population of the
country, nor the necessarily embryonic state of the University of San José, you
have looked only at our disposition to labor, to take part in the scientific move-
ment of the great nations, and you have treated us with a liberality for which I
know not how to express my gratitude.

I was about to solicit an order to send you a collection of the ores of the
country and of the most characteristic rocks among those which I have thus far
been able to collect, when this very order was issued to me. I have, therefore,
prepared two small cases, enclosing 39 select specimens of the ores of gold and
silver of Costa Rica, as well as of some eruptive rocks and principal limestones
known in the country.* These two cases I propose to despatch by the mail of
day after to-morrow.

The specimens of ores of gold and silver are accompanied only by a designation
of the locality; by the next post I shall have the honor of addressing you a
copy of an official table drawn up by one of the judges of mines, in which you
will find all the indications relative to the value of the ores. I send no table of
analysis, because this analysis would apply only to isolated specimens or at most
to an average of specimens, and would never have the practical signification of
the results obtained by the exploitation. Neither have I sent any specimen of
the enveloping stratum, because the specimens which I have at the university
have been taken rather too near the surface, and it is impossible to recognize in
the decomposed rock any mineralogical character which would authorize a deter-
mination respecting the formation itself. It should be added that I have not yet
been able to proceed to a study of the conditions of the bearings on the spot.
As soon as I shall have found time to make a geological reconnaissance of the
principal Costa Rican mines, I will send you a statement of my observations,
and will submit to you at the same time specimens of the rocks in support of my
determinations. It would be very interesting to see whether the law of Hum-
boldt applies to Central America, and whether it be really necessary always to

seek the precious metals at the point of contact of the porphyry and trachyta.
I do not doubt this law as far as the great formation of South America is con-
cerned, but it appears to me that here and in all South America the upheavals
have taken place at several intervals and relatively on a small scale, so that all
is confounded.

You will excuse, I trust, sir, the meagreness of our remittance, in considera-
tion that it is barely two years since the university has possessed a laboratory.
T'he work of organization, indeed, is not yet fully completed. I have no pre-
parator, and the most advanced of my pupils have had less than two years’
tuition. I have a number of schemes in view which can only be realized by
degrees. In all that relates to a serious study of the country, it was impossible
to commence anything before providing assistants, without whom an isolated
explorer, however earnest his purpose, would find himself reduced to two hands
and 12 hours’ labor per diem. The government, by which the laboratory has
been established, has always protected us with a liberality sufliciently indicative
of its enlightened views, and I hope that ere long myself and my disciples will
be enabled to give far other proofs of our existence than a scanty remittance
of some 39 specimens.

It is possible that we shall remain for some time among the poorer correspond-
ents of the Smithsonian Institution, but have the goodness to believe that we
shall be among the most zealous, and of the number of those always most ready
to contribute, according to our resources, to the noble objects which the Institu-
tion holds up to view.
BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF CHARLES COFFIN JEWETT,

(FORMERLY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, IN CHARGE OF THE LIBRARY.)

By REUBEN A. GUILD, OF BROWN UNIVERSITY.*

- Again we are called upon to mourn the loss of a distinguished man, whom
death has suddenly removed from earth in the prime of life and in the midst of
his accustomed duties. We refer to Professor Charles C. Jewett, superinten-
dent of the Public Library in Boston, who died at his residence, in Braintree,
yesterday morning, at half-past 1 0 ‘clock, after a brief illness of ten hours. On
Wednesday, we are informed, he was at his post in the library, attending to his
work as usual, until 3 o’clock in the afternoon, when he was seized with a sensa-
tion of numbness in one hand, which proved to be paralysis. He remained con-
scious for a time, and after having had medical attendance, requested to be carried
to his home. On the way he became insensible, and thus he continued until his
death.

Mr. Jewett was born in Lebanon, Maine, on the 12th of Angust, 1816. His
father, the Rev. Paul Jewett, was a Congregationalist clergyman of Salem,
Massachusetts, who graduated "at Brown University i in 1802, in the same class
with the late Hon. Henry Wheaton, LL. D., author of “ Elements of Interna-
tional Law.” He was a tutor inthis institution from 1806 to 1809, and was
afterwards offered a professorship, which he declined, preferring the labors and
responsibilities of the Christian ministry to those of any other calling or profes-
sion. He was a man of talents, of accurate learning, of cultivated taste, and of
very retiring habits. In the education of his children he took unwearied pains.
His eldest son was, until recently, a well-known and enterprising publisher and
bookseller in Boston; the second is the one whose loss we to-day deplore, and a
third was for several years a professor in Amherst College.

Mr. Jewett passed his early life in Salem, eraduating at the Latin School in
that place. He entered Dartmouth College i in 1831, but transferred his connec-
tion, in his sophomore year, to Brown University, where he graduated in the
famous class of 1835. He spent two years or more in teaching at the Uxbridge
Academy, and subsequently studied at the Theological Seminary in Andover.
Here he devoted himself chiefly to Philology, and especially to the oriental lan-
guages and eastern antiquities, in which departments of knowledge he attained
gre at proficiency. Indeed, according to the testimonies of the late Professors
Stuart and Edwards, few students, if any, had in these departments excelled him.
His commencement address at Andover attracted universal attention, and was
greatly admired on account of the elegant style in which it was written, and the
thorough acquaintance with oriental subjects which it evinced on the part of the
author.

During his residence at Andover, Mr. Jewett was for a year and upwards the
librarian of the seminary, and he assisted Mr. Taylor in the preparation of a

ratalogue of the books. At this time he was intending to spend several years,
and perhaps his life, in the East as a missionary, and he had, accordingly, at the
close of lis theological course, marked out for himself an extensive course of
study and research. He had been offered facilities for the accomplishment of his
wishes such as few scholars, in this country at least, had ever enjoyed. When
ready to embark, so slight a circumstance as the misdirecting of a letter to mform
him when the vessel in which he had taken passage was to sail, changed his

whole course of life. The vessel sailed without him, and he took charge for a
year of ‘Day’s Academy,” so-called, in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Here we
first made his acquaintance as a pupil, and we shall never forget his genial man-
ners towards all, and his cordial affection for those especially whom he instructed
Tn 1841 he was appointed librarian of Brown University, and he entered upon
his duties in the month of October. He at once set himself to the task of rear-
ranging the books, then numbering about ten thousand volumes, and of preparing
a catalogue of the same. For this kind of work he had an uncommon aptitude.
The catalogue was published in 1843, and attracted much attention, being favora-
bly noticed in the North American Review, and in other periodicals. Especial
‘are was now given to this department of the University, and a new era in its
history was inaugurated.

Soon after the publication of the catalogue, Mr. Jewett was elected professor
of modern languages and literature in the university. He immediately embarked
for Europe, where he spent two years and a half, principally in France, Germany,
and Italy, devoting himself to the acquisition of the languages of these countries,
and making himself familiar with all the principal libraries. During his resi-
dence abroad, Professor Jewett made valuable purchases of English and classical
books, under the direction of the library committee. He was also intrusted with
large commissions by a gentleman of the corporation, for the purchase of stand-
ard books in the three principal modern languages of Europe. ‘These purchases,
amounting to seven thousand volumes and upwards, were made with singular
skill and fidelity; and the accessions thus secured now constitute the choicest
treasures of the library.

Upon his return from Europe, Professor Jewett devoted himself to his college
duties as teacher and librarian, until March, 1848, when he resigned his position
at Brown to accept the place of assistant secretary and librarian of the Smith-
sonian Institution at Washington. He entered upon his new duties with enthu-
siastic ardor, and with all the fondness and capacity for hard and persevering
labor for which he had been pre-eminently distinguished. He was doomed, how-
ever, to disappointment in his efforts to build up a great national library, and thus
to carry out what he understood to be the expressed wishes of Congress in regard
to the expenditure of the Smithsonian funds.* _'The controversy between science
and literature, as represented by Professors Henry and Jewett, attracted great
attention at the time, and subjected the latter to trials which fully entitled him
to the sympathy that literary men so cordially gave him. But of the merits of
this controversy we do not intend here to speak. Although unable, as already
stated, to carry out his plans, Professor Jewett did much to promote bibliographi-
cal studies and the success of American libraries. His “Notices of Public
Libraries in the United States,” which was printed in 1850, was widely cireu-
lated and met with very general favor. He also perfected a system of cata-
loguing, by stereotyping separately the title of each work in a library, thus com-
bining economy with accuracy. ‘This system, indorsed by Edward Everett,
Joseph G. Cogswell, Charles Folsom, Samuel F. Haven, Edward E. Hale, and
George Livermore, was published under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, together with rules and examples for the proper cataloguing of books.

When it was decided to establish a great public library in Boston, Professor
Jewett, by common consent the ablest bibliographer and most accomplished
librarian in the country, was selected as the one of all others to superintend its
affairs. Although offered an honorable position in our oldest university, and the
presidency of a western college, he cheerfully accepted the place urged upon him
by the trustees of the public library. The library building was dedicated with
appropriate ceremonies on the Ist of January, 1858, and in October following the

first catalogue of books was published. For more than 10 years Mr. Jewett has
thus been identified with the best interests of learning in the metropolis of New
England. The catalogues which he has prepared, and the rules for the govern-
ment of the library which he has suggested, have served as models for similar
libraries in all parts of the country. ‘To his thorough and systematic knowledge,
and to the faithful performance of his duties, the citizens of Boston are largely
indebted for the’'rapid growth and complete success of what seems destined to
be the library of the land.

The early death of such a man must be regarded as a public loss. What
shall we say, alas! for the loved wife and children who survive him, and for
those who enjoyed his friendship, and who knew him in the most intimate rela-
tions of private life? For such, it is a consolation to know that his daily walk
and conversation was a beautiful illustration of the Christian’s faith; and that
the heavenly smile which rested upon his features in the calm repose of death
was but an index to the soul that had ceased to animate them forever. The loss
of such a man, viewed in its religious aspects, is indeed “ gain.”

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF WM. HENRY HARVEY, OF DUBLIN.

By Proressor ASA GRAY, OF HARVARD COLLEGE.

[This biography is republished from the American Journal of Science and
Aris as a tribute to the memory of a most valued collaborator of the Smithsonian
Tnstitution—J. H.]

William Henry Harvey, whose lamented death was announced in the last
number of this journal, (p. 129,) was born at Summerville, near Limerick, Ire-
land, on the 5th of February, 1811. His father, Joseph M. Harvey, was a highly
respected merchant in that city, and a member of the Society of Friends. William
Henry was, we believe, the youngest of several children. He received a good
education at Ballitore school, an institution of the Friends, and on leaving it was
engaged for a time in his father’s counting-room, devoting, however, all his spare
time to natural history, his favorite pursuit even from boyhood. He made con-
siderable attainments in entomology and conchology, and in botany he early
turned his attention to mosses and alge. ‘To the study of the latter, in which
he became pre-eminent, he was attracted from the first by the opportunities which
he enjoyed on the productive western coast of Ireland, the family usually spend-
ing a good part of the summer at the seaside, mostly on the bold and picturesque
shore of Clare. As the late Sir William Hooker's bent for botany was fixed by
his accidental discovery of a rare moss, which he took to Sir J. E. Smith, so in
tum was Harvey’s, by his discovery of two new habitats of another rare moss,
the Hookeria letevirens, which led to a correspondence with Hooker, and to a
life-long mutual attachment of these most excellent men. Encouraged by his

‘Mustrious friend and patron, Harvey sought some position in which he might
devote himself to science ; and it would appear was selected by Mr. Spring Rice
(the late Lord Monteagle) for the post of colonial treasurer at the Cape of Good
Hope; that by some accident the appointment was made out in the name of an
elder brother, and an inopportune change of ministry frustrated all attempts at
rectification. ‘There was no other way but for the brother to accept the under-
signed appointment, and take the young botanist with him to the Cape as his
assistant. This was done, and the brothers sailed for that colony in the year
1835. But the health of the elder brother suddenly and hopelessly failed within
a year, and he died in 1836 on the passage home. William Harvey’s appoint-
ment to succeed his brother had been sent to the Cape while he was on his home-
ward voyage; he immediately returned to his post and fulfilled its duties for
three years, devoting his mornings to collecting and his nights to botanical inves-
tigation, with such assiduity that his health also gave way, and he was compelled
to return home in 1839. 'The summer of the next year found him re-established
and on his way to the Cape for the third time. But he could not long endure
the sultry climate and the intense application; with broken health he came back
in 1841 and gave up the appointment.

After two years of prostration and seclusion he was well again; and in 1844,
on the death of Dr. Coulter, he was appointed keeper of the herbarium of Trinity
College, Dublin. The most important portion of the herbarium then consisted
of the collections, yet unassorted, made by Coulter in northwestern Mexico and
California. Harvey generously added his own large collections, for which he
was allowed fifty pounds a year in addition to a slender salary, and he proceeded
to build up the herbarium into a first-class establishment. 'The professorship of
132 WILLIAM HENRY HARVEY.

botany in the college, which was pretty well endowed, fell vacant about this
time, and the college authorities, wishing to elect Harvey to the chair and so to
combine the two offices, conferred upon him the necessary degree of M.D. But
it was contended that an honorary degree did not meet the requirements, and so
Dr. Allman, the present distinguished professor of natural history at Edinburg,
carried the election.

Except for the slenderness of his salary, Dr. Harvey was now well placed for
scientific work, the object to which he wished to devote his life, and he entered
upon and pursued his distinguished career henceforth with an entire and well-
directed energy that never flac ged until he was prostrated by mortal disease.

He had already published, at the Cape in 1838, his Genera of South African
Plants, hastily prepared, solely for local use, but no unworthy beginning of his
work in Phenogamous Botany ; and in his favorite department of the science he
had brought out in 1841 his Manual of British Alge, which he re-edited in 1849.
He now commenced the first of the series of his greater works, illustrated by his
facile pencil—for he drew admirably. The first (monthly) part of his excellent
and beautiful Phycologia Britannica, a History of British Seaweeds, containing
colored figures of all the species inhabiting the shores of the British islands,
appeared in January, 1846, and the undertaking was completed in 1851, in three
(or four) volumes, w ith 360 plates, all drawn on stone by his own hand. A simi-
lar but less extended work, the Nereis Australis, or Alg@ of the Southern Ocean,
which was begun in 1847, was carried only to 50 plates of selected and beauti-
ful species.

In 1848, Dr. Harvey succeeded Dr. Litton as professor of botany in the Royal
Dublin Society, to which belonged the botanic garden of Glasnevin ; this required
him to deliver short courses of lectures annually i in Dublin or in some other Irish
town, and provided a welcome addition to his income.

In 1848, at the request of his friend Van Voorst, the publisher, he wrote his
charming little volume, The Sea-Side Book, the unsurpassed model of that class
of popular scientific books; it was published in 1849, and has passed through
several editions. In July of that year, having arranged a visit to this atti y;
and having been invited to deliver a course of lectures before the Lowell Tnsti-
tute, he took steamer for Halifax and Boston, passed the summer and autumn in
exploring the shores of the northern States, and in the society of his friends and
relatives; for the late Mr. Jacob Harvey, still well and pleasantly remembered
in New York, who married the daughter of Dr. Hosack, was his elder brother.
In the antumn he gave an admirable course of lectures upon Cryptogamic botany
before the Lowell Institute in Boston, and afterwards a shorter course at the
Smithsonian Institution at Washington. He then travelled in the southern
Atlantic States, continuing the exploration of our Alg@ down to Florida and the
JXeys; and in May, 1850, he returned to Ireland.* Under the wise and liberal
arrangements made by Professor Henry in behalf of the Smithsonian Institution,
and with his own large collections augmented by the contributions which every
student or lover of Alg@ was glad to place in such worthy hands, Professor
Harvey now prepared his Nereis Boreali-Americana, or Contributions to a His-
tory of the Marine Alge of North America. 'The work is a systematic account
of all the known marine Alg@ of North America, but with figures only of the
leading species. It was issued in three parts; the first part, the Jlelanospermee,
in 1852, in the third volume of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge ;
the second, the Rhodospermee, in the fifth volume; and the third, or Chloro-
spermee, in the tenth volume of the series published in 1858; and the three parts,
collected for separate issue, compose a thick imperial quarto volume, of 550 pages
ot letter-press and fifty plates. The work remains the principal if not the only

enide to the American student of Alg@, and one of the most popular as well as
useful of the very various contributions to knowledge which the well-managed
bequest of Smithson has given to the world.

Before the last part of the Nereis Boreali-Americana was published, Professor
Harvey had sought a wider field of scientific labor and observation. Obtaining
a long leave of ‘absence, and some assistance from the university in addition to
the continuance of his salary, he left England in August, 1853, by the overland
route for Australia, stopping at Aden and Ceylon to collect ; he visited the east,
south, and west coasts of Australia, as well as ‘Tasmania. ‘Taking advantage of
a missionary ship which was to cruise among the South Sea islands, and which
offered him unexpected facilities, he visited ‘the Fiji, Navigators’, and Friendly
islands, touching also at New Zealand. Returning to Sydney he sailed to Val-
paraiso, which he reached much prostrated through over-exertion in a warm cli-
mate; and when recuperated he returned home by way of the Isthmus, arriving
in October, 1856. ‘The algological collections of these three laborious years, or
the Australian portion of them, formed the subject of Professor Harvey’s third
great illustrated work, and one of the most exquisite of the kind, the Phycologia
Australica, the serial publication of which began in 1858, and was concluded
in 1863, in five imperial octavo volumes, each of 60 colored plates. All but the
last century of plates were put upon stone by the author.

Upon Dr. Harvey’s return, in 1856, from his long expedition, he found the
chair of botany in the University of Dublin vacated “by the appointment of Dr.
Allman to that of natural history in the University of ‘Edinburg, and he was at
once preferred to the position which he had sought when younger and freer, and
which he now oceupied till his death. The exhausting duties of this chair, and
of that which he still held in the Royal Dublin Society, undiminished by the
transference to the Government Museum of Irish Industr y, did not prevent Pro-
fessor Harvey from entering with unabated ardor upon an undertaking of greater
magnitude than any preceding one. This was the Flora Capensis, : a full SYS-
tematic account of all the plants of the Cape Colony and the adjacent provinces
of Caffraria and Natal, in which he was associated with Dr. Sonder, of ae
burg. Three thick octavo volumes of this work have appeared, the last i
1865 5, including the Composite. Along with this Dr. Harvey—learning for Re
purpose another form of lithographic drawing—broveht out, between the years
1859 and 1864, two volumes of his Thesaurus Capensis, or Illustrations of the
South African Flora, comprising 200 plates of interesting phenogamous plants.
A complete list of his publications would include several contributions to scientific
periodicals, mainly to Hooker’s Journal of Botany, and a few miscellaneous
writings,

In April, 1861, Dr. Harvey married Miss Phelps of Limerick. If not robust,
he was apparently in good health, in the full maturity of his powers, and, it was
hoped, only at the noonday of his allotted course of usefulness. But ere the lec-
ture season of that summer was over, an attack of hemorrhage from the lungs
gave notice of a serious pulmonary disease. Yet he seemed to recover from this
almost completely ; he resumed his stated work and gave his lectures as usual in
1863, and also in the spring of the following year, but with some difficulty. The
winter and spring of 1864-5 were spent in the south of F rance, with only tran-
sient benefit. Returning to his home and his herbarium he w orked on still at
the Cape Flora, with cheerful spirit and feeble hands, until he could work no
longer. Last spring he sought in Devonshire a milder air, and found a peaceful

rest. “On Tuesday, the 15th of } May, 1866, at the age of 55 years, he quietly
breathed his last at the residence of Lady Hooker, the widow of his long : attached
friend Sir William J. Hooker, surrounded by kind and anxious relatives and

friends, and was buried in the cemetery at Torquay, on Saturday the 19th of
May.”
134 WILLIAM HENRY HARVEY.

Dr. Harvey was one of the few botanists of our day who excelled both in
phenogamic and cryptogamic botany. In algology, his favorite branch, proba-
bly he has left no superior; in systematic botany generally, he had now an emi-
nent position. He was a keen observer and a capital describer. He investi-
gated accurately, worked readily and easily with microscope, pencil and pen,
wrote perspicuously, and, where the subject permitted, with captivating grace;
affording, in his lighter productions, mere glimpses of the warm and poetical
imagination, delicate humor, refined feeling, and sincere goodness which were
charmingly revealed in intimate intercourse and correspondence, and which won
the admiration and the love of all who knew him well. Handsome in person,
gentle and fascinating in manners, genial and warm-hearted, but of very retir-
ing disposition, simple in his tastes and unaffectedly devout, it is not surprising
that he attracted friends wherever he went, so that his death will be sensibly felt
on every continent and in the islands of the sea.

MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

By M. Ete de Beaumont,
Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY C. A. ALEXANDER.

Ir has been said that the distinctive stamp of our age is the aspiration after
material well-being. Science is accused of having fostered this instinct by the
numerous useful applications with which it has endowed humanity; and it is
true that in our day chemistry, steam, electricity, have remodelled the face of
the world. It is quite certain, also, that a scientific education better understood
and more generally distributed has multiplied the number of those who, without
having received from nature faculties of the first order, have yet proved capable
of deriving from science great advantages as well for others as themselves. We
may well suppose that even minds still more developed, seduced by the allure-
ments of fortune or yielding to stern necessity, have sometimes deviated from
the arduous paths of pure science into the more inviting paths of applied science.
But we have seen also, and see daily, men of a more robust termperament who,
listening only to the inspirations of genius, devote their whole existence to stren-
uous labors which, for the moment, will contribute merely to the increase of
science; of which future generations alone can make useful applications; which
will not be appreciated even in a manner somewhat general until long after the
death of their authors; and from which those authors will themselves have
derived no other enjoyment than the majestic and exciting spectacle of great
truths covered as yet with an impenetrable veil to all eyes but their own,
together with the consciousness of a duty fulfilled towards Providence, who has
intrusted to them the instruments of the future progress of the human race.

Among those who seem to have been born to vindicate our age from an
unjust reproach, and to exalt humanity in its own esteem, a high rank must be
accorded to a geometer who occupied a place in this academy for nearly 50
years, who has enriched our publications with some of their most valuable con-
tents, and bequeathed to future ages works of paramount importance; whose
merit is every day more generally recognized, and whose memory awaits by
Just title an official testimonial of the sympathetic admiration which has sur-
vived him in the affectionate remembrance of all his colleagues.

Adrien Marie Legendre was born, September 18, 1752, in a condition of life
which left to him the credit of being indebted to his own merit for all that he
might eventually become, He finished in good season, at the college Mazarin,
those solid classical studies from which he derived a lasting taste for the litera-
ture of the ancients, the happy fruits of which are to be recognized in the ele-
gance, the purity, and the lucid conciseness of his writings. There also he
commenced the study of mathematics under a highly distinguished master, the
Abbé Marie, who failed not to remark his ardor and was struck with the per-
spicuity of his exercises. But a little time had elapsed after his retirement from
college when the judicious professor publishing, in 1774, a treatise on mechan-
ics, thought proper to embody in it several remarkable fragments derived from
his disciple. The modesty of the scholar inclined him to shrink from designa-
138 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

tion, but the abbé felt it to be a duty to indicate to men of science the passages
which had proceeded from the pen of the young Legendre, aged at that time
22 years. Among these passages is the definition of accelerative forces, dis-
tinguished by a precision and clearness of expression which seem sometimes to
be | among the happy privileges of youth. This definition is so natural, and
now so families to scientific minds, that, when recalled, it is with difficulty con-
ceived haw it could ever have presented anything of originality and novelty.
It is but just to say that it forms no exceptional feature in the work of the Abbé
Marie, who, in many respects, was in advance of his age, and whose merit was
not limited to that of having divined the talents of Legendre.

D’Alembert had said, with just foresight, that the fate of the new calculus
(differential and integr al) would depend on the reception it met with from the
younger geometers; these therefore he sought to allure to the method in ques-
tion, ‘and which was as yet imperfectly comprehended, by the degree of esteem
and consideration which he accorded to such among them as evinced a capacity
for following it. He was not likely long to overlook the penetrating and pre-
cocious talent which disclosed itself in the young Legendre; and scarcely had
the first “mpses of genius given presage of what might be expected from the
disciple of the Abbé Marie, when he was named professor of mathematics at the
military school of Paris. Here, from 1775 to 1780, he continued to give les-
sons on the scientific grounds of the military art to that ardent and intelligent
body of youths from which have sprung not a few of our warlike celebrities, and
whose number would have been more considerable, had not circumstances
forced a part of them into emigration. It may be inferred that the instruction
given by the young professor ‘embraced the first elements of balistics, the art,
namely, of throwing projectiles, and that he studied the learned treatises which
Bezout, Borda, and “other eminent men had published on these difficult problems ;
for when the Royal Academy of Sciences and Belles-lettres of Prussia proposed,
for the prize of 1782, the question of determining the curve described by balls and
shells, regard being had to the resistance of the air, and giving the rules for ascer-
taining the range which corresponds to different initial velocities and to different
angles of projection, M. Legendre was quite in readiness to enter into the compe-
tition. His memoir, prepared on this oceasion, was crowned with success in the
public meeting of mine 6, 1782, and was published at Berlin under the title
ot Recherches sur la tr ajectoire des projectiles dans les milieux résistants.*

Newton, it is stated in this memoir, was the first who made researches respect-
ing trajectories in resisting mediums. He particularly considers that which takes
place on the hypothesis of a resistance proportional to the simple velocity; but
he gives merely approximations, and those but rough ones, for the trajectory
which results when the resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity.
The honor of the discovery is due to Jean Bernoulli, who published a general
solution of the problem, supposing the resistance to be as any power whatever
of the velocity. Long after, Euler discussed the same question in the Memoirs
of the Academy of Berlin for the year 1753. His object was to apply the
theory to balistics, and for that he proposes very ingenious means. In the
memoirs of the same Academy for the year 1765, and elsewhere, we find very
extended researches by Lambert with the same object. Borda, in the Memoirs
of the Academy of Sciences of Paris for the year 1769, has treated this ques-
tion with his usual elegance and ingenuity. Conformably with the idea of
Newton, he substitutes for the true trajectory that which would be described in
virtue of a density but slightly variable, and he obtains by this means an
approximation much superior to that of Newton. Lastly, Berout, in his Course
of Artillery, published in 1772, made a more particular application of methods
of his own to the trajectory of shells and bullets.

* This memoir bore for its motto: Zolluntur in altum ut casu gravire ruant.

MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE 139

M. Legendre propounds the equation of the movement of the projectile on the
supposition that the resistance of the air is proportional to the square of the velocity.
He integrates this equation with elegance, and the reduction into series forms more
especially the remarkable part of the memoir. Although the hypotheses which
he advances on the variation of the density of the air have been modified, his
calculations have remained the type of those that have been made more in
detail on the supposition of a resistance proportional to the square of the velocity.
M. Francais, professor at the schools of artillery, and General Didion have only
supplied improvements to his method.* But this solution of the balistic ques-
tion is simply a monument, so to speak, in the history of the science, simce the
necessity has been recognized of introducing, in the expression of the resistance
of the air, a term proportional to the cube of the velocity. It is not the less cer-
tain, however, that by his memoir Legendre, young as he yet was, has earned
for himself a distinguished place in the series of mathematicians to whom is due
the superiority of the European artillery ; a series which commences with New-
ton, in which M. Poisson occupies an eminent rank, and which is continued
with so much éclat by the learned officers to whom we owe the actual precision
of our artillery and the employment of rifled cannon.

But, however seductive this first success might appear, M. Legendre did not
continue to occupy himself with the application of science to military art, and we
read at this early stage on the title page of the Dissertation on Balistics, printed
in 1782, the announcement that it is “by A. M. Legendre, late professor of
mathematics in the military school at Pars.” The youthful veteran, to whom
perhaps the military discipline had never been particularly congenial, had decided
to reserve his whole time for the study of departments of mathematics which,
while not more difficult, pertain to an order of ideas generally considered as more
elevated.

He had been occupied for some time with researches on the mutual attractions
and forms of the planetary spheroids, and read at the Academy of Sciences of
Paris, January 22, 1783, a memoir on the attraction of spheroids, for the exami-
nation of which, MM. d’Alembert and de Laplace were named commissioners.
It was at this same sitting, as we learn from the invaluable journals of the
Academy, that MM. Daubenton and Bezout made a favorable report on a
memoir of the Abbé Hatiy, relative to the structure of fluor spars ; for it was the
epoch when M. Hatiy was submitting to the Academy, in a series of memoirs, the
ideas which have become the basis of crystallography.

M. Legendre finished the reading of his memoir in the sitting of the 19th of
February, and in that of the 15th of March, MM. d’Alembert, Bezout and de
Laplace read the following report :

The Academy having charged us with the examination of two memoirs of M. Legendre on
the attraction of spheroids, we proceed to render an account of them. Geometers well know
the admirable synthetic theory of M. Maclaurin on the attractions of spheroids, of which all the
sections are elliptical, &c., d&c. M. de Lagrange subsequently arrived at the same results
by analogy alone in the Memoirs of Berlin for 1771, but all these researches suppose the
point attracted at the surface, or in the interior of the spheroids.  * bg ‘i 7

I regret the impossibility of reading the whole of this report, written with
a masterly hand and inimitable clearness by M. de Laplace, who had him-
self the year before communicated to the Academy a leamed theory of the
attractions of spheroids and of the figure of planets,t a cireumstance which
renders still more honorable, both for himself and M. Legendre, the justice which
he so cheerfully and explicitly accords to his competitor, as yet almost unknown.
{ will content myself with saying that after having analyzed the two memoirs of
M. Legendre, who arrives at the conclusion that, in order to determine the

140 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

attraction of a spheroid on any exterior point, it suffices to cause the surface of
another spheroid described from the same foci as the first to pass by that point,
the illustrious reporter closed his remarks as follows:

The theorem which forms the principal object of these two memoirs is highly interesting.
It is a new step taken in the theory of attractions of spheroids: the analysis is very able, is
presented moreover with much elegance and clearness, and announces in its author distin-
guished talent. We think, therefore, that these memoirs merit the approbation of the Academy,
and should be printed in the Collection of foreign savants.

After the conclusions drawn in their report, which were adopted by the Academy,
the commissioners further added :

Besides the two memoirs of which we have just rendered an account, M. Legendre has
presented to the Academy at different times memoirs on the resolution of intermediate equa-
tions of the second degree, and on the properties of eontinual fractions ; on several problems
of probabilities ; on the summation of continual fractions, and on the rotation of bodies,
which are not quickened by any accelerative force. All these memoirs have been esteemed
worthy of being printed among those of foreign savants. Finally, M. Legendre has borne
off the prize last proposed by the Academy of Berlin on balistics, or the mayement of pro-
jectiles.

Thus the reporters made incidentally a complete statement of the academic
titles of M. Legendre, nor was this done without intention, for there was an
election at hand in the class of mechanics. The journals inform us in effect
that, at the following session of the 19th March, (the Academy then met twice
a week,) MM. Coulomb, Bossut, Le Roy, and Cousin also made a report on two
memoirs of M. Périer; the first containing a description of a steam-pump, which
the latter had just constructed at Chaillot to raise the waters of the Seine, upon
the principles of MM. Watt and Bolton; and the second in relation to another
pump, which the same engineer had erected at that place, after ideas of his own.
These works, with which every one is now familiar, appeared to the Parisian
population of that day a marvel of a wholly novel kind. ‘The learned reporters
concluded by saying:

We think that the two memoirs of which we render an account, in which the author
describes in a simple and lucid manner a steam mechanism of his own invention, as well as
that of MM. Watt and Boiton, deserve the approbation of the Academy, and should be
included in the Collection of foreign savants.

At this sitting the Academy likewise received a favorable report from MM.
Desmarest, Tillet, Coulomb, and Monge on a memoir of M. Duhamel, corre-
spondent of the Academy and inspector general of mines, relative to a new imstru-
ment for determining the intersection of lodes. The journal goes on to inform
us that at this same sitting the members of the class of mechanics presented
MM. Legendre, Mennier, Périer, Duhamel, and Defer; that the first voices were
for M. Legendre, and the second for M. Perier. It was the manner of expressing
at that time the votes of the Academy, which was composed of four kinds of
members: honoraries, of whom few were present at the sittings; pensionaries,
associates, and adjuncts, to whom were sometimes added supernumerary adjuncts.
Among the names of academicians who took part in the scrutiny of the 19th of
March, 1783, we remark those of MM. Cassinide Thury, @Alembert, Lavoisier,
Lalande, Daubenton, Borda, Bezout, the Marquis Condorcet, Bailly, Rochon,

) ’ < peas 3) ‘1 ) J)
Monge, Berthollet, de Jussieu, Tessier, and several other celebrated savanis, a
part of whom will be remembered by some who hear me, as having, at a later period,
occupied with themselves the benches of the Institute.

In the sitting of the 2d April, the perpetual secretary (Condorcet) read the
following letter of M. Amelot, dated from Versailles, 30th March, 1783:

I have the honor of informing you that the King has nominated M. Legendre to the place
of adjunct of the Academy of Sciences, vacant in the class of mechanics by the nomination
of M. de Laplace to a place of associate, and that his Majesty has also thought proper to
name M. Peérier to a place of supernumerary adjunct in the same class.

I have supposed that, in reverting to the first brilliant successes of M. Legendre,
it would perhaps be agreeable to my auditors to carry back their thoughts for a
MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE. 141

moment to the constitution and usages of the ancient Academy of Sciences of
Paris, from which our own differ in some respects, though on many points they
have remained identically the same.

I hasten to return to the labors of M. Legendre, which followed one another
at short intervals. He read to the Academy, July 4, 1784, Researches on the
figure of planets, in which he again discussed in a felicitous manner a subject
treated by M. de Laplace. It had been ascertained by illustrious geometers
that when a planet, supposed to be fluid and homogeneous, revolves upon itself,
it arrives definitively at an ellipsoidal figure, slightly flattened at the two poles
of rotation, and that among the figures which may be attributed to the meridian
curve, the ellipsis is one of those which satisfy the condition of equilibrium; but
noone had yet discovered that the ellipsis 1 is the only curve which can satisfy the
condition. M. de Laplace, in his memoir of 1772, had said positively that he
would not venture to assert that this figure was the only one which could do so;
that it would be first necessary to know in finite terms the complete integral of
the differential equation of the problem, and that he had not yet been able to
obtain it. This M. Legendre accomplished by availing himself of the ingenious
analysis of his memoir on the attraction of the spheroids, and he concludes that
if a planet in equilibrium be supposed to have the figure of a solid of revolution
little different from a sphere, and divided into two equal parts by its equator, the
meridian of that planet will necessarily be elliptical.

“The proposition which forms the object of this memoir,” he observes in a
note, “having been demonstrated in a much more skilful and general manner in
a memoir which M. de Laplace has already published in the volume of 1782,
(printed later than its date,) I should draw attention to the fact that the date of
my own memoir is earlier, and that the proposition which appears here, as it was
read in June and July, 1784, gave occasion to M. de Laplace to inv estigate the

subject thoroughly, and to present to geometers a complete theory thereof.”

Other eveat geometers also have added their discoveries to those of M.
Legendre, * Dut nothing has effaced the merit of his two memoirs drawn up in
1782. Hence, M. Poisson, i in the learned and eloquent discourse which he pro-
nounced January 10, 1833, at the grave of Legendre, took occasion to say:

The reduction into series of which he made use in the first memoir, gave rise to theorems
which have been since extended, but which are still the basis of the theory at which we have
subsequently arrived. In the second, he gave the only direct solution yet known of the
problem of the figure of a homogeneous planet, supposed to be duid, and soon afterwards he
extended his researches to the general case of a planet, composed of heterogeneous strata.t

In the course of his memoir, M. Legendre finds that the terrestrial spheroid,
which is in equilibrium when the axes are in the ratio of 230 to 231, may still be
so if the axes be supposed in the ratio of 1 to 681, which affords quite a strange
figure, but one which recalls the ring of Saturn. He adds that d’Alembert was
the first to remark that there might be several elliptical spheroids which would com-
port with equilibrium. Wesee by these different examples what emulation existed
between those fine intellects, WV Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre ; with
what rapidity their labors succeeded, while they mutually completed one another,
It may further be remarked that M. Legendre supposes only in an implicit man-
ner that the spheroid is one of revolution. The equation found by him is that
of the meridian curve, and his analysis is in no respect contradicted by the dis-
covery, as curious as it was unexpected, made in our time almost simultaneously
by M. Liouville and M. Jacobi, that the planetary ellipsoid may have its three
axes unequal, and that the equator may itself be an ellipsis.

* Since the death of M. Legendre, the question of the attraction of an ellipsoid on an exter-

nal point has been completely resolved in an analytic manner by M. Poisson, (Mémoires de
L Acad. des Sciences de U’ Institute, t. xiii, p. 497, 1835 ;) ard in a ae manner by M.
Chasles, (Mémoires des savants étrangers dU’ Academie des Sciences, t. ix, p. 629, 1846. )

142 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

M. Legendre subsequently resumed the questions treated in these first and
memorable memoirs, particularly in 1790, in the sequel of his researches on the
figure of the planets; in 1789, in a memoir on double integrals, in which he
completes the analysis of his memoir on the attraction of spheroids ; and still
later, in a memoir read to the Academy in 1812. After having pointed out, in
this last, the improvements contributed to his preceding labors on this subject by
M. Biot, who had conceived the happy idea of applying thereto an integral given
by M. de Lagrange for another object, M. Legendre avails himself of the sub-
stitution discovered by M. Ivory to present the entire theory of the attraction
of homogeneous ellipsoids with all the simplicity of which it is susceptible.

But these important labors were far from entirely absorbing M. Legendre’s
attention, and the varied nature of the memoirs which he presented in great fre-
quency to the Academy, to a mere enumeration of which I must here confine
myself, evinced the extent of his know ledge and the surprising fecundity of his
genius.

In 1785, he read to the Academy a masterly memoir entitled Researches on
indeterminate analysis, which includes numerous propositions on the theory of
numbers, and especially the celebrated theorem of reciprocity known under the
name of the law of Legendre.* In 1786, a memoir on the manner of distin-
gushing maxima from minima in the calculation of variations.t Also, two
memoirs on integrations by ares of the ellipsis, and on the comparison of these
ares, { memoirs which contain the first rudiments of his theory of elliptical func-
tions. In 1787, a memoir on the integration of certain equations with partial
difierences. By a simple change of variables, he arrives rigorously at the inte-
gral of an equation which Monge had only integrated by a process depending on
certain met: iphysical principles about which there still existed some doubts. By
proving that the integral was exact, M. Legendre contributed to corroborate the
reputation of the illustrious author of the application of analysis to geometry,
whose name also is one of the characteristic glories of the French mathematical
school. In this same memoir he gives by his method the integrals of several
classes of equations with partial differences of superior orders ; ‘then, very hap-
pily extending an idea of Lagrange for the integration of non-linear equations
of the first order, he distinguishes therein six cases of integrability which they
may present. Again, in 1790 he read a memoir on the particular integrals of
differential equations, "of which he modestly says that the principle and demon-
stration are only consequences very easily to be deduced from the theory which
M. de Lagrange had given in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1774.
He establishes that particular integrals are always comprised in a finite expres-
sion in which the number of arbitrary constants is less than in the complete inte-
gral, thus preparing the way for the definitive labors which M. Poisson has since
made public on this subject.

But at this epoch M. Legendre was already engaged in another series of
researches which occupied him at intervals for a erent number of years, and in
which his labors were fertile in important results.

In 1787, some doubts having been raised upon the respective position of the
observatories of Paris and Greenwich, it was decided to connect the meridians
by a chain of triangles which should extend from one point to the other. The
Academy of Sciences confided to three of its members, MM. Cassini, Mechain,
and Legendre, the execution of this operation, in concert ‘with Major General Roy
and several other English savants. These important labors were accordingly,
performed with all the exactness which the state of science then permitted—by
the help of an excellent quadrant prepared by the celebrated English artist
Ramsden, and the repeating circle constructed by Lenoir upon the principles of

Borda. M. Legendre calculated all the triangles situated in France, and after-
wards those also which extended in E neland as faras Greenwich. On this occa-
sion he went to London, where he was received with the distinction due to him,
and was named member of the Royal Society of London. He published at this
time in the Memoirs of the Academy for the year 1787 (printed in 1789) an
important paper entitled, Memoir on the trigonometrical operations of which the
results depend on the figure of the earth ;* of this he has himself explained the
object in terms which I take the liberty of abridging:

The only question here is that which regards operations exacting extreme pre-
cision, such as the measurement of the degrees of the meridian or of a parallel,
and the geographical determination of the principal points of a large area frorn
the triangles which connect them. Operations of this kind may be carried
henceforward to a great degree of precision by means of the repeating circle.
In effect, the use which we have made of this instrument, in 1787, has convinced
us that it can give each angle of a triangle to about two seconds, or even more
exactly, if all circumstances are favorable. It is further necessary that the cal-
culations established on such data should not be inferior to the latter in exact-
ness; especially is it requisite to take account of the reduction to the horizon,
which amounts quite often to several seconds; and thence arise triangles of infi-
nitely small curvature, the calculation of which demands special rules; for, by
considering them as rectilinear, we should neglect the small excess of the sum
of the three angles over 180°, ‘and by considering them as spherical, the sides
would be changed into very small ares, the calculation of which by the common
tables would be neither exact nor commodious.

I have assembled in this memoir, continues M. Legendre, the necessary formu-

las, as well for the reduction and calculation of these sorts of triangles, as for
what relates to the position of the different points of a chain of triangles on the
surface of the spheroid. In these calculations, he adds, there are some elements
susceptible of a sheht uncertainty. = = a In order that
the calculation need be made but once, and to judge by a glance of the influence
of errors, I have supposed the value of each principal element to be augmented
by an indeterminate quantity which denotes the correction of it. These literal
quantities, which are to be regarded as very small, do not prevent the calculation
from being proceeded with by logarithms in the usual manner.

This was an important addition to the methods of calculation employed till
then, and still later he further added the method of least squares. He gives in
this memoir formulas for the reduction of an angle to the horizon, as also for
other determinations, and especially the important theorem known under the
name of the theorem of Legendre, through which the calculation of a spherical
triangle of small extent is reduced to that of a rectilinear triangle, by subtract-
ing from each of the three angles the third of the spherical excess ‘of their sum,
that is to say the inconsiderable quantity by which this exceeds 180°. M. Legen-
dre has subsequently demonstrated that this fundamental theorem is applicable
also to spheroidal triangles, whether traced on an ellipsoid of revolution or even
on a spheroid slightly iregular.

He also occupies himself, in the same memoir, with the value of the degrees
of the meridian in the elliptical spheroid, and with the determination of the
respective position of different places deduced from the nature of the shortest
line which can be traced on the surface of this spheroid from one extremity to
the other of the chain of triangles and from the intersections of that line with
the different sides of the triang les or with their prolongations. This line, which
M. Legendre, at different times and always with success, made the object of his
researches, bears the name of the geodesic line ; on the regular ellipsoid it is of

double curvature, unless it coincides with a meridian, Finally, he occupies him-

144 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

self w'th the operations which have for their object the measurement of the
degrees of the meridian, and concludes with some theoretical and practical reflec-
tions on the use of the repeating circle of Borda in the delicate operations which
relate to that object.

These reflections were judicious; but at the moment of recording them, M.
Legendre, struck with the progress which the construction of instruments had
recently made, did not foresee those improvements which it was even then on
the point of receiving. They were such that at the end of 30 years the opera-
tions of 1787 were found to be inferior in the measurement of angles and bases,
the observation of night-signals, &c., to those generally executed in this way.
Hence it resulted that the ecodesic connection of Dunkirk and Greenwich
required to be recommenced in 1817. This new undertaking was confided to
MM. Avago and Mathieu, associated with Captain Kater and other English

savants. What remained and will alw ays remain of the operations of 1787 are
the formulas and theorems which it furnished M. Legendre the occasion of estab-
lishing, and which in the sequel he still further developed and improved.

His memoir was written in the anticipation of new and more extended appli-
cations; for the project already existed of resuming the measurement of the
meridian which traverses France from north to south, and which had been once
measured, in 1739 and 1740, in the great and admirable geodesic operation which
had supplied the basis of the chart of Cassini. The National Assembly, in
effect, having adopted the plan of establishing a new system of weights and
measures for all Fi rance, a report was made to the Academy of Sciences, March
19, 1791, by MM. Borda, Lagrange, Laplace, Monge, and Condorcet, on the
choice of a unit of measure. The. report, after a profound discussion of the sub-
ject, proposed to take as the unit of measure the metre, representing the ten-
millionth part of a quarter of the meridian, calculated from the measured length
of the are comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona. It proposed at the same
time the execution of different preliminary operations, one of the most important
of which was the verification, by new observations, of the series of triangles
employed for the measurement of the meridian of Cassini and its prolongation
to Barcelona.

It was afterwards agreed that MM. Cassini, Mechain, and Legendre, the same
who had connected the meridian of Paris with that of Greenwich, should be
charged with this new operation. Yet M. Legendre is not comprised in the num-
ber of the 12 commissioners nominated (April 17, 1795) to conduct all the
labors necessary for fixing the bases of the metrical system. ‘These commis-
sioners designated from their own number MM. Mechain and Delambre to exe-
cute the measurement of the angles, the astronomical observations, and the meas-
urement of the dependent bases of the meridian, and it was they in effect who,
in very difficult times, had the merit of executing this vast operation with means
often greatly restricted ; yet, a few years afterwards, we find M. Legendre among
the members of the mixed commission, formed of a union of French and foreign

savants, to which the duty of examining and verifying the whole work was
entrusted. All the triangles were separately calculated | “by four persons, MM.
Trallés, Van Swinden, Legendre, and Delambre, each employing the method he
preferred, and the results were only admitted when there was a satisfactory agree-
ment between the four calculations. M. Legendre signed with the other com-
missioners the report made to the National Institute, June 17, 1799, on the basis
of the metrical system, and he continued to take part in all the ulterior calcula-
tions and the different verifications rendered necessary by certain discordances
which had been remarked, and by some doubts which had arisen on the exact-
ness of several paris of the operation. The method he followed was that of
which he had established the basis in his memoir of 1787. In applying it on so

extensive a Scale, he improved and developed it, and gave a large number of new
hoon les ading to more rapid reductions, to more convenient formulas. He read
MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE, . 145

to the first class of the Institute, March 3, 1806, a new memoir entitled, Analy-
sis of triangles traced on the surface of a spheroid, in which he considers the tri-
angles as no longer described on the sphere, but on a spheroid. THe inquires
and demonstrates the properties of the shortest lines traced on its surface ; extends
and thus generalizes the numerous applications of the theorem which bears his
name, and reviewing the principal operations offered by geodesy, gives the most
complete analysis of them.

He concludes that there can remain no doubt of the exactness of the calcu-
lation of the triangles from which the distance of the parallels between Dunkirk
and Montjouy, near Barcelona, has been computed, as well as the length of the
metre; but he considers it beyond question that the results deduced from differ-
ent chains of triangles do not always exactly accord among themselves, on
account of certain anomalies in the latitudes and azimuths which may be due
to local attractions.

At this epoch, in 1805, M. Legendre had just published, in the sequel of his
new methods for the determination of the orbits of comets, an appendix on the
method of least squares. Here he proposed that method which has generally
been adopted for deriving from the measures yielded by observation the most
exact results which they are susceptible of furnishing. M. de Laplace has since
demonstrated that it is the most advantageous of which we can make use in prac-
tice. M. Legendre, after having developed it, made an immediate application
of it to the measurement of the degrees of the meridian of France, and he con-
cluded, as in the geodesic memoir, that the anomalies in the latitudes ought not
to be attributed to the observations, and that they pertain probably to local
attractions which act irregularly on the plumb-line. M. Gauss, in 1809, seems
to have thought, for the moment, that he had rights of priority to the invention
of the method of least squares ;* but, if it cannot be contested that so eminent
a savant may have had the same idea with M. Legendre, and may even have
applied it in his labors, it is certain that M. Legendre had, on his part, discoy-
ered the method and was the first who published it.

M. Legendre continued henceforth to make part of the commission of weights
and measures; but, thongh his labors of 1787 had rendered his co-operation
indispensable in the great enterprise which that commission was charged with
conducting to a successful issue, there was a period during which, as we have
said, he ceased to be officially attached to it: this was under the reign of terror.
Like most of the sévants of his epoch, he was favorable to the ideas which
have become the basis of modern society; but he remained a stranger to the
excesses which imbrued the Revolution in blood. Perhaps, indeed, his caustic
turn had not wholly spared its authors; certain it is, that, during the violence of.
the storm, he was forced to hide himself. It was one of the most happy inci--
dents of his life; for, in the retreat which he found in Paris itself, he formed the
acquaintance of a young and engaging female, Marguerite-Claudine Couhin,.
whom he espoused shortly afterwards, and who constituted his happiness during.
40 years. Much younger than her husband, she bore no inefficient part in his
great labors by the tranquillity, the assiduous attentions, the watchful solicitude,.
with which she environed him, proving herself, in all circumstances, a model of
discretion, grace, and amiability.

The revolutionary turbulence, however, had itself never interrupted the
labors of M. Legendre. In the year II of the republic, towards the end of
1793, he published a new memoir on elliptical transcendents, forming a quarto.

*In his work, entitled Theoria motus corporum cedestium, M. Gauss expresses himself
with respect to this in the following manner: ‘This principle, which we have employed:
since the year 1795, has been lately given by M. Legendre in his Nouvelles Méthodes pour la
determination des orbites des cométes: Paris, 1806. There will be found in that work several
conseqtiences which the desire of being brief induces us to omit.’ (See the work enti--
tled Méthodes des moindres carrés, Mémoires sur la combination des observations, by M. Ch.
F. Gauss, translated into French and published with authority of the author by M, J..
Bertrand, 1855, p. 133.)

146 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

volume of more than 100 pages; but in the qnictude of his happy retreat he
had turned his thoughts to other subjects. The former professor of mathematics
in the military school began anew to occupy himself with the Hiements of
Geometry. 'Vhe first edition of his work under this title, a work written with
elegant simplicity, and in which all the propositions are disposed in a natural
and methodical order, appeared 1 in 1794. The author, modelling himself upon
Euclid, remands the science to the severity of the Greek school. In this,
without perhaps designing it, he accommodated himself to the spirit of his epoch.
Architecture, abandoning the distorted forms of the reign of Louis XV, was
returning, more and more, to the elegant simplicity of the Greek style. A few
years previous our great painter, David, had inaugurated, by his picture of the
Horatii, a complete. revolution in painting, which, after his example, reverted
likewise to the imitation of the ancients.

The work attained at once the first rank among classical books. In less
than 30 years fourteen editions were published, of which the last has under-
gone a large number of impressions: more than 100,000 copies of it have been

5 5
sold in France alone. Legendre’s Elements of Geometry have been reproduced

in the principal languages of Kurope, and have been even translated into Arabic
for the schools established in Egypt by the viceroy, Mehémet-Ali.

The author, prepossessed with the method of Euclid, has perhaps somewhat
unduly availed himself of the reductio ad absurdum, which might often be
replaced by more facile demonstrations; but his work has served to excite a
sort of vigorous intellectual gymnastics by which mathematical studies have
been invigorated, and its influence has been undoubtedly salutary. Among other
things, M. Legendre here demonstrates, in a novel manner, the equality of vol-
ume of two symmetrical poly hedrons formed of equal plane faces, adjusted
under the same angles, but with an verse arrangement which does not admit
of their being superposed. The first editions did not contain the excellent trea-
tise on trigonometry which the author has added to subsequent ones. He has
also enriched these with notes, in which he treats analytically certain parts of
geometry on a new system, as where he demonstrates that the ratios of the
circumference to the diameter and to its square are irrational numbers.

The ratio of the circumference to the diameter, being an irrational number, is
not susceptible of being exactly expressed by any fraction, however great the
whole numbers which form the numerator and denominator. Hence results the
tmpossibility of ever finding the quadrature of the circle, and it was in conse-
quence of a proposition of M. Legendre, based on this demonstrated impossi-
bility, that the Academy renounced all further attention to a problem, the
importance of which is in some sort axiomatic among persons little versed in
mathematics.

But whatever might be the success of his Hlements, M. Legendre did not
question the feasibility of using other methods with success, and himself con-
tributed, in 1802, to the public: ation of a new edition of Clairaut’s Elements of
Geometry, to which he added notes derived probably from his memoranda of the
military school. Geometry is further indebted to him for a method, directly
demonstrated by himself, of inscribing in the circle a regular polygon of 17
sides. Algebra, properly so called, owes to him, among other things, two
different methods for the seiatibn of numerical equations, methods which make
known with much rapidity all the roots, whether real or imaginary, of those
equations.

So highly was M. Legendre appreciated as a skillful calculator, that rarely was
any great series of numerical operations undertaken in France without recourse
being had to his services. In 1787 he had been called to take part in the com-
mission charged with connecting trigonometrically Dunkirk and Greenwich.
For the same reason M. de Prony, placed in the year IT (1794) at the head of the
cadastre, (registry of the survey of lands,) did not deem it expedient to dispense
with his services. The decimal division of the circle, then regarded as a neces-
MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE. 147

sary complement of the metrical system, required new trigonometrical tables.
M. de Prony caused them to be constructed, with incredible celerity, by means
of the division of labor and by processes ’ wholly new, which admitted of the
employment of arithmeticians of even the most indifferent qualifications. The
work was prepared by a section of analysts, over which presided M. Legendre,
who contributed greatly to facilitate the operation by devising new and ingen-
ious formulas for determining the successive differences of the sinus. For the
other sections it only remained to make the additions. The labors of this
board of caleulation produced two copies of tables entirely independent one of
the other, and affording, by their identity, a mutual verification. ‘This mona-
ment of labor and skill, the most vast of its kind which has ever been executed
or even conceived, has no other defect, said M. Delambre, but its very immen-
sity, which has so long delayed its publication.

When the revolutionary tempest had begun to subside, one of the first cares
of government was to reorganize public instruction ; but M. Legendre, whether
he was not in favor with the men in power or for w hatever other: reason, was not
invited to co-operate. His name does not either figure at the close of 1794
among those of the first professors of the Polytechnic school, nor in January,
1795, . in the list of the professors of the Normal schools; nor yet was he com-
prised among the 48 savants whom the government selected to form the nucleus
of the Institute; but, at the earliest opportunity, his colleagues hastened to
redress this injustice by summoning him to their ranks. It will not be amiss to
recall here the succession of events, as facts not destitute of historical interest.

The Academy of Sciences having been suppressed by a decree of the conven-
tion of the Sth of August, 1793, the National Institute, of which the first class
represented that academy, was established by a law of the 5 fructidor, year ILI,
(22d August, 1795,) and was organized by a second law of the 3 brumaire, year
IV, (25th October, 1795.) By the ninth article of this law it was enacted that,
“for the formation of the National Institute, the Executive Directory shall
nominate 48 members, who shall elect 96 others.” To form the nucleus of the
first class of the Institute, 20 members were accordingly nominated by the
directory, December 6, 1795, being two for each section ; those for the section
of mathematics were MM. Lagrange and Laplace. Two other members, MM.
Borda and Bossut, were elected in the meeting of the 9th of December, and the
section, which was to be composed of six members, was completed on the 13th
of the same month by the election of MM. Legendre and Delambre. In this
list M. Bossut appeared by just title for his labors in hydraulics; MM. Borda
and Delambre were included with not less right for their important services in
relation to geodesy, to measures of precision and astronomical calculations ;
MM. Lagrange, Laplace and Legendre were essentially the representatives of
the higher analy sis, and occupied “during life the foremost place among the geom-
eters of the Institute. All three continued till death to justify this proud posi-
tion by labors worthy of themselves and of the illustrious body to which it was
their pleasure as well as duty to communicate them.

In 1805 M. Legendre published new metheds for the determination of the
orbits of comets, t0 which he added, in 1806 and 1820, two supplements ; in
the latter stages of life he had collected the most recent observations on comets
of short periods, in the design of still further applying and improving his pro-
cesses of calculation. Previous to the publication of his two first memoirs in
1805 and 1806, the question had, in his opinion, been always treated in an
imperfect manner and merely by approximations. He considered himself as
haying first indicated two certain modes of arriving at a solution, at once the
most ‘Simple and exact, namely, the method of indeterminate corrections, pro-
posed by him as early as 1787, but the applications of which had been few in
number, and the method of least squares, which then appeared for the first tim

terbalanced by the length of the calculations and by other inconveniences.
They prefer employing the methods of Olbers and Gauss, which, while giving
perhaps a less certain approximation, furnish it in‘all cases more rapidly. In
1806 M. Legendre further published, in the memoirs of the Institute, a new
formula for reducing to true distances the apparent distances from the moon to
the sun or to a star.* Its object was to simplify and accelerate the labors of
practical astronomers. i

These last publications were in some sort excursions made by the indefatiga-
ble author beyond the habitual sphere of his researches, and, seeing with what
promptness and facility M. Legendre thus passed from one subject to another, it
might be thonght that he was completely at liberty in the employment of his
time. He found means, however, in the midst of his purely scientific labors, to
reconcile with the duties of the academician those of several important functions.

Some time after the creation of the Polytechnie School, the former laureate of
the balistic competition was appointed examiner in mathematics for the graduat-
ing students destined for the artillery, and he continued to fulfil these honorable
and delicate functions till 1815, when he voluntarily withdrew and was replaced
by M. de Prony. From the creation of the university, in 1808, M. Legendre
was of its council. At the death of Lagrange, in 1812, he was chosen to suc-
ceed him at the bureau of longitudes, in quality of geometer. He thus took
his place by the side of M. de Laplace, whom he had replaced in 1783, as adjunct
member of the Academy of Sciences, when the illustrious author of the Jléchan-
ique Céleste became an associate member. Thus, at an interval of 29 years, and
under circumstances assuredly very different, no one was found in France who,
by his scientific merit, could more naturally be called than M. Legendre to
replace M: de Laplace or M. de Lagrange. ‘That he owed to his merit alone a
choice so honorable for himself and those who made it, may be gathered from
a slight anecdote which is related of him. Having, from the creation of the
legion of honor, been inscribed in the number of its chevaliers, though he failed
not to record this testimony to his merit in the title-page of his works, his
natural modesty, we are told, long prevented him from attaching the red riband
to his button-hole. M. Legendre continued, moreover, as has been already said,
to form part of the commission of weights and measures as long as it existed,
and more than once was a member of other commissions charged with objects of
importance.

Yet independently of these numerous occupations and varied labors, all
impressed with a peculiar character of vigor and precision, by which he bore a
large part in the scientific movement of his epoch, M. Legendre had besides cer-
tain household gods, to which he sacrificed with ever renewed pleasure in the
silence of his closet. I mean the theory of numbers and the elliptical functions.
To these he consecrated, during the latter 50 years of his life, all the leisure left
him by his daily oceupations and more conspicuous labors. He has thus reared
two monuments which, by their extent, represent, no doubt, the better part of
his time, and which, though having had few readers and capable of having but
very few judges, will prove, perhaps, in the eye of posterity, two of his princi-
pal titles to renown.

The Theory of numbers appeared in 1830, in two quarto volumes, after being
preceded at divers intervals by preliminary publications. M. Legendre says, in
the advertisement :

The work having received all the improvements which the author has been able to bestow
upon it, as well through his own labors as those of other geometers of which he could avail

himself, it has been thought proper to give it definitively the title of Theory of numbers, in
place of that of an Essay on the subject which it has heretofore borne.

The Essay on the theory of numbers had passed through two editions, one in
1798, the other in 1808; this last had been followed by two supplements. The

Essay had itself been preceded by a considerable work published in the Memoirs
of the Academy for 1785, and entitled Recherches d@’analyse indéterminée ; which
relates principally to the study of the properties of numbers. In fine, we learn
from the manuscript proceedings of the Academy, before cited, that, among the
memoirs which M. de Laplace, in the session of March 15, 1783, indicated as
having been presented by M. Legendre, occur two memoirs on the resolution of
indeterminate equations of the second degree and on the properties of continual
fractions, and a memoir on the summation of these fractions. Now, from the
objects of which they treat, and indeed from the titles alone, these memoirs bear
a very natural relation to certain paragraphs of the great memoir of 1785.
They were probably the first rudiments of it. Hence we see that M. Legendre
had been occupied with the theory of numbers from his youth. He had labored
upon it for more than 50 years. Yet he concludes the advertisement of the
Theory of numbers, dated April 1, 1830, with the following words, which are
certainly modest enough :

We shall not pretend that certain matters treated of in this work do not need to be improved
or even rectified by new researches. Nevertheless, the author has thought that it would be
better to leave them in this state of imperfection than to suppress them altogether ; ; they will
offer a subject of investigation to those who may be disposed in the future to occupy them-
selves with the advancement of the science.

This part of the science has received in effect, since the publication of the
Theory of numbers, important accessions ; but if we compare the contents of this
learned work with what had been discovered during the 2,000 years which
preceded 1785, we shall see that no savant has marked his passage in this
branch of mathematics by traces in any degree comparable to these efforts of
M. Legendre. It cannot surprise us that a science which had advanced with but
slow and progressive steps under the hands of men as eminent as Euclid and
Diophantes among the ancients, as Viete, Bachet, Fermat, Euler, and Lagrange
among the moderns, should not all at once have been carried to a point which
comported with no further progress. It behooves us, on the contrary, candidly
to avow that M. Legendre, in speaking of new developments which still awaited

it, gave proof of perspicuity almost as much as of modesty.

The science of numbers is difficult, and it is above all difficult to convey an
idea of it to persons whose attention has never been occupied with it. Every
one knows that numbers are distinguished into two great classes: even and odd
numbers, which alternately succeed one another. 'The even numbers are divisible
by 2 , while the odd numbers are not, though they have often other divisors.
Whole numbers differ much from one another in the possibility of being divided
by other and smaller integers. It has been long ago remarked that the number
10, the basis of our decimal system, has but two divisors, 2 and 5, the last of
which is not subdivisible, while the number § has two divisors, 2 and 4, of which
the last is further subdivisible by 2, and the number 12 has three divisors, 2,

3, and 4, the last of which is again subdivisible by 2; whence it follows that
the numbef 8 and especially the number 12 have, as the basis of a system of
measures susceptible of being successively subdivided, an incontestable supe-
riority over the number 10. ‘This inferiority of the latter number is one of the
obstacles to the general adoption of the deciinal system of weights and measures,
which presents in other respects such great advantages.

But the number 10 is more favored in this regs ard than the number 9 , divisible
only by 3, of which it is the square. It is still more so than the numbers 3 BL 0%
7, 11, 18, 17, which have no divisors, or, to speak the language of science, have
no other dinisiors but themselves saad unity. Number 7, w hich enumerates the
seven days of the week, the seven w onders of the world, the seven sages of
Greece, passes for possessing a certain degree of excellence ; but number 13, a
well as 17, is looked upon as inauspicious, by reason, it may be, of this abaeten
of ears. which renders both numbers refractory. All thoge numbers which
have no other divisors but themselves and unity, are called prime numbers.
150 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

There are prime numbers of all magnitudes; but when the numbers are some-
what great it is not easy to discover immediately whether they are prime or not.
The prime numbers are distributed among the odd numbers with an apparent
irregularity which is yet subject to certain laws. 'The search for them, the deter-
mination of the quantities of them which exist in a given interval of the numeric
scale, form one of the objects of the theory of numbers.

Numbers may be ranged by series in each of which may be remarked the con-
stant existence of certain properties ; such are the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10,
15, &e., each expressing a number of units which may be arranged triangularly ;
the quadratic numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which in the same way correspond to the
square; polygonal numbers, pyramidal, &c.; and these series give rise to com-
binations more or less curious. Certainnumbers are the squares of other smaller
ones, as 4 the square of 2, 9 of 3, &c.; others, as 8, 13, 18, are the sum of two
squares; others again, like 17 for example, are the sum of three squares. Lagrange
and Evler have proved that there is no number which is not the sum of four or
of a less number of squares.*

These properties and many others are at once remarked in examples taken
among numbers of little amount, and it becomes a matter of curiosity to follow
them among the larger numbers in order to learn whether they are general or
not. Hence proceed researches which are often very difficult and provoke a
lively interest. The final conclusion evades detection so much the longer from
the circumstance that frequently there exists, as yet, in science no rule for seek-
ing it; it is a prey which for a long time eludes the pursuit of the hunter. Again,
there are certain properties of numbers which come to light unexpectedly in their
combinations, and which, presenting something enigmatical and surprising, have
been often held to pertain to the mysterious. Hence the virtues which necro-
mancers have pretended that they detected in cabalistic numbers ; virtues which
are to the theory of numbers not unlike what astrology is to astronomy.

“Tt would seem (remarks M. Legendre) that Euler had a peculiar taste for
the science of numbers, and that he gave himself up to this kind of research
with a sort of passion, as happens (he adds) to almost all those who are occupied
with it ;” and it is clear that M. Legendre himself formed no exception to this
remark.

The first researches of M. Legendre on numbers, contained in his distinguished
memoir of 1785, constituted a direct sequel to those of Euler and Lagrange which
they extended and developed in several important particulars ; but M. Leg endre
embodied also in this work many discoveries entirely new, and particularly the
theorem of reciprocity, known likewise under the name of the law of Legendre,
one of the most fertile laws of the theory of numbers.

This theorem, more readily expressed in algebraic than ordinary language,?

represent, one the remainder m-,— the other the remainder n a divided by m. At

the same time it has been proved that’ one and the other remainder can never be other than
+1 and—J1. This being so, there exists such a relation between the two remainders

(7) and (= ) that one being known, the other is immediately determined. The following

is the general theorem which contains this relation :

consists in this: two prime numbers i and » being given, if m be raised to the
power 2 minus 1 divided by 2 and the result be facet by n, then 2 to the
power m minus 1 divided by 2, and the result be divided by m, the remainders
of the two divisions, which are always capable of being expressed by plus 1 or
minus 1, will both be of the same sign, or else of the “contrary sign, in certain
qe mnatere cases; a result which has found and continues to find numerous
applications in researches relating to the properties of numbers.

M. Legendre, in reproducing, in successive editions of the Theory of Numbers,
the demonstration of this theorem as he had given it in 1785, discovered that in a
determinate case it presents a lacuna, without “the theorem itself having been ever
found in default. M. Gauss, who, by his Disquisitiones Arithmetice, published
in 1801, had placed himself in the first rank of the savants who have dealt
with the theory of numbers, gave a demonstration of the theorem of reciprocity
which left nothing further to be desired. M. Legendre reproduced this demon-
stration in his Theory of Numbers in 1830, observing that it is the more remark-
able as resting on the most elementary principles, and at the same time gave
another yet more simple, proposed by M. Jacobi. Still later, M. Lionville and
other eminent geometers have given other demonstrations of the same law. The
exactness of the law of Legendre is therefore more than sufficiently demonstrated ;
but here the inventor has left to those who have followed him the privilege of

completing his discovery.

This circumstance recalls, somewhat remotely, the fate of the remarkable
theorems on numbers which Fermat left without demonstration; all, with the
exception of a single one, have been demonstrated within a centur 'y and a half
after the death of their author, by Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre; this one, the
last theorem of Fermat, without having ever been found in default, still awaits
a demonstration, though the Academy has, in late years, several times proposed
it as the subject of a prize to the emulation of geometers.

But if M. Legendre took delight, like Kuler, in the combinations, so arduous
in appearance, of the theory of numbers, like Euler, he excelled also in the
research of the integrals of differential quantities, a research which is itself not
directed by any certain rule, and in which the inquirer is conducted to the result
only by a certain intuitive prevision of the combinations and reductions which
will be available in the formulas and figures. 'The finest integrals appear often
to have been found by hazard; but these are hazards, as M. Legendre said in
speaking of Euler, which never occur to any but those who know how to create
them. ‘his remar k, insufficient doubtless to make us comprehend how a differ-
ential expression is integrated, will enable us perhaps to conceive how the mind
may be stimulated to this pursuit, as to that of the properties of numbers, and
how these two kinds of research, which seem to call into play analogous facul-
ties, were the two dominant passions of Euler and Legendre.

A differential quantity given by a problem of geometry, mechanies, or physics,
does not always correspond to an analytic expression existing in the science, and,
in order not to leave certain problems ‘without solution, it becomes an object to
enrich analysis with new functions. After having exhausted expressions purely
algebraic, we succeed in integrating a great number of differentials by means of
ares of the circle and of logarithms which are the most simple of transcendent
quantities; but, in order to yextend still further the applications of the integral
calculus, it was necessary to have recourse to transcendents of a more composite
order,

Euler thought that instead of being limited to the circle, other curves of the
second degree, especially the ellipsis and hyperbola, might be considered, and that

tables ar alogous to the tables of logarithms and to those of circular functions
might be drawn up in reference to them. By one of those happy combinations,
which seem almost fortuitous, he found under a purely algebraic form the com-
plete integral of a differential equation composed of two separate but similar
152 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

A
terms, each of which is only integrable by ares of conic sections. This important
discovery led the illustrious geometer to compare, in a manner more general than
had been done before, not only the ares of the same ellipsis or the same hyper-
bola, but in general all the transcendents of which the differential approximates
to those of these two curves, in presenting, like them, a rational algebraic fune-
tion of the variable divided by the square Toot of an algebraic polynomis of the
fourth degree.* One of the results of this comparison was, that the integration
by arcs of the hyperbola may always be reduced to integration by ares of the
ellipsis.

From this time Euler foresaw that by means of a suitable notation the cal-
culation of arcs of the ellipsis and other analogous transcendents might become
of almost as general use as that of ares of the circle and of logarithms ; but, with
the exception of the English geometer Landen, who demonstrated, in a memoir
of 1775, that every arc of the hyperbola is immediately rectified by means of two
arcs of the ellipsis, t no one but M. Legendre recognized the importance of real-
izing the previsionof Euler; and it may be said that our learned colleague alone
occupied himself with this subject from the year 1786, when he published his
first researches on integrations by ares of the ellipsis, until the year 1825, when
his Treatise of Ellip ‘ie Functions appeared.

Ares of the ellipsis, being after ares of the circle and logarithms one of the
most simple transcendents, might become in some sort a new instrument of cal-
culation, if we were once familiarized with their properties and possessed ready
means of calculating them with precision. M. Legendre applied himself to this
important subject in two memoirs inserted in the velume of the Academy of
Sciences for 1786. In both of them the author demonstrates, by means pecu-
liar to himself, that the rectification of the hyberbola depends on that of the
ellipsis and presents no special transcendent, and in the second he shows that in
an infinite series of ellipses formed after the same law we can reduce the rectifica-
tion of one of these ellipses to that of two others taken at choice in the same
series. ‘This, he says with characteristic modesty, is one step more in a difficult
path.

In the first memoir M. Legendre gives convergent series adapted for the easy
calculation of the length of an are of an ellipsis, whether in the case in which
the elipsis but slightly eccentric approximates to a circle, or in that when,
greatly elongated, it recedes but little from its greater axis; and in the second
he adds:

If the zeal of calculators could furnish us with tables of arcs of the ellipsist for different
degrees of amplitude and eccentricity, and each arc were accompanied by the coefficient of
its partial difference, we should have the means of integrating by these tables a very large
number of differentials, and especially all those w hich MM. d’Alembert and Euler have
referred to the ares of conic sections.

M. Legendre had then attained the age of 34 years; he knew not that it
would be permitted him to labor till that of 80 years, and that unassisted he
would himself accomplish the task of which he here traces the programme.

In the course of these two memoirs, and particularly towards the end of the
second, he indulges himself in a just tribute of praise to the learned geometers
(Euler, Landen, and Fagnani) who, before himself, had demonstrated, in a differ-

*R being a radical of the form in question and P a rational algebraic function, all these

ent manner, a part of the theorems with which they are filled to profusion.*
But, in the publications of 1786, remarkable as they were, these rich materials
hardly yet formed a completed edifice, and M. Legendre was not long in_per-
ceiving ‘that this subject, and in general the theory ‘of transcendents whose differ-
ential enters into the form above indicated, required to be treated in a manner
more methodical and thorough. 'This he undertook to do in a Memoire sur les
transcendentes elliptiques, read by him to the Academy of Sciences in April,
1792, and published towards the end of 1793, in which he proposed to compare
among themselves all the transcendents in question, to class them according to
their different kinds, to reduce each of them to the most simple form of which
it is susceptible, to estimate their value by approximations the most prompt and
facile; and, in fine, to form from the collective theory a sort of algorithm which
should serve to extend the domain of analysis.t

Taking, in its most general algebraic form, the differential already indicated
as a point ‘of departure for this kind of researches , he analyzes it with extraor-
dinary address, lays aside all the parts which are integrable, whether by ares of
the circle or logarithms, and thus reduces it to its quintessence ; that is to say,
to the parts whose integrals are transcendents of a superior order. ‘Then, trans-
forming this remainder by means of circular functions, he reduces it to a form
of wonderful simplicity, containing but five quantities :{ an are of the circle
designated by the name of amplitude, null at the point where the integral com-
mences, and developing itself in proportion as that is extended; a modulus
always real and smaller than the unit, which, in the case when an ellipsis is in
question, represents its eccentricity ; a parameter of any magnitude, positive or
negative, capable of being reduced to zero, but to which it would be useless to
attribute imaginary values; lastly, two coefficients whose values, independent
of all the rest, may be anything, provided they be not null simultaneously.
The amplitude is the variable in Yelation to which the integration is made; it
is null only at the point of departure from the integral. ‘The modulus cannot
be null without the expression being completely altered in its nature, but the
three other quantities may be null independently of one another, or fulfil in
their relations of magnitude certain conditions according to which elliptic tran-
scendents are divided into three classes.

The second class is the only one which represents ares of the ellipsis. The
first class is a transcendent more simple than ares of the ellipsis; it may itself
be expressed by means of such arcs, but an are of the ellipsis cannot be
expressed by transcendents of this first class. The third class, on the contrary,
the only one in which the parameter is not null, is more composite than arcs of
the ellipsis.

The gradation which exists in the complexity of these three classes of tran-
scendents is manifested especially by this circumstance, that transcendents of
the first species may be joined with one another, by addition and subtraction,
so as to form a sum constantly null. Transcendents of the second species may
unite in like manner, so as to form a sum whose value is expressed in terms

* **T shall not conclude this article,’ (XVI of the memoir, ) says M. Legendre, ‘‘ without
giving notice that the greater part of the propositions contained therein have been discovered
by M. Euler, and published in the 7th volume of the Nouveaux Mémoires de Petersbourg
and in some other works, a fact of which I was ignorant when I was engaged in these
researches. But the difference of the methods may ‘throw new light on this subject, and
moreover the comparison of the ares of different ellipses, which is discussed in article XIII,
has not, as far as I am aware, been before treated of by any one.””—Mem. l’ Acad. des Scien-
ces, 1786, p- 676.

purely algebraic, like the celebrated integral of Euler, before referred to.
Lastly, transcendents of the third species may also be united to form a sum of
which the v value, without being null or even algebraic, is notwithstanding of a
more simple né ture than each of the former in itself; for it may be expressed
by arcs of the circle and logarithms, which are the most simple of transcendents.

These differences, and several others which exist between the three species of
elliptical transcendents, suffice to vindicate the division established by M. Legen-
dre; but, at. the same time, they do not prevent our perceiving a profound anal-
ogy between all these transcendents which justifies their union under the same
denomination. ‘The first and second species may be expressed by ares of the
ellipsis; the third is the most compounded, but it has so much analogy with the
two others that all three may be regarded as forming but one and the same
order of transcendents, the first after ares of the circle and logarithms. As M.
Legendre elsewhere s say s, ‘the denomination of elliptic function i is improper in
some respects; but we nevertheless adopt it on account of the great analogy
which exists between the properties of this function and those of ares of the
ellipsis.”

M. Legendre resumed these questions with several others in a great work in
three quarto volumes, which he published in 1811, 1816, and 1817, under the
title of Lxercises de calcul intégral sur divers orders de transcendantes et sur
les quadratures. In this work, part of which was devoted to two classes of
definite integrals, to which the author has given the name of intégrales eulé-
riennes, he occupied himself also with a great number of questions about the inte-
gral calculus, into the details of which it would be difficult here to enter; but the
most extensive and in his eyes the most important part was that w hich treats of
elliptic functions, of their application to different problems of geometry and
mechanics, and the tables u.ecessary for the use of those functions. J inally, in
1825 and 1826, he combined anew all his results, with the developments and
improvements which incessant labor had enabled him to supply, in a work
entitled Theorie des fonctions elliptiques. ‘This first appeared in two volumes,
followed at a later period by three supplements, which constitute the third and
last volume.

Among the improvements which M. Legendre bestuwed on his previous labors
when he “published them anew in 1825, one of the principal was the discovery
of a second scale of modules, different from that which alone was known at the
time of the publication of the exercises on the integral caleulus. ‘ This second
scale,” as he remarks in the 31st chapter of the first volume, ‘completed in
many respects the labors of the author upon this theory; it afforded an easy
method of arriving at many striking results of analysis which till then it had
been impracticable to demonstrate except by very laborious integrations. By
the combination of the two scales the transformations of functions of the first
species could be prodigiously multiplied; this the author has made evident by
constructing a sort of tessellated table (damier) infinite in its two dimensions,
all the divisions of which might be filled by the different transformations of
which one and the same function is susceptible.”

The development of the properties and uses of elliptical functions, consid-
ered with this generality, composed the whole first volume of the publication of
1825. The second was devoted, in part, to tables intended to facilitate the
conversion of the integrals obtained into numerals. Calculated by the author
himself with the greatest precision, these tables constituted in themselves an
immense labor. “ “By means of them,” said M. Legendre, “the theory of elliptical
functions, enlarged and nearly completed by many successive labors, might be
applied with almost as much’ facility as those of circular and log arithmic fune-
tions, answerably to the wishes and hopes of Euler.”

After the developments which the theory of elliptical functions had received
by the discovery of the second scale of modules, further progress seemed scarcely

probable; but the feeundity of the methods created by M. Legendre was such
that results which he had hardly ventured to anticipate were very soon realized,
and I abridge, in transcribing, the terms in which he speaks of this event in the
advertisement of the third volume :

A young geometer, M. Jacobi, of Koenigsberg, who could have had no knowledge of
the treatise of elliptical functions, had succeeded, by his own efforts, in discovering not only the
second scale of which we have been speaking, which is relevant to the number 3, but a third
which is relevant to the number 5, and he had already acquired the certainty that there must
exist a similar one for every odd number proposed. * * * This theorem being established
for every odd number, it was easy thence to conclude that for every integer or simply rational
number may be formed a particular scale of modules, which will give rise to an infinitude
of transformations of any one function of the first species, which transformations will be all
determinable algebraically. * * * The hopes inspired by the first successes of M. Jacobi
have been since justified by new publications. * * * It remains for me (says M.
Legendre in continuation) to speak of the admirable researches on the same subject which
M. Abel, a rival worthy of M. Jacobi, has published nearly at the same time. The first
memoir of M. Abel forms in itself an almost complete theory of elliptical functions considered
under the most general point of view. * * * A second memoir of his presents very
remarkable results: First, on the division of the particular function of which the modulas is
sin. 45°, and which represents ares of the lemniscate; secondly, on the general transformation
of functions of the first species, by which, says the author, we are enabled to demonstrate,
in a very simple and direct manner, the two general theorems previously published or
announced by M. Jacobi.

We shall not enter into other details (says M. Legendre in conclusion) respecting the
labors of these two young geometers, whose talents have dawned upon the learned world
with so much brilliancy. It will readily be conceived that the author of the present treatise
would be prompted to hail with cordial applause discoveries so greatly promoting that
branch of analysis of which he may claim to be insome sort the founder. Hence has originated
the design of enriching his own work with a part of these new discoveries, while presenting
them under a point of view at once the most simple and most conformed to his own ideas.
Such is the object of the two supplements which follow, aud of those which, in the sequel,
he may unite with them in order to form the third volume of his treatise.

Rarely has such sincere and emphatic recognition been extended to disciples
worthy from the outset of being counted as rivals; but M. Legendre still further
enhanced this recognition by the unaffected and spontaneous warmth with which
the paternal tenderness naturally felt for a theory created by himself, and developed
during more than 40 years by his single efforts, wasreflected on his young competitors.
Persons who, at that epoch, attended the sessions of the Academy will not have
forgotten the artless effusion of feeling with which M. Legendre hastened to
communicate to his colleagues the first letters received on a subject so interesting
for science and for himself. It might be said that the elliptic functions did no
less honor to the nobility of his sentiments than the profundity of his genius.

These first impressions were not modified by subsequent reflection, and M.
Legendre concludes with the following paragraph the third supplement to the
Theorie des fonctions elliptiques, by which that vast labor is closed :

We shail here terminate the additions which we have proposed to make to our work by
taking advantage of the recent discoveries of MM. Abel and Jacobi in the theory of elliptical
functions. It will be remarked that the most important of these additions consists in the
new branch of analysis which we have deduced from the theorem of M. Abel, and which
had remained until now wholly unknown to geometers. This branch of analysis to which
we have given the name of theory of ultra-elliptic functions is infinitely more extended than
that of elliptical functions, with which it has very intimate relations; it is composed of an
indefinite number of classes, each of which is divided into three species like the elliptic
functions, and which have besides a great numberof properties. We have been able to
enter but partially into this subject ; but that it will be progressively enriched by the labors
of geometers can hardly be doubted, and as little that it will eventually prove one of the
most efficient parts of the analysis of transcendents.

These lines, dated March 4, 1832, may be regarded as in some sort the scien-
tific testament of M. Legendre, who died within a year thereafter. M. Abel, in
whom he reposed such high hopes, had descended to the tomb several years
before him; M. Jacobi followed in 1849; but the anticipations of M. Legendre
have not the less been realized, as well by the labors of M. Jacobi himself as
by those of our learned colleagues, MM. Liouville and Hermite, and other distin-
guished geometers.
156 MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE.

I might still further speak of important labors published by M. Legendre on
the integrals, styled by him eulerian, from the name of Euler, who “had first
occupied himself with them, labors whieh occupy a large space in his exercises
on the integral calculus, and which he partially introduced, while he improved
on them, in the second volume of his theory of elliptical functions. I might also
show how, parallel with the employment of elliptic transcendents, he opened the
way to the numerical realization of a vast class of integrals by the tables which
he has given for calculating the new transcendent, designated by him under the
name of the function grand gamma ; but although M. Binet has shown that the
labors accessory to those which M. Legendre has given to the public on these
subjects alone, would constitute no inconsiderable title for a distinguished
geometer, I should fear to weary the attention of my auditors by dw elling at
ereater length on topics of this nature.

Like Euler, his model, and like many other great geometers who preceded
hin, M. Legendre prosecuted his labors to the last without having to regret any
enfeeblement of his faculties; ; the volume of our memoirs, which immediately
preceded his death, contains one of his studies upon a difficult question of the
theory of numbers. He was then 80 years of age.

So vigorous an organization could scarcely be broken up without great suffer-
ing. The malady which terminated the life of our colleague was long and
painful, but he endured it with firmness, without indulging any illusion as ‘to its
fatal issue, and with a resignation which, as was said by M. Poisson at his grave,
must have been rendered difficult by the happiness of his home, the tenderness
and fond solicitude which there surrounded him. Always characterized by a
spirit of self-renunciation, he had often expressed the wish that in speaking of him no
mention should be made except of his labors; but the same silence is not ee
on us as regards the noble actions which the faithful companion of his life, the
depositary of his thoughts and purposes, continued to perform in his name after
his death.

M. Legendre had not forgotten what, in his youth, he had owed to the leaned
and estimable men who had divined and fostered his talents. Madame Legendre
continued to testify the interest which her husband had exhibited towards pupils
of the Polytechnic school, who happened to be scantily endowed with the gifts
of fortune, and paid in succession the charges of several of them. Having
become possessor of the last editions of those works which M. Legendre had
printed at his own expense, she distributed them liberally, in order that they
might more promptly subserve the advancement of science; and the year before
her decease she presented, through the Bureau of public instruction, 40 copies
of the Theory of elliptical functions to the principal libraries of Trance, a
donation for which thanks were addressed to her by the worthy minister M.
Fortoul, in the name of the state. At her own death, in 1856, she devised to
the commune of Auteuil, for a vicarage and school, the country house in which
she had last lived with M. Legendre.

Full of devotion and admiration for the memory of one whose name it had
been her happiness and pride to bear for 64 years, she preserved to her last day
an unaffected and religious respect for all’ that had pertained to hin. The
survivor of M. Legendre for 25 years, she died at a somewhat more advanced
age than he, from the effects of a long and cruel malady, against which she

f=)
exerted the force and resignation of which he had given her the noble ex cumple.

She had lost all her family, allied to that of our Coleprated painter Robert Lefévre,
and having never had children, she expired at the age of 82, surrounded by the
pious care “of persons whom the graces of her mind ‘and her ‘constant ae
habitually assembled around her , and who have preserved for her memory
filial attachment. With her, completely disappeared a name in which France
will never cease to pride itself.

Lagreange was the reformer of analysis. By rendering more evident some of
MEMOIR OF LEGENDRE. 157

the bases of that science, he has conferred upon it greater force, at the same time
that by his immortal discoveries he has extended its domain. One of our greatest
geometers has dwelt with admiration on the perfection of his analytical style.*
Clear and smooth as the verses of Racine, the formulas of Lagrange have aug-
mented the number of the adepts of science, while they have facilitated their
labors. Laplace, in applying to the laws of the universe the faculties of a
geometer of the first order, advances a claim to be considered as the lawgiver
of the celestial movements. By his vast acquisitions in the empire of nature, he
has earned a title to be styled the Newton of France.t Legendre, more pro-
found than popular, was our Euler; like Euler and after his example, he has
bequeathed to the future a multitude of those analytical results which genius
alone knows how to obtain, and which enrich in perpetuity the domain of the
human intellect.

Clairault, @ Alembert, Euler were the continuers of Newton and Leibnitz.
After them, Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre have held with a grasp not less finn
the sceptre of mathematics. The Academy may be congratulated that it has
counted in its ranks and can still count at the present day more than one suc-
cessor of these great men.

*In his Eloge of Laplace, pronounced June 15, 1829, before the Academy, where M.
Legendre still occupied a seat, M. Fourier took occasion to make some interesting remarks
on the discoveries of Lagrange and the character of his works. The following words occur:
** All his mathematical compositions are remarkable for a singular elegance, for the sym-
metry of forms and the generality of methods, and, if we may so say, for the perfection of
the analytic style.” (Mém. de l’ Acad. des Sciences, t. x, p. 6, 1830.)

t It was M. Cuvier who, in one of his academic discourses, conferred on him this proud
qualification.
MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

By HIs son, F. A. PELTIER.

[TRANSLATED FOR '1HE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY M. L. WOOD.]

[The following sketch of the life and labors of Peltier by his son, though
perhaps warmly colored by filial partiality, scarcely does justice to his character.
He possessed in an eminent degree the mental characteristies necessary for a suc-
cessful scientific discoverer; an imagination always active in suggesting hypo-
theses for the explanation of the phenomena under investigation, and a logical
faculty never at fault in deducing consequences from the suggestions best ealew
lated to bring them to the test of experience; an invention ever fertile in devis-
ing apparatus and other means by which the test could be applied ; and, finally,
a moral constitution which sought only the discovery of truth, and could alone
be satisfied with its attainment. Deprived in early life of the means of mental
culture, and not commencing the study of physical science until after the age of
40, it is not surprising that he should have in some cases presented to the world
the results of his investigations in a form little favorable to their proper appre-
ciation; or that, considering his antecedents, the savants of France should not
have conceded to him at first the honors to which he was justly entitled. Accord-
ing to Bacon, foreign countries like future times are the dispensers of justice ;
and this is verified in the case of Peltier, whose labors were more highly prized
in Brussels than in Paris, and whose more important contributions to science are
found not among the memoirs of the Imperial Academy of France, but among
those of the Royal Academy of Belgium.—J. H.]

Jean Charles Athanase Peltier was born at Ham, in the department of
Somme, the 22d of February, 1785. His parents were poor, his father follow-
ing the trade of shoemaker in the town of Ham; but if they were but poorly
favored by fortune, they were well endowed by. nature; the father of Peltier
being a man of firmness and capacity, and his mother an active and industrious
woman.

Peltier inherited the qualities of his parents, evincing at an early age a quick
intelligence, great perseverance of character, a remarkable spirit of order, and,
above ay a love of labor which unfortunately led him to overtask his powers
and consigned him, at a later period, to a premature grave.

He was first sent to school to the schoolmaster of the place, who most proba-
bly only taught him to read and write, he himself not knowing much beyond
that. dle was afterwards placed under the care of a vicar, who took him for a
chorist, taught him French, a little arithmetic, and even a commencement of
Latin.

From this time Peltier evinced a very decided taste for mechanics. At the
age of ten years he took a clock to pieces, cleaned it, and put it together again.
At this period also, he gave evidence of that spirit of observation which never
left him. One evening he was on the promenade of the town, earnestly regard-
ing the heavens; sev eral shooting stars appearing, he followed them with his
eyes with intense interest, not doubting even then that some day he should
have occasion to occupy himself with them more seriously.

From the predilections his son had shown, the father of Peltier decided to
have him taught the trade of clockmaking; to which end he placed him in
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 159

apprenticeship to a German named Brown, who had been taken prisoner at the
time of the first campaigns of the republic, and had subsequently established
himself at Saint Quentin. In character he was brutal and passionate, and the
young apprentice had much to suffer from his ernel treatment. This natural
violence of character too was much increased by the condition of the political
world at that time; for Brown, loving his own -country to fanaticism, most
keenly desired the success of the Austrian arms. This was in 1800; the
moment of the glorious campaign of Moreau into Germany, and the second con-
quest of Italy ; and the year of Marengo and Hohemlinden: Every day that
the paper brought news of av ictory—and at that time this was of frequent oceur-
rence—there was redoubled bad treatment and vexation for Peltier. Nor was
this all: Brown, who himself had no fondness for study, refused to his appren-
tice this privilege, and this was an additional means of tormenting him. For
some little time Peltier, the day’s work being done, would read in his chamber
by the light of the candle furnished him ; but Brow n, discovering this, forbade
the use of one. By the strictest economy he now procured the coveted hight
from his own scanty means, and continued to read at night; but this also was
prohibited. F orced to yield, Peltier at length w atched for the nights when the
moon shone clear, and opening his window ‘softly, would thus read a few pages
by stealth. This, too, Brown managed to prevent. Apprised of these facts
Peltier’s father withdrew his son from this uncongenial domicile and succeeded
shortly afterwards in dissolving the connection.

Peltier had been two years in Saint Quentin. On leaving this place he went
to Paris, where he became apprentice to a clockmaker by name of Métra, who
himself worked for the celebrated Bréquet. ‘This was at the close of 1802.

The father of Peltier, who had never been to Paris and had no idea of the
expense of living there, only allowed his son one frane a day for his support.
With this pitiful sum the poor boy was to provide himself with board and lodging.
Compelled to suffer many privations, Peltier appealed several times to his father ;
but he, judging Paris by his own little town, imagined the increase of allow ance
demanded by lis son to be meant solely for indule ence in pleasure, and refused.
Peltier very soon became seriously ill; and, hurt at the want of confidence
manifested by his father, forbade his friends to write to him, resolving to aban-
don himself to his illness and to die without informing his parents of his condi-
tion. J*ertunately his friends took no notice of his “prohibition, and Wrote to
his father, who came in tears to find his son and carry him back to his native
country, where he soon recovered.

On his return to Paris, Peltier set himself to work at clockmaking with more
ardor than ever. At the close of 1803, however, he was for a while diverted
from his peaceful occupations by other and entirely new ideas.

The peace of Amiens had lasted but a short while, and war with England
had been speedily rekindled ; a universal enthusiasm reigned throughout France ;
departments, cities, corporations, all vied with each other in offering ships,
frigates, and even boats for the public service.

Peltier could offer nothing, being without means, but he cozld give his life,
and he resolved to enter the navy. Not wishing, however, to engage as a com-
mon sailor, he worked incessantly i in the hope of being received into the naval
school at Brest. Nor was this all; for, not content with his own intentions
towards his country, he recruited three of his comrades and bound them to join
the army with himself, For a while all went smoothly ; but as the fatal hour
approached, the courage of the three comrades waned; and when the decisive
moment arrived, Peltier found himself successively abandoned by his proposed
companions, and left to execute his designs alone; this he w ould certainly have
done but for a circumstance which he had not foreseen. In order to enter the
naval school at Brest, it was necessary to obtain the consent of his parents ;
and he had already written them on this subject. His mother, learning his
160 MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

design with the deepest grief, made many efforts to dissuade him from his pur-
pose ; but in vain. When, however, at last, she received the news that all was
in readiness for his departure, and that he only awaited their consent, she was
seized with a despair that rendered her seriously ill; and the father of Peltier,
communicating to the son his mother’s condition, terminated his letter thus:
“If you persist, I will send you my consent, but it will kill your mother; and
remember that you will have but yourself to reproach for her death.” The
alternative, thus put, admitted evidently but of one solution, and Peltier
renounced his design.

Released from the ideas which had for a while so entirely occupied him, Pel-
tier set himself again to work, and it was not long before Bréquet, discerning
his talent, attached him directly to himself as a ; workman, and shortly after
intrusted him with the most difficult part of horology—the construction of chro-
nometers.

After remaining about two years with Bréquet, Peltier left him with the inten-
tion of establishing himself in business. For a while, however, he was on the
point of uniting himself to Berthoud, who offered him very advantageous con-
ditions ; first, a very good salary; second, that at the end of six years he
should be associated with himself in the manufacture of marine watches. ‘This
offer certainly merited reflection. After some hesitation Peltier finally refused ;
he would have been obliged to engage for six years, and live in Argenteuil at
a period when communication was not as prompt nor easy as it is to-day.  Pel-
tier preferred his liberty ; and, establishing himself in 1806, was shortly after
married to Mademoiselle Dufant. For nine years he remained honorably
engaged in trade; retiring from business in 1815, on the death of his mother-
in-law.

Madame Dufant left him master of a very moderate fortune, the proceeds of
which were considerably restricted by the disturbed condition of affairs; but
Peltier, having no expensive tastes to gratify, remained contented with it, that

he might from that time give himself up entirely to his natural inclination for
study ; besides which, energy and method produced by degrees their natural
fruits ; so that towards the close of his life he was possessed of a competency,
which permitted him to oceupy himself exclusively with his scientific labors.
The activity of Peltier’s mind prevented him from restricting himself to the
narrow limits of his trade; and always while studying and working at horology
he was occupied first with one thing and then another, as the taste or inclination
of the moment prompted him. At the time of which we speak, literature and
literary persons were held in high regard in the empire; and Peltier’s age
inclining him to such pursuits, he devoted himself exclusively to books. He
read, wrote or dictated constantly; reading while eating or walking; and
even in the evening, when at work on his bench, listening to his wife who read
aloud. It is thus that he read Voltaire, R: onsseau, Buffon, the Correspondence
of Grimm, and the geography of Malte- Brun; in short, everything that he
could borrow, the scantiness of his fortune not permitting him to indulge i in the
purchase of books. He not only read, but composed. While still a journey-
man, he wrote a melodrama. Later he applied himself to the study of poetry,
and has left a comedy in verse completely finished, and has even ‘published a
criticism on the comedy of the Deux Gendres of Etienne. It was generally in
putting together his clocks that he composed. Leaving his house, paper and
pencil in hand, he would, while walking, compose his verses, and when he had
them properly arranged in his own mind, would stop and write them. The
real bent of Peltier’s mind was rather towards the sciences and severer studies
than literature or poetry ; but he yielded for the time to the ardor of youth and
the fashion of the moment. Still we find in what he has left real imagination,
and a sprightliness throughout which is extraordinary. In general the versifi-
cation is somewhat neglected ; but this is by no means surprising, he very
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 161

often not having the time to review what he had written; but here, as else-

where, his ideas are not at fault.

Retiring from trade at the age of thirty-one, Peltier resolved to educate him-
self anew. He had doubtless read much, worked much, and exercised his mind
on a variety of subjects; but he had never pursued a regular course of study.
He determined, therefore, as the first step to make himself inaster of Latin, and
at the same time to teach it to his little son, then aged seven years, and whom
he had, since his sixth year, taught English. Wishing at the same time that
he taught the Latin to perfect the child’s English, he ‘bought several English
and Latin grammars; but what was his surprise in examining them to find that
they differed essentially from the French and Latin! This difference was the
more singular inasmuch as these grammars, both teaching the same language,
should have been entirely alike.

Peltier, not content with remarking this difference, set himself to work to
ascertain the cause, which he found to "be that both English and French confine
themselves to rules for translating their language into Latin. Now when the
Romans tanght their children the rules of Latin grammar, it was by rules deduced
from grammar in general, and not by telling them that such and such a turn of

5 . . .
phrase in French or English should be rendered in such or such manner in Latin.

Thus when we teach our children French, we do so independently of all foreign
languages.

When Peltier had once seen this defect, he resolved to write for his son a
grammar in which all the rules of the Latin language should be given in
English. It was in 1816 that he undertook this work; somewhat later he took
it up again, but in French; the change from one grammar to the other being
but a small matter, the same language, being taught i in both, and the same rules

iven. He worked at this for some t time, and made considerable progress; but
it is far from being complete.

When this work was somewhat advanced, Peltier began to write an introduc-
tion for it. Now grammar being the art of expressing one’s thoughts according
to certain rules he: discoursed, in : this introduction, of ideas , their origin and trans-
formations, thus passing from grammar to ideology. At first it was only his
intention to write an introduction, but little by little his plan enlarged, as the
constant necessity arose of mounting higher into causes in order better to explain
effects. It was first an introduction of a few pages; it very soon became an
entire work. He abandoned it several times, but always seemed irresistibly
drawn to take it up again.

It was his conviction that all the phenomena of the formation of ideas could
and should be reduced to the simple undulation of the nervous fluid. The sen-
sation composed, Ist, of the impression made on an organ, 2d, of the transmission
of this impression to the brain, 3d, of the perception effected by the brain, was
only, according to him, an angulation wrought in the nervous fluid, the starting
point of which is any given organ, the stopping point the encephalon; ea
afterwards this undulation returns from the brain to the organ impressed, i
becomes attention; when it returns from the brain to an ensemble of soars
and is designed to cause motion, it becomes will. Memory he describes as a
succession of undulations, similar in nature, and acting upon each other; while
judgment is the sensation ‘of the difference between I (moi) previously i impres ssed.
in a certain manner, and Z (moi) afterwards impressed otherwise.

It is far from my intention here to enter into any detail on this subject. Suf-
fice it to say that ideology i is one of the sciences on which he was most often
engaged, and in which he has advanced the newest and most original ideas.
Unfortunately his work on the subject is very far from being finished.

Prepositions are the most difficult parts of speech to define, and have very
much perplexed all grammarians. Expressing the relations of persons and
things to each other they form one of the most abstract points of grammar.

162 MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

We easily conceive of a noun; it is the name of a person or thing, or else the
generalization of a quality; we understand an adjective or verb; but a preposi-
tion is infinitely more difficult of conception; it is neither an object, quality, nor
act, but a relation between all these ideas; it is, in short, a something completely
intangible. Led by his ideological studies on the one hand, and his studies of
Latin grammar on the other, Peltier undertook, about the year 1820, a treatise
on Latin prepositions. To this he applied himself assiduously for several years,
and finally completed it. In 1826 he even had some thoughts of submitting <
to the press, but, led off by other studies, he soon renounced his intentions.

At the time that Peltier was studying the formation of ideas with such care,
Dr. Gall had opened his public courts in Paris, in which he expounded his theory
of the development of the brain, and the localization of the faculties. Peltier,
perceiving in an instant of what immense advantage such knowledge would be to
him, studied with assiduity the lessons of Dr. Gall, and became, and to the close
of life remained, his zealous partisan. Not that he thought the localization of
faculties as maintained by Dr. Gall incontrovertible; he had not implicit faith
in all his bumps, (to speak after the usual manner;) but he did believe sincerely
and with reason in the fundamental principle of Gall’s doctrine; that is, in the
relation which exists between the mental and moral nature on one hand, and the
development of certain parts of the encephalon on the other.

The confidence he had in the principle of this doctrine, however, did not pre-
vent him from pointing out a few errors of detail. He made several objections
to Gall himself on his cranioscopy; one, among others, having reference to the
organ of perfectibility, and another to comparative sagacity. On this subject he
wrote as follows: “I have never been able to understand how there could be
an organ of perfectibility unless it should be made the centre of all the intellec-
tual organs, which would be an entire subversion of your scientific principles.
Mathematics, metaphysics, music, having each its particular organ, perfectibility
cannot be a separate, universal quality; it can only be a greater development
of a particular organ. Neither have I been able to comprehend the organ of |
comparative sagacity. All judgment is the result of a comparison; the mathe-
matician compares and judges; so also the painter, the mechanic. Our knowl-
edge does not come but by comparing and judging. ‘The organ of comparative
sagacity, then, is one that encroaches upon the others, and that is directly opposed
to your theory of the localization of the faculties.” The reply of Gall to these
objections was far from being satisfactory.

The study of Gall’s theory had made Peltier feel the necessity of studying the
anatomy of the brain. This necessity once acknowledged, he set himself to
work; he went into the amphitheatres and dissected like a novice, although he
was at that time about 36 years of age. He did not, it is true, pursue the study
of anatomy so far as is necessary for a physician or surgeon, but he studied
enough to understand thoroughly the nervous system of man, and to have suf-
ficiently correct ideas of all his other organs. The gross dissection of the brain
and nerves showing him almost nothing of their inmost structure, Peltier endeay-
ored to study them with magnifying instruments. But man stands highest in
the scale of animal beings. Instead of studying the construction, assimilation,
and life of so complex a being, it is much more rational to study them in beings
of more simple construction. Transparent insects will perhaps let the secret of
their existence be seen. Thus Peltier was led to apply himself to microscopy.

Perfectly insatiable in his desire for knowledge, Peltier attended at the same
time the lectures of M. Flourens at the Collége de Fr ance, and the experiments
in vivisection of M. Magendie. Electricity was just rising into great favor with
physiologists; ail was attempted to be explained by it, M. Magendie made
dogs and rabbits digest by electricity ; according to M. Dumas, muscular con-
traction was but electro- dynamic; nothing seemed able to resist its power, not
even the generation of beings, the males being powerfully charged with positive
electricity, , the females consequently with negative: it was a ecneral mania.
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 163

What is electricity? Peltier had now come to the study of this science—a
study which was to occupy him exclusively during the last twenty years of his
life, and on which he has left such a profound impress of his genius; but we see
what detours he had made before arriving at this point, and what road he had
travelled.

I have entered into these details because they seemed to me to offer some
interest ; we see in them the gropings to which a vigorous mind may give itself
up before arriving at what is destined to constitute one day its study from pre-
dilection. 'The course followed by Peltier is, besides, I think, rooted in the
very nature of the human mind; it is always towards the most abstract and
complex ideas that man at first and from choice directs his studies; it is not
until later, and little, by little, that, instructed by experience, he at the same
time simplifies and restricts his researches. History bears ample testimony to
this. In the middle ages, on the revival of, letters, men were occupied but with
questions in metaphysics—the nature of the soul and its faculties—and, as if this
were not sufficiently beyond their powers, they discoursed even on the nature
of God. It was not until some time later that they consented to descend from
these heights and study the material world: first the living world, anatomy and
physiology ; and lastly the inorganic world, physics, chemistry, geology, &c.,
&c.; so true is it that associated men, or the people, take but the same course as
isolated men, or individuals.

ft was about 1825 that Peltier commenced seriously to study physics; until
that time indeed it had been to him but an accessory. In 1827 he bought in a
public market-place an old electric machine and some Leyden jars; these
were the first instruments he had at his disposal. At first he amused himself by
drawing sparks; he then formed sparkling squares and tubes, and electric jump-
ing-jacks, and many other amusing objects; a little after he tried more serious
experiments; but he very soon discovered that this road could lead to nothing.
By an electric machine, in fact, he could never have obtained other than static
electricity; and static phenomena constantly reducing themselves to phenomena
of attraction or repulsion, and to sparks, are very tar from offering the variety
and interest of dynamic phenomena. Weary of these experiments without result,
Peltier very naturally turned his attention towards another source of electricity,
the pile; it was, besides, of the Voltaic pile that physiologists made use in apply-
ing electricity to the phenomena of life. Peltier therefore very soon bought a
trough pile, with which he made his first investigations into currents. Later he
made for himself a very great number of these piles.

For several years Peltier labored without communicating to any one either his
work or his discoveries. Knowing but little of the world, he had not had oppor-
tunity to compare himself with other men, and, ignoring completely the real
worth of his intellect, did not dream that he could do anything worthy of being
known. This diffidence rendered him extremely reserved, and he worked a long
time in profound silence. His first communication to the Academy of Science
was on the 19th of July, 1830, and relates to dry electric piles. ‘The reason of
this communication was as follows: It had been generally believed for a long
time that dry piles were not capable of giving a constant current, and could not
produce any chemical reactions. In 1830 M. Donné endeavored to throw light
on this subject by new investigations. In his experiments he carried the number
of couples to 25,000 and 30,000, without, however, increasing the usual size of
the plates. He obtained thus phenomena of enormous tension, but could not
get a current which was capable of effecting the least chemical action.

At this time Peltier had already comprehended the distinction to be main-
tained between the quantity and the intensity of a current. He therefore took
up the experiments of M. Donné, but instead of increasing the number of couples,
he increased their surface, and thus succeeded in reddening to the color of turnsole,
and in decomposing water by means of a cuwrent of the dry pile. It suffices

for this that we take from 25 to 30 disks, provided only that. their surface be a
little expanded, say from one to two square decimeters. Such was the first sci-
entific communication made by Peltier to the Academy of Science: this took
place on July 19, 1830; and Peltier dying October 27, 1845, it was in this
interval of 15 years that he wrote and published the labors and discoveries of
which we shall proceed to give a rapid enumeration.

At the time that Peltier began. to devote himself to experiments in physics,
Nobili was in Paris, having come thither to illustrate his system of static needles
which he had just invented for galvanometers. Peltier was forcibly struck by
the sensibility which these instruments were rendered capable of acquiring by
this ingenious modification, and set himself immediately to work to construct
similar ones for himself, A short time afterwards M. De la Rive commenced his
publications on the theory of the pile. This illustrious savant wished to prove
that chemical action was the real cause of dynamic electricity, and endeavored
to demonstrate this by analyzing the different phenomena of the currents by
means of the galvanometer thus perfected by Nobili. Peltier thus found him-
self led, on one hand, to the thorough study of galvanometers, and on the other
to experiments on the pile and on currents. The first communication that Peltier
made to the Academy of Science bore marks of this double impulse. On July
19, 1830, he presented his note relative to dry piles; May 27, 1833, he laid
before this learned body another note on the quantity and intensity of currents ;
July 22, of this same year, he presented them with a memorandum on the same
subject; and finally, on March 10, 1834, he made known his galvanometer of
deviations proportioned to its force.

Peltier had naturally great dexterity of hand, which had been still increased
by his practice of horology ; further, he was possessed of patience sufficient for
any ordeal, never becomin: » disheartened, and never recoiling before any sacrifice
of time or ‘trouble which could lead to the desired end; and assisted besides by
the counsels of a distinguished artist, M. Gourjon, he W as enabled to give to his
galvanometers a sensibility which permitted him to study the smallest forces, and
consequently to discover phenomena of which he would never have suspected the
existence had he had at his disposal only heavy and sluggish instruments. It
was thus he discovered that, under certain determinate circumstances, a weak
electric current can produce cold. He first made known this fact to the Academy
of Sciences, April 21, 1834; later he inserted in volume 56 of the Annals of
Chemistry and Physic s a dissertation on the heat generated by electric currents.

In 1835 Peltier discovered the difference of capacity of the various metals for
each kind of electricity. During this same year he published in volume 60 of
the Annals of Chemistry and Physics a dissertation on electro-magnetic experi-
ments. Until that time it had been assumed, for simplicity and facility in theo-
retic calculations, that magnetic repulsion was a force equal and contrary to
attraction. In this dissertation Peltier proves that it is nothing, demonstrating
that repulsion is by no meansa special force like attraction, but that it is an effect
of the disagreement of opposed motions sustained in their opposition by second-
ary causes and influences.

In 1830 Peltier again turned his attention to the quantity and intensity of cur-
rents, laying before the academy, May 9th, an article on this subject; and this

same year he submitted to that leamed body the curious fact of the formation of
several individuals proceeding from a single animal that is subjected to lingering
inanition. He published in volume 62 of the Annals of Chemistry and Ph, YSics
a description of the electrometer which he had just invented, and which is cer-
tainly one of the most useful instruments with which he has enriched science ;
and he also presented to the Philomathie Society most interesting observations
on vorticelle, on the articulation of the claws of rhizopodes, on the influence of
electric currents in the vegetation and evolution of animalcula, on the peprodue
tion of arcelle, &c, Finally, this same year, recurring for the last time to the
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 165

subject of the quantity and intensity of currents, he published a resumé of his
works on this subject, in volume 63 of the Annals of Chemistry and Physics.

January 9th, 1837, Peltier presented to the Academy of Sciences a large work
containing his experimental researches into the various phenomena which concur
in producing the general result from electric piles; the 30th of the same month
he inserted a note on the dynamic electricity engendered by friction. May 15
he made known to the academy the new hygrometer he had just invented, and
his work on solutions and dissolutions; and, finally, on June 12, he laid before
this same learned body his researches on the difference in the conduction of a
circuit according to the direction of the current ; and thus explained from natural
causes a fact that M. De la Rive could not account for, except by admitting, in
electric currents, interferences analogous to those of light.

In 1838 Peltier published in volume 67 of the Annals of Chemistry and Physics
an article on the quantity of dynamic and static action produced by the oxida-
tion of a milligram of zinc, and on the relation which exists between these two
kinds of phenomena. Faraday had handled an analogous question before Pel-
tier, and M. Becquerel has treated it since. These three gentlemen have arrived
at this conclusion: that a dynamic degree represents an enormous static force; in
other words, that a galvanometer, despite its apparent sensibility, isan extremely
inert instrument compared with the electroscope. This same year Peltier made
known the cause of secondary currents in liquids; and he published in the Annals
of Natural Science two dissertations: one on a new kind of floscularia, the other
on the structure of muscles. He also laid before the Philomathic Society his
observations on the zoosperms of the frog; on magnetism by discharges along a
bar; on the displacement of the axis of a magnetic needle during a prolonged
deviation, &c., &c.

In the beginning of 1839, Peltier presented to the Philomathic Society an
article containing most interesting observations on the difference in structure of
the motor and sensitive nerves. At the same time he published in volume 71 of
thie Annals of Chemistry and Physics a very comprehensive dissertation. This
dissertation is composed of two distinct parts: the first treats of the formation of
tables in regard to relations which exist between the force of an electric current
and the deviation of the needles of the multipliers—and certainly no one was
more fit than Peltier to do this work; the second treats of the causes of pertur-
bation in the thermo-electrie pairs and the means of avoiding it. It is in itself
an entire and profound study of thermo-electricity. Peltier examines in this
work the effect of the bulk of the pairs and their number, of the size of the
solderings, the extent of surface immersed, &e.

During the period we have just sketched, Peltier had also occupied himself
with the study of meteorology, although in a cursory manner. In 1835 he placed
on the house he occupied apparatus for studying the temperature and electric
state of distant media. ‘The apparatus with which he at this time studied the
electric interchange between the earth and clouds was as follows: it was formed
of a piece of copper wire surrounded with silk, and covered over with several
layers of oil varnish; the upper portion of this wire was terminated by a tuft of
platina wire, and was elevated about 25 metres above the earth; the lower end
was also terminated by a platiua wire, and immersed in a deep well of 12 metres,
In the midst of the wire Peltier interposed at pleasure either a multipher of
3,000 coils, an electrometer of his invention, or a simple electroscope of gold
leaves. By the aid of this apparatus Peltier soon ascertained that the earth ordi-
narily gave indications of negative electricity; that, in general, there was a nega-
tive ascending current, but that in certain circumstances, and especially during
storms, there was on the contrary very often an inverse current, that is, a nega-
tive descending current.

Later, in 1836, Peltier ascertained that during storms the negative ascending

. . . 5S . .
ewrent acquired at times a considerable force, and then ceased altogether, giving
166 MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

place to a negative descending current still more powerful. August 6 of this
same year, especially, the storm that he was observing presented { at least 25 of
these inversions. He even ascertained that these sudden inversions did not take
place in all their power until the rain precipitated itself from the clouds to fall
on the ground; and, finally, he discovered that all storms were negative, but that
the clouds surrounding them were in general of a contrary electricity, and that

this was the reason why the commencement and close of storms always produce
positive signs, while the storm itself gives but negative ones.

In 1838 Peltier noticed a fact which he afterwards often confirmed, namely :
that snow alone never produces electric currents, while on the contrary sleet and
hail invariably give them. When they come with snow it is because it is mingled
with sleet. Finally, this same year, he called the attention of the Philomathic
Society to the fact that the earth and all bodies resting upon it are naturally in a
negative state; but that when in a storm the lower clouds are strongly negative,
the earth and all appurtenant bodies, being beneath them, become positive ; that
is, they exist momentarily in a condition opposed to their ordinary state; and he
thinks this change of electric state may be the cause of the general discomfort
suffered by nervous persons during certain storms.

We see that Peltier was perfectly prepared by his observations and previous
researches for the study of meteorology. He understood electricity thoroughly ;
he possessed galvanometers of great sensibility, by the aid of which he could
estimate the smallest dynamic currents ; he had invented an electrometer which
could measure the smallest static tension ; he had already made both curious and
interesting meteorological observations, and he needed but some favorable occa-
sion to deliver himself to the study of meteorology with all his characteristic
ardor. This occasion the water-spout of Chatenay was not long in furnishing.

On June 18, 1839, a water-spout laid waste the property of M. Hérelle at
Chatenay. The insurance company refused to pay damages, alleging that water-
spouts were not electric phenomena. In order to satisfy himself on this point
M. Herelle sought Peltier, whose works had now begun to be known and appre-
ciated. Solicited by M. Hérelle, Peltier repaired to the spot, and by virtue of
his perfect knowledge of electricity soon determined the real character of this
phenomenon. He first wrote a letter on this subject to the Academy of Science,
July 15; later, his ideas becoming still clearer, he presented, October 28, a
resumé of his researches, and in 1840 published his 7’reatise on Water-spouts.

From this moment Peltier found himself engaged for a long time in the study
of meteorology ; for, in consequence of his habit of never leaving unexplained
a single phenomenon, he felt himself compelled to study the whole science, and
with what zeal he did this we shall now see.

February 3, 1840, Peltier wrote to the academy explaining the fact of the
entire destruction of a man by a thunderbolt ; and the same day laid before them
a sealed package on the grouping of clouds. May 4, he communicated to this
learned body observations of great interest, made by aid of an electric kite, on
atmospheric electricity during clear weather. May 25, he made known his
researches on the phenomena which take place in the interior of metallic spheres
charged with electricity, and deduced from them an explanation of the grouping
of clouds. June 1, he complimented the academy by a presentation of his Treatise
on Water-spouts ; and, finally, November 30, he presented them with an article
in which he demonstrated that the electricity produced by evaporation was only
maintained by decrepitation. All these works, however, did not prevent him
from continuing his experiments in electricity and his microscopical researches,
so that, July 4, he presented to the Philomathic Society the interesting observa.
tion of a lucophre produced by efflux; and, November 16, made known to the
academy his experiments on the origin of the zoosperms of the frog.

In 1841 Peltier continued to oceupy himself with the same ardor on all that
concerns meteorology ; he ascertained the resinous tension of the earth, and dis-
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 167

covered the true cause of the electricity of vapors, (February 8, communication
to the Academy of Science.) This same year he procured a barometer, and six
months had not passed before he was able to comprehend the true cause of the
oscillations of this instrument, placing in fact before the academy, April 25, 1842,
a sealed package containing the resumé of his researches into the causes which
vary the barometrical pressure. At the same time that Peltier made by his obser-
vations so important a discovery, he published, in volume 4 of the third series of
the Annals, his great work on the cause of the electrical phenomena of the atmo-

t=)
sphere, which may be regarded as the fundamental basis of all meteorology ; he

also ascended the Faulhorn, and there ascertained that mountains are possessed
of all the properties of forelands, and that consequently their resinous tension is
enormous. He explained the phenomenon of the coloring of mountains; studied
the electrical phenomena of cascades; caught a glimpse of the cause of the dif-
ferent colorings of clouds; made, with M. Bravais and by request of M. Régnault,
experiments on the boiling point of water in reference to different heights; and
finally returned to Paris laden with his numerous materials. Hardly arrived in
Paris, he gathered together, arranged, and made known all the facts he had
observed, and published his dissertation on the different kinds of fogs.

In 1843 Peltier continued his labors, and prepared the memoirs with which
his scientific career terminated.

November 2, 1844, he presented to the Brussels Academy of Science his great
work on the cause of barometrical variations, and his researches on cyano-polar-
imetry ; and this same year published in the Archives of Electricity, at Geneva,
his memoir of electrical meteorology. He also made known to the Philomathic
Society his observations on the electricity of vapor arising from boilers at high
pressure ; pointed out the different causes of error which might deceive students
of meteorology, and added some points of detail to the general history of water-
spouts, on occasion of the Cette water-spout.

Finally, in 1845, Peltier made known the cause of the oscillations observed by
M. Liagre in spirit levels, and presented to the Brussels Academy of Science his
dissertation on the cause of electrical phenomena, which concluded his scientific
career, and which he unfortunately did not live to see in print.

We have now terminated the principal discoveries made by Peltier in micro-
graphy, physics, and meteorology. All these works, all these researches were
effected at most in 20 years; and, indeed, it can be said that his meteorological
labors only date from 1839. From having made so great a number of discoveries
in so short a time, it is easy to understand in what a state of intellectual tension
Peltier must have passed his life. For several years previous to his death his
health had suffered much; but to all remonstrances of his friends and family he
replied: “TI would rather die 10 years sooner and leave behind me discoveries
which will recall my name.” In the month of July, 1842, Peltier went to the
F'aulhorn, there to make meteorological observations. The sudden change from
a temperature of 30° above zero to one almost always below this point, mate-
rially affected his health, and, a short time after his return to Paris, resulted in a
spell of sickness. His disease was not in its first stages dangerous, being but a
slight intestinal affection, to cure which would have required at this time rest and
quiet for a few months. But with his character, with that incessant activity which
distinguished him, Peltier could not accept repose; he could exclaim with Hoche:
“Give me a remedy for fatigue, but let it not be repose.” Another cause there
was which added still to the excessive excitement of his brain: he had laid the
foundations of meteorology ; he had established the basis, and he now wished
to deduce its consequences and ayply them to the different phenomena of nature.
Nor was this all: it was long since he had had decided opinions on the nature of
electricity ; but never having drawn them up into regular form, he was afraid
death might overtake him too soon for the work ; so that, redoubling his energy
and activity to accomplish his wish, his relapses became frequent, and his malady
168 MEMOIR OF PELTIER,

soon assumed a most serious character. From the year 1844 a fatal issue was
feared, although he still had strength sufficient to go into Belgium for the pur-
pose of there introducing his various apparatus and his method of observation in
meteorology.

In 1845 the disease continued to make such progress that it was soon impos-
sible not to recognize in it a scirrhous stricture of the intestine; and to this he
soon succumbed. The day before his death, although exhausted by suffering,
he was still intent upon science—admitting several persons who came to consult
him on the water-spout of Monville, among whom was M. Preisser, professor of
chemistry at Rouen, with whom he had a long conversation on the cause of the
disasters which had just taken place. In the evening he dictated some lines
explaining the twisting which had been observed on the bark of certain trees; the
next morning he still retained his consciousness, but, gradually losing it, died
calmly and painlessly at 9 o’clock a.m. on Monday, October 27, 1845, having
attained the age of sixty and a half years.

Peltier was of medium height and well proportioned; his build was somewhat
spare, and his temperament at the same time bilious and nervous ; his forehead
was broad and largely developed; his face, something thin at the lower part.
was extremely mobile, the expression of his features being quick and intelligent,
while the contrast between his light blue eyes and heavy black brows gave to
his face a most marked appearance. His sight was excellent, although some-
what impaired towards the last by his use of the microscope ; and he had a deli-
cacy of touch which he found invaluable in his manual labors. In an intellect-
ual point of view there are few men who have been better endowed; his con-
ception was prompt and facile, and he was at the same time a man of theory and
of facts, never separating these two—a fact being to him but the round of a lad-
der by which he ascended to the cause. It was also often his lot to find in the
discoveries of others relations which they had not themselves seen. His passion
for study was incredible ; it is impossible to conceive a correct idea of all that he
learned and did, bearing throughout that sound, practical mind which so pre-emi- -
nently distinguished hin.

In a moral point of view there has been and can be but one voice. It is
known with what violence political passions rage, and how the least fault is held
up to public view as a handle against an adversary. But his political adversa-
ries, even the most bitter, respected and loved him profoundly, for his probity
and loyalty were known and appreciated by all. Peltier had no ambition, or,
rather, he had but one, and that was science. In 1834 the prefecture of the
Seine offered him the mayoraity of the fifth ward of Paris, and he was given to
understand that the cross of honor would be the speedy reward of his services
in this new capacity; but he refused. Himself maintaining the most decidedly
conservative opinions, he nevertheless could respect the views of his adversaries ;
and, although he was frequently engaged in oral strife, those even whom he had
combatted with the most energy could not leave him without regret. It was,
indeed, for every one a day of grief when he died.

On the 29th day of October, 1845, a great concourse of savants and friends
conducted him to his last home, amidst the universal grief. Among these were
MM. Régnault and Milne Edwards, members of the Academy of Sciences; M.
Desbassayns of Richemont; Dr. Conneau, MM. Bravais and Martins, M. Boutigny
d’ Evreux, M. L. Bréguet, M. Donné, M. Lemercier, M. Frédéric Gérard, M. Lesueur,
M. Silberman, M. Doyére, M. Lassaigne, M. Bréon, M. Véc, mayor of the fifth
ward; MM. Converchel and Lourmand, who had been his colleagues in the pri-
mary committee of instruction; the officers of his old company, and many others
too numerous to mention.

Arrived at the cemetery of Pére-la-Chaise his body was deposited in a provis-
ional vault, and two discourses were pronounced over his tomb—one by M. Milne
Edwards, as president of the Philomathic Society, of which Peltier was a mem-
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 169

ber; the other by M. Frédéric Gérard, who had known him but a few years, but
to whom the time, short though it was, "had sufficed to give a just appreciation of

his qualities. ‘These discourses were as follows:
DISCOURSE OF M. MILNE EDWARDS.

“Tt is not in the midst of the sad scenes surrounding the tomb that we can give
ourselves up to the cold estimations of science, and judge impartially the works
of a man who has long been our colleague. I shall not then endeavor to recall
here all that M. Peltier has done for the advancement of human knowledge, nor
to expound the ingenious views which led him to explain and reproduce, by
single experiments in the laboratory, the most sublime phenomena of which the
atmosphere i is the seat. Historians of science will have the grateful task of regis-
tering his works, and will gladly render him the praise which is his due. But
before the earth-clods close over his remains let me be permitted to pay to his
memory this last tribute of respect, in the name of a body of men whose watch-
words are study and friendship. 'The Philomathic Society will long honor the
memory of M. Peltier. We will not forget the frequent and interesting com-
munications in which he has given account of his curious researches, and his
name will be often cited among us when we wish to place before the eyes of our
rising generation examples of disinterested love of science and patient perseve-

rance in the pursuit of knowledge, which may excite them to emulation. The
recital of his life will be pre-eminently instructive to those who, in the beginning
of their career, feel discouraged by their isolation, and fear that they can, unsup-
ported, acquire neither fame nor fortune. They will see from the example of M.
Peltier how, with firm will and undaunted spirit, a young man alone in the world,
and without resource except such as is furnished by a powerful organization, can
triumph over the numberless obstacles by which he is surrounded, and conquer, lit-
tle by little, all that is wanting—instruction, wealth, and fame, all well acquired.

“Such, indeed, has been the life of M. Peltier; and had not death so ruthlessly
come prematurely to interrupt the course of his labors, so strongly impressed with
the seal of originality, he would have received the reward due to his merit, for
doubtless his peers would soon have chosen him to be one of the representatives
of that science he cultivated with such éclat.

“When in a few days our society resumes her labors, she will learn with grief
the loss that I now so deeply deplore; and on the list of members which she most
regrets and loves will be inscribed the name of Peltier beside those other illus-

trious names, Dulong, Fresnel, and Savart.”
DISCOURSE OF M. FREDERIC GERARD.

“Jt is a noble thought that gathers around a grave the friends of him whose
remains are to be laid therein; it is the last homage we can render to his mem-
ory; and the words pronounced over his coffin, resting deeply engraved in the
mind, are an instructive lesson to all who hear them.

“Tf a pompous eulogium is expected for those who have performed glorious
actions, a fev simple and touching words are the fittest tribute to the memory of
that man who has applied himself to the art of living well, and has consecrated
his leisure hours and all his mind to the advancement of knowledge.

“Such was he whom death has taken from us before the time at which he usu-
ally strikes those who have passed the critical period of life.

““A few words on his earliest years will show what there was of noble in this
man’s life, and will be the highest eulogium we could pronounce over his tomb.

“ Born at Ham, in 1785, in mediocre condition, but of an honest and intelligent
father, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier was placed, at the age of fifteen years,
under the care of a German clock-maker living at Saint Quentin—a hard, unmer-
ciful man. It was at this time that France in arms battled against all Europe ;
170 MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

and each time that the public journals announced the success of republican
arms, his wounded national pride vented itself upon his pupil, who experienced
a malicious pleasure in informing him of the reverses of the German hordes.
As he offered to the eager lad but little knowledge, Athanase, impatient of a
yoke which nettled his pride, ran away and went to Paris.

“This was in 1803, when Bréguet held in this city the sceptre of elevated
horology. Peltier, having heard of his fame, presented himself before him
with that naive confidence so precious an accompaniment of youth, and asked
to be employed in his workshop. Struck with the frank and open manner of
the young Picard, the great mechanic granted his request, and placed him under
one of his most skilful workmen. A few years later, the young horologer of
Ham was promoted to a place under Bréguet himself, and very soon intrusted
with his most important works.

“Fortune smiling on his persevering efforts, Athanase became himself head of
an establishment of horology. Until that time he had applied his intellect to
the study only of mechanics; but he then began to feel that this branch, cut
off from general knowledge, could not satisfy him; and so occupied himself
with literature, poetry, and philosophy ; this last science especially suiting his
grave and meditative cast of mind.

“Married in 1806, and becoming a father two years later, he formed the reso-
lution of himself directing his son’s education. This was for him the beginning
of a new life. Without neglecting his business, he attended the public courses,
and devoured the lessons of the great masters with the eagerness of a spirit
impatient of all trammels. Gifted with a perspicacity equalled only by his
perseverance, overcoming with giant strides all difficulties, the modest partner
of the labors of Bréguet could soon compete with those who had commenced
their life with study, and could discuss with them the most abstruse points in
science.

“At the close of 1815 he quitted his establishment and succeeded his father-
in-law, who had been farrier to the Emperor; but the feebleness of his health,
and his extreme fondness for study would not permit him to accommodate him-
self to a profession which requires more of physical force than of mental; and
hence he was not long in abandoning the situation to return to his favorite
studies with renewed zeal.

“In a short time the son of M. Peltier, under the intelligent direction of his
father, began to study seriously, and designed himself for the profession of medi-
cine. henceforth the career of the elder Peltier was irrevocably determined ;
he occupying himself exclusively with mathematics, physics, and natural his-
tory. He brought to bear on these studies a cool, clear mind, a sound and severe
judgment and a fertility of resources which characterize the observer; quali-
ties rarely found united in one man; to which he added a skill in handicraft
and a precision which, acquired as they were in his earliest years, enabled him
to make his own instruments, and to add to others the modifications necessitated
by their use. He loved to repeat and explain the experiments in physics at
which he had assisted ; ; and, novice at first, he very soon became skilful in
handling the most delicate instruments. He now also began to give his whole
attention to the study of electrical phenomena.

“He for a long time followed assiduously, but in silence, the sittings of the
Academy of Sciences ; meditating deeply on problems in electricity, repeating,
multiplyi ing his observations, varying them incessantly, and perfecting constantly
the means “of investigation.

“1830 found him laboriously occupied on these matters, without one single
line having appeared in public to reveal his severe and profound studies. At this
time the question of dry batteries was much discussed ; this subject roused him,
and, seizing it, he treated it with that accuracy of judgment which announces a
man habituated to the severest labors of the mind. From 1833 to 1845 was
MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 171

occupied by a succession of works numerous and varied on the most obscure
points of electricity. These were never theories @ priori, mere playthings of
the imagination, but experiments and minute researches pregnant with new
views and marked by the most subtle penetration. ‘The returns of the Acad-
emy of Sciences, the Bulletin of the Philomathic Society, of which he was an
honored member, the public library of Geneva, the Annals of Chemistry and,
Physics, all attest his incessant activity.

“Dynamic electricity and galvanism, that important branch of physics which!
is so nearly allied to the great phenomena of life, were to him the object of |
numerous researches ; but he directed his special observations to meteorology, a
science which so imperiously demands an attentive observer, a skilful experi-
menter, and a philosopher who knows how to deduce results from his observa-’
tions; and on this subject he indeed threw light. His works on the electricity
of clouds, on fogs, and his fine treatise on water-spouts, would suffice to assign
him a distinguished place among physical philosophers had he not other claims
to the remembrance of the friends of science: I allude to his last works on
electrical meteorology and barometrical variations.

“‘T shall also call to mind his considerations on ether, in which he rises to the
greatest heights of abstraction without, however, quitting the stronghold of expe-
rience, a characteristic which is observable throughout all his works.

“T must not forget, too, to cite his experiments on microscopic life, which form
a portion of his far too limited zoological observations. Studying in them the
phenomena of the production and disaggregation of infusoria, he arrived at a
belief in the heterogeneous origin of all these forms of life. It is pleasant to
follow him in these minute experiments, where we recognize at every step the
rigorous method of the philosopher, and in which he studies this infinitesimal
life with a happy daring which permits him to read its secrets as easily as the
evolutions of great bodies.

“ But a life so laboriously consecrated to study, and so productive of fruit for
science could not be without its sacrifices. The observations made by M. Pel-
tier on the Faulhorn, in 1842, in connection with M. Bravais, laid the founda-
tion of that disease which has to-day bereft us of him. From that fatal period
his strength diminished, ard his body wasted away ; but his mind lost none of
its original vigor, and he ever retained his passionate love for science. It was,
indeed, during these last three years that he published in the Brussels Archives
of Electricity and Memoirs of the Academy of Science his most important
works.

“'Towards the close of this year his health became more and more feeble, and
the disease which preyed upon him soon gave too clear warning of his approach-
ing end. He spoke of it without affectation, and with the quiet resignation and
calm philosophy of one who feels and understands that the goal of life is death.

“His extreme sufferings, the prostration of his strength, his ever-increasing
debility, that precursor of dissolution, could not diminish the ardor with which
he still devoted himself to his favorite occupation, even revising and correcting
towards the last the impression of a general treatise on physics, which will
appear as a posthumous work, and is the last emanation from his great and
noble mind.

“The numerous materials he has collected will not, we hope, be lost to science ;
and only when we reap the fruit of these will we understand the full extent of
the loss we have this day sustained. Justice will then be rendered him; all
will deplore his untimely death, but, alas! without avail.

“Tt is but two days since he conversed for several hours with a scientific gen-
tleman of Rouen and the proprietors of Monville on the cause of the disasters
of that commune ; pointing out to them, with his usual clearness, the part he
considered the electric fluid to have borne in this fearful event. This long and
serious conversation, while it aggravated his physical exhaustion, did not pre-

vent him from dictating to his son his ideas on the cleavage of trees by the
electric spark.

“Tn men whose life is in their intellect, the obstructions of the physiological
funetions have but a feeble effect on the brain; this was, nevertheless, the last
time that his thoughts manifested themselves to those around him. The next
morning his friends found him sinking, but calm; a few hours and he was no
more.

“Thus terminated this life so filled with labor of which science had the best
and noblest portion. He died firmly believing in the infinite progression of
physical philosophy, and confident in the bright future of experimental science,
which he regarded as the anchor of safety and truth.

“ For him is accomplished that terrible phenomenon whose name is death ;
but, like all strong men who dare to look beyond, he was prepared.”

I1.—MIcROSCOPIC RESEARCHES.

We owe to Peltier observations on certain new microscopic animals, We
will cite among others his observations on a vorticella which, by its form, closely
approximates to that which Muller has called citrine, and, in its interior consti-
tution, resembles the vorticella or umbel of Roésel. We will also advert to his
observations on a new species of floscularia. We shall not, however, dwell on
this class of researches. Peltier, in fact, had never devoted himself to the use
of the microscope in order to discover new individuals ; microscopy was for him
but a means of study for arriving at a more thorough knowledge of physiology.

Effects of inanition on the infusoria.—Microscopic animals have, in general,
a very simple structure ; still they are often too complex to admit of an advan-
tageous study in them of the different phenomena of organized bodies. Peltier
conceived the i ingenious idea of employing inanition in “order to rid these ani-
mals of all superfluous matter, and to reduce them to their most simple expres-
sion. The following is the method which should be taken: Ona glass plate
let a circle of tin be glued, and in the centre of this circle place the drop of
water which is proposed to be examined ; on the tin circle spread a thin coat of
oil, with the exception of a section of a few millimetres.{ This arrangement
has several advantages; in the first place the thickness of the tin does not per-
mit the drop of water to extend itself by capillarity as far as the edges, and
entirely to flow away as ordinarily happens; the liquid remains at rest at the
centre of the circle which cireumscribes without touching it ; moreover, the circle
of oil delays evaporation. If we closed it entirely, there ensues, in 24 hours,
asphyxia of a great part of the animalcules ; while, by leaving’ a small space
without oil, the drop of water may be preserved from three to eight days,
according to the temperature and hygrometricity of the air. ‘The animals thus
preserved in a drop of water will have soon exhausted all the nutritive matter
which it contained, and a succession of very remarkable effects produced by
inanition is progressively brought to view.

In proportion as the drop of water becomes impoverished, most of the ani-
mals give more development and extension to their organs of contact ; fre-
quently new vesicles are developed on the sides of the corona of the vorticelle,
and around the cephalic projections of the rostrated cyclida the protées become
transformed ; and the more as the drop of water has been longer kept. It
seems, in a word, that aliment no longer reaching the organism in sufficient
quantity, this organism forms a sort of hernia of all its ‘parts in order thus
to reach it. At the same time that the appendages are developed, the body of
the animal is gradually reduced to its elements. Peltier witnessed, for instance,
in the vorticella above spoken of, the following phenomena: at the end of five
or six days of inanition, the ag clomerations attached to the exterior mem-

55
brane of the animal GinehiG in number; when the vorticella is wholly enfee-

bled, it has lost them all; it is then no more than a very thin and diaphanous
membrane in which no organ is any longer perceptible. In this state, all move-
ment has ceased; the particles of the membrane itself become disintegrated
and the vorticella dissolves globule by globule ; at other times a rupture “takes
place in a part of the membrane, the internal liquid escapes, and the animal
has ceased to live.

Reproduction of infusoria.—\t is known that among the infusoria, properly
so called, reproduction takes place commonly by fissiparity ; they continue sep-
arating into two parts, and thus form new beings. ‘This mode of reproduction
is so rapid that a single paramecia observed for some days divided itself four
times in 24 or 30 hours, producing thousands of new creatures in the lapse of a
few days. This generation only proceeds with activity when an exuberant
nourishment is supplied to these animals. Peltier, however, produced by inani-
tion, in a great number of animalcules, an effect analogous to that which results
from an excess of nutrition.

There are species which possess a contractile dorsal vessel, in which we can
follow the progress of the nutritive liquid; such are the digitated naiade. If
these animals be subjected to inanition, we shall see, in proportion as the liquid
is impoverished, a contraction of the dorsal vessel, which is less stretched out,
and stops where the liquid ceases to arrive, because it has been absorbed by the
anterior parts. When this movement is thus arrested, there will be seen to be
formed, at the middle of the body, at the point where the nutritive liquid ceases
to arrive, and where the contraction of the vessel stops, two large absorbent
vesicles, which imbibe for the behoof of the posterior part. As soon as these
vesicles enter into action the second half of the dorsal vessel resumes its contractile
movements ; these contractions, be it understood, take their origin in the new
vesicles, and have no communication with the anterior part nor any synchro-
nism with its movement. In front of these vesicles, a constriction is presently
formed, which increases by degrees, and which ends by completely separating
the two portions, which then constitute two distinct individuals.

The anterior portion, better organized and better supplied with appendages
for alimentation, has more vivacity, more energy, than the other. If we suc-
ceed in preserving the drop of water seven or eight days, the nutritive matter
diminishing more and more, there occurs for the two halves that which occurred
for the entire animal: the quantity absorbed by the anterior parts is no longer
sufficient for the total alimentation, and the posterior part is left in a state of
complete inanition. It was thus that Peltier obtained in one instance a new
separation into two of each of the two former halves, and eventually a new
tee ee of the two quarters proceeding from the anterior half ; the two sep-
arated parts of the posterior half had ceased to live before he ‘could effect a
new separation. The result, therefore, was the formation of six individuals
proceeding from the separation of the parts which the dorsal vessel could no
longer supply with nourishment.

Peltier has verified the same fact with regard to the pustulous kerones ; hav-
ing subjected these animals to protracted inanition, he perceived that, in the
middle of the body, an indentment was formed which went on constantly
increasing, and finally separated the animal into two parts; the anterior half
- continued to live, it appeared even to acquire new energy by the loss of the
posterior half of its substance, while this latter often died at once, though some-
times it remained alive for a certain interval. In every case, the instant of the
death of the individual restored to liberty and their own spontaneity the rest
of the globules which happened to be in its interior. Peltier observed also
similar ‘peculiarities i in the kidney-shaped cyclide.

M. Dujardin had inferred from his researches that certain animals might be
produced by means of lobes of their substance abandoned by them on the
bodies to which they attach themselves. Peltier has confirmed this idea by

numerous observations on the common and the scutelliform arcelle. The
mother-arcella begins by extending, under the form of a large disk, a portion
of her membrane. This portion of membrane is attached to the horny shell by
prolongations at regular intervals. It is at first perfectly smooth, of great trans-
parence, and contains no other substance ; when its formation is finished, a por-
tion of the glutinous matter of the mother flows upon it. In one instance Pel-
tier saw this glutinous substance flow too abundantly on the new membrane
and leave but about a sixth of it for the mother; the current now stopped, then
retrograded, and an inverse current was established for the benefit of the primi-
tive arcella. An instant afterwards, when the original current had been re-es-
tablished and again conveyed the vivifying matter on the young disk, it once
more surpassed the bounds and left the arcella too much impoverished. It was
not until after five or six oscillations of this sort, the amplitude of the flow
diminishing each time, that a due distribution was effected and the intercommu-
nication ceased. The vascular filament which united the two arcelle gradually
became thinner, then entirely separated, and two minutes afterwards the two
distinct animalcules withdrew one from the other, both thrusting out their arms
and performing their customary digitations. This mode of generation is cer-
tainly very remarkable ; we here see the half of a living creature flowing out-
wardly and forming with this excreted moiety an animal in all respects similar
to the moiety remaining.

Peltier observed, in 1830, another example of generation by an efflux of sub-
stance still more curious than the former, for here the efflux was not sponta-
neous. He had placed between two glasses, under the microscope, a drop of
water in which there was a very large specimen of Muller’s vesicular leucophra;
in slightly compressing the two glasses, the external membrane was broken and
perhaps a hundred of the globules which fill the animal were extruded. Many
of these were scattered about in being projected by the pressure, but others
clung together in a space of smalk extent. The former remained apart, and
nothing was remarked in them but the tremulous motion of light bodies. The
globules of the agglomerated portion, on the contrary, gradually drew closer
together, grouped themselves, and finally, at the end of an hour, formed a
sphere whose contour, of a brilliancy inclined to nacreous, indicated the forma-
tion of a membrane. At the end of two hours there was perceivable in the cir-
cumference the reflection of the liquid in motion, and shortly afterwards the
oscillations of very fine cilia. The leucophra was now complete and presently
revolved upon itself, then spontaneously changed its place and traversed the
drop of water. Thus this little animal was produced externally by the agglome-
ration of the substance which had been made to issue mechanically from the
mother.

Transformations of zoosperms.—Peltier had followed with much attention the
successive transformations of zoosperms, especially those of thé frog.* He
showed first that the spermatic liquor expressed from the testicles contains, in
winter, only simple spherical globules. As adolescence approaches, and the
season of copulation, these globules become covered with black points and small
projections, which latter speedily elongate, forming each a cone, the point of
which appears filamentous and soon undergoes much enlargement; at the same
time the filaments which terminate these cones grow more and more distinct and
present the appearance of a tuft of hairs. The cones thus terminated by fila-
ments consist of small masses of zoosperms, attached by the head to the black
points of the central globule, and free in their caudal extremity.

As long as these globules swim in their natural liquor, no movement is per-
ceived; but if there be mixed with it blood from the neighboring veins and
arteries, the point of the tufted cone partially opens and some of the filaments
which terminate it commence oscillating with their terminal parts. If blood

taken from another organ than the testicles be added, the movement is commu-
nicated to a still eveater number, the expansion of the tufts increases, the oscil-
lation extends to half the leneth of the fibrils, and the posterior portion of the
zoosperms may then be perfectly recognized ; if a still more heterogeneous liquid
be added, such as river or pond water, the movement becomes general and the
whole body of the filament oscillates. After a few instants, some of these fila-
ments are seen to detach themselves from the primitive nucleus ; presently all
successively quit it, become so many complete zoosperms, and leave the parent
globule covered with brownish points where they had been attached.

Once become free, the zoosperms undergo new transformations; their anterior
part bends in an arch more or less elongated; this arch, by closing, constitutes
a ring in some and an oblong mesh in others. A little later their anterior part
has assumed the shape of a cupel, fringed with vibratile cilia; but before enter-
ing into this last state, these zoosperms have passed through intermediate forms,

5
giving them the appearance of different animalcules, by which circumstance

observers have been often deceived. Such, according to the researches of Peltier,
are the successive transformations presented by the. zoosperms of the frog.

Structure and contraction of the muscles——Peltier also occupied himself
with the structure of the muscles and the phenomenon of contraction. He even
availed himself of several different methods, that he might study them with
greater profit. Sometimes he simply examined the muscular fibres with the
microscope, sometimes he proceeded by crushing them on the porte-object glass;
again, he unravelled them by means of the finest needles. He often operated
also on muscles desiccated by heat, for this process also yields good results. He
studied likewise the structure of the muscles in certain microscopic animals
which have muscles in a rudimentary state, and composed of one, two, or three
fibrits. In a word, he had employed all the means which science could furnish
him, and the followi ing are the results to which he was conducted :*

The muscles are composed of distinct cylinders, of a diameter of from 3! to
35 of a millimetre. Seen with the microscope, these cylinders seem divided by

rather transparent longitudinal lines and by dar ker transverse lines. This

causes them to appear somewhat like an assemblage of small graduated scales
of a perfect regularity. ‘The cylinders in question are formed of fibrils in justa-
position, w hile the fibrils themselves are constituted by a tube nce W any minute
grains, the diameter of which varies, in different animals, from abo tO yao Of a
millimetre.

In studying these fibrils it is seen that the globules are ranged in succession
one above the other in their sheaths, that they touch and press one another,
while the globules situated in the same transverse range, and pertaining each to
a different tube, are separated by a double membrane extremely transparent.
When a ray of light traverses a muscular fibre, diffraction takes place quite
around each globule, except at the point of contact of the globules superposed
in the same sheath. It thus forms an image unequally illuminated, being less
so at the part in contact than in the rest of ‘the outline of the globules. Hence
it results that the transverse lines which connect all these obscure points are
darker than the longitudinal lines; and from this we see in what consisted the
error of the physiologists who thought that these transverse fibres were formed
by nervous filaments, wound in a helix around the muscular fibre.

The globules of the elementary fibrils are strongly adherent to one another
and to their sheaths, for it is very rare to find portions of the latter devoid of
their globules.

When certain microscopic animals are deprived of life by long inanition, the
whole contractile membrane is seen to be formed of aligned globules. In this
case also the different phases of the phenomenon of contraction may be followed

with facility. It will be seen that the arrangement in zigzag has here replaced

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. Ti

the arrangement in a straight serial line. The sheath is shortened in obeying
this new arrangement; it folds slightly on itself, like the finger of a glove w ‘hose
two ends are pressed nearer together. The elasticity of the sheath, however,
renders this corrugation very diflicult to be perceived.

On the structure of the nerves.—W hen Charles Bell had published his treatise
on the distinction of the nerves of the face into nerves of movement and nerves
of sensation, Magendie proceeded to inquire whether there were not something
analogous i in the rachidian nerves, and soon thereafter proved, in effect, that the
posterior roots of these nerves presided over the sensibility, while the anterior
roots governed the power of movement. It was natural to suppose that these
two sorts of nerves had a different structure and constitution. Peltier applied
himself to this interesting question, and we will recall the principal facts which
he made public.*

The nerves of sensibility have not a texture similar to those of movement,
and moreover each of them in particular varies according to the proximity of its
insertion in the organ or of its exit from the cerebro-spinal centre.

In removing further from the cerebro-spinal centre, the cellular tissue of the
nerves increases and becomes more resistant; it cireumscribes more and more the
medullary pulp, and in the end forms for it ‘distinct sheaths. At farst there are
but small portions of this pulp thus circumscribed and enclosed in the sheaths;
the rest surrounds them and fills the interstices which separate them. ‘The
number of these sheaths continually increases, and the free pulp diminishes in
the same proportion, The nearer we approach the termination of the nerves, the
more glutinous does this pulp become and the greater the cohesiveness it acquires.

The nerves which are ramified in the muscles are formed of tubes of about
zip of a millimetre; the membrane which constitutes them is of little consist-
ency; at the least pressure it yields unequally, and the medullary substance
which it contains forms varicosities. The nearer the periphery, the fewer the
varicosities, because the sheath becomes more resistant and the pulp diminishes.
These tubes or nervous fibrils, however, always preserve a considerable part of
their globules in line, whatever the pressure Gcbiied on them. ‘Towards their
insertion they are finer, more regular, and more numerous; the globules of the
pulp are there better aligned, their position is fixed, pressure no longer displaces
them, and these nervous fibrils might be re adily confounded with the muscular
fibrils, if the transverse lines fads in the latter were not w anting.

Arrived at the muscle to which it is destined, the nervous filament sends forth,
at variable distances, bundles of SB fibrils which have become extreme sly
thin. They are in diameter about <j, of a millimetre, and are only formed of

a series of contiguous globules ; one does pressure any longer discover a
little free pulp in their interstices. ‘These bundles of nervous fibrils are dis-
persed over all the adjacent muscular fibrils, in the midst of which they success-
ively disappear, without our being able to see how they terminate. It might
almost be believed that the muscular fibril i is, as regards a part of its substance,
but a continuation of the nervous fibril.

The nerves of sensibility have a different constitution from the preceding.
They contain less of the nervous pulp in a state of semi-fluidity ; on compression
no varicosities are Dee their fibrils are more tennous; they have, at first,
a diameter of from 345 to sp of a HEI but CUTE the organ in which
they are inserted of not more than from , 5p to yq5o of millimetre. Their

C

globules are much smaller, being not larger than about zo05 Of a millimetre ;
they are regularly aligned, and pressure does not displace them. ‘These
fibrils often cross one anothers in their progress. A certain number of them,
united in little bandlets, form, in crossing, lozenges elongated at the point of
their intersection ; nee) houuke are strongly adherent, and eannot be detached

but by tearing them.

II.—STaTic ELECTRICITY.

Difference of static and dynamic electricity — Electricity may present itself in
two distinct conditions; it may be in repose or in movement. In the first case
it is said to be im a static, in the second in a dynamic, state. The phenomena
which it produces in these two cases are very different.

This distinction is to be found in all treatises on physics; bat no author has
insisted so much as Peltier on the difference—on the almost constant opposition,
indeed, which exists between the phenomena produced by static electricity and
those produced by dynamic electricity; by electricity in repose or in movement.*

Static electricity, says Peltier, is double; each of its forms is collected, con-
trolled, and maintained separately. ‘They do not become manifest except in
this state of insulation and of separation. ‘They may be preserved thus sepa-
rated by means of insulating bodies, and their action then is as enduring as their
insulation. Static electricity is accumulated at the surface; its effects reduce
themselves to the phenomena of attraction and repulsion. When two bodies
are charged with the same electricity they separate from one another; when
charged with contrary electricities they approach one another, &c.

Dy namic electricity exhibits constantly opposite properties. Itis not double ;
it cannot be collected, coerced, or preserved. To have a constant dynamic effect,
it is necessary that the cause itself should act ina constant manner. It secks
not the surface; on the contrary, it is propagated through the interior of bodies
and has relations only with ponderable quantities of matter. Like currents
attract one another; unlike currents repel one another. Finally, dynamic elec-
tricity has an extreme diversity of action; it alters the temperature of bodies,
vaporizes or decomposes them, magnetizes iron and steel, causes deviation of the
magnetic needle, &c.

The two orders of phenomena, static and dynamie, are rarely coexistent ; it is
only when the current has ceased, through a forcible interruption, that a static
effect appears ; so, too, it is only ‘when free course is given to the cause of the
static effect that the dynamic effect is reproduced ; but the two effects never are
and never can be simultaneously produced by the same portion of electricity.
When these two effects make their appearance at the same time, as happens in
the case of an insufficient conductor, the portion of electricity which passes pro-
duces only dynamic effects, and the portion of electricity arrested produces only
static effects.

Relation of static and dynamic actions.—Peltier had measured the extent of
the electric phenomena, both statie and dynamic, which may be produced by the
oxidation of a milligram of zinc. By causing the electricity produced by a
given quantity of substance to pass successiv ely from the dynamic to the static
condition, and from the static to the dynamic, he found that the quantity of sub-
stance necessary, in order to produce the dynamic effect of one degree of a good
multiplier, may yield a static effect of 7,069 degrees of the electrometer of his
own invention, and, moreov er, that the static effects which it produces are as the
square of its dynamic effects; hence the quantity of oxidized substance which
doubles a dynamic effect, quadruples the static effect which springs from it-t

Electric capacity of the metals.—Peltier first demonstrated that the metals
have not equal capacities for receiving thé same static electricity from a constant
source; thus, zinc takes and retains more positive than negative electricity, while
the contrary takes place with copper. Gold is likewise more apt than silver
and platina to become charged with positive electricity.¢

quantities of dynamic and static action produced by the oxidation of a milligramme of zinc.

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 179

After having sufficiently verified this fact, Peltier sought to find whether it was
the consequence of a special force or the result of a permanent electric state,
and he ascertained that in their natural state, or that of equilibrium, bodies pos-
sess different quantities of static electricity, and that consequently the proximity
of a metal which, like platina for instance, is negative in its natural state of
equilibrium, influences the neighboring bodies, rendering them more positive,
and, in consequence, more apt to receive and retain positive electricity. From
this it results that two condensing plates, the one of gold, the other of platina,
influence one another; the platina renders the gold more apt to receive and
retain positive electricity, and the gold renders the platina more apt to receive
from it negative electricity. If these two plates be placed in contact they take
reciprocally that electricity for which they have most aptitude.

We must not confound this peculiar property of the metals with the electro-
motive force of Volta. Coutact is here of no account, for the same results are
obtained without contact, only in this case the results are somewhat lessened by
the distance.

After having verified these facts, Peltier expressed them in the most general
manner, by saying that the metals have different capacities for collecting the
same static electricity from a constant source. But it was impossible for him to
arrive at the cause of this difference. Since that time, the researches of M. de
la Rive, and especially those of M. Edmond Becquerel, would seem to have suf-
ficiently elucidated the problem. ‘These two savants have demonstrated in effeet
that the metals least liable to be tarnished are yet, in reality, oxidized in the
open air; but very slowly and very slightly, which had theretofore prevented
the physicists from perceiving it. The quantity of platina oxidized is unques-
tionably very minute, but the experiments of Faraday, of Peltier, and of Bec-
querel have proved that it needs but the oxidation of an almost imperceptible
quantity of metal to produce considerable quantities of static electricity; if,
therefore, platina is always naturally negative in relation to gold, it is because
it oxidizes to a greater degree; if it is also negative in relation to zinc, this is
referable to the fact that the zinc employed is always covered with a coat of
oxide which preserves the metal from all ulterior alteration.

Modifications in the torsion balance.-—Yor a long time there was nothing avail-
able for the purpose of indicating the tension of static electricity, except the
gold-leaf electrometer and the torsion balance.’ The former instrument possesses
great sensibility, but unfortunately does not afford a measure; the latter, on the
contrary, gives exact measures, but has not the sensibility requisite for delicate
experiments; it has besides some serious defects. Peltier adapted to the torsion
balance modifications which eliminated these defects, and designed, besides, an
electrometer which unites the precision and measurement of the torsion balance
with the sensibility of the best gold-leaf electroscopes. We shall speak in sue-
cession of the torsion balance, as modified by Peltier, and of his electrometer.

The torsion balance, as it was employed by Coulomb, had the inconvenience
of not maintaining in electric equilibrium the two balls between which the elec-
tricity under experiment is distributed. When one of the two loses more than
the other, whether by reason of its own asperities or that of the neighboring
bodies, the humidity of the air and the imperfect insulation of the supports
which is the consequence thereof, or through whatsoever other accidental cause,
there results an inequality of action, of which the resultant is no longer the
expression of the repulsive quantities alone; for as soon as the inequality of
charge supervenes, the action becomes complicated from the repulsion of the
similar electricities, and from the attraction produced by the excess of one of
the balls over the contrary electricity of the other ball, which the former devel-
opes by influence.

With a view to avoid these causes of error, Conlomb took infinite precautions
180 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

to assure himself that during the whole time of the experiment the total loss
should be very small, and consequently the difference still smaller. When the
experiment, however, lasts a long time, and in damp weather, we cannot neglect
this difference in the electric state of thie balls, since it involves a considerable
one in the results. On the other hand, there are many experiments in which it
is proposed to measure the successive addition or subtraction of the electric
forces, which cannot be done with an instrument of which the active parts are
insulated one from the other.

Peltier corrected these defects by applying to the torsion balance two import-
ant modifications. In the first place he established a permanent communication
between the movable disk and the fixed ball; secondly, he soldered this last to
a metallic rod which projects laterally, and which, after having left the ball, is
bent vertically in order to receive the condensing plates or any other apparatus.
The following is briefly a description of this instrument:

The torsion balance as modified by Peltier presents at its upper part a micro-
meter, like that of Conlomb’s balance. A cocoon thread, devoid of torsion, is
attached to the windlass of this micrometer by its upper extremity, and bears at
its lower end a metallic needle, terminated on one hand by a proof plane, and
on the other by a balance weight of gum-lac. ‘The needle has on its lower face,
and in the line of prolongation of the cocoon thread, a point of platina descending
vertically. This point is immersed in a capsule of glass, mto which has been
previously introduced diluted sulphuric acid. ‘The capsule i is carefully surrounded
with resin, and rests on a plate of copper. This plate may be raised or lower by
means of a bent lever, whose leg is situated without and passes underneath the
footstand of the instrument. p he fixed ball, as has been already said, is sol-
dered to a copper rod which projects laterally through the glass case which
covers the instrument, and then rises vertically, so as to receive the condensing
plates or other apparatus. <A fine wire proceeds from the rod which supports
the fixed ball, and directs itself towards the capsule filled with sulphuric acid ;
having reached this capsule the wire is bent at a right angle, and descends into
the acid. When the instrument is to be used the capsule is elevated by means
of the bent lever; when the experiment is finished it is lowered, and the point of
platina and the wire are no longer immersed in the acid.

Peltier placed, moreover, two graduated circles, one on the footstand of the
instrument, and the other on the upper plane of the casing. ‘These two circles
correspond; consequently, if the visual ray is made to pass by the same degrees
in the two circles, the deviation of the needle may be read without the possi-
bility of error. .

Those who are a little conversant with electricity will readily comprehend the
object and advantages of the arrangements here indicated. By means of these
modifications, in effect, the tension remains perfectly equal between the fixed
ball and the proof plane, even when the experiments last some time, or when the
electricity which is to be measured is either augmented or diminished.

Electrometer.—We pass now to a description of the electrometer of Peltier.*
On a socle or footstand, three decimetres in diameter, is pasted a dial-plate of
pasteboard, graduated to 360 degrees; at five centimetres above the centre of
this dial is the extremity of a rod of copper having a section of seven millime-
tres. This rod is slightly curved, and bends back almost at a right angle when it
arrives above the zero. It then penetrates vertically into the footstand from which
it is insulated by resin; it is there again bent round so as to proceed laterally;
then, at a distance of a few centimetres, it rises vertically to receive the plates
of Volta or any other apparatus. On the inner extremity of this rod, just above
the centre of the dial, is soldered a small plate of tempered steel, polished and
slightly concave.

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER, 181

This concave surface is destined to receive the pivot of a needle formed of a
very fine copper wire. The needle is a decimetre in length, and is thus equal to
the radius of the dial. Its pivot is soldered to its posterior part ; consequently
it must be maintained in equilibrium by a small counterpoise of gum-lac. The
pivot is of tempered steel, and terminated by as fine a point as possible. The
copper wire which forms the needle is slightly curved, in order that its greatest
portion in length may be placed in contact with the rod, and receive from it a
greater influence. To give a direction to it we place at the centre, forming one
body with this rod and with the pivot, a very small wire of tempered steel, very
feebly magnetized, to which is imparted only the quantity of magnetism rigor-
ously necessary to draw the large needle near the horizontal rod.

To obtain the maximum of sensibility, it is necessary that the movable needle
should not be of steel; for however little magnetism might be given it or be
received by it, whether from its position in the magnetic meridian, or through
oxidation, it would act on the particles of iron contained in all the coppers of
commerce, and thus alter the great sensibility of this instrument.

The electrometer is covered with a glass cylinder, the upper flat surface of
which presents another graduated circle, corresponding to the lower circle. In
this way the visual ray passes by the same degrees in the two circles, and thus
no error of parallax is to be apprehended.

Peltier had further added a movable armature. ‘This was a plate of copper,
of the length of the needle, and placed at the same height. It was worked by
means of a horizontal lever, situated below the foot-stand. This armature con-
siderably augmented the sensibility of the instrument; unfortunately it some-
what embarrassed the phenomena, and the instrument lost im point of exactness;
hence Peltier seldom employed it.

The manner of using this electrometer is very simple. The apparatus is
placed in the magnetic meridian, so that the needle may touch lightly the fixed
rod. ‘The instrument being thus adjusted, we touch the exterior ball or the
plate with the body char wed with the electricity which we wish to measure, and
immediately the needle deviates by a certain number of degrees, which may be
read on the dial. Thus we have results perfectly comparable; the fixed rod and
the movable needle, always in metallic contact, maintain infallibly an equilibrium
of electricity.

However ‘light the indicating needles, their weight occasions a slight friction
on the concave plane which supports the pivot. This frietion gives to the instru-
ment a small resistance which prevents it from obeying at ‘the instant, when
very weak quantities of electricity are either added or withdrawn. To overcome
this resistance, it is sufficient in general to strike lightly on the table which
supports the electrometer.

For those who have an electrometer, but no torsion balance, it is necessary
that the electrometer should be capable of being transformed at will to a torsion
balance. Peltier added, therefore, to his electrometer different pieces, with a
view of rendering this transformation possible and easy. ‘The pieces are the

following: 1°. A gallows formed of a foot of copper or ivory, screwed in the
pedestal; of a vertical staff of glass, 25 centimetres in length, and of a hori:
zontal bridge of copper, he free extremity of which corresponds exactly to the
centre of the dial-plate. 2°. An apparatus destined to carry the wire and pos-
sessing two very ae es a horizontal and circular, the other ver-
tical and rectilinear. A silver wire of the utmost fineness, terminated at its
lower extremity by a ae cylinder of gum-lac, having beneath it two small
copper hooks designed to carry the needle.

In order to transform the electrometer into a torsion bal: ance, it is enough to
lower the wire by means of the vertical and rectilinear movement above indi-
cated, to seize the needle with the two hooks, and again sufliciently raise the

whole; by this means, in effect, the indicating needle, instead of being sup-
182 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

ported by the point of the pivot resting in the steel cup, is suspended by the
silver wire, without being, however, in metallic contact with it, simce it is sepa-
rated from it by the small cylinder of Capers

When these changes have been made, the electrometer has become a torsion
balance; only, if we wish to use it as such, it is necessary to withdraw from
the indicating needle the small wire of magnetized steel, or still better, to have
a spare nce dle for exchange. There remains but one other condition to fulfil in
order that the torsion balance should be completely prepared ; that is, to estab-
lish the communication between the needle and the capsule, though with the
exclusion of all friétion.

In the torsion balances, Peltier employs acidulated water, because the point
which descends into the liquid is of platina; but here, as the point is a pivot of
steel, even pure water cannot be used, much less acidulated water, for the pivot
would be soon oxidized. Doubtless this communication might be established
by means of mercury poured into the little eup; but this metal is too resistant,
and detracts much from the sensibility of the instrument. ‘There is, besides, an
inconvenience in using it; its resistance prevents the needle from placing itself
perfectly at its centre “of ‘eravity ; whence it results that the suspending wire,
instead of being vertical, has a slight inclination, and consequently the needle
has a tendency to fall to one side. The liquid which suits best is a solution of
potash, for this preserves unimpaired the polish of iron and steel, and sutlices as
a conductor for the electricity of tension between two bodies in such close prox-
imity as the steel cup and its pivot.

At first Peltier had given to his electrometer dimensions somewhat large. It

was then, in effect, a cabinet instrument; but afterwards, when he occupied him-
self with meteorology, he perceived the necessity of reducing these dimensions,
in order to render it more manageable and portable; he therefore constructed
an electrometer of small size and very nearly conformed to the proportions of
an ordinary electroscope. ‘This instrument has been also adjusted to the use for
which it was to serve. The fixed rod no longer communicates outside laterally
and by the foot-stand; its interior extremity, that which is above the centre of
the dial, is curved from below upwards, and issues from the casing by its upper
wall; it is then prolonged vertically for two decimetres, and is surmounted by
a hollow metallic ball, eight centimetres in diameter. This is the atmospheric
electrometer of Peltier.

We must not quit this subject without mentioning that these electrometers all
require that a table giving the ratio of the forces to the are of deviation should
be constructed for each of them, It is the same, in effect, with electrometers
as with galvanometers: their angular deviation is not proportional to the forces.

IIT.—DyYNAMIC ELECTRICITY.—VOLTAIC PILE.

Of the pile of Volta and the theory of contact—The most usual source of
dynamic electricity is the pile of Volta. This is one of the most admirable
instruments with which the genius of man has enriched science, and numerous
physicists have occupied themselves with its theory.

Volta supposed that at the contact of two heterogeneous metals, there is a
force which constantly decomposes their natural electricity; that this force pro-
jects on the one side positive and on the other negative electricity; that the
interposed liquid serves only as a conductor to allow the recombination in the
neutral fluid of the two opposite currents. It was this decomposing power
placed at the ecntact of the metals that he called the electro-motive force. This
theory has received the name of the theory of contact.

According to this theory, the liquid acts but as a conductor; an experiment
of Davy’s, however, soon evinced the inexactness of this assertion. After hav-
ing constracted a battery of cups, of copper and iron, Davy first poured pure
APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 183

water in the jars; the iron became positively electrified, and was oxidized; the
copper, on the contrary, was negatively electrified, and disengaged hydrogen.
In a second experiment, in place of pure water, Davy poured into the jars sul-
phur of potassium; immediately the iron became negative, and disengaged
hydrogen, while the copper became positive, and was oxidized. The poles of
the pile were therefore inverted, and the direction of the current had been
changed with the nature of the liquid body interposed.

Experiment of Peltier, proving that there is no electro-motive force on the con-
tact of the two metals—We are also indebted to Peltier for an experiment which
completely overthrows the theory of Volta, and which proves, in the most pesi-
tive manner, that there is not an electro-motive force at the contact of the two
elements of zine and copper. As this experiment is of the highest importance
for the theory of the pile, we shall report it with some details.*

We plunge in two separate vases, well insulated and filled with the same
liquid, the extremities of a pair, zinc and copper. We first immerse the end of
a wire of platina din the vase A which has received the zine, and the other end
of the wire communicates with
the ground. By means of an-
other wire of platina e, which
is kept insulated by a sleeve
of gum-lac f, we successively
put in communication the zine,
the copper, and the liquid of
the vase B which has received
the copper, with one of the con-
densing plates g of an electro-
meterh. Agreeably to this ar-
rangement, the liquid cannot possess free electricity, since it communicates with
the ground, and the zine can as little possess it, since the electro-motive force,
according to the theory, results from the contact of the zinc and copper. — It is not
thus that the distribution is effected : the liquid of the vase A is neutral, but the
zinc, the copper, and the liquid B, are negative in the same degree. We place
now the end d of the platina wire, communicating with the ground, in the vase
B, and interrogate, in the same manner, by means of the insulated platina wire e,
the copper, the zine, and the liquid of the vase A, which is then insulated. ‘The
liquid of B is necessarily neutral, as well as the copper which is plunged in it,
but the same is the case with the zine, which is also neutral; the water of the
vase A alone is positive.

This experiment demonstrates that the electricity of a zine and copper pair is
not produced, as Volta thought, by the contact of the two metals; it proves,
moreover, that it is produced on the contact between the acidulated liquid A
and the portion of zine which is immersed. There could be, then, no longer any
doubt about the error of Volta; for, on his theory, the zinc and copper would
be in different electric states, and this experiment proves, on the contrary, that
they are both one and the other in the same state.

Since the electricity proceeds, not from the contact between the two heteroge-
neous metals, and is produced on the surface of the zinc moistened by the acid-
ulated liquid—on the surface which the acidulated liquid attacks chemically—
everything tends to the conclusion that it is the chemical action itself which pro-
duces the electricity. This opinion, proposed for the first time in 1801 by Par-
rot, supported by the experiments of Febroni, Wollaston, Faraday, and Becquerel,
was again-considered, in 1828, by M. de la Rive, to whom pertains the honor of hay-
ing first made known, in a clear and satisfactory manner, the true theory of the pile.

Chemical theory of the pile, by de la Rive-—According to this distinguished

physicist, the origin of the electricity of the pile of Volta is the chemical action
which takes place between the acidulated liquid and the zinc. The negative
electricity diffuses itself over the metal attacked, the positive electricity diffuses
itself in the acidulated liquid. ‘These plecencties are afterwards neutralized,
each on its side, with the opposite eleetricities of the adjacent pairs, and the
same fact reappears as far as the two extremities of the pile, which alone are in
possession of free electricity. In a well-constructed pile, according to M. de la

Rive, there is a neutralization of all the intermediate eleciricities ; “all the ne@a-
tive portions are neutralized by equal positive portions, proceeding from: the
pairs in juxtaposition ; there are none free but the electricities of the two extreme
elements, and these polar electricities have, in order to become neutralized, only
the are inter posed between them or a return by the pile.

From this it is evident that the quantity of electricity found at the poles of a
battery is independent of the number of pairs, and that the number of pairs
must only angment the difficulty of recomposition backwards; that is to say,
must augment t the tendency of the electricity to combine forwards. But in phys-
ics it is not enough to advance a theory more or less satisfactory : it is necessary to
demonstrate it ; it is necessary to prove the reality by numerous and positive experi-
ments which can leave no doubt or uncertainty ; it is necessary, in a word, to antici-
pate all objections and answer them in advance. 'Thisis what Peltier has done*

Summary of Peltier’s researches on the Voltare pile—According to Peltier, in
a current there are two very different things to be distinguished: the quantity
and the intensity. The quantity is the number of electric perturbations which
traverse a conductor in a unit of time. The intensity is the power which a cur
rent possesses of overcoming the resistance of the conductors presented to it.

Peltier, to whom we are indebted for having clearly established this distinc-
tion, has demonstrated by multiplied experiments that in a battery the quantity
of electricity produced is in a ratio with the number of molecules pertaining to
one and the same surface, and undergoing a change in their equilibrium ; “but
that, in the estimate of the quantity of electricity which passes by the conduet-
ors in the state of a current, it is necessary to regard the resistance of these
conduetors, because these resistances almost always cause a portion of the quan-
tity of electricity produced to be in return neutralized. He has shown that
when the resistance of the conductors is null, the quantity of electricity which
passes by the closed cireuit is proportional to the quantity of molecules attacked
on the same surface.

He has proved that when a battery is well constructed and the circuit without
resistance, the entire pile gives no more electricity than a single one of its pairs;
consequently that when it is desirable to have a current of quantity, it is neces-

sary to use a battery with pairs of large dimensions.

it was generally ‘thought that in a Datter y, when one pair was smaller than
thé others, this small pair decided the quantity of the whole current. Peltier
proved that this opinion was not wholly exact. No doubt this small pair dimin-
ishes the quantity of the current. In consequence of its resistance, which is greater
by reason of its very littleness, it forces a portion of the electricity which reaches
it to recombine behind it, but it gives passage as a simple conductor to the rest.

By means of positive experiments, Peltier has demonstrated that the intensity
of a current, that is to say, the power it possesses of overcoming obstacles, is
only due to the greater obstacles situated bebind to prevent retrogradation. of
the two polar eleotrivities by the battery. Now, these obstacles may be of two
sorts: they may proceed from the reduplic ation ina battery of the same pairs,
or else from a more profound alteration in the state of equilibrium of’ the mole-
cules. In the first case, the intensity is proportional to the number of pairs; in
the second, it depends on the power of action of the disturbing substance.

‘* Definition of the words electric quantity and intensit , drawn from direct experiments.”
q i Mi P

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 185

Peltier has also proved that a current endowed with a great intensity is iden-
tical with a current which possesses but a feeble one, and that these currents of
great and feeble intensity produce the same effects on bodies when they traverse
them in equal quantities. He has established, by two series of new experiments,
the one dynamic, the other static, that in a battery well constructed there is a
neutralization of ei the intermediate electricities ; that all the negative portions
are neutralized by equal positive portions proceeding from the pairs in front of
them, and that there are no free electricities but those of the extreme elements,
which, to become neutralized, have only the are interposed between them, or a
return by the battery. Finally, he proved that it was always by its quantity
that a current acted, but on the condition of being aecomp: anied by a suflicient
intensity ; for, without this intensity, the current could not pass in suitable quan-
tity to produce action; the resistance of the conductors would oppose itself to
that action.

We proceed now to indicate the chief experiments by means of which Peltier
has demonstrated the principles above stated. These experiments are almost
all derived from the memoir of Peltier, already cited, on the electric quantity
and intensity.

Experiments of Peltier relative to the quantity and intensity of a current.—
Tf we take a voltaic pair consisting of two fine wires, zinc and copper, immerse it in
common water, and complete the circuit by a copper wire of the length of 300
metres, there is a continuous current in this closed circuit. If this wire be pre-
sented above a magnetized needle, the needle will not be deflected from its posi-
tion of equilibrium in the magnetic meridian; the action of the current will not
be powerful enongh to overcome the influence of the terrestrial magnetism.
But if this needle be surrounded with 100 or 200 coils of the long wire, there
will be at once a notable deviation; if the number of coils be increased to 2,000,
the deviation will extend as far as 60 degrees.

In this experiment, the primitive current has not been changed or altered.
We have only produced a factitious quantity by conducting it 2 ,000 times around
a magnetized needle, so that it may act as the primitive quantity multiplied by
2,000. It is very evident in this experiment that it is by the quantity that the
power of action has been enhanced, and not by some other modification. It is,
therefore, through its quantity that a current acts on the magnetized needle.

If, now, we take a thermo-electric pair, zine and copper of five square milime-
tres, ‘heat one of the solderings to 40 degrees, and complete the circuit by the
sort of roultiplier which we had previously formed, the needle will be not at all
deflected; the electricity will not pass. But if we retrench 1,860 coils and
shorten the conductor to this extent, the multiplier, now reduced to 200 coils,
will begin to give notable deviations. If we reduce it to 10 coils, the deviation
will be considerably augmented. If, in fine, we reduce it to a single coil,
formed of a sirip of copper containing as much substance as the 2,000 coils, the
deviation may proceed even to 60 degrees.

The quantity of electricity produced in this experiment by the thermo-electric
pair is evidently 2,000 times greater than that of the above hydro- electric paw,
since we obtain the same deviation with a single coil as with the factitious quan-
tity given by the reduplication of, the coils. Nor is this all: in the first experi-
ment the length of the conducting Wire was easily traversed by the hydro-
electric current; the inertia of the “matter was overcome without ‘difficulty and
without appreciable loss of the current. In the second experiment this inertia
could not be overcome; the power of action was insufficient, and it was neces-
sary to reduce the cireuit to a very small length for the electricity to be able to
traverse it. ‘There are two quite distinct conditions, then, which we must not
confound: to act by the guantity, or to overcome the resistance of the conduct-
ors by a power independent of the quantity, and which Peltier called antensity,
reserving the name of tension for static electricity.
186 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

To throw better light on the nature of these phenomena, Peltier varied the
experiments. He formed a quintuple helix of 240 coils; in other words, on a
helix of 240 coils he superposed a second in all respects similar, but insulated
from the first, then a third, a fourth, and finally a fifth. This quintuple helix
was So constructed that the homologous ends might be united and then form
but one helix of 240 coils, having five times more of substance; they might
also be united in a battery, that is ; to say the end of the first might be joined
to the beginning of the second, the end of the second to the beginning of the
third, &e. ; ; forming thus a helix of 1,200 coils, being a helix five times longer,
but having five times less substance than each spire.

When a magnetized bar is placed in this apparatus to produce a current of
induction, results exactly inverse are obtained according as one or the other
of these last arrangements is employed. Suppose*that we unite the helices by
their homologous ends, and that we have taken a rheometer of a single coil,
the deviation will increase as the number of helices united by their homologous
ends; that is to say, as the arte of substance modified. ‘Thus, assuming
that with one helix we have 5° of devi iation, with two we shall have 10°, w ith
three 15°, and proportionally fai five 25°. If we replace the galvanometer
of one coil by a multiplier of 2,000 coils, we shall have 35° of deviation with
a single helix. But we obtain no more by employing two, three, four, or five
helices, still supposed to be united by their homologous ends,

Suppose now that in place of uniting the five helices by their homologous
ends, we unite them in a battery, and that we make use of the rheometer of
one coil; we shall have 5° of deviation with a single helix, and we shall obtain
no more with two, three, four, or five helices united in battery. On the other
hand, suppose that we employ the rheometer of 2,000 coils, the deviation of the
needle will go on increasing in proportion as we auement the number of helices,
and it will attain its maximum or 90° after the fourth.

Thus we see there is complete opposition between the results, the reason of
which is simple: with a rheometer of a single coil, the resistance of the con-
ductor ao be considered as null. When the helices are united by their homo-
logous ends, the quantity of substance altered is augmented, and consequently
the quantity of electricity produced. Now, as the conductor offers no resist-
ance, this constantly increasing quantity of electricity passes without difficulty
and eradually angments the angular deviation of the needle. On the contrary,
when we take a rheometer of 2,000 coils, the resistance of the conductor is
great, the quantity of electricity produced i is in vain augmented ; no more of it
passes, it returns backward and is neutralized by the electromoter itself. The

sole means of making more pass, is to unite the helices in battery ; then, in
effect, we augment the difficulties to the retrogradation of the two électricities,
and force them consequently to recombine in advancing. Peltier formed still
another multiple helix, of which the wires were of different and proportioned
magnitudes, ‘The result was still that the quantity was given by the mass, and
the intensity by the reduplication of the spires. He repeated the same experi-
ments with thermo-electric and with hydro-electric pairs. These gave analo-
gous results; the quantity depended on the quantity of matter altered in each
element, and the intensity on the number of interposed pairs undergoing the
same alterations. We shall content ourselves with speaking of the results
yielded by the hydro-electric pairs.

In ‘one experiment, five square centimetres of a voltaic pair, immersed in
acidulated water, gave two proportional degrees :

Tn this experiment the conductor was short and very large, consequently the
resistance might be considered as null; on repeating the same experiments with
APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 187

a battery of six pairs of the same dimensions, the same results were obtained,
and not a degree more.

If, on the contrary, the interposed are conducts feebly, the angular deviation
is no longer propor tional to the surface immersed. In another series of experi-
ments, Peltier caused a current to pass into a trough full of water, in which he
could interpose, at pleasure, diaphragms of platina, and he reached the fullow-

ing results :

The galvanometer employed in this experiment was an instrument of 430 coils.

The inspection of this table suffices to remove all doubts: as long as there
was no diaphragm, two pairs were sufficient to give 40 degrees of ¢ alvanometric
deviation, equivalent to 102 of force; when there were two diaphragms, five
pairs were needed to arrive at the same angular deviation. When there was
one diaphragm, three pairs gave 32°=48.5 of forees; with two diaphragms
there was but 24°25; to regain the 32° it was necessary to employ four pairs.
With three diaphragms there resulted for three pairs only 20°20); foro:
pairs only 26°=28. To regain or nearly regain the 320=48 5, it was neces-
sary to employ five pairs. Tn effect, by taking three pairs, there resulted, with
one diaphragm, 32°=48.5, with two diaphragms 24° = 25, with three dia-
phragms 20°=20. ‘Thus the quantity of the current continued diminishing in
proportion as the resistance of the conductor augmented. T'urther, to regain ‘that
quantity, it sufficed to increase the number of pairs; then, indeed, the resistance
of the conduetor was overcome and the same quantity of electricity passed anew,

The inspection of this table proves, therefore, that to have the same number
of degrees after a different number of alternatives, it is necessary to modify the
electric source, and that the same deviation can never be reproduced after the
addition of a diaphragm, if the number of pairs be not augmented. ‘The table
shows, also, that the loss of the current is so much less as the current has
already traversed a greater number of diaphragms. Thus, we find in the second
line for two pairs 102: 21.2 , 14, and 12. The first diaphragm, eee, has
caused the current to lose + of its quantity ; the second, 3; the third, +. It is
not, as has been said, that the electricity, better sifted, passes more easily
through the new obstacles opposed to it; the electricity has not changed its
nature, but it is that after baving trav ersed, say two diaphragms, if a third be
presented to it, it has, in order to retrograde, to surmount anew the resistance
of the first two diaphragms ; it is no longer simply the obstacle of the battery
which opposes itself to its equilibration in returning, there are besides the two
diaphragms which it has already passed. From this it results that the more
diaphragms the current has traversed, the more resistance it finds im its return,
and the less loss it sustains consequently by the interposition of another dia-
phragm.

From what precedes we shall readily comprehend the gravity of the error
committed by physicists, and especi ially by the German physicists, who, in their
experiments on currents, in general only consider the current itself, and take
little or no account of the eleciro- motor. <A current, however : is not an ideal
existence which can be divorced from the source w hich fives rise to it.

Ohm and Gauss have, in their formulas, recognized as a principle that metallic
threads oppose to the passage of electric currents a resistance alw ays directly

proportional to their length, and inversely proportional to the surface of their
transverse section. It would be desirable, certainly, that this law might be
considered exact ; but unfortunately it is not so, for Peltier has demonstrated
that there are e very great differences between the losses undergone by a current
which traverses different lengths of the same wire according to the kind of elec-
tro-motor employed ; according as we have to do witha hydro-electric pile, a
thermo-electric pile, or with electricity by mduction. Further, for the same
electro-motor the results vary according to the greater or less power of the dis-
turbing action.*

Reply of Peltier to an objection made to the chemical theory of the voltaie pile.—
The partisans of the theory of contact had often objected that it is not always
the bodies most strongly attacked which give mest élecizicity. Tow, said they,
should chemical action be the canse of currents, when we obtain by the least
oxidation of zine in pure water a current superior to that given by copper
plunged in nitric acid, which devours it in a few instants ? Peltier has supplied
the explanation of this apparent anomaly. t

To have full (nombreux) currents, it is not only necessary that there should
be much electricity produced, but, moreover, that the two electricities should be
collected, each separately, at the moment of their production ; this takes place
with the zinc, but does not take place with the copper. When an acid attacks

and oxidizes the zine, that oxide remains adherent to the metallic plate; the —

negative electricity can therefore easily diffuse itself over this last. On the
contrary, when ihe acid attacks copper, the resulting oxide does not remain
adherent to the metal; it falls into the acidulated liquid, leaving the copper still
bright and clean. Of course, in this case, there must be a vast quantity of
electricity lost ; in effect, the chemical combination is no longer -accomplished,
as in the preceding case, in contact with a good conductor ; it ‘takes place in the
midst of an acidulated liquid ; - it hence results that the negative electricity is
recombined, in part at least, with the positive electricity which is present in the acid,
What has been said above explains the utility of the amalgamation of the
positive elements in batteries ; the combination of the oxygen of the solution
not being capable of accomplishment except in the interstices of the mercury
the electric phenomenon is enveloped by a conducting metal, and the resinous
electricity, thus collected from all parts, is propagated through the conductor to
become again neutralized with the vitreous electricity ¢ abandoned to the liquid.

TV.—CYANO-POLARIMETRY.

Peltier had occupied himself much with that branch of the physical sciences
which treats.of light. It will be readily understood that, desiring to penetrate
as far as possible ‘into a know ledge of the intimate structure of bodies, he would
not neglect the study of optics. There is , indeed, no science more useful or
necessary in this point of view, for there is none in which molecular actions and
influences are more distinctly defined; there is none of which the general theory
is so complete and satisfying. Independently of many other circumstances, this
is referable to a fact which has not perhaps been sufliciently remarked. For the
study of caloric, of electricity, of magnetism, there is always need of instru-
ments, and these instruments s, produets of our industry and ingenuity, are always
more or less awkward; we must have recourse to the thermometer, the galvan-
ometer, the different compasses of declination, inclination, &c. For light, on
the contrary, we need them not; the instrument has been conferred on us ready
made by nature, and is of an admirable sensibility: it is the eye. Peltier had
given, therefore, much attention to the phenomena of light and had perfectly

mastered them; but he had experimented little, and all that remains to us of
his in this branch of physics is the improvement which he applied to the eyano-
polarimeter of Arago.

Every one knows how much the azure color of the sky varies with the quan-
tity and state of the vapors diffused in the atmosphere; every one knows also,
since the discovery of M. Arago and the researches of MM. Quetelet and Dele-
zeune, that the air polarizes light and that the intensity of this polarization is
not the same at all points of the sky, nor the same for the same point at all
hours. There was nothing, for a long time, wherewith to measure the variations
of the azure of the sky but the cyanometer of Saussure; for the cyanometer of
Arago, as designed by him in 1817, had never been realized. As to the polari-
zation of the ‘atmosphere, there existed for its study only the polariscope of
Savart and that of Arago. But the cyanometer of Saussure is a very imperfect
instrument which can yield none but very uncertain results; as regards the
polariscopes of Savart and Arago, they are both, it is true, extremely sensitive,
but as they are destitute of the means of measurement, they could not serve for
exact observations.

In the sitting of 25th of October, 1841, Arago communicated to the Academy
of Sciences a “polarimeter of lis own invention. This instrument was the
polariscope proposed by the same savant in 1811, but to which a particular
apparatus had been adapted. ‘The polariscope of Arago becomes a polarimeter
by the sole addition of one or more plates of glass with parallel faces, placed
in front of the old instrument. These plates are movable. A graduated circle
indicates the inclination under which the light has traversed them, before pene-
trating into the polariscope, properly so called. The proportion of polarized
light contained in the pencil observed is deduced from the angle at which it is
necessary to adjust the plates of glass in order to perceive no longer any trace
of color athwart the whole apparatus.

In the sitting just mentioned, Arago had presented to the academy the instra-
ment as constructed and arranged by himself; at a suecceding session, Novem-
ber 15, he submitted to the inspection of the academy this same polarimeter
constructed upon his model, but executed by M. Soleil; this instrument is known
as the cyano- polarimeter of Arago. Capable‘of serving at once as a cyanometer
and polarimeter, it was, beyond doubt, greatly superior to the instruments pre-
viously in use for studying the variations of the blue color of the sky and the
differences in the quantity of light polarized by the atmosphere; yet was it not
without defects: first, as concerns cyanometry, it wanted several Important
means of measurement; then, as regards polarimetry, it could in reality render
service in only two rectangular planes : in the plane, namely, of the meridian,
and in that of the equator of the aerial sphere, of which the sun is one of the
poles, and the anti-sun the other pole; outside of these two planes, it could be
of no utility. Peltier applied himself to correct these defects,and completely
succeeded in doing so.

Optical pr inciples of cyanometry.—Ilf we take a crystal having a single axis
of double refraction, such as Iceland-spar, the beryl, &c., and cut from ‘its mass

a slip of which the two faces shall be exactly perpendicular to that axis, and
if we then cause a ray of polarized white light to fall perpendicularly on this
slip, so that it shall traverse the crystal exactly i in the direction of its axis, the
ray will undergo modification. If we now analyze it on its emergence with an
achromatic double- refracting prism, taking care to place the principal section of
this prism in the plane itself of the polarization of the ray, the ordinary image
contains the entire ray; that is to say, the complimentary tints are black and
white, and there is no coloration. Quartz, however, forms an exception to this
rule. When, in effect, a ray of polarized white light is made to pass through a
lamina of quartz (rock crystal) ent perpendicularly to the axis, and this ray, as
in the previous case, exactly follows the direction of the asis, if we in like man-
190 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

ner analyze it at its emergence with an achromatic double-refracting prism, we
shall see two images always colored and presenting complementary colors which
change when the bi- refracting prism ismade to revolve. The reason of this
difference is the following:

A ray of white light polarized is a ray of which all the constituent colored

rays have vibrations which are always executed in the same plane. Now, if
such a ray be made to pass through a crystal with a single axis, the planes of
polarization of these different rays are ‘not modified. ‘The colored rays issue
from it as they had entered, and consequently the bi-refracting prism employed
to study the white ray at its emergence can produce no other phenomena than
those which it produces with all ordinary polarized rays.

It is not the same when quartz is employed. ‘This mineral, in effect, has the
property of deflecting the plane of polarization of the different-colored rays
constituting the polarized white ray. ‘he lamina of quartz turns these different
planes around its axis, so that the planes might be said to follow a spiral situated
within the crystal; the plane of polarization of the red ray is the least deflected,
being that which makes the smallest angle with the primitive plane of polariza-
tion; on the contrary, the plane of polarization of the violet ray is most deflected,
being that which makes the greatest angle with the above definitive plane. It
is thus seen that in the deflection of their planes of polarization, the rays follow
the order of their respective refrangibilities, beginning with the least refrangible.
When, therefore, the polarized white ray issues from the lamina of quartz, the
colored rays which constitute it have each their plane of special polarization—
have each particular and different planes in which their vibrations are performed.
When we proceed, then, to analyze such a ray with an achromatic double-refract-
ing prism, the colors are distributed in unequal proportions among the ordinary
and extraordinar y pencils, which consequently produce colored and complimentary
images.

The planes of polarization of the colored rays which have traversed the axis
of a lamina of quartz deviate from their primitive position by a quantity propor-
tional to the thickness of the lamina. They exhibit a double angular deviation
for a double thickness, and, at the moment of their emergence they present pre-
cisely the position in which they would o¢cur if they had been made to turn
uniformly in the same direction around the axis during their transit through the
lamina. From this it will be seen, that by giving to the lamina of quartz a
sufficient thickness, the primitive plane of polarization ofa ray might be made
to turn even several semi-circumferences. ‘This shows that there isa fundamental
difference between the action of the quartz on a polarized white ray, and that of
a prism of glass on a ray of natural light; it is, in effect, that the first is a molec-
ular action, while the second is due only to the difference of refractive power of
the surfaces.

By giving a suitable thickness to the lamina of quartz, we may obtain, there-
fore, such a tint as is desired for a given position of the principal section of the
prism. M. Arago has, with reason, chosen the thickness which gives a pure
blue of the second order in the ordinary image; this thickness isin general from .
six to seven millimetres.

It results from what has been said, that the intensity of the blue color in the
ordinary ray depends upon the perfection of the polarization of the ray which
falls on the lamina of quartz, on the thickness of that lamina, and on the posi-
tion of the bi-refracting prism. or a constant thickness of the lamina and an
equally constant position of the bi-refracting prism, the intensity of the color
can, therefore, only depend on the greater or less perfection in the polarization
of the incident ray; in other words, on the relative polarization of that ray.
Now, when the pile of glasses in the cyano-polarimeter is perpendicular to the
incident ray, the polarization is null, and consequently the coloration is equally
null, ‘The more the pile is inclined and the incidence of the ray oblique, the
APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 191

more perfect is the polarization and the more intense the blue color of the ordinary
ray. Fora pile of eight glasses, the polarization may be considered as perfect
when the ray of light. reaches it under an incidence of 10 degrees; it is at that
point, therefore, that we should have the most intense blue, and it is evidently
this angle which might serve as a point of departure, were it not for the cireum-
stance which I am about to mention. The pile of glasses transmits, in effect,
only a part more or less considerable of the incident light, and reflects the rest.
Now, when the incidence of the ray is too oblique, the quantity of reflected
light is so much augmented that more is lost in vivacity of color by the reflec-
tion, than is gained by the perfection of the polarization. There is, therefore,
an angle at which the polarized ray gives a maximum of the i image ; ‘that point
passed, the ray still gains in polarization, but loses considerably in brightness.
Jt is thought by most authors that this maximum is obtained when the pile of
glasses makes with a perpendicular to the ray an angle of 55°; in other words,
when the ray reaches the pile under an incidence of 35°* It is in fact under
this angle that we obtain the maximum of absolute, but not of relative polari-
zation.

This is the angle also that Peltier has taken as being that which gives the
maximum blue. “I confess, however, that it has appeared to me that we should
still gain by continuing to incline the pile. We lose, it is true, a little in light,
but to me it has seemed that the blue tint became more pronounced. I think
that the angle which gives the maximum of coloration is rather between 25° and
30° than at 35° ; it may be, however, that this would vary according to the indi-
vidual.

Optical principles of polarimetry.—W e now pass to polarimetry. In researches
on this subject, the observer is always supposed at the centre of a sphere of
which the sun is one of the poles and the anti-sun the other. This sphere has
its meridian and its equator, endowed with the properties which characterize
those great circles.

We will suppose, then, the axis of the objective tube to be in the plane of
the meridian, the pile also, and moreover rectangular with the incident ray; we
will suppose, in fine, that the index of the ocular points to the zero of the
graduated circle. If now, by means of the vertical joint, the objective tube be
carried successively to all points of the meridian of the optical sphere which we
are considering, the following is what we observe: the rays proceeding directly
from the sun and those little distant from them give no signs of polarization,
and consequently no coloration in the images, but in proportion as the angle of
the radius vector with the direct rays of the sun is enlarged, the signs of polar-
ization supervene and coloration makes its appearance. ‘The extraordinary
image takes the blue color, and the ordinary image assumes the orange-yellow
complementary tint.

The intensity of the tints increases up to about 90°, that is to say, to about
the point of intersection of the meridian and equator; thence it decreases till
about 150°. This number attained, we find the neutral point for whose discov-
ery we are indebted to M. Arago. Beyond this, polarization is again reproduced,
but in an opposite direction; that is, the plane of polarization of these new
polarized rays is perpendicular to the plane of polarization of the preceding ;
consequently it is no longer the extraordinary image which is colored blue; it is
the ordinary image.

This singular change in the plane of polarization of the reflected rays results
from the Circarmasice that that portion of the sky no longer reflects the rays
proceeding directly from the sun in so great quantity as “the rays proceeding
from the different illuminated points at the horizon. Consequently the neutral

of M. Arago evidently results from the union of equal rays polarized rectanga-

192, APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

larly, for such rays conduet themselves like the rays of natural light. M. Arago
has remarked, moreover, that this point does not always correspond to the ver-
tical plane passing by the sun, but that it is sometimes found diverted to the
right or to the left, when the reflection is altered in one of the reflecting sectors,
whether this alteration proceeds from the presence of clouds, or from that of
diffused vapors, or from the neighborhood of a mountain, &c.

We will not enter into further details on this subject; it may suffice to direct
the reader’s attention to the original researches of M. Arago, as well as to those
of MM. Quetelet and Delezenne.* It may be stated, however, that a second
neutral point has been found by M. Babinet, about 30° above the setting sun,
and a third by Mr. Brewster, below the setting sun; but these two neutral points
are rather diflicult to be observed. All these neutral points, it may be added,
exist only in the meridian or in the great circles but shghtly remote from it.

We have supposed that the pile was placed in the plane of the meridian, and
that it presented itself perpendicularly to the incident ray. If during the move-
ment communicated to the eye-glass along the meridian, we incline the pile on
the axis of the luminous pencil, the intensity of the colors will be seen to dimin-
ish; in a word, the pile then depolarizes the atmospheric ray. It depolarizes it,
however, unequally, according to the direction that is given to its inclination;
for if it is inclined towards the sun it depolarizes rapidly and completely, while
if it is inclined in. the other direction, towards the opposite pole, it depolarizes
much less and often very little.

If now the tube of the eye-glass be turned in its collar, so that the plane of
the pile shall be perpendicular to the meridian, and if, in this new position the
pile be inclined on the incident ray, the intensity of the tints is augmented,
instead of diminishing as in the previous case. Thus, in the first position, that
of the pile in the plane of the optical meridian, the pile in inclining depolarized
the rays of the atmosphere; in the second, on the contrary, it adds new polar-
ized rays to those which already existed.

Instead of placing the instrument in the plane of the meridian, the observer
may place it in the plane of the equator; suppose, then, the objective tube of
the polarimeter in this latter plane, and that the pile also be in the same
plane, and thus presents itself perpendicularly to the incident rays; if now we
direct the instrument in succession to all points of the equator, from the maxi-
mum point, which has its place on the meridian at the intersection of these two
ereat circles, to the horizon, we shall find the extraordinary image colored blue ;
moreover that it preserves the same intensity in the whole line of the equatorial
circle; only in approaching the horizon, the tint becomes a little weakened,
through the vapors diffused in the strata of air very near the surface of the globe.
We have supposed the pile in the plane of the equator and perpendicular to the
incident rays; if wefincline it on those rays the intensity of the colors is aug-
mented; if, on the contrary, we place it perpendicularly to that plane its inclina-
tion depolarizes the atmospheric rays and renders the images colorless.

Thus in the two great rectangular circles which we have been considering,
one forming the meridian of the optical sphere and the other its equator, the
extraordinary ray is blue, the ordinary ray has the complementary tint, orange
yellow; the pile adds to the atmospheric polarity when it is parallel to the
equator, while, on the contrary, it depolarizes when perpendicular to it. As to
the horizon, if we examine it at the moment of the rising or setting of the sun,
it will be found that the coloration is null for the rays which proceed directly
from that luminary; that it increases up to about 90°; that it then diminishes till
about 180°, where it is at its minimum; that it recovers anew till about 2707,
where is found a second maximum, to again disappear when it falls within the
too direct rays of the sun.

* See the Correspondance Mathématique de M. Quetelet, t. 1, pp. 275 and 383. —

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 193

From the above, it is seen that the maximum of coloration is always found in
the extraordinary image, with the sun at 90°. Now, it is evident that this should
be so, since the angle of maximum polarization for the air is precisely at 45°.

If we look with the objective tube of the polarimeter towards a point of the
heavens situated outside of the optical meridian and equator, the blue of the
extraordinary image is altered; it becomes violet, or else green, according to
the direction of the displacement. This change in the tint of the images indi-
cates an equivalent change in the plane of the reflector or polarizer. T'o regain
the blue, it is necessary ‘to turn the: bi- refracting prism by an angular quantity
equal to the supposed angular deviation of the reflector, with a view to replacing
the principal section of the prism in the same relation that it had with the plane
of the polarized ray before this deviation of the reflector; we therefore turn the
ocular tube which bears the bi-refracting prism, until we shall have recovered
the blue; then we carefully note the number of degrees by which it has been
turned, for it is this notation which gives the position of the plane of polariza-
tion in the point of the atmosphere which we may be studying. Unluckily, the
rotation which has been communicated to the ocular to restore the blue of the
extraordinary image, has at the same time destroyed the blue of the ordinary
image which proceeds from the pile and from the other lamina of quartz—that is
to say, the blue which is to serve as a point of comparison; it was requisite,
therefcre, to find the means of reproducing the normal blue of the ordinary
image.

To attain this result, Peltier covered the cap of the left and his lamina of
quartz with another cap, turning with easy friction. In this new cap he set a
lamina of mica of a thickness sufficient to restore to the i image its normal blue by
turning the cap on itself, and placing by this means the principal section of the
lamina of mica in the plane necessary to obtain this restoration of the blue.

V.—METEOROLOGY.

Introduction.— Astronomical and meteorological phenomena are, beyond ques-
tion, the first which must have attracted the attention of man. The diumal
movement of the sun, its annual movement and the periodical return of the
seasons, must have so much the more interested him as they bore directly on his
existence and his material well-being. On the other hand, the astounding spec-
tacle of storms, the lightning and the thunder, could as little fail strongly to
impress his imagination. Everything, therefore, would lead us to conclude
that, from the earliest times, mankind have been seriously occupied with the
study of the different phenomena of astronomy and meteorology.

But if these two sciences were born at the same time, they are far from having
made the same progress. Astronomy has long ago pieced a certainty so great
that it may be considered in this respect the first of all the sciences of observa-

tion; meteoroloe y, on the contrary, is still in its infancy. The reason of this
| difference i is easily comprehended. The movements of the heavenly bodies are
subjected to a small number of very simple laws, always identical ; meteorolo-
gical phenomena, on the contrary, are generated by the action of a ‘host of dif-
| ferent causes, all widely diverse, and highly variable as to their nature, their
mode of action, their power and their mutual influence. But this is not all: to
arrive at the point it has attained, astronomy has had to ask little succor from
the other sciences ; it has, in some sort, had need only of direct observation for
the registration of facts, ’and of mathematics for their co-ordination and the
| deduction of consequences. It is not so with meteorology, for meteorology is
most frequently only the application of the different laws < physics to a par-
ticular class of phenomena, and could not exist in an independent manner ;
| meteorology, therefore, could make no real progress until other sciences, and
especially | physics, were sufficiently advanced to constitute a satisfactory body of
13s

194 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

doctrines. Now, the most important part of physics for meteorology, electricity,
dates back scarcely a century. The discovery of the Leyden jar by Musschen-
broeck and Cuneus dates from 1746, the experiments of Dalibard and of Frank-
lin from 1752; what could meteorology be before that epoch? Evidently it
could consist only of theories, of suppositions more or less vague and unmeaning;
in fact, before that epoch, but little consideration was applied to it. It was
quite otherwise after the period in question ; the discovery of Musschenbroeck
had aroused all thinking minds; the analogy between the electric spark and
the thunderbolt appeared evident ; all the world threw itself with ardor into
the study of electrical phenomena on the one hand, and of meteorological phe-
nomena on the other; a great number of savants devoted themselves to the
study of atmospheric electricity, and if the results at which they arrived had
not at first all the precision that might be desired, they always maintained an
interest which fostered and kept alive the general attention.

The number of savants who occupied themselves with experiments on atmo-
spheric electricity in the second half of the eighteenth century was very con-
siderable. Some of these, like Lemonnier, Ronayne, Read, Schiibler, made
use, by preference, of fixed apparatus, while others, like Romas, the prince
Galitzin, Musschenbroeck, Van Swinden, the duke de Chaulnes, Bertholon,
Franklin, Cavallo, joined thereto the use of the electrical kite. Beccaria, who
had at first experimented only with fixed apparatus, employed also the electrical
kite at a later date.

The results at which these savants arrived were most contradictory. Romas,
Galitzin, Musschenbroeck remarked from the beginning that the electric signs

varied with the course of the kite ; on the other hand, Beccaria, Read, Schiub-
ler, complained of the little accordance of the fixed apparatus ; hence it was
impossible to reach a conclusion even approaching certainty. Yet, as doubt is
always painful to the human mind, it came to be admitted generally, on the one
part, that the air was electrical; on the other, that the electricity of the air
proceeded from the evaporation which takes place at the surface of the soil.
For the substantiation of this opinion, reliance was placed on the old experi-
ments of Volta, Lavoisier, and Laplace, and on the more recent ones of M.
Pouillet. These experiments consisted in projecting water on a body raised to
a high temperature ; but it was M. Pouillet alone who had employed a crucible
of platina i in place of an oxidizable metal as the other physicists had done. In
these experiments the vapor formed, almost always yields electricity, and when
it does so it is always vitreous electricity.

The first thing which Peltier did was to repeat, while he also simplified, the
experiment of Ponillet, and he showed that the formation of vapors only gives
an appreciable electricity when the vase has a temperature of at least 110
degrees; that below that temperature the instruments can no longer collect any,
and fate in fine, even at that temperature they can only Ralicees it when here
has been calefaction and then decrepitation of the drop of water projected.*
The high temperature and the assemblage of phenomena necessary to maintain
separate the electricities produced, never meet together in our ambient medium ;
never does the vapor, when it rises on the surface of the soil, possess any con-
siderable tension; hence spontaneous evaporation gives no electrical signs,
unless under circumstances wholly peculiar.

Spontaneous evaporation being incapable of communicating electricity to
vapors, and those of the atmosphere containing considerable quantities of it,
Peltier felt engaged to seek the true origin of that electricity. He recurred,
therefore, to an old experiment of Sanssure and Ermann, which in their hands
had been barren of results; and as this experiment may be considered as the

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 195

fundamental basis of all meteorology, we judgé proper to recite it here with
some details.

A place is selected perfectly uncovered and commanding all the environing
objects ; an electroscope is to be taken furnished with a stem of about four
decimetres, surmounted by a ball of polished metal of a radius of from three to
four centimetres, with a view to augment the effects of influence and to avoid
the efflux of the electricity which may be repelled into the upper part; the
instrument is to be held with one hand, the equilibrium to be managed with the
other, in putting in communication the stem and the foot. All the reac-
tions being equal on one part and the other, the gold leaves of the electroscope
fall straight and mark zero. In this state of equilibrium the instrument may
be left in contact with the free air for a whole day under a clear sky without
the least sign of electricity being manifested ; it may even be moved and the
air agitated ; as long as the instrument is kept at the same altitude it remains
completely insensible. But if, instead of leaving it in the same horizontal stra-
tum of air, it be elevated from four to five decimeters, the gold leaves are at
once seen to diverge and to indicate a vitreous tension. If the instrument be
replaced at the point of departure the leaves again fall exactly to zero; if it be
sunk lower than this point of equilibrium the leaves diverge anew, ‘but now
they are charged with resinous electricity. On raising it again to the point of
departure the instrument resumes its zero, and retains ; nothing of the free elec-
tricities which it has for an instant shown.

Since no free electricity has remained in the instrument the air has of course
communicated nothing ta it, and the electrical signs which the instrument had
presented proceeded only from the electricity developed in its interior by the
influence of a neighboring body in proportion as it was brought nearer to or
removed further from it, by elevating the instrument above the point where it
had been in equilibrium or depressing it below that point: it suffices, in effect,
to replace the instrument at the same point to cause them to disappear. ‘They
were, I repeat, nothing more than signs of electricity by influence, such as may
be perceived in bodies which are brought near to or removed from another body
charged with free electricity, a phenomenon which may be reproduced in the
closet by placing one’s self on a resinous or a vitreous surface. The conse-
quence of this experiment is that dry air is not electrical of itself; that the
earth has a resinous tension, and space a vitreous tension. We may, in effect,
interpret this experiment in relation to space, or in relation to the earth. In the
first case we say if, after having placed an electroscope in equilibrium at a cer-
tain height, we raise it to a grei ater height, we approximate the terminal ball to
the celestial space or to the vitreous body. This latter then acts with more effi-
cacy ; it decomposes a portion of the natural electricity of the ball, attracts the
resinous and vepels the vitreous in the gold leaves which diverge and indicate a
vitreous tension. In the second case we say if, after having placed an electro-
scope in equilibrium at a certain height, we raise it to a greater height, the
foot of the instrument, forming with the arm which lifts it the extremity of a
point more elevated and conducting, becomes charged thereby with a more con-
siderable resinous tension; the resinous electricity thus accumulated in the pla-
tina and in the armatures acts now with more force, decomposes the’ natural
electricity of the upper part of the instrument, repels the resinous in the termi-
nal metallic globe, and attracts the vitreous in the gold leaves which diverge.
As may be seen, these two interpretations end in the same result ; but, accord-
ing to the ideas of Peltier on electricity, the last alone is logical and admissible.

‘Peltier may be considered as the founder of meteorology, No doubt, before
him, a great number of distinguished savants had oceupied themselves with this

branch of knowledge ; among the more recent it might suffice to mention

&c., &e. But all these savants starting with the erroneous principle that the

air is, in itself, electrical, and that it is vitreous, had not been able to draw any

general conclusion, to deduce any law from their observations. ‘There had been,.

unquestionably, meteorological observations at once curious, interesting and
exact; there had been, indeed, a great number ef them; but as nothing con-
nected, co-ordinated, concatenated. them with one another, , meteorology as a sci-
ence did not yet exist ; ; it was Peltier who founded it, for it was he who first
stated its laws; of this the reader will be convinced by a perusal of the sum-
mary review which we propose to give of the discoveries and ideas of Peltier
on this subject, based on his published researches.*

The principal works of Peltier on meteorology are the following: fon his
Traité des trombes, (on water-spouts,) published in 1840; his memoir on the
electricity of the atmosphere, published in 1842 in the Annales de Chimie et de
Physique, (3d series, vol. iv, p. 385;) his memoir on fogs, which may be found
in the 15th volume of the Mémoires de VAcademie de Brucelles, and has been
reproduced in the Annales de Ch. et de Physique, vol. vi, p. 129; his writings
on electric meteorology, printed in the Archives d’ Electricité de Geneve, 1844, vol.
iv, p. 173; finally, his great memoir on barometric variations, published i in vol-
ume 18th of the Mémoires de V Académie de Bruxelles. To these should be added
certain articles of the Dictionnaire Universel des Sciences Naturelles (ctoiles
filantes, foudre, galvanism, gréle, &c.,) and many other less important commu-
nications, composed in the form of letters, whether to the Academy of Sciences
of Paris or to the Socteté Philomatique.

current, that is to say, between two like forces acting in a contrary direction, are

of the earth too greatly facilitates its efflux; it is only the zone placed at some
distance which is sufficiently insulated to preserve a part of its own. ‘The infe-
rior vapors, in assuming the globular form, become white and humid; they form
the ordinary fogs, which so easily resolve ‘themselves into dew or drizzling rain
through the attraction of the globe.

The cause which develops in the inferior vapors a vitreous electricity is also
found in the tropical current, charged like the globe with resinous electricity ; it
repels from above downwards the resinous electricity of the diurnal vapors, as
the earth repels it frem below upwards. The most elevated portion of these
vapors, being thus subjected to a resinous influence, becomes also charged with
vitreous electricity. As they grow opaque, these vapors assume a tint of glow-
ing white, and form the beautiful cumulus or brilliant cirrus which appears at a
great elevation. The vapors which receive the resinous electricity, repelled
from above downwards by the tropical current and from below upwards by the
earth, extend in large, slaty bands which can acquire no great thickness, since
they are confined by these two antagonistic forces. Ina word, the diurnal
vapors, such as rise every day in all countries, and which diffuse themselves
between the earth and the tropical current, are divided into three well-defined
and distinct strata, as, in summer and in the country, may readily be discerned
after the setting of the sun. A light, whitish mist is then observed in contact
with the earth; above this appear large grayish strata; still higher, white
masses of cumulus, or sometimes the refulgent cirrus which seems to stretch
away towards the tropical current.

in which filial veneration may have prompted the absolute claim here advanced on behalf
of Peltier to be regarded as the founder of meteorological science.—TR.

.

The succession of electrical signs is accordingly as follows: the earth is res-
inous ; the inferior vapors which give rise to the white mists are vitreous; the
middle vapors, which produce by their condensation the large, slate-gray strata,
are resinous; the superior vapors, which in their turn generate the voluminous
white cumulus, are vitreous ; and, finally, the tropical ‘current which overtops
the whole is again resinous, like the earth.

In a medium so movable as the air , and subject, moreover, to so many differ-
ent influences, this triple distribution has stability only for the succession of

vapors in time and space, and not for those which, at a given moment, form the
triple superposition. We have before said that the inferior vapors retained but
for a short time their vitreous electricity, and that they quickly resolved them-
selves into drizzling rain; but that is not all. When, through the lowering of
the temperature, the vapors have ceased to ascend and to thus feed the superior
zone, the cumulus which is saspended therein disappears by degrees under the
form of elastic vapors. ‘This new transformation is effected so much the more
rapidly as the air at that altitude is drier, and as the electric action of the trop-
ical current is more intense.

The inferior vitreous vapors, those which presented themselves under the form
of mist or fog, being resolved into drizzle or dew, the visible, superior, vitreous
vapors, those which presented themselves under the form of cumulus, having
returned to the state of elastic vapors, there remains in the atmosphere nothing
but the intermediate vapors, which are alone seen at evening and at night,
extended in long, opaque curtains , forming clouds of a slaty gray. Surrounded
by an electricity ‘of the same nature as the globe and the tropical current, the
repulsion which these clouds encounter on each side retards their re-vaporization ;
they repass into the state of elastic vapors only when, notwithstanding the
re-vaporization of the white and vitreous clouds, the air is still far from satura-
tion; they change their state by the sole force of hygrometric affinity, and not
by the help of electric attractions, as takes place in regard to the two other
zones. Hence it often happens that we still see, the next morning, portions of
these grayish strata not re-vaporized, and which present themselves under the
form of dark spots, or even extensive black bands, strongly relieved by their
deep color in the midst of the ruddy hues of the dawn.

On the influence of hydro-meteors on the distribution of temperature at the sur-
face of the ground —The temperature of a place depends not alone on its lati-
tude ; it depends also on its longitude. Thus Eastport, in America, and Stock-
holn, in Sweden, have a mean temparature of about 5°.5, and yet their latitude
differs by 14 degrees. New York and Naples are in the same latitude, but the
mean temperature of winter at Naples is 9°.9, while that of New York is—1°.20,
the difference bemg 11.1 degrees.

By uniting by lines all the points for which the mean temperature is the same,
we obtain curves which Humboldt first traced on maps, and which are desig-
nated under the name of isothermal curves. These lines are very far from form-
ing parallels with the equator: thus the isothermal line of 10° passes successively
by Fort George, (10°.1); by Erasmus Hall, near New York, (10°.7); by Dublin,
(9°.56) ; by London, (10.4) ; by Harlem, (10°.0); and by Odessa, (9°.86); ; that is to
say, by 46°.18 of north latitude; 40°.37; 53°.21; 51°.31; 52°.23; and 46°.28.
The extent of the divergence is therefore about 13°. From this we see that the
angle under which the rays of the sun strike the earth is not the only element
which determines the temperature of a place. Several other causes, in effect,
contribute their action.

The trade winds impelling towards the equator masses of air proceeding from
high latitudes, refresh the intertropical regions. On the contrary, the warm
wind of the southwest, which proceeds from the equator and which sinks
towards the earth in proportion as it advances nearer the poles, communicates to
the regions which it touches a portion of its heat and moderates the rigor of
198 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

°

their climate. Hence, for the equator, calculation gives stronger temperatures
than those realized by direct observation. In higher latitudes, on the contrary,
the values to which it leads us are too small. ‘These two results are satisfacto-
rily explained by the opposite influence of the trade winds, which warm the
poles and cool the equator. The currents of the ocean join their action to that of
the currents of the atmosphere, and concur in warming the countries of the north.
Such is, beyond all, the case with the Gulf Stream, which, after bathing the coasts
of the United States, presses on in summer as far as Iceland and even the shores
of Norway.

The causes which have been signalized are evidently of a nature to modify
the temperature of the places on which they act, but they could not have suffi-
cient power to explain the great differences which are sometimes observed
between localities, although in near proximity. They cannot especially explain
the constant decrement of temperature in the different localities of Europe and
of central Asia, in proportion as we advance into the interior of the land.

If we depart from the western coast of Europe and proceed diregtly towards
the east, always advancing unJer the same latitude, we shall observe the follow-
ing meteorological phenomena: 1. In proportion as we advance towards the
east, the mean temperatures of the year continue to become progressively lower
at the places by which we pass. This fact is still more remarkable if, mstead
of taking the mean temperatures of the year, we simply take the mean tempera-
tures of the winters. 2. It will be found, moreover, that the mean quantity of
rain that falls in a year goes on diminishing in proportion as we advance trom
the west towards the east. 3. Finally, it will be observed that the relative
quantity of water which falls in winter continues also to diminish; in other
words, if we represent by 1.00 the annual quantity of water, it will be found
that in proceeding towards the east the quantity of water which falls in winter
becomes a fraction less and less considerable of the whole quantity.

These three facts, namely, the diminution of the temperature, the diminution
of the annual quantity of water, and the diminution of the fraction of water
which falls in winter, are easily observed in proportion as we advance into the
interior of the continent, proceeding from west to east. We will cite several
examples :

It has been our purpose, as far as possible, to introduce into these tables only
placesof little elevation above the level of the sea; so that, in effect, there were no
corrections to make in regard to the height. Yet there are exceptions, Moscow
being 148 metres above the level of the sea, Kazan 58, Wilna and Iakoutsk
117. These heights, however, are much too insignificant to have any notable
influence on the results, for it is usual only to admit a diminution of 1° Centi-
grade for 200 metres of elevation.

The preceding tables suffice to show the rapid decrease of the mean tempera-
ture of winter for the same latitudes in advancing from west to east. The dimi-
nution of the absolute quantity of rain in the year and the diminution of the
absolute and relative quantity of rain in winter are not less evident. If we count
the number of days of rain for the different countries of Europe, we have the
following table:

200 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

For further details on this subject recourse may be had to the great treatise on
meteorology of Kaémtz,in 3 volumes, pp. 450, 500; the smaller treatise on
meteorology by the same author, translated, with notes by Ch. Martins, p. 138
and seq.; the memoirs of Gasparin on the distribution of rains in Europe,
(Bibliotheque Universelle, t. 38, pp. 54 and 264;) and the Atlas Physique of
Berghaus, charts 10 and 12 of the meteorology, p. 19 and seq. of the text.

The tables above given establish, therefore, the three facts in question: the
diminution of temperature, the diminution of the annual quantity of water, and
the diminution of the relative quantity of water falling in winter. What, now,
is the cause of these three phenomena? what is the bond which connects them ?
It is this which we propose to explain while expressing ourselves with all the
reserve which is proper on such a subject.

The winds of the southwest bear from the Atlantic ocean a large pagent of
clouds and vapors; these, nearly throughout Europe, are the winds pre-emi-
nently rainy. The clouds are formed of globules of transparent vapor and of
globules of opaque vapor, both kept apart by the latent caloric and the elec-
tricity, which render them mutually repellant. If any cause abstracts from a
cloud the greater part of its electricity, one of the two forces which co-operated
to keep the globules separate is suppressed. The globules of transparent vapor
approach one another, are condensed, and transformed into opaque vapors; the
globules of opaque vapor, for the same reason, pass into a liquid state, the dens-
ity of the cloud, its specific gravity, is augmented, the cloud sinks and falls on
the earth in the form of rain. On arriving at the surface the cloud disengages
the latent heat it possessed, and thus the soil, as well as the ambient air, is ren-
dered warm.

The quantity of rain which falls annually is naturally, all else being equal,
more abundant in western Europe than in the interior of that continent ; the
forests, the mountains, especially when wooded, radiate much electricity ; ‘they
neutralize, therefore, the electricity of the clouds, and thus induce, in a manner
more or less indirect, their precipitation. When this current from the southwest
reaches Germany it is already deprived of a great part of its vapors. When it
arrives in Russia, there remains still less of “them + finally, in Siberia there is
scarcely any at all remaining. It thus appears that the quantity of water which
falls in a year must continue alw: ays diminishing as we penetrate into the interior
of the continent; it is evident, consequently, that the quantity of latent heat
abandoned by the clouds must also progressively diminish, and that the tempera-
ture must under 20 a corresponding abatement. ‘These facts are more marked in
winter than at any other season, because then the wind from the southwest brings
a less quantity of vapors, w hile these are less elevated and consequently termi-
nate at lower latitudes. Another cause, moreover, concurs in augmenting the
asperity of the cold in the interior of Russia: this is the intensity of the radia-
tion which takes place in consequence of the great serenity of a sky which is
obscured by neither cloud nor vapor.

It results from what has been just said, that a locality in Europe situated to
the east of a chain of mountains should alw ays be colder, all else being equal,
than a locality situated to the west. The chain of mountains in effect, "by pre-
cipitating a great quantity of vapors, must have abstracted a consider able por-
tion of the latent heat, which is hence naturally in deficiency on the other side ;
moreover, if these places are‘sitnated in a latitude somewhat high, where the

clouds Ae already very low, this effect will be still more peda: This in-

reality is what occurs as respects Sweden and Norway in reference to the Scan-
dinavian Alps. We may cite as an example Drontheim in Norway, and Uméo

on the Gulf of Bothnia, in Sweden, (see ?Lnstitut of 18th February, 1846, p. 61,

the communication of M. Martins.) These two cities are nearly in the same
latitude, and yet the mean temperate of Drontheim during winter is —4°.75,
while that of Uméo is—10°.2, a difference of 5°.45.

APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER. 201

The same fact is observed, if we compare together Bergen and Stockholm.
Bergen is in 60° 23/ north latitude, and west of the Scandinavian Alps; Stock-
holm is in 59° 20’, and east of that chain of mountains. Bergen is therefore one
degree further north than Stockholm, and yet the mean temperature of winter
at Bergen is +0°.79, while at Stockholm it is —3°.61, a difference of 4°.4. Besides
this, the quantity of water which falls in a year at Bergen is enormous; it reaches
2,250 millimetres, and in winter 598. At Stockholm, on the other hand, the
quantity of water which falls in the year is but about 520 millimetres, and the
fall in winter 76. In the latter place, then, there falls in winter about eight
times less of water than at Bergen. Moreover, if the total quantity of rain fall-
ing in a year be represented by “100, it will be seen that at Bergen there falls in
winter 26.6, while at Stockholm there falls but 14.8. These two places, there-
fore, fully confirm the facts which we have above indicated, and lend their sup-
port to the explanation which we have given.

Hydrometeors influence also the mean temperature of summer; in general,
when we penetrate into the interior of Europe, pursuing always the same line of
latitude, the mean temperature of summer will be found progressively growing
higher; the difference, however, being not so great as for the winter, and in the
inverse direction. This is generally ‘attributed to the fact that on the borders
of the ocean there are frequent sea mists which veil the sun. ‘Thus the coun-
tries situated near the western coast of Europe have summers somewhat less hot
and winters rather less cold than the countries situated in the interior of the con-
tinent in the same latitude. Hence the climates have been distinguished as
equal or marine climates, and continental or excessive climates.

If the explanation which we have given of the inclination of the isothermal
lines towards the equator in the interior of the continent be true, it is evident
that the isochimenal lines (¢c0¢ equal, ve¢ywy winter) should, for a certain extent
of their course, be perpendicular, or nearly so, to the direction of the southwest
wind—that is to say, to the direction of the ‘wind pre-eminently a rainy one.
Now this is in reality the case. The number of observations is not yet sufli-
ciently great to enable us to trace these curves with exactness; but they suffice
to show the general direction of several of them. If we take, for imstance, the
localities at which the mean temperature of winter varies between —1° and
—1° 5, we find that this isochimenal line passes successively by Odessa, Dant-
wig, Lund in Denmark and Ullensvang in Norway. This curve extends,
therefore, in latitude from 46° 28 to 60° 20; it thus traverses 14 degrees of lati-
tude and is almost perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the southwest wind.
The same is very nearly the case with other isochimenal curves; they all decline
strongly towards the south in proportion as they withdraw from the western coast
of Europe in advancing eastwardly into the interior of the continent.

It may be proper in addition to cite Venice, Paris, and Edinburgh ; the first is
situated in 45° 26 of latitude, the second in 48° 50, the third in 55° 57. Now, in
these three cities the mean ‘temperature of winter is very nearly the same; at
Venice and Paris it is +3° 3, and at Edinburgh +3° 6.

Sometimes, as the sequel of abundant rains, , and especially tempestuous rains,
a decided lowering of the temperature is observed. This fact, at first glance,
seems in contradiction with the theory of isothermal curves which we have pro-
pounded; yet it is by no means so. Almost always after a storm the sky grows
clear, if only for a few hours; the air of the middle and interior regions, unbur-
dened of the great masses of vapor which have been precipitated in the form of

rain, then presents a certain degree of relative dryness; the earth, on the con-

trary, is soaked with rain; there takes place, therefore, at its surface an extremely
abundant ev aporation, which withdraws in a few instants a considerable quan-
tity of heat from the earth and the air in contact with it. It is this subtraction
of caloric which produces the cold in question.

The temperature indicated by the thermometer, moreover, {s not always in accord-
202 APPENDIX TO MEMOIR OF PELTIER.

ance with the sensation experienced by living beings. Often, in fact, individuals
realize a much sharper cold or intense heat than the thermometer seems to verify ;
this depends evidently on the hygrometric condition of the air. In its natural
state the body of man is always covered with a film of humidity, an insensible
transpiration. If the air is calm and saturated with humidity there will be no
evaporation on the surface, and complaint will be made of oppressive heat ; if,
on the contrary, the air is dry and agitated by the wind, the evaporation will be
considerable, and a disagreeable sensation of cold will be complained of, alto-
gether disproportioned to the thermometric indications.

Before concluding this section a word should be said of the effect of denuding
mountains of their trees on the annual mean quantity of rain, on its distribution,
and consequently on the climate. This influence, long denied, is now every-
where admitted—facts speak loudly enough for that. As to the explanation,
we shall endeavor to give it.

The clouds which are in the middle region of the atmosphere are almost always
resinous. As long as their electric tension is moderate and inferior to the tension
of the earth, this latter repels them and keeps them at a greater height than
comports with their specific gravity. When these clouds pass above naked
and woodless mountains, inasmuch as the mountains more nearly approach
them, the action in question is more efficacious, and the clouds are forced to
ascend somewhat higher in consequence of the energetic repulsion exerted by
the mountains. In this case the clouds pass without a discharge of rain. Tf, on
the contrary, the clouds have a considerable electric tension, this tension is more
powerful than that of the earth. When, therefore, these clouds pass over moun-
tains destitute of trees, their resinous electricity represses the resinous electricity
of the mountains into the interior of the soil, decomposes a portion of their
natural electricity, and attracts the vitreous to the surface. The phenomena of
repulsion are then changed into the phenomena of attraction, and the cloud is
wholly precipitated, and that with violence, upon the mountain.

When the country is mountainous and wooded, the occurrence is quite different.
I have already said that vapors, transparent or opaque, were kept at distance by
two forces, heat and electricity; that all the phenomena, which dimjnished by
their action one or the other of these two forces, induced indirectly the con-
densation of the vapors, and consequently the precipitation of a part of them.
These principles are directly applicable to the question with which we are
engaged. When masses of transparent or opaque vapors, charged with resin-
ous electricity, pass above wooded mountains, the vitreous electricity developed
by influence in the soil flows off by the trees, which furnish thousands of points,
and neutralizes a part of the resinous electricity of the super-jacent masses of
vapor. The vapors, being less repelled, draw together and are condensed, the
transparent vapors into opaque vapors, and these into drops of rain which fall in
a regular manner and in measure proportionate to their formation.

In sum, then, the cloud, in the case of mountains naked and divested of wood,
either passes without discharge or is precipitated in its entire mass; the result is
an incessant oscillation from great drought to deluges of rain; in wooded moun-
tains, on the contrary, the rains are gentle and continuous. From this we may
see that to denude mountains of their woods does not perhaps diminish the
annual quantity of rain, but that it modifies the distribution of the rain, or, to
speak with more exactness, its mode of precipitation,

THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN.

By Ep. MAILLY.

[TRANSLATED BY C, A, ALEXANDER FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.*]

J.—CouUNT RUMFORD, PRINCIPAL FOUNDER OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION.

~ “The Royal Institution of London,” says Cuvier, in his Hloge historique of
Count Rumford, “enjoys an unsurpassed reputation as an establishment for pro-
moting the progress of the sciences and their application to public utility.” In
proceeding to give some account of the Institution, it is deemed proper to prefix
a few words respecting the distinguished man to whom it was chiefly indebted
for its origin.

Benjamin Thompson, afterwards known as Count Rumford, was born in 1753,
in the English colonies of North America, at a place then called Rumford, but
now Concord. Devoted at an early age to the study of science, he adopted the
profession of teacher for a livelihood, but, by an advantageous marriage, when
scarcely more than 19 years old, he secured for himself entire independence in
his pursuits. He had accepted the grade of major in the militia of his native
province when the war of the Revolution broke out, and was led by the connec-
tions of family and personal predilection to take the part of the royal govern-
ment. He served with courage and address, and after the evacuation of Boston
by the British troops in 1776, was sent with important despatches to London,
where he Aeqnired the confidence of Lord George Germaine, secretary of state
for the colonies, and was by him attached to that department of the public ser-
vice. In 1780, Mr. Thompson was advanced to the post of under-secretary of
state, but the disasters of the royal army, the constant object of his solicitude and
activity, continuing to accumulate, the young minister “felt that he could not
serve with honor a sinking cause, without serving it at the peril of his life.” t
Having raised a regiment of dragoons in America, he proceeded to take command
of it and distinguished himself in several affairs. At the cessation of hostilities,
he returned to England and was knighted by the King, eventually obtaining
permission to enter the service of Charles Theodore, elector of Bavaria, by whom
he was soon received into favor.

Sir Benjamin Thompson (which was the title he bore on his arrival at Munich,
in 1784) became successively aide-de-camp, chamberlain, and privy councillor
to the elector ; was created lieutenant general of his armies; and when, on the
death of the Emperor Joseph II, Charles Theodore was -called to the functions
of vicar of the empire, the latter promptly took advantage of the prerogative
attached to that position to advance his favorite to the dignity of Count, giving
him the title of his native village in New Hampshire.

the administration of war and the direction of the police, he applied himself, on

the one hand, to the melioration of the condition of the soldier, and, on the other, -

to the suppression of mendicity by organizing a house of labor for the poor. He
had never lost sight of the sciences, his earliest predilection. Researches on the
cohesion of bodies and on the force of powder had procured his admission, in 1779,
into the Royal Society of London. In his new position he undertook experi-
ments on the nature of heat and light, as well as on the laws of their propaga-
tion, with a view to supplying large assemblages of persons with economical
nourishment, clothing, warmth, and artificial illumination. It is not within the
scope of this paper to discuss these researches of Count Rumford; they will be
found detailed in his Hssays.* Suffice it to say that light and heat became the
engrossing subjects of his philosophic attention. Thus we find him, in 1796,
establishing a prize at London “ for new discoveries tending to the improvement
of the theories regarding fire, heat, light, and colors, and for the inventions and
processes by which the production, preservation, and employment of heat and
light may be facilitated.”t

“In 1798 he proceeded to London as minister plenipotentiary of the elector
of Bavaria, but was held to be disqualified for fulfilling the functions of that
office by the fact of his being still regarded, in point of law, as a British subject,
and incapable, therefore, of representing a foreign power at the British court.
Soon afterwards he learned the death of the prince, his benefactor, and, fore-
seeing that he would have scarcely less difficulty in resuming his old than in
exercising his new functions,t he turned with habitual earnestness to other pur-
suits, and, in becoming the principal founder of the Royal Institution, of which
his favorite ideas formed the basis , established one of his best claims to lasting
remembrance.

The latter years of Count Rumford were passed in retirement. In 1802 he
transferred his residence to Paris, where he contracted a second marriage, with
the widow of Lavoisier. ‘This union proved unhappy, and was terminated after
three years by a private separation. He then retired to a country house at
Auteuil, about four miles from Paris, and there devoted his time to the embel-
lishment of his domain, and to the cultivation of chemistry and experimental
philosophy. Here he died, August 21, 1814, at the age of sixty-one years.

IJ.—THE FIRST PROSPECTUS OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION.

The first meeting of the founders and directors of the Institution took place
the 9th of March, 1799, at the mansion of Sir Joseph Banks, those present
being Sir Joseph, the earls of Morton and Spencer, Count Rumford, Richard
Clark and Thomas Bernard. Sir Joseph was named president, and Thomas
Bernard secretary. ‘The prospectus of the establishment, for the preparation of
which Count Rumford was designated, bore the following title: “ Proposals for
forming, by subscription in the metropolis of the British empire, a public
institution for diffusing the knowledge and facilitating the general introduc-
tion of useful mechanical inventions and improvements; and for teaching, by
courses of philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of science

The following extract from the prospectus, given by the Bibliothéque Britan-
aque (sciences and arts) of Geneva, for the year last mentioned, will convey an
idea of the objects of the new establishment:

When the directors shall have chosen a site, there shall be prepared large and airy apart-
ments to receive and exhibit the mechanical inventions aud improvements which seem to

improvements which seem to merit public attention; and more eenecialy such
kinds of apparatus as tend to multiply the conveniences of life; to promote
domestic economy; to form the taste and facilitate the exercise of useful indus-
try. Efforts shall be made to procure the most perfect models for each object.
The following will deserve particular attention: Chimneys for cottages, with
appropriate utensils ; complete kitchen for a farm-house, with all its furnishings ;
complete kitchen, suitable for a family in easy circumstances; rooms for wash-
ing, drying, and ironing clothes for a rich family or hospital, with boilers and
other necessary utensils ; German, Swedish, and Russian stoves for heating
apartments and passages.

“Tn order that those who visit the establishment may acquire just ideas of these
different inventions, and of the circumstances which constitute the particular
merit of each of them, working models shall, as far as possible, be used for
exhibition; and it is evident that the greater part of those just spoken of are
susceptible of being presented in that form. In the different apartments, chim-
neys contrived on the best principles shall be provided, to serve as models for
constructors, and fires shall be constantly kept burning therein during cold

5
weather. In the same apartments, models of grates, adapted both for ornament

and economy, shall be exhibited, as well as models of ornamental stoves, in the
form of elegant chimney-places, for large saloons, dining-rooms, &c.
“Tt is proposed also to introduce small models (though such still as shall be
capable of being put in operation) of that curious and useful machine, the
steam-engine ; models also of the apparatus for brewing, with improved fur-
naces ; of large stills, with the new condensers; of extensive ranges for the
kitchens of hospitals and the marine, with improved fire-places. Place should
be found likewise for models of ventilators for renewing the air of apartments
and the interior of ships; of hot-houses, with all the known improvements; of
lime-kilns of divers construction; of steam-boilers for preparing the food of
domestic animals; of rustic houses, upon different plans; of wheels for spinning,
and looms for the production of fabrics especially suited for the poor, and caleu-
lated to furnish them employment at home; together with models of all the new
inventions proper to promote the advancement ‘of a agriculture; those of bridges,
constructed on various principles; and, in fine, of all that be directors shall
deem deserving of public attention in point of utility and convenience. Each
article shall be accompanied by a detailed description, and exact drawings, and
a designation be given of the name and abode of the artist engaged in its pro-
duction, with the price of his work.

“In order to realize the second object of the Institution, that, namely, of show-
ing the application of science to the different requirements of life, a course of
public lectures on natural philosophy, accompanied by experiments, shall be
established. Forthe use of this course there shall be a cabinet of physics and
a laboratory of chemistry.

“Among the different subjects treated of in these lectures, particular attention
should be given to that of heat in its application to the various uses of life;
combustion, and the relative quantities of heat furnished by different combusti-
bles; the management and economy of fire; the causes on which depends the
heat of different substances used for clothing ; ; the effects of heat and cold, both
in a stationary and circulating atmosphere, upon the human body, whether in a
state of health or sickness ; ‘the effects of vitiated and confined air on respira-
tion; the means of rendering ordinary dwellings agreeable and healthy ; the
construction of ice-houses and preservation of ice in sammer; the prevention of
ailments in different seasons and climates; the cooling of liquids without the
use of ice, &e.

“Veeetation and the effects of different manures, with the method of prepar-
ing and adapting the latter to various soils, should receive attention; also the
changes which alimentary substances undergo in the different processes of cook-

ing, as well as in those of digestion ; the chemical principles involved in the
tanning of Jeather, with the objects to which artisans, who may seek to perfect
so important a process, should direct their efforts ; the chemical prinicples of the
art of making soap, of bleaching, of dyeing, and, in general, of all the mechan-
ical arts which bear a relation, more or less direct, to manufactures.

“There shall be five classes of contributors: 1, subscribers at 50 guineas, pay-
able once for all; 2, subscribers at 10 guineas, likewise payable but once; 3,
subscribers at two guineas; 4, testators or benefactors ; 5, persons who pay the
ticket of admission. Of these, the first class are the proprietors of the estab-
lishment.. They alone elect the directors and visitors, and can alone exercise
office. The establishment will be gratuitously conducted by nine directors.
There shall be also nine visitors.”

“Such an institution,” adds the editor of the Bibliothéque Britannique, “is
calculated to form an epoch in the history of civilization.” In the month of
July,-1799, there were already 138 subscribers at 50 guineas a head, 103 at 10
guineas, and 97 at two guineas. The capital of the society, therefore, was at
that time 7,950 guineas, besides 194 guineas contributed by annual subscrip-
tion. The first meeting of the proprietors had taken place April 20 previous.

IIJ.—SItTvATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1800—pr.
GARNETT, THE FIRST PROFESSOR OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.

The charter of the new corporation, which by permission of George III had
assumed the title of Royal Institution of Great Britain, bears date January 15,
1800. It was published with a new prospectus, mainly of a descriptive charac-
ter; the indefatigable activity of Count Rumford having bastened the execution
of the ideas contained in his first appeal to the public. It is here’said:

* * * “The tardiness with which improvements of every kind are intro-
duced, even such as are of the most evident utility, is a remarkable fact; it stands
in striking contrast with the avidity of the public in adopting the frivolous
changes created by caprice or folly, and which circulate in society under the
auspices of fashion, * * * ‘The Royal Institution has two principal objects:
one, to spread promptly and introduce into all the ramifications of society a
knowledge of inventions and useful improvements, drawn from the experience
and practice of all nations; the other, to make known the applications of which
scientific discoveries are susceptible, to the advantage of the arts and manufac-
tures of this country, and the augmentation of domestic enjoyment and con-
venience. * * * The directors have purchased (June, 1799) acommodious
and spacious edifice on Albemarle street, where large and airy apartments are
in course of preparation for exhibiting such mechanical inventions or improve-
ments as may be thought to merit public attention. Particularly will those
inventions be exemplified which tend to increase domestic comfort and economy,
to improve the taste, or advance the industry directed towards objects of utility.

“An amphitheatre will be arranged for lectures and demonstrations, acecom-
panied by a laboratory and complete collection of instruments of experimental
physics and chemistry. This branch of instruction will be confided to savanis
of the highest merit, * * * <A place has been provisionally prepared in
which three courses are given: First, a course of natural philosophy on the
principles of astronomy, electricity, magnetism, mechanics, hydrostatics, pneu-
matics, and optics. The meetings take place every Tuesday, at 2 o’clock, and
this course is particularly directed to the instruction and amusement of persons
who, without having leisure or opportunity to explore thoroughly these different
branches of natural knowledge, still desire to know whatever most strongly
provokes curiosity. Second, a course of chemistry and its application to the
arts, to manufactures, and the requirements of life. ‘The meetings take place
Wednesdays at 2 o'clock. Third, a complete and scientific course of experi-

mental physics, in which the propositions are first demonstrated mathematically,
afterwards illustrated by experiments, and finally applied to the various uses of
the arts and domestic economy. ‘The meetings occur three days in the week, at
8 o’clock in the evening.”

The professor who had charge of this course was Dr. Garnett. In Nicholson’s
journal it is said, under the date of April 1, 1800: “The course of physics and
of chemistry opened by Dr. Garnett, in the apartments of the Royal Institution,
is followed with the most marked attention by a numerous and distinguished
auditory.”

Thomas Garnett was born in 1765 or 1766, at Casterton, in Westmoreland.
He received the degree of doctor of medicine at Edinburgh, in 1788, and prac-
ticed his art successfully at London, at Bradford, at Knaresborough, and at Liv-
erpool. Called in 1796 to Glasgow to teach chemistry, he afterwards quitted
that city in order to occupy at the Royal Institution the chair which had been
offered him by Count Rumford. Dr. Garnett died at London June 28, 1802, in
the prime of life. We owe to him a compendium entitled, Outlines of a Course
of Lectures on Chemistry, Delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain.—
London, 1801.

IV.—THE SITUATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN MAY, 1801, AND APRIL, 1802.

To M. Pictet, one of the editors of the Bibliothéque Britannique, who visited
London in 1801, we owe the following notices of a report made by Count Rum-
ford to the directors and visitors of the Institution, in the month of May in that
year:

“'Mhe sums subscribed for the execution of the proposed plans amount at
present to £23,000, without comprising £7,000 generously offered by a small
number of the proprietors (which subvention will, however, not be needed) to
supply deficiencies in the cost of new buildings. Those already acquired are
very extensive. The ground on which the principal edifice stands was originally
occupied by four private dwellings, and the location is central to that part of
London to whose inhabitants the establishment most naturally appeals for an
enlightened interest, (Albemarle street, Piccadilly.) Professors and demonstra-
tors in physics, chemistry, and mechanics have been engaged, and lectures are
given in two spacious amphitheatres, one of which will contain 300, the other
900 persons. An ample laboratory having been provided, a manager and opera-
tor have been nominated, and negotiations are on foot with a skilful German
chemist to serve as assistant to those two individuals. Shops for the construction
of models, furnished with the most complete assortment of tools that could be
procured, have been placed in order, under a master-workman, who will have
charge of all the physical apparatus pertaining to the Institution. ‘The opera-
tives engaged are: a mathematical instrument maker, a constructor of models,
a cabinet maker, a carpenter, a workman in brass and copper, another in tin, and
still another in sheet iron. To these will be added a brick maker and mason,
who will be instructed and rendered competent to instruct other workmen in the
art of constructing chimneys, ovens, furnaces, &c., upon the principles recently
applied to the management of fire and the economy of fuel.

“There has been established in the apartment of the janitor a complete kitchen
suitable for a family of small means, with an oven for roasting of the most sim-
ple construction, a chimney place adapted to cottages, a steaming kettle, &c.
All these objects are open to the inspection of those who frequent the Institution.
It is proposed also to establish a principal kitchen, which shall be rendered as
complete as possible in every particular. It will include ovens for baking, others
for roasting, steam boilers of every construction; and in order that every one
may learn to avail himself of this diversified apparatus daily use will be made
of it in the Institution, and certain persons be specially charged with showing

it. And in order that the proprietors and subscribers may be enabled to judge,
by experience, of the merit of such or such method of cooking, or of any new
viand which may be suggested, a dining-room has been provided at the Institu-
tion, ia which the directors will, from time to time, prescribe experimental din-
ners, of which the proprietors and subscribers shall be invited to partake, the
whole at the expense of the guests.

“ A conversation-saloon has been provided. * * * One of the divisions on
the ground floor has been assigned for a printing-office, which pertains exclu-
sively to the Institution. It is particularly designed for printing its journals,*
which will probably be issued once a week, and of which three numbers have
already appeared. These memoirs will contain not only the detail of all that
is done at the Institution and in England relative to the introduction of inven-
tions or useful improvements, but also a selection from everything of foreign
production which can be of advantage to the country. * * * As the prin-
cipal object of the establishment is to promote improvements in the mechanical
arts, to stimulate and encourage the exercise of genius and industry, bearing on
objects of practical and immediate utility, it has been decided to introduce
nothing which has reference to the three learned professions: theology, law, and
medicine.

“A department will shortly be arranged for the accommodation of 18 or 20
young persons destined for different mechanical professions. An evening school
will be established with this view, in which will be taught the art of designing,
practical geometry, and the elements of mathematics.”
