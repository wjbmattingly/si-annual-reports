The Smithsonian Institution

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846 in
accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England, who
in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America “‘to
found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an
establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.” In
receiving the property and accepting the trust, Congress determined that
the federal government was without authority to administer the trust
directly, and therefore, constituted an “establishment,” whose statutory
members are “the President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the
heads of the executive departments.”

Statement of the Secretary

S. DILLON RIPLEY
The Pleasure of Your Company

Of all places in the world, Washington seems to have the largest tourist
attendance if the Smithsonian’s annual visitor count is any indication. Last
year the Smithsonian buildings, including the National Zoological Park in
nearby Rock Creek, were visited by more than twenty million people. A
year ago the Zoo made a survey showing that approximately 50 percent of
its visitors are persons from a radius of more than 50 miles away from
Washington, that is to say not from the immediate suburbs. Thus the

_ National Zoo is indeed a nationally visited zoo. Extrapolating the figures

for the total Smithsonian visitation on this basis would produce an
extraordinary result. Something over five percent of the total population
of the United States has visited the Mall buildings and the Zoo during the
past year. This is the largest number of visitors that has been recorded for
any institution. Other buildings in Washington also have a large number of
recorded visitors, many of whom must be the same visitors of course. The
United States Capitol has an annual estimate of seven to ten million people
visiting the building but, as is also our case, there is no way of
differentiating between members of the staff, Members of Congress, the
press, people on business calls, and others. It does appear that on
particularly heavy days the Capitol entertains as many as thirty thousand
visitors on tours. In New York, the Metropolitan Museum has approxi-
mately 2.25 million visitors a year and the American Museum of Natural
History, 3.2 million annually. In Disneyland, California, there were about
9.5 million visitors last year and the visitor count for Walt Disney World in
Florida was approximately 7 million.

Compared to these figures the total 20 million for the Smithsonian
makes it by all odds the largest single center for visitors in the Nation, if
not in the world. The National Park Service estimates that all over the
nation as many as 200 million people have visited public installations
under their care in the last year. This includes, of course, everything from
battlefields, national parks, the Statue of Liberty, The White House
(1,391,300), to historic homes, forests, and open space camping sites.
These figures seem to indicate that Americans are as peripatetic as ever and
as restless as Mark Twain and other authors have described.
4 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972. |

What special impact do the Smithsonian buildings have on twenty
million visitors? This question represents a continuing enigma to us at the |
Institution, one that we shall probably never really solve. Certainly, as the
years go on, my own impression is that the American tourists consider the
Smithsonian’s public exhibits as part of their birthright, and maintain a
residual sense for many years afterwards of a kind of pilgrimage to this
center in Washington, a visit to the place where the truths of their origins
will be revealed. Of all the buildings visited on the Mall, the one with the
largest tourist count is the National Museum of History and Technology,
and as one might suspect, here is felt the pulse of American history. Here
are the visible evidences of America, the desk on which Thomas Jefferson
wrote the Declaration of Independence, the flag that flew over Fort
McHenry and inspired, apocryphally or not, our Nation’s anthem, the
uniform of General George Washington, his field campaign tent, memo-
rabilia of famous men and women and examples of our culture and crafts
from earliest times. The National Museum of History and Technology is a
veritable archive of objects. It makes patent American history and speaks
of the struggles and triumphs of American men and women. Surely this
will be one of the most important shrines for American visitors during
the Bicentennial Year of 1976.

Another center for historical interest, which we hope to complete by
1976, will be the National Air and Space Museum Building. Time, strikes,
weather, and material shortages notwithstanding, our target is to open this
new museum during the Bicentennial year. The National Air and Space
Museum will have within it not only the documents of the history of
man’s conquest of the air and space, the machines, the objects involved in
the bewildering triumphs of air and space technology, but also archives
and records of those who have made the discoveries and the flights
possible. We shall also have a fascinating auditorium, a space which we
have christened the “‘spacearium,” in which it should be possible not only
to achieve the impressions gained in a planetarium but also seemingly to
project the visitor out into space looking back on Mother Earth.

This coming winter we shall be experimenting with a model of the
spacearium in the form of a smaller-domed projection auditorium in the
old Air and Space Building in the hope of refining our techniques and
making the exhibit technologically perfect. It is estimated that the visitor
count during the first year to the National Air and Space Museum will be
in excess of six million, presumably taking care of the anticipated 30
million visitors on the Mall during the Bicentennial Year of 1976. The
contemplation of such a vast aggregation of tourists is staggering almost
beyond comprehension. In his 4th of July speech the President cited
“Festival USA” as part of the Nation’s plan for the Bicentennial and
mentioned also the “Nation of Nation’s” slogan which the National

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 5

Museum of History and Technology had adopted for its major exhibit
during the Bicentennial Year.

The record of this country’s performance in such areas as politics,
economics, and science is clear, but the attitude of Americans towards the
arts—ranging as it sometimes has, from apathy to antagonism—has left us
with little understanding of their history. One of the purposes of the
Smithsonian’s program for the American Revolution Bicentennial Celebra-
tion is to develop a Bicentennial Survey of American Art. This will
embrace the National Collection of Fine Arts’ Bicentennial Inventory of
American Painting, the National Portrait Gallery’s catalog of portraits of
the revolutionary era, the Archives of American Arts’ Bibliography of
American Art, and the Division of Performing Arts’ Survey of American
Folk Culture. Most of these were begun two years ago with the first
Congressionally approved appropriation to the Smithsonian for the
Bicentennial. In addition, the National Gallery has important plans for
exhibitions. During those two years plans have been formulated for the
various parts of the Survey; hundreds of local, state, and regional
organizations and institutions have been invited to cooperate in it;
computer programs and retrieval systems have been developed and forms
have been prepared for the gathering of information. To date some 1,226
museums and historical societies all over the country and in Canada have
undertaken to gather information for the National Collection of Fine Arts
Inventory, which already lists more than 18,000 paintings. About 5,000
items have been entered in the National Portrait Gallery’s Catalogue of
American Revolutionary Portraits. This Survey is one that promises to
produce one of the most enduring products for students and scholars of
our Nation’s cultural achievements.

In the realm of exhibits, the Smithsonian has developed a Bicentennial
Exhibition Program, designed to produce special exhibits in all of our
major museums, as well as traveling Bicentennial exhibits for use
throughout the country. During this year some four million persons
viewed our traveling exhibits throughout the United States and Canada.
One can only surmise how many more will wish to see the Bicentennial
displays planned especially for them. We also plan to have additional
exhibits, catalogs, the possible acquisition of special objects and the
production of traveling versions of these exhibits. The Anacostia Neighbor-
hood Museum is planning to create a new center for the design and
production of imaginative and inexpensive exhibits on themes of special
interest to minority groups, to the disadvantaged, and to all those
throughout the country who do not normally visit museums. This center
will serve also as a training place for young people drawn from all parts of
the country who wish to learn the special skills involved in communication
through objects and exhibits. In addition we plan to contribute to
6 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

intergovernmental agencies, Bicentennial projects, such as the exhibit in

the Great Hall of the Department of Commerce Building. Altogether the
Smithsonian’s contributions to the Bicentennial Year should be epoch
making in the Mall area itself; and if, in addition we can create an outdoor

museum in one of the neighboring park areas along the Potomac for the |

history of the Armed Forces revolutionary period, we will have played a
still more significant role in the welcome to Washington for the thirty
millions of visitors expected at that time.

If the fifty percent increase in visitors, expected by 1976, is to be
accommodated without an increase in available parking facilities, the
saturation point will have been exceeded. By then, the Air and Space
Museum Building, the addition to the National Gallery of Art, and the
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden will have joined the other
buildings on the Mall, and added over 50 percent to the present 760,514
square feet of public exhibit space, to make a total of 1,154,964 square
feet. This tremendous increase in exhibition area, and one which will have
unusual architectural distinction, will, we believe, accommodate a forecast
attendance of thirty million persons a year. But there is no doubt that
things will be crowded, and particularly in the heat of summer, with the
rush from one activity to the other, the temper of our visitors may wear
thin. Hence, it is even more important that the activities planned for 1976
be festive and that Washington, as a whole, prepare itself for the challenge
of “Festival USA.” The Smithsonian, with appropriate help from the
National Park Service and kindred organizations, and with the blessing of
Congress and of the administration, will do its part, and every member of
our staff will be taxed to the limit..To this challenge, there are no
alternatives: 1976 is a year of promise for all Americans and it is a year in
which many foreigners will want to share. Restless as Americans are, they
will come. Patient as they are they will withstand the tiredness, the aching
feet, the shrill cries of little children who cannot be left behind. The year
will come and go with a resounding crashing of many feet on the Mall,
millions hungry for these sights will not be denied.

What impression will the visitors have in that year? What semblence of
the past, what hope for the future will they take away when they leave the
Nation’s Capital? The Smithsonian is more than simply concerned with the
past. Our objects are “documents,” carefully conserved and lovingly
curated, representing more than merely a panorama of past history. They
indicate the scope of man’s inventiveness, his ability to create, and the
technical skill and craft innovation which have placed America in the
forefront of the nations of the world.

In a recent commencement address Nathan Glazer, the sociologist,
spoke of the question of productivity and the fact that in the present
youth culture in the United States there seems to be a rejection of

{

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 7

ambition and competition. As he put it, the position of the United States
in world trade and technology is dependent on its youth. It is dependent
on a continuity of such skills and such creativeness. Without that our
standing could be significantly diminished in time. He contemplated a
possible future in which Japanese youth “take pride in turning out ever
more efficient and complex transportation and electronic devices, while
American youth take satisfaction in fashioning leather belts and making
organic bread.”

A recent article in The New York Times cited a foreign correspondent’s
impression of the difficulties of education in a country abroad. Describing
the present trends in that country the writer noted the government’s
concern for educational techniques and training which have failed to
preserve traditional labor in agriculture and crafts, noting that the youth,
especially of more affluent families, desired to go to college today,
whereas 30 years ago a high school diploma was considered a mark of
prestige. The writer commented on the government’s increasing concern
over vanishing agricultural labor on farms and the distaste expressed by the
young for craft or machine work in factories. As it happened the country
was the Soviet Union although the resemblance to the United States seems
startling.

Why is it that young people today find education itself a pleasurable
occupation, to be prolonged as long as possible, in a kind of extended
playpen, and why is it that no one really seems interested in getting down
to a job?

These are some of the questions which continually bewilder all of us
concerned with education. They are not necessarily questions confined to
educators. It often seems to me that the Smithsonian should concern itself
with these problems based on our reservoir of information about the
history of the growth of American culture. If American culture is
changing, then there should be some way of assessing and measuring this
even within the records of the recent past. I have often stated that a
museum should be like a kind of planetarium, almost like the spacearium
which the National Air and Space Museum contemplates building. It
should be possible to set in motion a chain of events within a museum
which would lead up through an exposition of the past into the present
and then, bearing these points of reference in mind, preparing a projection
for the future. If we could think of a museum as a kind of “social
spacearium’”’ then it should be possible to determine why it is that at this
present stage in American culture, there is such a sense of alienation from
traditional values and such a sense of apathy about traditional skills and
cultural refinements. From art to technology, there seems to be a peculiar
lack of industry, creativeness, and desire to follow in any mould today.

In many ways art today is sick, suffering from a surfeit of invention,
8 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972 |

which has produced a sense of negativism. Artists today dwell in a half |
world, bored on the one hand with derivative skills and the techniques of |
realism, on the other hand virtually barren of inspiration. The result is a |
kind of nihilism, a sense of frustration out of which a feeling of self |

destruction and sadism seems to emerge. At the Venice Biennale a group
of revolutionary young artists voted to applaud the act of the mentally
disturbed Hungarian engineer who defaced Michelangelo’s Pieta, as a
heroic act of anti art (= presumably art?). This sort of gesture is beyond
Dada, beyond surrealism, perhaps part of an odyssey into a new psychic
realm—the “‘freak-out.”

In technology the labor unions, on the one hand, and industrial
planners, on the other, are concerned that the young of the most highly
skilled, inventive, and technologically developed country in the world are
no longer interested in the refinements and skills on which our society
depends. Here again is a kind of nihilism which one must deplore, for it is
so naive. If we are to succeed in making the envelope of earth viable for
future generations, we must continue to develop the skills on which our
very culture depends.

Only with greater skills and a greater understanding of the lessons of
applied science can we achieve an ultimate adaptation between human life
and the supporting forces of earth, which will allow human life to
continue. This dilemma is heightened today by the tension between the
universities, on the one hand, and the students and their parents, on the
other. The universities have been plagued by negativism and self-doubt.
The students, many of whom really are not qualified for university life in
principle, are led astray by the play syndrome, or by feelings of frustration
or rancor at the failure of their expectations. The parents are frustrated
because of their own expectations for their children inherent in the
American dream. And so all elements in the mixed salad that is American
education today are at odds. The institutions, afflicted with self-doubt and
a nagging loss of purpose, are about as popular to the taxpayer as other
municipal or state supported institutions, such as sanitariums and prisons.
We know we need them or something like them, but we hate to have to
pay for them. In this atmosphere leadership is difficult if not impossible,
and mere training and the transfer of information becomes the rule.

What is, of course, needed is some development of training institutes
for the many youths who need such training in skills. But how to make
that dignified? How to make it more glamorous? How to invest such
potential career-training with an aura of excitement? Without it, the
urgent needs of education will not be solved. One can only applaud US.
Commissioner of Education, Sidney Marland’s concept of “career educa-
tion” at different levels from primary to continuing adult. What we need is
a return to the concept of a tradition and pride in crafts and skills through

|

curriculum reform.

The problems of the Smithsonian for the next few years are going to
evolve largely around “the pleasure of your company” and how best to let
some of what we have to tell about America rub off on the increasing
millions of visitors. It is all very well for us to spend time, money, and
great intellectual effort planning and designing new buildings as part of the
Smithsonian complex of public enterprises on the Mall, but it is going to
be physically impossible to entertain the very crowds we welcome unless
some accommodation can be reached among the city of Washington, the
legislators who rule us, and the federal government. Signs and portents are
all around. Cassandra-like voices have been calling for the development (via
the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission of a number of years ago) of new
centers for visitors, of outlying satellite parking, of bus services and other
means of transporting people. It will be most difficult to handle the very
masses of people whom the President wishes to welcome for “Festival
USA” for 1976 even with the present schemes of busing and the
development of the Metro. Visitor surveys seem to be largely unheeded. It

__ is difficult to assess the eventual costs of building a transportation network

that will get tourists to the central attractions of the Capital city. No one
seems really to want to pay for it all, and yet so much of the economic life
of Washington depends on its tourist traffic. If twenty million people a
year are coming to the Smithsonian buildings today, how many more will
have been here by 1976 to increase the glut and congestion?

Recently I had a letter from South Dakota.

Dear Mr. Ripley,

I bought a $12 Smithsonian membership [I think he meant an Associate mem-
bership which is $10] because I thought it would help when we visited. We probably
will never know!

Yesterday we were able finally to get on to the street your front door is on—the
heat was terrific—the people thicker than hair on a dog’s back—and by the good Lord
himself you could not find a place to park your car—Sooo - we decided, in a word,
-tohellwithit—we have had a lovely day here in Dayton at the Air Force Museum.

My 13 year old son and I also spent three days at the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago. When we finish here we are going to St. Louis and see the
Arch—so we will see our share—in spite of your lousy parking situation.

We honestly do suggest that better parking and more of it be provided for us
country bumkins from the sticks and further—so somehow we can see what we keep
hearing about when we come to town.

And no wonder. One Associate member who receives Smithsonian
magazine wrote in to tell us that he lives in Arlington, Virginia, and that
the only way that he sees the Smithsonian is through our magazine.
Whenever he sees the buildings it is usually to drop off visitors to town,
leave them at the front door, drive around, and pick them up two hours
later. This means that many of the less persistent residents of Washington
10 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

buildings.

It becomes not worth-while. It is too much of a struggle. We certainly
cannot blame them. The tourists will come despite any amount of traffic
jams and problems. It is really going to be difficult in the coming years for
Washington to become so relatively unpopular that the tourist traffic will
fall off. Rather, people remain persistent, they remain hopeful, and, one
hopes, they remain enthusiastic.

Recently, when planning for the National Air and Space Museum (plans
approved by the Congress now many years ago), voices were heard on
Capitol Hill that we should not go ahead with the plans for the Air and
Space Museum because of the present congestion of visitors. But if we are
not to go ahead with plans for a new building already long approved, |
which will enhance the popular understanding of science and technology ©
among the American people, then how are we to proceed? Should we
simply shut up shop and go away? The Institution is already here, the
plans for the new building are already in existence. Everything that we can
do to mobilize public opinion and to engage the interests of the young in
American history, the history of our technological achievements, and the
hopes for the future, must somehow be done. If it is not to be done by the
Smithsonian in Washington then how is it to be done? Some Members of
Congress may find it more appealing to have the Air Force Museum in
Dayton or a museum of science and industry in Chicago assume the task,
but this is begging the question. The National Collections must be
exhibited in Washington. The city itself continues to be an enormous
tourist attraction for Americans from every part of the country. Surely the
Congressmen themselves on reflection will realize that these are their own
constituents and that there will be growing concern over the years if
somehow these constituents are not shown the heritage of America and its
hopes for the future. In any case, a traffic survey made for us around the
site of the new Air and Space Museum showed that having the building
there rather than a parking lot and cross streets as at present, will actually
decrease traffic congestion at peak periods by cutting off diversionary
cross traffic, improving the parking situation, and providing some five
hundred new spaces for tourists in a basement parking garage.

city, itself, and the immediate suburbs simply have no time to get to the
|

And so we proceed with our plans, confident that over the years the
city government, the Congress, and the Executive branch will somehow
mobilize a coherent program to solve the parking situation and to handle
the flow of visitors whom we all surely wish to see come to Washington.
We will have to learn how to live with ourselves as well as visitors in some
kind of harmony as far as transportation is concerned.

In a way, Washington symbolizes the kind of general transportation
problems of all urban areas, and yet it is a specialized one in so far as
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 11

tourist traffic is concerned. Too much attention is being paid today to
other areas, too little attention is being paid to inner city transportation
problems. Concomitant with these transportation problems are the
problems of the residents themselves. Somehow a new effort will have to
be made to understand the interrelationships of people living in urban
areas and people moving through and being part of these urban areas in
transit. A whole aspect of human nature is involved. People do not like to
be crowded beyond a certain point and the points vary, the degrees of
toleration are endless. Anthropologists have mused on the fact that certain
types of people accept life in aggregations more than others. The study of
proxemics reveals that some people are more adapted to being closely
crowded, almost as it were herded together, and that other kinds of people
resent herding and wish to break out and be more solitary. And so it goes.
People will continue to be motivated by different urges, will continue to
differ in their reactions as well as in their appearance, and this will go on
endlessly in spite of all attempts by planners, architects, engineers, and
social philosophers to equate one person to another.

Our very diversity and our ethnic variety are strong assets only now
beginning to be realized. It is one more reason why the Smithsonian hopes
over the next few years to think more deeply about the problems of
representing man in his environment, perhaps to be encompassed in a
Museum of Man?

The problems of man and the representation and discussion of man in
his environment are not simply the prerogatives of anthropologists. The
sadness of museums of anthropology is that for most of the practitioners
of ethnology these museums are merely legacies of extinction. Museums of
anthropology in themselves have only existed for the past hundred years
since the collections of the explorers began to be displayed. The Musée de
Homme in Paris, perhaps the greatest of the existing museums of
anthropology, is a place where one can find preserved exquisite records of
extinct cultures, collections brought back by explorers themselves long
dead. On the other hand, certain of the newer museums such as the
National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City have done an excellent
job in exhibiting the continuity of culture. More recently we have “urgent
anthropology” as it is sometimes called, the last residues of that program
of the explorers, initiated in this country by Major John Wesley Powell
(who founded our own Bureau of American Ethnology in the Smithsonian
a hundred years ago), to record the languages and artifacts of the
American Indian before they became extinct. I have been told that there
are still more than two dozen Indian dialects or subdialects which have
eluded Powell and his followers and have not yet been fully described. In
some cases they are spoken by only a handful of persons over 70 years of
age, and, thus, as dialects or languages, will go to the grave with them. If
12 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972 |

this is so we cannot avoid an ultimate responsibility as curators, not |
merely in the failure to record an aspect of the creativity of the human |
spirit, but also that we ourselves have created the very extinctions which
we now mourn.

All over the world today, especially the tropical world, a sadness
descends upon us, as we think of the ease with which cultures vanish
before the onslaught of ourselves and our material artifacts. Tribes with
whom I lived in New Guinea a dozen years ago have now already in the |
intervening time forgotten how to fashion stone axes and know only the
steel ones. In fifty years I suppose they will have forgotten how to use
axes at all and be dependent on power saws and gasoline-powered brush
cutters. Thus these legacies of vanishing ways of life, collected by
ethnologists and anthropologists are really the sole meaning of anthropo-
logical museums. They are simply evidences of the evolution of groups and
types of the varied material cultures of mankind.

A modern Museum of Man, however, should be far more than a
museum of collections and a museum of extinctions. A Museum of Man
should be a museum of social and technological history and as such a
matter of great moment and concern to us all whether we are American
Indians, Caucasians, or members of any other ethnic subdivision. All
citizens of the United States should be concerned, for within all of us
there continues to reside heritable characters which, transmuted by
whatever external pressures about us still persist, tend to evade change,
and still produce our bewildering diversities. Anthropology as such does
not seem any more a subject. It has become to many minority peoples a
figment of the imagination of peoples of European stock.

Nowhere could there be potentially better proof of the ability,
phoenix-like, of a museum to show its true colors, not to be dead, but to
be reborn, than in the case of anthropology. Ethnologists should cease to
exist solely in the realms of connoisseurship and bring their functions and
their collections up to date. They should do this by studying the peoples
as they are today, how they survive, how their culture has molded them to
adapt to this onrushing century and its international hucksterism. For they
will not die out, all these different people, all these ethnic subcultures,
these minorities of every kind. “Their cultural structure may become
dilapidated”’ as Kubler describes the descendants of the Maya, but they
will survive, and in so doing surely represent a cultural evolutionary
response to hard knocks, which students of the welfare state might do well
to recall. I have always felt that there were quantities of relevant data in
the reactions of tribal people to the inroads of civilization. Psychologists
and sociologists would do well to remember the vast resources that
ethnographers and their museums of anthropology have at their disposal.

So it seems to me that the subject of a Museum of Man is a vital

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 13

forward looking one, which could help to place the capstone on the realm
of public instruction which we can offer along the Mall. Somehow or other
the Smithsonian should play a role in interpreting man to himself through
all his endless varieties and diversity.

The past year has seen the 125th anniversary of the legislation that
established the Smithsonian Institution. In September 1971 we celebrated
this milestone. A letter from President Nixon described the contributions
of the Smithsonian and paid tribute to the English scientist “whose
generosity and vision first made its founding possible, and to the dedicated
_ generations of scientists and scholars who carried forward its mission. This
anniversary is a brilliant reminder of the public benefits that can result
from enlightened private endowment.”

The 125th anniversary was celebrated with a delightful program of
lectures and capped by a dinner at which birthday cakes in blue and gold
colors were provided and messages from around the world were read. One
of the interested participants in the 125th anniversary was former
Secretary C.G. Abbot of the Smithsonian, who in May, 1972, celebrated
his 100th birthday. Eighty percent of the history of the Smithsonian has
' been encompassed in his lifetime and one half of the history of our
Republic. Dr. Abbot’s 100th birthday, coinciding so closely with the
125th anniversary of the Smithsonian itself, reminded us once again of the
transitory nature of recent history, the fact that in a flash, as it were—the
lifetime of one man—fully half of the lifetime of our Nation has occurred.
All of us concerned rejoiced both in the anniversary of the Institution and
in the birthday anniversary of the fifth Secretary. We were delighted that
all of his successors were able to be present as well, for it is in such a sense
of continuity that we can overcome the feeling of speed and haste which
somehow so easily overcome us today.

It is significant that the largest of our two new enterprises, the
Hirshhorn gallery, on the one hand, and the National Air and Space
Museum, on the other, should be concerned with objects and ideas and
ways of thought which did not exist when former Secretary Abbot was
already an adult. The Smithsonian itself as it now exists could hardly have
been imagined at the turn of the century when Abbot had been working
for this Institution for four years. The very idea of air and space
technology was a dream, encompassed then only in the minds of
visionaries. The emphasis of the museum community itself, the concern
with social problems, and the attempts to understand our natural
environment, are programs that similarly did not then exist. At the turn of
the century, Darwin was barely accepted and his theories of evolution
were still revolutionary. Now we realize that an understanding of the
principles of Darwinian evolution is vital to our understanding of
continued life on earth.
14 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Having a 125th anniversary reminds us of the continuing efforts that
must be made to develop the most effective ways of administering so
extraordinary an institution, preserving the richness of its variety and the
liveliness of its parts, while retaining a general identity and a sense of
purpose and direction. A new element in the administration of the
Institution has been introduced this year with the retirement of James
Bradley as Under Secretary and his replacement by Mr. Robert A. Brooks
as The Assistant Secretary. Mr. Bradley, a veteran of 37 years of
government service, came to the Smithsonian in 1959 as Assistant to the
Secretary and was named Assistant Secretary in 1960 and Under Secretary
in 1971. He had served as the principal technical and administrative
assistant to the Assistant Secretary in the Department of the Interior since
1950. Earlier, from 1945 to 1950, he served as a budgetary and legislative
analyst in the Bureau of the Budget, Executive Office of the President. His
ability to handle the various threads of administration and to support the
Secretary’s Office in all its aspects has been outstanding and one of my
personal pleasures is the fact that he will continue to work for the
Institution on a part-time basis in the future. Meanwhile, we welcome
Mr. Brooks in his capacity as a replacement to Mr. Bradley and feel
convinced that his unique background of training in classical scholarship
and administrative achievement in the Department of Defense and in
private industry in management will succeed in serving the Institution’s
purposes most successfully.

At the beginning of the fiscal year David Challinor was appointed
Assistant Secretary for Science. Mr. Challinor came to the Smithsonian in
1966 with a background in forest ecology and museum administration.
Subsequently he performed an excellent job as Director of the Office of
International Activities and had been Acting Assistant Secretary for
Science since the departure of Dr. Sidney Galler.

Other activities in some of the outlying parts of the Institution have
been of great interest in 1972. During this year recognition of the pioneer
work of the team of Messrs. E. A. Link and J.Seward Johnson in
developing the unique submersible vessel, the Johnson-Sea-Link and
creating a marine center about five miles north of Fort Pierce, Florida, on
the inland waterway, resulted in the creation of the Fort Pierce Bureau.
The Bureau will be a center for research and development in the
Smithsonian’s continuing work in the sea. The five-man submersible
Johnson-Sea-Link is a fascinating vessel in which I have had the good
fortune to make a dive. It attains high visibility through a transparent
acrylic forward compartment as well as a diver lockout capability from the
aluminum afterchamber. It is possible to descend as deep as 1,000 feet or
more for study of the structure and biology of the sea floor. The research
vessel Johnson, now being completed, will service and act as a mother ship

to the submarine. This bureau is under the direction of Dr. I. E. Wallen,
who pioneered the marine sorting center facilities at the Smithsonian
itself, and has been so active in our oceanographic program.

Activities at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies have
resulted in the Smithsonian Institution joining the Chesapeake Bay
Research Consortium, Inc., for long term research of the area. This
Consortium includes support from the National Science Foundation for
scientists from the Smithsonian, Johns Hopkins, The University of
Maryland and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. In addition, close
cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey will be maintained. The
Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies continues to develop
successfully through the mixture of private land acquisition and govern-
ment agency support. During the past year, the Stevens farm of 150 acres
was added to the acreage of the Center, which now consists of a total of
2,261.26 acres, acquisition of which resulted from donations from private
individuals and foundations. These included two major gifts in the past
year: $200,000 from the Richard K. Mellon Foundation and $120,000
from the Scaife Family Charitable Trusts. In addition a donation of one
half of Jefferson Island gives the Smithsonian full title to two of the three
islands in the Poplar Island group. This donation adds to the debt of
gratitude which the Smithsonian owes to Dr. William L. Elkins of
Philadelphia, whose generosity has been notable in the past.

In October the Smithsonian Institution joined with the University of
Tel Aviv in the dedication of a new sixty inch telescope at Mitzpeh
Ramon. This is the largest telescope in Israel and further strengthens the
SAO’s connections in astronomy abroad.

An additional bureau of the Smithsonian is the Cooper-Hewitt Museum
in New York, which will become the eventual National Museum of Design.
During the past year strong support has been given to the development of
this museum in the Carnegie Mansion, a National Historic Landmark,
through the gift of that mansion to the Smithsonian from the Carnegie
Corporation, as well as an important contribution of $500,000 towards
the renovation of the house by the Andrew F. Mellon Foundation. Further
contributions have been notable including the gift of $100,000 by Mrs.
Enid Haupt towards the conversion of one of the period rooms of the
Carnegie Mansion, the beautiful old conservatory. It is planned that partial
reconstruction of the Carnegie house will begin in the coming year.

In Washington, a striking development of the past year has been the
final opening of the Renwick Gallery on the corner of Pennsylvania
Avenue and 17th Street. As readers of past annual reports will recall, the
Renwick Gallery was the original W. W. Corcoran Gallery of Art, designed
by our own architect of the Smithsonian Building, James Renwick of
church and cathedral fame. Rechristened the Renwick Gallery, the
16 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972 |

building for many years had been the home of the Court of Claims, and in
more recent times had lain uninhabited when the Court moved out to its |
new home on Jackson Place. The Renwick Gallery is next to the Blair |

House and across from the Executive Office Building and the White House.

It is one of the city’s loveliest and most historic buildings. Constructed just |

before the Civil War, it was the first building in this country designed

specifically as a gallery for art, and finally given to the Smithsonian |
through the intervention of President Lyndon B. Johnson. When the |

building opened in January 1972, visitors could view the enormous north
gallery on the second floor carefully restored to convey the impression of
its appearance in its opening days in the 1870s. We are most grateful to the
Corcoran Gallery of Art for the loan to the Smithsonian of a number of

the paintings which appeared in this original gallery. The smaller octagonal —

room on the south side of the building has been carefully restored as a
result of the generosity of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation.
In addition contemporary furniture, industrial design and James Renwick’s
own historical architectural achievements, the Index of American Design,
and Frederick Carder’s glass craftsmanship were all parts of the current,
contemporary exhibits for the opening. The building will serve continually
as a showcase for American design, crafts, and the decorative arts, as well
as serving as host for important cultural events from time to time.

Another important milestone for Smithsonian installations in the
Capital has been the preliminary approval of the master plan for the
National Zoological Park, coupled with the arrival in this country and the
donation to the National Zoo of the two giant pandas from the People’s
Republic of China. Mrs. Nixon presented the pandas to the Zoo in a
ceremony on April 20th. Installed in the former Delicate Hoofstock
Building, which is to be extensively renovated for these purposes, the
pandas already have attracted an attendance fifty percent higher for the
Zoo than in comparable periods of previous years. Ffforts are being made
to have the pandas fed at times of the day that will give visitors maximum
viewing possibilities. We are already learning far more about giant pandas
than most of the previous records of their care in captivity had prepared us
for. Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling were reported to be about the same age,
approximately 18 months old, when they arrived in this country in
mid-April, and are notable for the fact that they are very different in
weight. The female, Ling Ling, weighed 136 pounds on arrival, but had
been in captivity since June of 1971. The smaller male weighed only 74
pounds on arrival, and may be slightly younger, but has been in captivity
only since December 1971. It is thought by the Chinese keepers who
accompanied the pandas to this country, that these animals grow more
rapidly and increase their weight at a faster rate in captivity than they do
in the wild state.

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY iL7/

Somewhat nocturnal or at least crepuscular, the two animals have been

| adjusting well to their new home. They now sleep a bit less in the daytime

than they did at the beginning of their stay, spend more time at play and

_ in curious inspection of the visitors. They are fed a gruel of boiled rice and

powdered milk along with fresh fruits and vegetables and freshly cut
bamboo, and enjoy eating plants of bamboo planted in large tubs in their

_ air conditioned enclosures. Although separated for the time being, it is

planned eventually to bring them together in a common garden area to the
south of the house in which they are confined. Under the imaginative
guidance of Lester Collins, the landscape architect associated with our
architects for the master plan, Faulkner, Fryer and Vanderpool, we hope
to produce a panda haven in the form of a garden of bamboo as part of
their enclosure.

It would be inappropriate today to receive such extraordinarily rare and

valuable animals as giant pandas without making every effort to insure that

they eventually should mate and reproduce. Pandas have been reared in
captivity in the Peking Zoo, and it is the hope of the National Zoological
Park, as it would be of any responsible zoo today, that the stewardship of
these animals will include sensible and pragmatic efforts to have them
breed. More and more, the major zoos of the world today are becoming
bound together in a common concern and new fraternity as stocks of

endangered species of animals continue to decline. One of the ambitions of

the National Zoological Park is to create its own breeding area somewhere
outside of Washington, so that certain stocks of rare species may be
entrusted to the Zoo for safe-keeping and breeding in captivity. With the
constant destruction of habitat, more and more species of animals will
tend to become rare, vulnerable, and endangered. Many of these species
will not be susceptible to captive rearing, but on the other hand, many of
the larger animals, mammals, and birds particularly can be reared in
captivity. Through international cooperative efforts, breeding stocks of
such animals may be maintained for the day, some time in the future,
when international public sentiment will have evolved sufficiently to
restore some balance between human habitation and animal occupation of
former range. As nation after nation becomes more sophisticated and
understanding of the interplay between man and his animal relatives and
neighbors increases, there is hope that natural areas may be preserved and
kept around the world to serve as resources for the future. In such areas,
many of the presently endangered species can be reintroduced successfully
in time. The example of the San Diego Zoological Society, in creating their
big natural park for breeding stocks of certain animals such as the white or
wide-lipped rhinoceros of Africa, is inspiring.

It is incumbent upon the National Zoological Park to join this
movement and to develop its own breeding area outside of the city. Such a
i
18 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1073

breeding area can serve as a Satellite zoo, in effect combining both
visitation possibilities for tourists and regional visitors, as well as secure
breeding sanctuaries. The original example of the Whipsnade division of
the London Zoological Society at Regents Park and the additional work |
being done by American zoos are all part and parcel of our hopes and}
ambitions for the National Zoo of the future.

On 17 May 1972, the Institution opened a major exhibit on drugs. Over |
two years in preparation, the purpose of the exhibit was to see how the |
Smithsonian, looking at the historical roots and evolution of the use of |
hallucinogens, could develop an exhibit that would educate the public in
understanding drugs in our culture. Since the earliest times, drugs have
played a significant role in religion and, later on, in medicine. Today
without the constant refinement and use of drugs, medical practice would
be at a standstill. In the conviction that our culture has evolved in close
company with the rational and disciplined use of drugs, first in religion
among the priestly castes and secondly among alchemists and doctors, we
felt that it would be possible to arrange an exhibit which would rationalize
in people’s minds the traditional uses of these extraordinary substances.
The exhibit has been supported with help from several foundations and
drug companies and has pointed towards a new dimension in our ability to
tell a story through an exhibition. The use of “talking heads,” as
developed by our Department of Exhibits has been noteworthy. The text
material for the exhibit, prepared with the aid of the National Institute of
Mental Health, the President’s Committee on Drug Abuse, and a number
of national and international authorities, has given us, I hope, the source
material for a book which can be used as a textbook on the current status
and knowledge about the use of drugs both beneficially and harmfully in
our lives.

It is hoped that the exhibit will travel and will be widely viewed around
the country. Shortly after the opening of the exhibit the Institution was
honored by being given the Pacesetter Award from the National Coordinat-
ing Council on Drug Education, in recognition of our innovative educational
exhibit. It is our hope that this exhibit will contribute to developing a ra-
tional approach towards the understanding and prevention of drug abuse.

In connection with our museum programs, we have been happy to
obtain the addition of Mr. Paul N. Perrot to our staff. Mr. Perrot has been
for twelve years Director of the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New
York. He will assume office on 1 August 1972 as the Assistant Secretary
for Museum Programs of the Institution, succeeding Mr. Frank A. Taylor
who had been our pioneer head as Director General of Museum Programs.
Like Mr. Taylor, Mr. Perrot has had long experience with museums in this
country, as well as contacts abroad, and should be a most valuable
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 19

associate in connection with the Institution’s National Museum Act, our
Exhibits Program for museums both here and abroad, our libraries, our
Conservation-Analytic Laboratory, and for museum affairs in general. It
has been unexpectedly sad that he comes to us just after the tragedy of
Hurricane ‘“‘Agnes”’ had destroyed so much of the important collection and
library of the Corning Museum of Glass, and we greet him with mixed
emotions of happiness at his arrival and commiseration with him, his
colleagues and associates at Corning, New York.

Of outstanding importance in this year has been the official commit-
ment by Mr.Hirshhorn of an additional gift of 326 paintings and
sculptures valued at more than $7 million for the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden. The paintings and sculptures involved are of the finest
quality and include an important portrait by John Singer Sargent of 1884,
a vitally important painting by Piet Mondrian of 1935, a Picasso sculpture
of 1950, and an additional important David Smith, to round out the large
Smith group in the Collection. The Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn
Museum have held three meetings, in Washington, New York, and
Greenwich, and noted with approval the planning for the catalog of the
inaugural exhibition which will be published by Harry N. Abrams,
Incorporated. Mr. Lerner, Director of the Hirshhorn Museum, has an-
nounced that Douglas MacAgy, former Director of National Exhibitions,
National Endowment for the Arts, has been named Curator for the
Opening Show. The public opening of the Hirshhorn Museum and
Sculpture Garden is scheduled for late autumn, 1973. At that time the
collection of sculpture, complemented by a strong selection of modern
American paintings and significant European works, will add greatly to the
range and depth of artistic achievement on public view under the aegis of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Progress continues to be the watchword for the Anacostia Neighbor-
hood Museum, which has been extremely active during 1972. The Museum
has expanded its effort to involve more people in the community in every
aspect of the museum experience, and plans this coming year to establish
an exhibits, design, and production laboratory, which will offer training in
all phases of exhibition work. A small building has been planned for this
laboratory and an important proposal has been submitted to a private
foundation for funding.

In the National Museum of History and Technology a major opening of
the past year has been that of a 19th-century Post Office Country Store.
The U.S. Postal Service cooperated in the development of this exhibit and
has provided a staff of three clerks to handle philatelic sales and regular
mail for visitors to the Museum on a daily basis. The furnishings and
objects in this store, a former Headsville, West Virginia, Post Office,
originally constructed in the early 1860s, recreate the 1890-1910 period.
20 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

It is a living historical exhibit, dramatizing the importance of postal
communications and the role of the post office as a social institution in
the American community. A special postmark incorporates a pictorial
representation of the Headsville Post Office and has been applied to all the
mail deposited at our new “Smithsonian Station.”

The Division of Postal History at the Museum has been fortunate this
year in acquiring an outstanding envelope carried by the pony express in
1861 and a pair of rare stamps issued for mail carried by the balloon,
Buffalo, in 1877.

Many additional acquisitions in photographs, daguerrotypes and associ-
ated items have also been received by the Division of Photographic
History. This spring a Hall of News Reporting is being opened, made
possible by generous donations from Time-Life, Inc., and The Salt Lake
Herald Tribune among others. This summer has also included the re-
opening of the Hall of Graphic Arts and the Hall of Numismatics. These
halls have been redesigned since the unfortunate fire in the Museum of
History and Technology a little over a year ago.

The Friends of Music at the Smithsonian had a memorable program in
April 1972, including an entire festival weekend under the direction of
Mrs. Constance Louden Mellen as Chairman of the Friends, and of our
Concert Director, James Weaver. Fifty guests from many parts of the
country attended and were taken on tours of the Division of Music’s
handsomely installed exhibits and study collections, and in addition given
dinners and receptions provided by local resident Friends of Music,
culminating in a superb performance of Rameau, Couperin, Bach, and
Handel in the Hall of Musical Instruments. The weekend was a delight, and
grateful thanks are indeed owed to the organization of Friends of Music at
the Smithsonian.

Plans have been inaugurated for the opening of a new gallery on the
American Merchant Marine. A brochure has been published outlining the
projected hall’s theme which will expand the present collection beyond
the limits of ships and types of ship models. Under the direction of Dr.
Melvin H. Jackson, Curator of the Maritime Collections, it is hoped to
convey a greater scope to the exhibits which will capture some of the
glamor of the seatrader’s life and the romance of ocean commerce. The
scheme is an ambitious one and holds great promise to enliven and
broaden the appeal of exhibits in the history of technology. An effort is
being made to secure private support for the installation of the new hall.

Behind all this, performing less spectacular but nonetheless vital jobs,
are the many administrative and support activities which enable the people
engaged in the more glamorous history, art, science, and scholarly pursuits
of the Smithsonian to carry on their work.

During the past year the Woodrow Wilson Center for International
if
|

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY P|

Studies has been extremely busy and active. A number of important
seminars have been held including informal visits to the Smithsonian
Building by Prime Minister Willy Brandt of West Germany and Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi of India. In addition the Club of Rome, in
conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woodrow
Wilson Center, and the Smithsonian, held a one-day seminar on the subject
of the Limits of Growth, the stimulating book developed as a result of
studies by computer scientists and economists at M.I.T. This seminar
attracted considerable attention, although the subject matter has come
under spirited debate and the question of the validity of the projections
will continue to be argued for a number of years. An airing of such a
subject at this time, however, can always be assumed to be of the greatest
value.

Additionally, in December 1971, the Institution played host for several
days to the Group of Ten Finance Ministers at the request of then
Secretary of the Treasury, John B. Connally. This momentous meeting,
the first of the Finance Ministers to be held in Washington, was a landmark
meeting for the Smithsonian itself, and we hope that the benign influence
of the Castle Building was useful in promoting a community of financial
interests among the nations concerned. Even though the dollar proceeded
to float thereafter to the dismay of a good many of us, the merits of the
case were well thrashed out and the immediate results seem to have been
propitious.

In February 1972, as a result of the offer of air transportation by
Mr. Watson, four of the Regents and their wives, accompanied by
Smithsonian officials made a flying weekend visit to the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute in the Panama Canal Zone and the Republic of
Panama. The trip was an enormous success and a veritable eye-opener for
the Regents involved, Senator Fulbright, Congressman Bow, Mr. Watson
and Dr. Greenewalt; all of them found the occasion a memorable one,
especially in understanding the complex ecological studies being under-
taken in the tropics. During the visit the Regents had an opportunity of
seeing the headquarters of STRI at Ancon in the Canal Zone in a building
made available to the Smithsonian by the Canal Zone government next to
the Gorgas Memorial Hospital. In addition they were able to see the Naos
Island laboratories on the Pacific side of the canal and the work being
done there on the biology of intertidal animals, marine environmental
monitoring, and such fascinating subjects as the competition of coral
species, and the reaction of unsuspecting Atlantic fish species to the
poisonous Pacific sea snakes, a subject of great interest in connection with
their possible introduction to the Caribbean Sea via a sea-level canal. The
party also had an opportunity to visit the Galeta Island marine station on
the Caribbean side of the canal, where studies are being undertaken on the
1

long term consequences of oil spills, as well as a wide variety of basic |

research. |
A visit to Barro Colorado Island in freshwater Gatun Lake was a high |

point of our stay, for this island, formed when the Chagres River was
dammed for the canal in 1914, has been held intact as a laboratory reserve |
since the 1920s. Its nearly 4,000 acres under the quarter-century
administration of the Smithsonian serve as one of the most valuable
tropical research laboratories in the world. Research records have been
maintained of the flora and the fauna of the island since it was first set |
aside as a research center, and records of such continuous duration are rare
indeed for tropical areas of the world. The reception that the Regents and
their party received from the officials of the Republic of Panama as well as
the Canal Zone was outstanding, and it was a joy to all of us to meet with
so much hospitality as well as comprehension of the Institution’s programs |
by the local residents and officials. It is hoped in the future to plan
additional field trips for members of the Board of Regents as well as
members of the National Associates Board. The success of this first trip |
was so marked that it seems important to give Board members additional
opportunities for such personal experiences.

Three meetings of the Board of Regents were held during the past year.
The autumn meeting was convened on 27 September 1971 in the
Director’s Conference Room of the National Museum of History and
Technology. The principal discussion centered around the 1976 commem-
oration of the Bicentennial of the American Revolution which, as I have
said, offers the Smithsonian Institution a rare opportunity to help to
delineate our National achievements. Presentation of the proposed
Smithsonian program was made by a number of bureau directors: Michael
Collins for the National Air and Space Museum, Daniel J. Boorstin for the
National Museum of History and Technology, John H. Magruder for the
National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board, and Theodore H. Reed
for the National Zoological Park. Others presented a brief report on the
proposed “Year of the Centennial” exhibit in the Arts and Industries
Building, and the Festival of American Folklife.

The winter meeting was held at Hillwood, the estate of Mrs. Marjorie
Merriweather Post, on 27 January 1972. The appointment of Thomas J.
Watson, Jr., as a member of the Executive Committee (Permanent
Committee) was confirmed by the Board of Regents. Senator Clinton P.
Anderson resigned from the Executive Committee and the Board ex-
pressed its highest regard for his effectiveness in the deliberations of that
Committee for the last eight years.

Following the meeting, the members of the Board of Regents attended
the opening of the Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery, located at 17th and
Pennsylvania Avenue.

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 23

The spring meeting of the Board was held in the Regents’ Room of the
Smithsonian Institution Building on 10 May 1972. Mr. James E. Webb was

named Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Regents,

and Dr. William A.M. Burden was appointed a member of the Executive

- Committee.

The Board of Regents approved the adoption of new principles

_ designed to make possible improved performance in the management of its
_ endowment funds. These principles include the establishment of maximum

total return as the investment objective for the funds without assuming an

inappropriate degree of risk, and the determination of amounts to be

distributed from endowment funds each year as a prudent portion of the
average total return expected on these funds over an extended period.

On 11 May 1972, the President signed into law the appointments of
three new citizen Regents. The appointments of John Paul Austin,
A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and Robert F. Goheen, are for the statutory
term of six years.

The Regents received a number of status reports including construction

' progress on the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, which has been
» delayed by difficulties in the construction itself, as well as industry-wide

strikes and slowdowns.
The design concept of the National Air and Space Museum was

| approved by the Commission of Fine Arts. The House of Representatives

included in the appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1973 an appropriation

of $13 million and express contract authority for an additional $27

million for the construction of this project.

The National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board was the subject of
legislation introduced during the year to establish a Bicentennial Outdoor
Museum, to designate the authorized study center as the Dwight D.
Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research, and to authorize the transfer
of federal lands at Fort Foote, Maryland, to the administrative jurisdiction
of the Smithsonian. Negotiations with the Prince George’s County
Planning Board and with the local communities continued through the
year.

The Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc., received a

| supplemental appropriation of $300,000 to provide for normal operation

through the fiscal year.

The National Zoological Park master plan received preliminary approval
from the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning
Commission. The plan emphasizes the landscape and animals, and
subordinates the visual impact of building construction. Particular atten-
tion was given to the critical matter of automobile parking and traffic. At
this meeting the Secretary reported that Robert A. Brooks will succeed
Under Secretary James Bradley with the title of The Assistant Secretary
24 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

on 1 July 1972. The members of the Board recorded their appreciation of |
the extraordinary service that James Bradley has rendered to the
Smithsonian. |

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Board of Regents honored Dr.
Charles G. Abbot, former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, on the
occasion of his 100th birthday.

If one lesson has been learned this year it is that we must alert ourselves
and all the powers that be in Washington that time will not stand still, and
that the tidal wave of “company” will descend upon us inexorably in the
next four years. We can paraphrase the poet and declare that “‘the World is
too much with us late and soon, getting and begetting,” but we know that
the souls so created will crowd in upon us ever more closely—full of the
stuff of life, endlessly consuming to ashes the remains of time and
purpose, of objects carefully wrought, of past history. We cannot halt the
tide but only make our preparations while we may and pray for affection
and comprehension. If Americans have begun to indulge in self-doubt, let
us rejoice, for this should be an encouragement. Self-doubt and a certain
hesitancy can be the beginning of the road to self-knowledge and thus to
comprehension and to wisdom. Can we not prepare for that?
Financial Report

It is a rare experience for educational and research institutions to have
adequate funds to take care of all their pressing needs and promising
opportunities for improvements and imaginative new projects. In this
respect, the Smithsonian Institution is no different from its counterparts.
Nevertheless, fiscal year 1972 was one from which the Institution may
derive a degree of satisfaction from improvements on a number of
budgetary fronts—many of these resulting from programs initiated in
previous years.

Increased FY 1972 federal appropriations, which account for over
three-quarters of our total financial support, moved toward easing
accumulated research support shortages and also made possible additional
services to our visitors and the start of certain important new research
projects. Private unrestricted fund accounts, vital to the unique character
of this Institution, showed a favorable balance between income and
expenditures for the first time in five years. This welcome result followed
introduction of improved accounting and budgeting methods, tighter
control of expenditures, a gradual extension of fund-raising efforts, and
modest improvement in a number of revenue-producing areas. In addition,
increased donations for specific purposes and larger grant and contract
awards also benefited the many projects covered by these restricted-
purpose funds. New policies adopted this year with respect to the handling
of investment funds of the Institution are expected to bring important
benefits in future years.

Overall Sources and Application of Financial Support

Total support of the Institution from all sources for operating purposes
approximated $62,700,000 in fiscal year 1972, compared with
$52,800,000 in the previous year. In addition, $6,347,000 was received
for construction projects, somewhat less than the $7,125,000 in FY 1971.

Federal Appropriated Funds

Operations (Salaries and Expenses).~As shown above in the tabulation
of sources of support, Congress increased the Smithsonian’s appropriation
for regular operations by over $9,400,000 in FY 1972. Of this amount,
however, $1,600,000 represented an appropriation for the Smithsonian
Science Information Exchange (Table 1) which had been funded since
1964 by grants from the National Science Foundation. Nearly $2,000,000
of the increase in appropriations, furthermore, was necessary merely to
meet legislated increases in federal salaries. Continued inflationary cost
increases for supplies and other services absorbed additional monies.
Nevertheless, the remaining increase of more than $5,000,000 included
provision for an important start on correcting the serious imbalance
between professional research and curatorial efforts, on the one hand, and
the level of technical support for these efforts, on the other. Such
technical support had been eroded in previous years as the limited funds
available had to be increasingly devoted to salaries of the professional
} STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 29

staff, leaving progressively lesser amounts for technicians, assistants,
equipment, and supplies. Accessions of new or expanded collections
meanwhile accentuated such needs. Increases in appropriations provided in
FY 1972 were the first step toward elimination over a three-year period of
these shortages in the National Museum of Natural History.
| Similarly, a $500,000 increase for the National Zoological Park made
possible improved veterinary treatment and research. An allowance of
$600, 000 was received to implement the program of the National Museum
Act, authorized in 1970; of this amount, $200,000 was transferred by
legislative requirement to the National Endowments for the Arts and
-Humanities. Other major benefits from increased Congressional support
were directed toward the visiting public: funding of a major new exhibit,
“The World of Living Things,” provision for longer visitor hours for our
Mall museums, the opening of the Renwick Gallery, and stepped-up
preparations for the opening of the Hirshhorn Museum. Finally, $500,000
was provided for Smithsonian’s share of a group effort to establish a new,
large, low-cost, multi-mirror telescope which should represent a break-
through in instrumentation of this type and lead to important new
discoveries in astrophysics.
The division of the Institution’s federal appropriations for operating
purposes (excluding special Foreign Currency Program) in recent years,
among its broad areas of services, has been as follows (in thousands):

*Includes $1,600,000 for the Science Information Exchange which had been
funded since 1964 by grants from the National Science Foundation.

After allowance for the change in form of funding of the Science
Information Exchange in FY 1972, the percentage share of each of the
service areas has remained fairly constant in this four-year period, except
that the combined share of Administration and Building Maintenance has
fallen from 34 to 31 percent, with slight percentage increases in Science
and Public Service.
30 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972°

Special Foreign Currency Program.—Since 1966 the Smithsonian has}
been administering a program of grants benefiting more than 200 museums)
and universities in the United States in order that they may carry on}
research in certain foreign countries where blocked currency credits,)
usable only in those countries, are available to the United States in return)
for services previously provided. Annual appropriations to the Smithsonian!
from available blocked currency to fund such grants increased in FY 1972
from $2,500,000 to $3,500,000. Use of such grant monies in FY 1972 was)

Construction.—From the tabulation of sources of support, it can be
seen that Congress appropriated to the Smithsonian Institution in FY
1972, a total of $6,347,000 for construction purposes. Of this,
$3,697,000 represented the final balance of the $15 million authorized by
Congress for the Hirshhom Museum construction, which is to be
completed in FY 1973. In addition, $1,900,000 was granted to cover the
planning and redesign of the new National Air and Space Museum on the
Mall, construction of which was authorized in 1966. Another $750,000
was appropriated for completion of the Renwick Gallery renovation plus
various relatively minor improvements elsewhere.

Research Grants and Contracts

An important part of the Institution’s research work is funded by
grants and contracts received from federal agencies. Following is a

The decline in the total for FY 1972 compared with FY 1971 was
caused entirely by the elimination in this past year of the National Science
Foundation grant for the Science Information Exchange. In FY 72
Smithsonian took over the responsibility for the funding, as well as the
management of, the Exchange with its $1,600,000 becoming a new
separate Smithsonian federal appropriation rather than being received in
the form of a contract. With this exception, there has been an increase in
federal grants and contracts received during the past year.

It may be noted from Table 1, that the major recipient of grants and
contracts is the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, with a total of
$4,755,000 for FY 1972. Grants to the Observatory covered, among other
things, work done on tracking of satellites, monitoring of stellar
observations from the celescope satellite and experiments concerning
continental drift. A large share of the remaining research grants and
contracts went to the scientists of our National Museum of Natural
History and the Office of Environmental Sciences covering a variety of
studies from sources of endemic Asian diseases to analysis of the contents
of areas of the oceans. Grants and contracts also extended beneficially the
work of our Oceanographic Sorting Center, Tropical Research Center, and
Division of Performing Arts. A major contract, received near the close of
the fiscal year, will fund worldwide population studies by our Interdis-
ciplinary Communications Program.

Private Trust Funds

As mentioned earlier, the largest part of the funding of the Institution
comes from federal appropriations, augmented further by substantial
a2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972 —

amounts of grants and contracts from federal agencies. Equally important
in many ways, however, is the “private side” of the Institution, since, the

Smithsonian derives its unique character in large part from this combina- —

tion of Governmental and private support, permitting operating flexibility,
nonpolitical objectivity, and greater attraction to its many private donors.

The resources for the Smithsonian private side are in the form of
income from endowment funds, donations from foundations, corporations
or individuals, and to a lesser extent, receipts from concessions and
miscellaneous sources. In appraising these resources an important distinc-
tion must be made between income received for unrestricted as compared
with restricted purposes. The largest share of both the investment and gift

income is for specific (restricted) purposes, with only a regretably small —

unrestricted portion which can be directed to support Institutionally
determined priority needs or promising program opportunities.

In fiscal year 1972 the private fund income, excluding gifts to—
endowment funds, for both restricted and unrestricted purposes totaled —

$4,849,000 as follows (in thousands):

Not included in the above figures are the results of our revenue-
producing activities, such as, the Smithsonian Magazine and museum
shops, since on balance these activities do not yet produce net income
although they are expected to do so in the future.

Unrestricted Private Funds.—The most significant fact about this
important segment of the Smithsonian’s financial affairs is that in FY
1972 a favorable balance was reestablished between income and expendi-
tures. The gain of $61,000 was, of course, small, but it was achieved at a
time when many educational institutions and museums are reporting
serious financial losses. It was also achieved despite the continued rise in
costs and pressing needs for greater services—factors that contributed

———

heavily to the Smithsonian’s own losses of private unrestricted funds in the —

previous four years.

As may be seen from these figures, the improvement in FY 1972 |

resulted principally from (1) control of administrative expenses and their
recovery through proper charges to grants and contracts, revenue-
producing activities, and other privately funded programs of the Institu-
tion, and (2) the nearly $400,000 reduction in the loss of our revenue-

producing activities. Together these two factors more than offset the
absence in FY 1972 of a special one-time $300,000 gift for unrestricted
purposes, which was so beneficial in FY 1971.
The gain of $61,000 in FY 1972 reversed the down-trend in the balance
-of our unrestricted funds and increased it slightly to $1,781,000 at
30 June 1972. This figure, however, is still well below a comfortable level
for current working funds of the Institution. Intensive steps must be
continued to rebuild this working capital by more than $1 million to at
least the $2,851,000 figure existing at the end of 1969. More than $1
million of such working capital is required to support grant and contract
work performed before payment is received, another $700,000 for
investment in inventories, and at least $1 million more must be maintained
‘for payrolls, accounts receivable, and cash fluctuations of a seasonal
nature.
There is, however, reason to believe that improvement in this direction
lies ahead. Our Development Office, together with the National Associates
34 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972.

Organization, is now working on a program which will hopefully produce
an annual flow of donations and bequests from an increasingly large

number of interested parties. Approximately $171,000 of gifts for:
unrestricted purposes were received in FY 1972 in addition to much larger

grants, principally from foundations, for specifically designated purposes
(see “Restricted Private Funds” below).
At the same time our revenue-producing enterprises show promise of

producing significant income in the next several years to bolster our

private resources. Additional data on the finances of these revenue-

Associate Members by 30 June 1972. Despite the unusual expenses related
to the circulation-building efforts, financial results were greatly improved,
registering $2,500 net income for the year compared with a loss of
$209,000 in the previous year.

The Museum Shops showed a sharp 35 percent increase in volume this
year. Financial results moved from previous losses to a gain of $19,000
and should show increasing gains in the future. Shop areas were expanded
i STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 35

iad a new shop will open at the Renwick Gallery in mid-1972. Two sales
‘exhibitions and increasing emphasis on offering educational items reflect-
ing the various museum exhibits contributed to the progress of these
auxiliary operations.
__ The closely related program of product development is now underway.
If successful it should become an important element in improving the
balance between private and federal resources of the Institution. Equally
important, this program is directed toward spreading nationally the
Smithsonian’s educational efforts through the distribution by independent
manufacturers of authenticated items related to our collections. Great care
will be taken with this program to maintain strict standards of quality,
authenticity, and good taste.

As may be noted from the preceding tabulation, two other activities,
the Smithsonian Press and the Division of Performing Arts, have required
subsidies from our private funds in recent years. These programs provide

both educational and entertainment value, but strenuous efforts are being
directed toward elimination of their financial losses while preserving their
cultural values.
Restricted Private Funds.— Additions to “restricted” funds dedicated to
specific purposes (exclusive of gifts to endowment funds) totaled
$5,151,000 in FY 1972, but this included a special transfer of $612,000
from the principal of Endowment Fund No. 3, in part to allow completion
of the renovation of the research vessel Johnson at Fort Pierce, and in part
as an advance against FY 1973 operating funds for this bureau. Including
this special transfer, $2,082,000 came from endowment funds, $2,618,000
from donations, and $451,000 from miscellaneous sources. The major
bureaus and programs supported by these funds, together with their total
related income and expenditures in FY 1972 were as follows (in

The Freer Gallery is largely supported by income from endowment
funds originally provided for this purpose by Charles Freer at the time of
the construction of the Gallery; it also receives some federal support.
Inflationary cost increases of recent years have made it increasingly
difficult to operate within available income.

The Fort Pierce, Florida, oceanographic facility is supported entirely by
income from Endowment Fund No. 3, donated to the Smithsonian for this
purpose during the past two years. The Center’s expenditures have been
principally for research operations of the Center’s oceanographic submersi-
ble, the Johnson-Sea-Link, and for renovation of the tender ship, R/V
Johnson. These renovations, to be completed in September 1972, caused
FY 1972 expenditures to exceed available endowment fund income,
necessitating a one-time withdrawal of funds in FY 1972 for this purpose
from the principal of the endowment fund itself.

Two important new gifts in support of the Chesapeake Bay Center’s
land acquisition program were received during this year—$200,000 from
the Richard King Mellon Foundation and $120,000 from The Scaife
Family of Pittsburgh. These gifts made possible the repayment of a
$175,000 loan previously incurred for land purchases, as well as the
purchase of an additional parcel of land, and brought to $1,669,000 the
total thus far received for this project. Most of the major plots of land
have now been obtained and negotiations are in progress for the remaining
areas. Substantial additional sums will still be required to complete
payments for these acquisitions.

The planned renovation of the Carnegie Mansion in New York City to
house the Cooper-Hewitt Museum was launched in a most encouraging
way in December 1971 by a grant of $500,000 from the A. W. Mellon
Foundation. Nearly $300,000 more of renovation funds has also been
received from other sources. In addition, gifts totaling $128,000 were
received during the year toward the operating programs of the Museum.
This Museum will need greater financial support for both purposes in
future years.

The Reading Is Fundamental Program, initiated by Mrs. Robert S.
McNamara and now operated in association with the Smithsonian, has
} STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 37,
{

been generously supported by the Ford Foundation, and the program has
now been awarded a new grant from the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation totaling $1,130,000 over a three-year period. This should
enable R.I.F. to become self-sustaining thereafter.

A complete list of donors for FY 1972 is included at the end of this
financial report.

Endowment Funds.—The Smithsonian endowment funds are handled in
three separate investment accounts, namely, the Freer Fund, dedicated
entirely to the operation of the Freer Gallery of Art; Endowment Fund

No. 3, devoted entirely to oceanographic research; and the Consolidated
Fund in which all other endowment and similar funds of the Institution
are pooled for common investment although maintained separately for
accounting and administrative purposes. A listing of individual funds
included in our Consolidated Fund and their related book values, market
values, net income and unexpended income balances are set forth in
Table 2.
The growth of these endowment funds in recent years is shown in the
following comparison of their market values at intervals since 1960 (in
thousands):

Of the $32,014,000 total increase from 30 June 1960 to 30 June 1972,
$7,354,000 of Endowment Fund No. 3 and $6,277,000 of Consolidated
Fund was the result of additions from donations and reinvestment of
income and the remaining $18,383,000 represented an increase in the
market values of securities. During the year ended 30 June 1972, net
additions of new funds to the Consolidated Fund equaled $131,000, while
a net amount of $891,000 was transferred from Endowment Fund No. 3
to current operating accounts; market appreciation of total funds in this
year amount to $8,055,000.

Effective 1 July 1971, management of these funds were distributed
among three different investment managers with performance being
monitored closely by the Investment Policy Committee and the Treasurer.
The results achieved thus far have substantially exceeded the average rise
in stock values in the 12-month period to 30 June 1972. A breakdown of

the three endowment funds as of 30June 1972, showing types of
investments held, with related book and market values, is given in Table 3.
A listing of the individual investments held in the various endowment
funds may be obtained upon request to the Treasurer of the Institution.
Much attention has been given to the management of the Institution’s
endowment funds during the past three years. In addition to the steps
taken by the Board of Regents in FY 1971 to establish the Investment
Policy Committee and, upon its recommendation, to appoint new
investment managers with full discretion for the investment of the funds
(subject to broad policies established by the Board and to prompt
reporting of transactions), we have been investigating for some time the
desirability of adopting ‘““Total Return” as the investment goal of all of our
endowment funds. Briefly, this concept of investment management is in
two parts: first, it establishes maximum total return (interest and dividend
income plus appreciation in market values), without assuming an inappro-
priate degree of risk, as the investment management goal; second, it
provides that the income to be derived from the endowment funds, in lieu
of interest and dividends received by the fund in that year, shall be a
prudent amount determined in relation to the value of the funds, taking
into account both present and future needs of the Institution. The purpose

of the policy is to allow investment in the most attractive securities from
the point of view of expected total investment return without the need to
restrict them to those providing higher current yields.

With the agreement of the Board of Regents, this policy has been
followed during the past year for “quasi-endowment” funds (namely those
in which the principal, as well as interest and dividend, yields may be used
for the purposes specified), a course of action now followed by many

|

| STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 41

leading universities since adoption of the policy was first recommended by
a study financed by the Ford Foundation. More recently, the Institution
has received from the Washington firm of Covington & Burling a strong
| legal opinion supporting its use of the Total Return policy for true
endowment funds as well as quasi-endowment funds. Based upon this
opinion and upon the recommendation of our Investment Policy Com-
mittee, the Board of Regents, in May 1972, authorized adoption of the
Maximum Total Return policy as the goal for all of our endowment funds.
It is believed that this policy, which also has the full support of our three
investment managers, will enable our endowment funds to show an
improved record in future years.

The Board of Regents also approved the recommendation of the
Investment Policy Committee that the prudent amount of income to be
derived from the endowment funds should be 4% percent annually based
upon the moving five-year average market values of each of the funds.
Insofar as income is concerned, there will be little immediate effect on any
of the funds except the Freer Fund; endowment income to the Freer
Gallery will increase immediately by over $100,000 per year and bring
beneficial relief to that gallery in keeping abreast of its expenditure
requirements.

Accounting and Auditing.— As mentioned earlier the improved financial
results in FY 1972 were aided in no small measure by beneficial changes in
accounting and budgeting procedures and reports instituted by our
Accounting, Budgeting and Grant Administration offices over the past two
or three years. The control budgets, reporting of monthly operations, and
regular monthly financial review meetings, combined with increased
participation in the planning and budgeting process at bureau and
administrative levels have all served to clarify the Institution’s basically
complex financial affairs. Increasing use of computer program aids is a part
of these efforts. Appreciation is expressed herewith to the staffs of these
offices for their initiative shown in this important work.

Private side finances of the Institution are annually audited in full by
independent public accountants; their report for FY 1972 on following
pages includes comparative balance sheets and a statement of changes in
balances in all the various funds. Grant and contract monies received from
federal agencies are audited annually by the Defense Contract Audit
Agency. Audits of federally appropriated funds, as well as portions of the
Institution’s non-federal funds, are conducted regularly by our own
internal audit staff, and from time to time by the General Accounting
Office. Special Foreign Currency grants are also audited by the internal
auditing staff aided by foreign independent accountants, and in some cases
by the audit staff of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Regents
Smithsonian Institution:

We have examined the balance sheet of private funds of Smithsonian
Institution as of 30 June 1972 and the related statement of changes in
fund balances for the year then ended. Such statements do not include the
account of the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts, nor other departments, bureaus and operations
administered by the Institution under federal appropriations. Our exami-
nation was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such
other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

As explained in note 1 of the notes to financial statements, the
Institution has consistently followed the practice of reflecting in its
financial statements as fixed assets only museum shops and computer
equipment and other fixed assets acquired through gift or through use of
gift funds. Generally accepted accounting principles for non-profit
organizations require the recording of all fixed assets in the financial
statements.

In our opinion, except for the method as discussed in the preceding
paragraph, the accompanying balance sheet and statement of changes in
fund balance of private funds present fairly the financial position of
Smithsonian Institution at 30 June 1972, and the results of its operations
for the year then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
PRIVATE FUNDS

Notes to Financial Statements
30 June 1972

1. Accounting Principles.—The institution follows the accrual method of account-
ing except that accrued vacation pay has not been reflected on the accompanying
financial statements.

Fixed assets are recorded as follows:

Museum shops and computer equipment: Those purchased from private funds are
capitalized in the current fund.

Land and buildings: Those acquired by gift or by use of gift funds are recorded in
the real estate acquisition fund at cost or appraised value at date of gift, except for
gifts of certain islands in the Chesapeake Bay and the Carnegie Mansion which have
been recorded at nominal values.

All other land, buildings, furniture, equipment, works of art, living or other
specimens are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements.

Museum Shops and computer equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis
over an estimated useful life of five years. In accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for non-profit organizations, depreciation is not provided on
non-income producing assets.

2. Deferred Magazine Expenses.—This amount represents promotional expenses
incurred in connection with the Smithsonian magazine. These expenses are to be
amortized over a period of twelve months.

3. Note Payable.—The note payable in the principal amount of $383,691 is
secured by computer equipment and is payable in monthly installments of $7,993 to
30 June 1976.

4. Mortgage Notes Payable.-The mortgage notes payable are secured by first
deeds of trust on property acquired in connection with the Chesapeake Bay Center.
Funds for the curtailment of these notes will be transferred from restricted
funds—gifts, designated for the development of the Chesapeake Bay Center. The
details of the mortgage notes payable are as follows:

a. A $226,100 note on property acquired for $376,000. The note is payable in
nineteen consecutive semi-annual installments of $13,300, plus interest at the
prevailing prime rate on the due date of payment but not less than 8% with the
final payment due 1 July 1980.

b. A $37,038 note on property acquired for $118,533. The note is payable in
monthly installments of $451, including interest at the rate of 6%, with the final
payment due on 1 November 1989.

c. A $90,000 note on property acquired for $120,000. The note is payable in three
consecutive annual installments of $30,000, plus interest at the rate of 7 percent
on the unpaid balance, with the final payment due 1 November 1974.

5. Real Estate Acquisition Funds.—The real estate acquisition funds include
certain land and buildings acquired by gift or purchased from restricted funds. This
property is currently being used for museums, the Chesapeake Bay Center and a
conference center. Previously this property was included as part of the endowment
and similar funds. The prior year’s financial statements have been reclassified to
reflect this change.
SCIENCE

Science at the Smithsonian has been free of many of the constraints to
which large government agencies are subject. The benefit accruing from
this freedom has resulted in the innovative and often unconventional
research that follows in the reports of the bureaus.

It is worth noting that when the Astronomy Survey Committee of the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council
published its independently formulated standard entitled Astronomy and
Astrophysics in the 1970’s the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
could already show substantial progress on its own towards every one of
the Committee’s recommendations. One of the most dramatic innovations
by SAO during the year has been the start of construction of a
multiple-mirror telescope (MMT) in cooperation with the University of
Arizona. Although not a new concept, this is the first time the
multiple-mirror technique has been attempted on a telescope of this size.
When finished it will be the third largest optical telescope in the world.
The MMT, when completed, will be capable of performance hitherto only
equaled by conventional instruments of larger size and costing several
million dollars more.

Exhibit plans are moving rapidly ahead for the new Air and Space
Museum, which, pending Congressional approval, is scheduled to open in
1976. Construction of Washington’s first planetarium is well advanced, and
the prototype of a highly imaginative spacearium is being constructed,
which will allow the audience to “travel” into space and look back at the
earth and our solar system. With cooperation from the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory the proposed exhibits will afford the lay
visitor new perspectives of our universe and a greater knowledge of some
of the exciting discoveries and theories of astrophysics.

Substantial progress has been made in the interbureau research of the
Environmental Science Program. The first research results of this long-term
project will soon be published on the Zoo’s study of two species of sloth
at Barro Colorado Island. The results of monitoring biological and physical
fluctuations on this island are now being submitted to computer analysis
and parallel monitoring is underway at the Chesapeake Bay Center for
Environmental Studies.

An important step in multidisciplinary and multi-institutional research
on the Chesapeake Bay was achieved in December by the formation of the
Chesapeake Research Consortium, Inc. As a Consortium member, the
Smithsonian received a grant from the National Science Foundation’s
RANN (Research Applied to National Needs) Program for work at the

x1

Sy SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies. Scientists from the
University of Maryland, the Johns Hopkins University, and the United
States Geological Survey are using our facilities there in a highly integrated
fashion. The Rhode River estuary is particularly valuable in this bay-wide
study because it is one of the very few relatively unstressed areas less than
an hour from Washington and Baltimore.

This year also marks the inauguration of the Fort Pierce Bureau of the
Smithsonian, in Florida, where a broad research plan in marine science is
getting underway.

Finally , recognition should be given to the continuous and positive role
which the science bureaus of the Smithsonian have assumed throughout
the past year in matters of national and international concern.
Smithsonian scientists have provided representatives and advisory services
to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), to the U.S. delegation to
the International Whaling Commission, to the U.S. delegation to the
Stockholm Conference on the Environment, and to the federal agencies
interested in the environmental effects of sea-level canal construction in
Panama. Smithsonian scientists have also collaborated with foreign
governments on every continent on environmental projects for which they
needed technical assistance, and a joint Smithsonian Institution-Peace
Corps recruitment effort has also made scientific technicians available to
many developing countries.

Details of these and other science bureau accomplishments in fiscal year
1972 follow.

National Museum of Natural History

This was a year marked by encouraging progress in a number of areas,
progress made possible by substantial new fiscal support from the
Congress.

In addition to several new scientists, the Museum was able to employ a
considerable number of support personnel—clerks and typists, museum
aides, and technicians. As a consequence, an excellent start was made
toward the Museum’s long-sought goal of providing an average of two such
support people for each researcher. Results are evident in a greater number
of publications of the interpretive type, as well as greater involvement in
leadership activities that contribute to the advancement of the natural
sciences nationally and internationally. New multidisciplinary field studies
were initiated which, when added to ongoing projects and broad floristic
and faunistic survey programs, have provided significantly increased
opportunities for the staff to work in the field with living organisms in
their natural habitats.
SCIENCE 53

Major accomplishments also have been made in the application of elec-
tronic data-processing (EDP) and information retrieval to the management
of collections. It is becoming increasingly evident that the care of such data
is, in its own way, as important as care for the specimens themselves. The
objectives are to capture, store, and retrieve collection-based information
more efficiently than by conventional means and to produce ultimately a
versatile, easily searchable data base that will be more responsive to
scientific inquiry than are current records in most of the departments. Top
priority is given to projects designed to capture data from all incoming
collections. The capture of data on specimens already in the collections
occupies the second priority, and about 25 such projects are underway.
Application of computer technology to research projects of the staff of
the Museum, a third priority, began this year and will be expanded in the
future. In close cooperation with the Museum’s EDP program, a research
team consisting of USDA and Smithsonian entomologists is collecting and
collating all the available data on entomological systematics in machine-
readable form. The primary purpose of the project is to use the resulting
magnetic-taped data base to publish a current catalog and simultaneously
to provide the means by which it can be continuously updated. In
addition, such a data bank can be queried by agriculturists, entomologists,
and even by the public indirectly without demands on the time of our
Museum staff.

RESEARCH

Early man and animals of the New World were intimately related
ecologically in an environment characterized by climatological extremes.
While there have been many attempts to interpret one or another sector of
this vast area, a new, multidisciplinary program was initiated this year
aimed at a clearer understanding of man’s early history as a hunter of
Pleistocene fauna from Alaska to Patagonia. An archeologist specializing in
Paleoindian studies was employed and projects were inaugurated in the
Brooks Range of Alaska, Nebraska, the Texas Panhandle, east-central New
Mexico, eastern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and in four geographical zones
of Coastal Chile. It is anticipated that the program will involve-in addition
to anthropologists—geomorphologists, palynologists, and paleontologists.

The National Herbarium has long been recognized as one of the most
important centers for studies of neotropical plants. The truth of that
observation was again emphasized by the volume of monographic,
revisionary, and floristic research published or largely completed this year.
Now palynology in the Museum has been initiated by the employment of a
specialist whose first responsibility was to plan the new laboratory and
begin to obtain the necessary equipment.

54 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Lichens have long held a place of special interest to botanists because of
the algae-fungus symbiosis involved. The use of phytochemistry is well
established as a means of classifying lichens but the Scanning Electron
Microscope (SEM) has now opened the way for new understandings of

croceopustulata Kurok.) showing the thin polysaccharide epicortical layer and a pore

SCIENCE 5)5)

their microstructure. Working with members of a major family of foliose
lichens, the SEM has been used -to reveal for the first time the complexities
of the structure of the cortical layer, most importantly in three
dimensions. It is particularly interesting that pores below the resolution of
light microscopy were found. These function in much the same manner as
the stomates of flowering plants, except they do not open and close, to
permit gaseous exchange between the inner (algal) cells and the external
physical environment. Not only do these findings provide new charac-
teristics for systematic investigations but they may stimulate research on
ecological physiology of lichens.

Bees were also the subject of an economically important study that is
continuing. Those bees responsible for pollination of squashes, gourds, and
pumpkins are being introduced under carefully controlled experimental
conditions into areas where these plants are cultivated but where their
natural pollinators are absent. Releases of bees were made in Hawaii and
observations are underway to determine whether or not they become
established and, if so, whether the yields of these crop plants are increased
as anticipated. Positive results could be of major importance to some of
the developing nations where these crops are being introduced to improve
the local food supply.

Similarly, the study of burrowing sponges, which form large cavities in
coral heads and contribute to the destruction of coral reefs is of primary
importance. Through use of the Scanning Electron Microscope and
through stimulation of burrowing activity in pieces of Iceland Spar
(calcite), it was possible to study burrowing activity in hard substrates.
Continuing investigations are aimed at determining the mechanisms by
which sponges dissolve hard substrates. This and other studies will be
greatly facilitated by an electron microscope, obtained and installed in
cooperation with the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals, which is
housed in the Museum.

Under laboratory conditions, it was determined that an ostracod species
of Cypretta is an effective predator of Biomphalaria glabrata, a vector snail
of the blood fluke that causes the serious tropical disease schistosomiasis.
Such ostracods may prove to be useful in biological control of schistoso-
miasis in areas such as Vietnam and tropical Africa.

Lunar studies in recent years have often been directed to exploration of
the chemical and structural nature of moon rocks and dust. However,
investigations of lunar “‘geomorphology” have also stimulated re-
evaluations of some earth structures similar in appearance to those on the
moon. Staff members spent several weeks in South and Southwest Africa,
Lonar Lake in India, and Henbury and Gosse’s Bluff in Central Australia
examining enigmatic geological structures in each location for evidence of
meteorite impact. In addition, extensive investigations were carried out of

Squash bees have been introduced in Hawaii experimentally in an attempt to
establish populations of these natural pollinators of cultivated cucurbits.

the active volcanoes Arenal in Costa Rica, Soufriere on the Carribean
island of St. Vincent, and Fernandina in the Galapagos Islands.

In recent years, the interrelated subjects of sea-floor spreading, plate
tectonics, and continental drift have received attention primarily by the
petrologists in the Museum. Important paleobiological data can now also

58 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

be reported that complement and support the physical data. A pilot study
has been conducted of the evolutionary responses to the constant
movements of the earth’s crustal plates. This consisted of an investigation
of the history of biological relationships among mollusks across the
Temperate and Tropical Atlantic Ocean throughout the 200-million-year
history of its formation and subsequent opening to its present configura-
tion. Initial results clearly show increasing endemism of molluscan faunas
during the Mesozoic and Early Cenozoic on either side of the Atlantic as it
opened, as well as a close correlation of major evolutionary and
sedimentary events with periods of active plate movement. Periods of
active crustal movement appear to be correlated with continental flooding,
while draining of continents accompanied inactive periods of crustal
movement. Rates of molluscan evolution, documented by studying
numerous lineages within a framework of absolute geological time
constructed from radiometric dating, appear to be closely related to
tectonic-sedimentary events.

birds was completed, dealing primarily with kinesis of the upper jaw, as
well as the proportion and angular relationships of the skull. Skull
features not previously studied were compared, using X-rays, with the
conclusion that general adaptive patterns in these respects corresponded
well with accepted taxonomic groupings.

As is usually the case, studies of fishes of many groups using the full
panoply of taxonomic characteristics, was an important contribution to
the total research of the Museum. A paper on nearly 200 interspecific and
intergeneric hybrids of chubs concluded that such hybridization results
from temporal, spatial, or ethological isolation during the breeding season.
Also completed was a comprehensive summary and analysis of host
relationships in the sharksuckers that demonstrated host specificity in
some species, including one that attaches only to certain species of marine
mammals. In addition, the Ocean Acre project, an intensive study of the
ecology of the midwater fauna of a selected water column near Bermuda,
produced reports on the vertical distribution and ecology of the
lanternfishes and the bristlemouth fishes.

COLLECTIONS

Two ultimate truths concerning natural history collections were
repeatedly emphasized by events of the year: Samples of the natural
world, already viewed as indispensable documentation of the components
of the global ecosystem, are increasingly seen as a national resource in the
study of environmental and pollution problems, as well as for more
conventional uses. However, there is no single, more serious, all-pervading
| SCIENCE 59
problem for the National Museum of Natural History than the production
of a long-range solution to the problem of adequate space for the National
Collections.

Conservation of collections, always important, was advanced in this
year by several activities. A major collection of Samurai Arms and Armor
for the first time was cleaned and stored in proper cases and on special
racks. An expert Japanese sword polisher from Tokyo spent six months in
the Anthropology Processing Laboratory examining, evaluating, and

_conserving the 180 Japanese Samurai swords in the collection. It was

historically important Samurai swords from anthropological collections to preserve
the finish and to expose temper lines.
60 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

discovered that some were extremely significant pieces and certification
papers will be issued by the Japanese authorities.

Growth in holdings of vertebrate animal specimens, as well as the care
of those already in hand, continued to pose space-use problems, as well as
research opportunities. Whale, porpoise, and other marine mammal
materials, presently in warehouse storage, were prepared for return to the
Museum where they will occupy an entire exhibit hall made available for
this purpose because of great national interest in these animals. This marks
the initiation of a research/curatorial program on marine mammals in
collaboration with the International Biological Program studies of marine
productivity, involving the Departments of Vertebrate Zoology and
Paleobiology, which house the fossil marine materials.

In addition to collections management, EDP applications have other
very real values. For example, associated data on mammals and their
ectoparasites in the system will permit the generation of a variety of
summaries, correlations, and analyses of great potential value in
epidemiological and ecological programs underway in many institutions. A
quite different objective motivates the capture of data about and from the
gem and mineral collections. In this instance, not only are the needs of
research projects served, but an accurate inventory of these precious
materials permits much improved security to be maintained.

During the fiscal year a National Synthetic Crystals Collection has been
initiated which promises to be a significant adjunct to the present
collections. In the first six months of its establishment almost a thousand
specimens had been received, many of rare or unique materials.

EXHIBITS

There has been a succession of outstanding temporary exhibits in the
foyer area. An exhibit of the tools and implements of everyday life in a
Korean village, another on life in Greenland, one on the history of U.S.
Fisheries, and another on Japanese Swords and Armor are examples of
these short-term highly popular presentations.

Perhaps the single effort most appreciated by the public was the Insect
Zoo which opened for its second summer season in June, thanks to fiscal
support from Alfred Elser, the Smithsonian Associates Ladies’ Committee,
and the Entomological Society of America. New features this year were an
ant farm, butterfly flight cage, and television monitor closeups of a
procession of insects too small to be seen easily without magnification.
Although funds were available for much of the apparatus, a great deal of
the time required for answering questions and giving brief explanations
was contributed by a large number of young volunteers recruited and
trained by the Museum staff.

National Air and Space Museum

Fiscal year 1972 marked the first year that the National Air and Space
Museum operated under the leadership of its new Director, Michael Collins.
Major emphasis has been placed on detailed preparation for a new museum
to be opened in the Bicentennial year. The architectural firm of Hellmuth,
Obata, & Kassabaum, Inc., designed the new National Air and Space
Museum Building. The building design has been approved by the Fine Arts
Commission and the National Capital Planning Commission.

Two major exhibits were opened during the year. The first, Ballooning,
combined a variety of audiovisual techniques new to the Air and Space
Museum. The exhibit contains such things as an automated puppet show,
which describes the first balloon crossing of the English Channel; a hot air
balloon that rises to the ceiling and returns to the floor when the air cools;
continuous playing of balloon music; and hundreds of artifacts ranging
from the first air mail letter to furniture designed with a balloon motif.

The second exhibit, World War I Fighters, carries the audiovisual
techniques to even greater dimensions. In this exhibit not only is there
extensive use of sound, but in addition, a live mechanic works on the
restoration of a Nieuport Fighter. This exhibit area has proved to be very
popular for it allows the visitor to ask questions and receive immediate and
accurate information about the aircraft of the World War I era.

A planetarium chamber on the Mall is fast becoming a reality. A
30-foot domed chamber, which will be housed in the Air and Space
Building, is under construction. The dome is in place, the equipment is on
62 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

order, and a planetarium program is being prepared for opening in late
December 1972. This planetarium will serve two purposes. First, it will be
an entertainment and educational center. Not only will shows be given to
the general public on a regularly scheduled basis, but in addition,
educational programs ‘will be developed for classes at primary and
secondary educational levels. Schools in the Washington area will have the
opportunity to send full classes to the planetarium for astronomy lectures
and shows. Secondly, the planetarium will serve as a laboratory for the
experimentation and design of programs and equipment which will be used
in the Spacearium to be built in the new NASM Building.

Not only is the Museum adding to the collections, approximately
120,000 pounds of material was added during the fiscal year, but, more
significantly, a program was initiated to purge items which have little or no
historical significance. Pursuant to this program, over 35,000 pounds of
material were removed from the NASM collections.

Restoration work continued during the year on the Douglas World
Cruiser, the Nieuport Type 83E-2, and the Curtiss XFC9-2. It is planned to
exhibit these aircraft in the new NASM Building.

Miss Catherine Scott was assigned as branch librarian by the Smith-
sonian Library and has begun the task of reorganizing the NASM library.
Interlibrary loan cooperation procedures have been established with other
libraries in the Washington, D.C., area. Work has begun on weeding out
insignificant and duplicate material. Circulation records are being re-
organized and an appraisal is being made of the catalog file in line with the

Union catalog holdings in the main library. All of this is being:

accomplished to bring the NASM library up to the standards of the other
Institution libraries.

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

Publication of Astronomy and Astrophysics in the 1970's (Astronomy
Survey Committee of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Research Council, April 1972) gave an independently formulated standard
against which to measure progress and plans of the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). A comprehensive assessment, begun this
year, of the implications for SAO of the Committee recommendations will
be completed during fiscal year 1973. Meanwhile, however, the concord-
ance between these recommendations and SAO activities is so striking in
most areas that this situation is already reflected in the Observatory’s
report for this year.

The Survey Committee defines, in order of importance, four national
programs of highest priority. The first concerns radio astronomy; it
SCIENCE 63

recommends construction of a very large array (VLA) radio-telescope
facility and increased support of smaller radio programs. While SAO
scientists have no intimate role in present plans for the VLA, they would
surely be among the users of such a facility.

The second part of the recommendation is another recognition of the
same compelling scientific facts that led SAO to initiate a joint
radio-astronomy program with Harvard University some years ago and
diligently to build that program in the intervening years. During the past
year, joint research by a Smithsonian-Harvard team continued on several
excited states of methyl alcohol, and, for the first time, interstellar
acetaldehyde was detected. Parallel laboratory studies gave precise rest
frequencies for the formamide molecule, recently detected by this group
in the interstellar medium, and further spectroscopic data on isotopic
hydroxyl molecules. Measurements were made of the far-infrared spectra
and chemical properties of an unidentified oxygen-hydrogen radical
produced in the reaction of oxygen atoms with unsaturated hydrocarbons.

The most recent addition to this program—very long-baseline inter-
ferometry (VLBI)—is specified in the recommendations as one of the areas
deserving increased support. Four VLBI experiments were undertaken
between July 1971 and June 1972 in cooperation with Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Naval Research Laboratory, and California
Institute of Technology. All the experiments involved observations of
galactic spectral line sources, including the 273/2, J=3/2 and 2171/2, J=5/2
transition of OH and the 6; ¢> 53 transition of H50.

As its second highest priority, the Committee recommends an optical
program that will greatly increase the efficiency of existing telescopes by
means of modern electronic auxiliaries and at the same time design and
construct the new large telescopes necessary for research to the limits of
the known universe.

SAO has, for some time, been pushing the development of modern
electronic auxiliaries for use primarily on its 60-inch telescope, but also on
other telescopes such as those at Boyden Observatory in South Africa and
the new Wise Observatory in Israel. Examples of such instrumentation
employed by SAO scientists include the PEPSIOS spectrometer, the
Fourier-transform spectrometer, and a Kron electronographic image tube.
With such instrumentation, the SAO 60-inch telescope on Mt. Hopkins has
in fact been making observations that earlier could have been done only on
a much larger telescope.

For example, high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of planetary
absorption lines have been made with a three-etalon Fabry-Perot inter-
ferometer at Mt. Hopkins. The investigators detected, for the first time,
the presence of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars and also
established the existence of a layered cloud structure in the atmosphere of
64 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Venus. They made some measurements of interstellar absorption lines that
gave the rotational temperature of interstellar CN molecules, which may
show remaining effects of a “big bang” origin of our present universe.

The Smithsonian participated in several ways in the founding of the
new Florence and George C. Wise Observatory in Israel. This observatory
was dedicated on 26 October, 1971. The Institution provided exchange
currency for acquisition and operation of some peripheral equipment, and
an SAO scientist is coordinating joint research activities of American and
Israeli astronomers. The major instrument at the new observatory on the
Negev High Plateau is a 40-inch reflector-type telescope.

The Multiple-Mirror Telescope (MMT) project of SAO and the
University of Arizona is a principal element in the activity that the
Committee envisions as leading to new large telescopes. Design of the
MMT progressed as scheduled during the year, and SAO gave a contract to
an industtial firm for fabrication of the mount. Mt. Hopkins was chosen as
the MMT site. Measurement of light pollution and radio noise established
that the sky there is significantly better for astronomical observations than
is the sky over Mt. Lemmon north of Tucson, the other site considered.

The third recommendation of the Survey Committee asks for a
significant increase in support of infrared astronomy, including construc-
tion of a large ground-based infrared telescope, a high-altitude balloon
survey, and design studies for a very large stratospheric telescope.

Some few years ago, SAO placed particular emphasis on strengthening
its infrared astronomy program. Activities have included the fabrication of
refined infrared detectors, adaptation of the Boyden 60-inch telescope for
infrared observations, and initiation of a project to put on the peak of Mt.
Hopkins a 48-inch telescope for infrared observations. Of course, SAO’s
greatest activity in this area is the MMT, which will be the world’s largest
telescope optimized for infrared.

Furthermore, a joint project is underway among SAO, Harvard College
Observatory, and the University of Arizona to design and build a 40-inch
telescope for infrared observations from a balloon gondola. The first
flights of the telescope will take place during calendar 1972. This infrared
balloon project is a substantial first step toward the large stratospheric
telescope recommended in the Committee report.

A program for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy from a series of large
orbiting High-Energy Astrophysical Observatories (HEAO), supported by
construction of ground-based optical and infrared telescopes, is the fourth
Survey Committee recommendation.

SAO scientists are not involved in the development of the HEAO now
authorized, but they have had experience with satellite-borne gamma-ray
astronomy. SAO also has been very active during the last few years in
balloon flights for gamma-ray astronomy. Early this year, two successful
SCIENCE 65

balloon flights of SAO’s 10-Mev gas-Cerenkov detector were made from
Parana, Argentina. Both gave indications that the suspected 10-Mev
gamma-ray source at the galactic center was indeed there. Another
gamma-ray source, Sgr y-1, reported at higher energies, also yielded an
excess flux of gamma rays, although at a lower level of confidence.

The first observations of extremely high-energy gamma rays from the
pulsar in the Crab Nebula have been made by SAO scientists using two
different techniques. In the first, pulsed gamma rays were detected by
means of paired searchlight reflectors at Mt. Hopkins. These observations
confirm an earlier SAO experiment when a suspected pulsed flux of
gamma rays was detected. A second set of results was based on
observations with the 10-meter optical reflector, also at Mt. Hopkins.
Scientists detected a continuous flux from the Crab Nebula; the flux
varied slowly with time, the largest emissions occurring 60 to 120 days
after a major frequency change of the pulsar.

The Survey Committee identifies several additional programs of
“highest scientific importance,” but agrees that funding of them, although
urgent, should not be allowed to delay the funding of the first four
recommendations. SAO is engaged in activities relating to these additional
programs.

The Committee proposed construction of a large millimeter-wavelength
antenna to study quasars and complex interstellar molecules. SAO has
already initiated a program in millimeter-wave astronomy. One phase of it
is a joint project with Harvard College Observatory, the University of
Texas, and Bell Laboratories that has fielded in Texas an extraordinarily
precise telescope equipped with recently developed millimeter-wave
detectors.

Continuation of the program of Orbiting Solar Observatories (OSO) is
urged by the Committee. SAO scientists will participate in the currently
authorized OSO-I of the University of Colorado and OSO-J of Harvard
College Observatory. Meanwhile, from data taken by OSO 4 and 6, SAO
scientists have produced a new model of the solar chromosphere and made
basic contributions to understanding of the high-temperature structure of
solar flares, active regions, and prominences.

Another recommendation is a sizable increase in support of theoretical
investigations, including numerical computations. SAO is a recognized
world leader in the use of computers to generate theoretical models of
stellar atmospheres. This year, it cosponsored with NASA an international
symposium on such models. Also, Observatory scientists continue to
improve and refine PANDORA, the largest and most powerful computer
program yet designed for model stellar atmospheres and radiative line
transfer. Already the program is being used by a number of research
groups outside the Smithsonian.

66 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

The Committee proposes an expanded program of ultraviolet
astronomy from space, culminating in the launch of a large space telescope
by the end of this decade.

SAO’s Project Celescope to record stars in the ultraviolet was, of
course, one of the two experiments onboard NASA’s Orbiting Astro-
nomical Observatory (OAO 2). This year, as a major achievement of that
project, SAO issued the first catalog of stars as they appear in the
ultraviolet. It is based on more than 6000 television pictures taken by
Celescope. The initial version in the form of magnetic tape has been
deposited in the National Space Sciences Data Center at NASA’s Goddard
Space Flight Center. An extended tape and printed version based on all
Celescope data is now being prepared.

The catalog lists the magnitudes of the stars observed in Celescope’s
four ultraviolet bands, as well as the standard deviations of the
magnitudes, and the positions and identifications of the stars. It also gives
the magnitudes, colors, and spectral types of these same stars as observed
by ground-based telescopes. The data will be of particular value to
theoreticians constructing models of hot rapidly evolving stars, which seem
to emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.

The large, steerable radio telescope recommended by the Committee is,
in most respects, identical to the radio instrument described in the design
study funded by NSF. This study, in which SAO participated, is the most
detailed plan in existence for such an instrument.

As a contribution to the Committee’s final recommendation that
improved astrometric measurements be undertaken, the Observatory
coordinated a 14-month Earth-Physics Satellite Observation Campaign
(EPSOC) to measure the Chandler Wobble, a major component in the
geophysical phenomenon known as “polar motion.” Meanwhile, the
earth-physics group at SAO is generating a new Standard Earth, the third
the Observatory has produced as a major result of its satellite-tracking
program.

The Observatory, of course, pursues other important research outside
the scope of the Astronomical Survey Committee. This year, three groups
of scientists continued to analyze lunar samples; a new and definitive guide
to cometary orbits was issued at SAO; analysis of the orbit of the asteroid
Pallas led to the concept that the asteroid belt is a cosmic museum of
unused building blocks for Mars and Earth, of uncompleted planets, and of
senile comets; first returns from a retroreflector on the moon were
obtained by the SAO laser at Agassiz Station; precise geodetic measure-
ments across the great African rift valley in Ethiopia surprisingly suggested
longitudinal extension rather than widening of the rift; and a program of
environmental monitoring was initiated at Mt. Hopkins.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Fiscal year 1972 was a period of quiet consolidation and transition for
STRI. Programs planned or begun earlier were pursued with encouraging
success. Preparations were made for anticipated developments in the
future.

As always, considerable emphasis was placed on basic research. The
scientific staff was enlarged by several recruits and supplemented by new
pre- and postdoctoral fellows and research associates. This has made it
possible to investigate the ecology and/or behavior of a really substantial
variety of organisms. The “in house” research of the bureau (work
receiving direct financial support) included studies of primates, bats,
edentates, passerine birds, cuckoos, lizards, sea-snakes, frogs, both fresh-
water and marine fishes, spiders, several kinds of insects (Hymenoptera,
Orthoptera, Lepidoptera), squid, shrimp, corals, gorgonians, zooanthids,
echinoids, crinoids, other less conspicuous marine invertebrates, orchids,

. forest trees, and marine algae.

Most of this work was done in the neotropics, in and around the
Isthmus of Panama, the northern part of South America, and the West

_ Indies; but new comparative studies were also launched in the Old World

(including such countries as Liberia, Gabon, and Kenya where the bureau

_ has not been active before).

The gradual increase of personnel has permitted extension of research
to whole communities, as well as to individual groups and areas. Special
attention is being paid to the measurement and prediction of fluctuations
in humid tropical forest (part of the general Smithsonian Environmental
Sciences Program) and in coral reef and inshore marine habitats (with
support from both the Environmental Sciences Program and the Environ-
mental Protection Agency). Preliminary work on tropical grassland biomes
has begun. Further studies will be developed in collaboration with experts
of the Institute of Ecology of the Polish National Academy of Sciences.

The following examples illustrate the sorts of problems that have been

_ judged to be accessible and relevant, and the level of refinement attained

in STRI’s research.

Research on corals has been a major focus of effort. J. Lang of the
staff, who is working in Jamaica, has for the first time measured
interspecific aggressive behavior and the establishment of dominance

' hierarchies in competition for space (and presumably ultimately food)

among major species of scleractinian hermatypes in the Caribbean. She is
also studying such subjects as deep reef communities, intraspecific
polymorphism and speciation in reef corals, the effects of depth upon
skeletogenesis, and budding forms of asexual reproduction in

- scleractinians.
68 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

J. Porter, one of the predoctoral fellows, has been experimenting with
coral feeding and zooplankton energy flow over the reefs of the San Blas
Islands, and has completed surveys of coral diversity and biomass
abundance as well as the physical oceanography and sedimentation regimes
of several reef sites.

P. Glynn of the staff, with his colleagues, has documented the
occurrence of true structural reefs on eastern Pacific shores—another first
record. Evidence from C'* dating and the growth of the principal
frame-building corals indicates that these reefs are among the fastest-
growing known. They are increasing at the rate of M/250 yrs, despite
attrition by predators of about one-third of the annual production.

Analysis of reefs and environments around the Pearl Islands reveals that
the low temperature conditions accompanying seasonal upwelling are
deleterious to corals along the exposed western coasts. Thermal stress
slows or impedes growth by rendering the corals more susceptible to
invasions by other benthic organisms.

Sections of coral heads cut along the growth axis and viewed under UV
light show chlorophyll rings which appear to represent annual growth
increments. An attempt is being made to determine the relationship
between size of rings and intensity of upwelling. Hopefully, this should
provide information on past marine climatic fluctuations.

C. Birkeland and D. Meyer, research associates, obtained transect data
on the depth distribution of reef corals at the isolated island of Malpelo
off the northwestern coast of South America. They found that hermatypic
corals were a dominant benthic element as far down as 37 meters below
the surface of the waters.

Further work on the Caribbean shore of Panama has disclosed drowned
reefs on the shelf off Nombre de Dios, an actively accreting algal ridge
structure on the Holandés reef, and an emergent fossil coral assemblage,
possibly of Sangamon age, on the same reef.

STRI’s participation in the Environmental Sciences Program, primarily
concerned with problems of unpredictability and instability (which may be
larger in the tropics than has usually been supposed), has both terrestrial
and marine components. The monitoring of biological and physical
fluctuations in the forest on Barro Colorado, which was begun last year, is
proceeding at full speed. The data are now being submitted to computer
analysis. The parallel studies of inshore organisms and habitats started
later, and only became fully operational in the first half of fiscal year
1972, with the installation of continuously recording instruments on the
reef flat adjacent to the marine laboratory at Galeta. The parameters being
measured include salinity, water temperature, water depth, exposure, 05
concentration, light penetration, rainfall, air temperature, wind speed,
wind direction, and the growth rates, reproductive cycles, abundance,

mortality, and productivity of selected species of animals that seem to be
particularly dominant or important to the system. It has already become
clear that periods of stress in the intertidal area are totally unpredictable
on the basis of conventional tide tables and information derived from
offshore waters.

In addition to the “in house” research, STRI has continued to provide
facilities for, and help to, visiting scientists and students from universities
and other institutions all over the world. The number of visitors and their
use of the bureau’s laboratories, equipment and reserves in fiscal year 1972
remained at much the same level as in the two preceding years, especially
noteworthy in view of the general and widely publicized reduction of
effective research funds in so many of the countries from which visitors
come. The demand for bureau help to outsiders in this sphere would
appear to have reached temporary equilibrium. The rate of demand may
be less than would be desirable, but it is still appreciable. It is bound to go
up in the future, although the timing remains uncertain.

The most promising new educational activity was a cooperative
program with the University of Panama. The students and staff of the
university are now using the STRI research vessel Tethys on a regular basis
for studies along the Pacific coast and adjacent islands.

The various changes, additions, and improvements in fiscal year 1972
were not spectacular in themselves, but they should all contribute to the

ultimate goal of developing a multicultural international institute with

disciplines.
SCIENCE 71

Radiation Biology Laboratory
REGULATORY BIOLOGY

Light signals in the environment regulate the growth and development
of plants. These light signals are absorbed by pigments which in turn
change the metabolism and life functions of cells. One of the pigments
known to be involved in this process is phytochrome, a plant pigment
which strongly absorbs red or far red light. Phytochrome, a water soluble
protein with a molecular weight of more than 50,000, has been isolated
for several years in the Radiation Biology Laboratory and its properties
studied extensively at the molecular level. Recently, evidence has
accumulated that sulfhydryl reagents which were present in the extraction
solutions may have altered its properties. This year a method has been
developed for isolating and purifying phytochrome without sulfhydryl
reagents. This phytochrome is more stable in the presence of proteolytic
enzymes and at low pH. It has an isoelectric pH of 7.5 to 8 and we believe
_ has properties which approximate more closely the properties of “native”
phytochrome in vivo than previously isolated phytochrome.

In addition, two significant findings have been made in the study of the
mechanism of phytochrome-mediated growth responses of oat and wheat
coleoptile cells to red light: (1) The light-induced effects are independent
of growth responses to exogenous auxins or gibberellins, as though there
are two separate growth mechanisms in the cell. (2) The light-induced
effects appear to be related to microtubule formation, since they can be
specifically prevented by substances such as colchicine, urea, and cupric
ions, which are known to interfere with aggregation of microtubule
subunits.

The control of the molecular processes required for the synthesis of
chloroplast proteins is not understood. Regulation may be under either
cytoplasmic, nuclear, or chloroplast control or some complex interaction
between all three. Attempts to map precisely this control system have
continued using the alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardii, in which the
synthesis of proteins of chloroplast ribosomes and their properties have
been measured.

Two lines of evidence suggest that most of the proteins of chloroplast
ribosomes (70S) are made in the cytoplasm on 80S ribosomes. Chloram-
phenicol, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, fails to inhibit the synthesis of
the protein component of chloroplast ribosomes. In addition, when cells
are labeled for short times (15 seconds) with radioactive amino acids, a
product-precursor relationship can be demonstrated between radioactivity
in newly formed “nascent” protein on 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes and
radioactivity in protein of 70S chloroplast ribosomes. From independent
tests it has been discovered that chloramphenicol specifically inhibits
q2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

protein synthesis on chloroplast 70S ribosomes of C. reinhardii. Am-
monium ions also control the synthesis of ribosomes in wild type C.
reinhardii, but not in the arginine requiring mutant, arg-1.

ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

A program for the study of phosphorus cycling has been initiated in the
Rhode River-Muddy Creek system at the Chesapeake Bay Center for
Environmental Studies. Baseline data of 18 parameters such as tempera-
ture, pH, salinity, and inorganic and organic phosphorus levels were
accumulated for 13 stations. In addition, experiments on phosphate
cycling and energy flow were initiated in phytoplankton, periphyton and
salt marsh communities.

National Zoological Park

Without question, the most important event at the National Zoo during
the fiscal year 1972 was the arrival of two giant pandas for the people of
the United States from the people of the People’s Republic of China. This
generous gift was formally accepted by Mrs. Richard Nixon on 20 April.
The pandas, female named Ling-Ling and male named Hsing-Hsing, have
nearly doubled the Zoo’s attendance.

Twin orangutans (a rare event) were born in December and a male
gorilla in May. As a result of captive breeding at the Zoo, Kanitia, the
older of the two female bongos, gave birth to a female calf. The hatching
of four brush turkeys, Alectura lathami, was a significant event. The male
brush turkey began scratching a mound together in the spring of 1971 and
worked the entire summer on the peat moss, shredded bark and grass
clippings which were supplied to him. The female was allowed near the
nest only on the occasion of egg-laying. The rare Rothschild’s mynahs
continued to be prolific, producing 18 young during the year, bringing the
total offspring from a single pair to 29 during an 18-month period.

Other important births have been scimitar-horned oryx, sable antelope,
Burmese brow-antlered deer, pygmy hippopotamus, and a greater kudu.
The scientific program has a notable achievement in the second generation
breeding of the tenrecoid insectivore, Microgale talazaci. For the second
time, the rare and endangered species of caviomorph rodent, Plagiodontia
aedum, was bred.

The golden eagles and bald eagles were given enclosures of their own
and almost immediately nesting attempts were made. The female golden
eagle laid ten eggs which proved to be infertile.

Bill and Lucy, the pair of the northern race of square-lipped
thinoceroses, were shipped to San Diego’s Wild Animal Park in San
Pasqual. The pair had been at the Zoo for 16 years without reproduction.

An extremely popular new exhibit is the jungle scene in the Reptile
House. The cage is decorated with a variety of living plants, tree trunks,
and vines. Six adult iguanas, four basilisk lizards and ten giant toads were
placed in the cage and breeding and territorial behavior is displayed.
| Another exhibit that is attracting interest is in the grouping of wildebeest,
Cape buffalo, and zebra in one large corral.

In February the Zoo co-sponsored a conference of Brazilian and
American specialists concerned with saving the golden marmoset from
possible extinction. Construction was begun on a Golden Marmoset
Breeding and Research Facility as an official gesture of concern for this
vanishing primate. During the year the Zoo’s golden marmosets produced
three sets of twins.

Office of Environmental Sciences

The increasing general awareness of the importance of environmental
problems has caused an increase in the activities of this office during fiscal
year 1972. Federal and private agencies and organizations have requested
assistance in studying and solving national and international environmental
problems and have provided financial support. The Office has assisted
other Smithsonian organizations in utilizing their expertise and collections
to greater advantage in the environmental field.

The staff is quite active on national and international committees and
organizations involved in environmental and ecological impact studies,
biological monitoring, plant and animal protection, study and preservation
of natural areas, review of environmental and ecological research programs,
biological control, marine and limnological research, and related areas.

Studies are being made in various parts of the world on the
environmental and ecological impacts of technology in developing
countries for the Agency for International Development. These include
study of impacts by the Volta Reservoir in Ghana, a game park in Kenya,
rapid urban growth in Seoul, Korea, offshore oil pollution in Indonesia,
and other studies.

ECOLOGY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Center for Natural Areas is making detailed surveys of
the Atlantic Coastal Plain and particularly the Chesapeake Bay region for
the Department of Interior and Nature Conservancy. Surveys are being
made of all protected natural and wilderness areas and ecologically
important areas which should be procured and protected. Ecological
advisory service is being furnished to requesting federal agencies, and a
registry and computerization has been started for all United States natural
areas.

A global biological monitoring program was prepared for the Inter-
national Union of Biological Sciences, Commission on Monitoring.
Detailed studies were made of the importance of museum specimens for
studying the history of levels of toxic metals.
SCIENCE Th

A study was made of wildlife, including endangered species, and their
habitats, as indicators and indices of the status of environmental quality
for the Council on Environmental Quality. Trends in populations, acreage
of habitats and other factors were used in developing environmental
indices and a proposed national biological monitoring program.

Remote sensing of vegetation and hydrology of the Rhode River
watershed was studied with emphasis on identification of deciduous
forests and salt marsh plants using different films and altitudes under a
NASA contract. A symposium was held on uses of remote sensing in
developing countries for AID.

The Peace Corps Environmental Program has resulted in over 650
applications and 220 volunteers with Masters and Doctors degrees in the
biological and environmental fields, and 85 scientists have been sent to 24
requesting countries to carry out research programs.

OCEANOGRAPHY AND LIMNOLOGY PROGRAM

The Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center processed over 3.5
million marine organisms in fiscal year 1972, and sent about 10 percent to
scientists for taxonomic, distribution, and population studies. The Center
assisted various national and international programs on environmental
analysis, particularly the National Science Foundation’s U.S. Antarctic
Research Program (USARP), and the Marine Resource Monitoring and
Assessment Program (MARMAP) of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
The Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center in Tunisia contributed to the
UNESCO-FAO sponsored Cooperative Investigations of the Mediterranean,
and made available 2.5 million marine organisms to scientists who depend
on research services of taxonomic sorting, community analysis, specimen
and sample data management, and field logistics. During the past 10 years,
over 40 million specimens have been processed by the Smithsonian’s two
centers which provide international leadership in this field. In cooperation
with UNESCO, an international conference of directors of the eight
sorting centers of the world was held in Tunisia to meet rapidly increasing
demands in environmental biology research.

Studies of Skadar Lake, the largest of the Balkan Lakes, were initiated
in cooperation with the Institute for Biological Research at Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. The objectives of this 5-year project are to describe the
physical, chemical, biological, and geological nature of this lake, to
develop a capability for management of the lake and its drainage basin as
the regional impact of man increases. A report was prepared on the
“Existing Conditions of the Biota of the Chesapeake Bay” for the Corps of
Engineers to be used in developing a broad-based program on environ-
mental management.
78 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

CHESAPEAKE BAY CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES

The Center initiated an interdisciplinary ecosystem study of the Rhode
River and watershed under a grant from the National Science Foundation.
The project is a microcosm study of a relatively undisturbed subestuary of
Chesapeake Bay. Results will be compared with research projects on more
heavily stressed areas of the bay being studied by the Chesapeake Research
Consortium which includes the Johns Hopkins University, University of
Maryland, Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and the Smithsonian
Institution. The Rhode River study includes investigators from the above
listed institutions, Catholic University, the U.S. Geological Survey, and
NASA.

Other continuing research projects at the Center include ground-truth
evaluation of remote sensing and other aerial photographic techniques;
historical land-use patterns and their environmental impact; solid-waste
disposal and erosion control; and basic studies in ecology. New studies
include an evaluation of spray irrigation as a waste disposal technique;
investigations into environmental decision-making by local units of
government; an examination of the role of citizen participation in land-use
planning; and research on the attitudes of urban and suburban youths
towards their respective physical and social environments.

Educational activities include regular tours and lectures for elementary
and secondary schools, colleges, and adult groups on the ecosystem
research program of the Center. Facilities of the Center were expanded
with the addition of 155 acres of land and completion of laboratories in
the Old Dominion Building. A dormitory building for students is planned
for construction by the end of the year.

CENTER FOR SHORT-LIVED PHENOMENA

The Center’s reporting network includes over 2700 scientists, scientific
institutions, and field stations located in 143 countries on every continent
and ocean of the world.

The Center continues to communicate data and information of
significant changes to biological and ecological systems, including rare or
unusual animal migrations, population explosions, and major mortalities of
flora and fauna, as well as volcanic eruptions, the birth of new islands,
major fireball events and meteorite falls, and environmental pollution
events such as major oil spills, and pesticide and herbicide contaminations.

During fiscal year 1972, the Center reported 99 short-lived events that
occurred in 50 countries. Scientific teams investigated at least 80 of the
events. Forty-six earth science events were described, as well as 40
biological and 11 astrophysical events. The Center also reported unusual
geological events, including fumarole activity in the Galapagos Islands, an
SCIENCE 719

avalanche in Peru, seismic activity in Colombia, a landslip in Canada,
fracturing in Ethiopia, a severe hailstorm in Milan, Italy, and floods in
Brazil and West Malaysia.

The Center has worked on international programs concerned with
global environmental monitoring including a world-wide survey for
UNESCO on “National and International Environmental Monitoring
Activities” and a paper on “The Establishment of an International
Environmental Monitoring Program” invited by the Secretary-General of
the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.

Center for the Study of Man

The Center brought together over fifty scholars from five continents to
meet in Cairo, Egypt, and complete plans for focusing anthropological
knowledge on problems of worldwide concern. The conference, held 8-12
May 1972, under joint auspices with the American University in Cairo and
the University of Alexandria, agreed that one or more books on major
world problems should be prepared as quickly as possible by individuals or
teams of authors selected from all over the world.

Topics with which the books would deal include: (1) education in the
modernizing world; (2) social integration in the new nations; (3) social
dislocation of people accompanying urbanization, industrialization and
population growth; (4) physical and mental health and social well-being in
a variety of different cultures.

The Center will coordinate the interaction between anthropologists and
teams of authors, in most cases behavioral scientists, who are chosen to
prepare the books. The effect of this program will be to elicit data in the
heads and notebooks of anthropologists which could then be put to use by
the best of social scientists in seeking solutions to problems besetting the
world.

During the past fiscal year ten final reports were received from
recipients of Urgent Anthropology Small Grants. One of these reports was
an analysis by Keith H. Basso and Ned Anderson of a unique, original
American Indian writing system. Data on this Western Apache writing
system was obtained from its 89-year-old creator, Silas John Edwards.
Forthcoming publication of the results of this work will constitute a very
significant contribution to the field of American Indian language writing.

Work on the Handbook of North American Indians over the past year
has resulted in the receipt of over one-hundred manuscripts at the editor’s
office. More arrive each day and the editorial process is now underway.
Our schedule calls for final publication of all 18 volumes by 1976.
Another activity of the Center’s American Indian Program has resulted in
the publication of a list of 217 current periodicals by, for, and about
American Indians.

80 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Smithsonian Science Information Exchange

This fiscal year marked completion of the Smithsonian Science
Information Exchange’s (SSIE) first year as a nonprofit corporation. It
also marked the completion of the Smithsonian Institution’s first full year
of responsibilities for both policy and management responsibilities for the
Exchange.

Of primary importance during the year was the increasing demand for
user services which was reflected by an increase in user income of some 75
percent over the 1971 level. Much of this increase was attributable to an
increase in the preparation of catalogs of ongoing research in many new
areas of interest such as dental and health services research. Regular annual
catalogs continue in such areas as outdoor recreation, water resources, and
population research. The demand for services of the Exchange continues
to be dominated by federal users, although industrial and foreign use is
increasing. Brochures describing SSIE services have now been‘prepared in
French and Japanese and requests from these two areas are increasing.
Negotiations are underway to secure the services of a Spanish-speaking
representative.

Among the new and innovative services offered by SSIE, the use of
pre-run questions which can be made available at reasonable cost and
maximum distribution has been the most well received. This service has
been greatly expanded through the development of an SSIE Newsletter
published ten times a year and sold on a subscription basis. The Newsletter
has been instrumental in making SSIE better known throughout the
scientific community. In addition, several volumes of ongoing research
have been prepared for publication by a nationally known publishing firm
with the intention of making information in the SSIE data bank more
readily available to users throughout the country.

Fort Pierce Bureau

The generous support of Edwin A. Link and J. Seward Johnson has
enabled the Smithsonian to establish, on 16 October 1971, the Fort Pierce
Bureau as an operating unit on the landward shore of the inland waterway,
about 5 miles north of Fort Pierce, Florida. Directed by I. Eugene Wallen,
who formerly headed the Smithsonian Office of Environmental Sciences,
the new Bureau has a mission of marine biological and geological research,
using the Johnson-Sea-Link and other submersibles as well as the
oceanographic research vessels Johnson and Sea Diver.

During the year a fine new laboratory building was constructed at the
site by the Harbor Branch Foundation for use in research in association
with the Smithsonian. Five Smithsonian scientists are stationed at the
SCIENCE 81

laboratory studying (1) marine ecology, (2) the biology of organisms
under pressure, (3) the biology of sipunculid worms, (4) contaminant gases
in enclosed spaces such as the submersible, (5) the recycling of nutrients
through sewage and oysters, and (6) the biology of alligators and green
turtles.

Principally an engineering activity in support of biologists, the Bureau
also has about 35 employees in machine shops and carpenter shops,
remodeling oceangoing vessels and developing research support equipment
for use from the submersible. Such items as manipulators, communications
systems, special diving equipment, special lighting, submersible collecting
equipment, photographic facilities are being conceptualized, designed, and
produced for use in research in marine biology.

Seagoing operations of the ship-submersible system will support
Smithsonian scientific activities and extend the ability of the Smithsonian
to cope with environmental problems, such as marine pollution and beach
erosion.

HISLORY AND ART

During the month of April 1972, nearly a million visitors—978,728, to
be exact—came to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of History and
Technology. This single month’s attendance far exceeds the annual
attendance of many respectable and important museums, including several
of our own. The visitors were drawn not by any special, dazzling
temporary exhibition in the museum, but rather by what are somewhat
inaccurately called its “permanent” exhibits—the halls and galleries that
draw upon the museum’s great collections, and upon the knowledge and
skills of its curatorial and exhibits staffs to illuminate our nation’s history
and the history of technology.

Numbers of visitors are, of course, only one way to measure a
museum’s achievement. While no other museum in the Smithsonian, and
we believe, in the world, can match the Museum of History and
Technology on this score, it is satisfying to note that during the year under
review the attendance at each of our history and art museums increased. In
the case of the National Collection of Fine Arts the increase was due in
large part to the opening in January of its new branch, the Renwick
Gallery, which is now settling into its magnificently restored building on
Pennsylvania Avenue. In the case of the National Portrait Gallery,
unusually large numbers of visitors were drawn especially by two
handsomely installed special exhibitions, one on the history of the
performing arts in America, and one on unsuccessful candidates for the
presidency. For its part, the Freer Gallery of Art benefited from the
growing public interest in China that followed Mr. Kissinger’s and the
President’s trips.

Pleased as we are by this evidence of popularity, we do not intend to
lose sight of the other responsibilities that are so deeply rooted in the
traditions of the Smithsonian, and that indeed insure that the experience
of our growing number of visitors will be enlightening as well as delightful.
We shall continue to stress the importance of collecting, of conserving, of
studying, and of publishing the results of our studies. Catalogs published
by the National Portrait Gallery in conjunction with its major shows are
important works of historiography; exhibitions in the National Collection
of Fine Arts have quite literally rescued significant artists from oblivion;
the nineteenth-century post office in the Museum of History and
Technology is meticulously accurate in every detail—these are simply
outstanding examples of the way in which the increase of knowledge can,
and in our view must, go hand in hand with its diffusion to the public. The
role of the Archives of American Art, not only in providing a great resource

82

HISTORY AND ART 83

and restored to full postal service in the National Museum of History and
Technology.

for research, but also in supplying fascinating material for use in exhibitions
of the National Collection of Fine Arts, is another example, as is the role of
the Joseph Henry Papers and the Smithsonian Archives, in keeping always
before us the example of our predecessors and the evidence of their
determination, under differing circumstances, to maintain a due balance
between the scholarly and the public functions of the Institution.

The Bicentennial of the American Revolution offers us challenges on
both frorts. We must, as the American Revolution Bicentennial Commis-
sion suggests, take this event as the occasion for deepening our understand-
ing of the entire history of our nation. On the other hand, we must also
prepare ourselves for the descent upon Washington and our museums of an
awe-inspiring number of visitors in the years around 1976. We are
confident that the Smithsonian’s response will be worthy of a great
institution and a great occasion.

Finally, it would be unthinkable to conclude even these brief
observations without grateful mention of the continuing generosity of
Joseph H. Hirshhorn, which will make the opening of the Hirshhorn
84 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Museum and Sculpture Garden even more brilliant than we had expected,
and the munificence of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which have provided a fitting home for
the Cooper Hewitt Museum. As always in such cases, our pleasure in these
great gifts is enormously increased because they are evidence of the
donors’ confidence in us.

The National Museum of History and Technology

Remarkable progress was made during the past year in the National
Museum of History and Technology. Five major exhibition halls and a |
special exhibits gallery in the central segment of the Museum’s third floor |
were being reconstructed into the Halls of Communication. A newly
designed Hall of Money and Medals and a Hall of Printing and Graphic
Arts were completed by the end of the fiscal year and opened to the
public shortly thereafter, and the remaining three halls are well in progress.
One of these depicts the history of news media, the installation of which
has been made possible by the support of Time-Life, Inc. It will open in
the spring of 1973, in time to commemorate the firm’s 50th anniversary,
as the Henry R. Luce Hall of News Reporting.

The Museum was fortunate in enlisting the interest of outside industries
and trade organizations in contributing to the Museum’s programs to fulfill
its mission in new dimensions. Sears, Roebuck and Co. donated to the Mu-
seum an important collection of 3200 cast iron and tinplate toys and pro-
vided funds for installing a special exhibit on the second floor entitled, “A
Children’s World,” and developing a series of satellite exhibits which are be-
ing presented by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.

To mark its 75th year in book publishing, Doubleday & Company, Inc.
has agreed to sponsor a series of Frank Nelson Doubleday Lectures on the
general subject of “‘Frontiers of Knowledge,” which will be held during the
next fiscal year. The Gulbenkian Foundation has provided a grant for a
period of three years to enable the Museum to undertake a program of
studies in the history of Portuguese navigation with major scholars in the
field. The Museum has developed plans for a new and greatly expanded
Hall of Maritime Enterprise with the cooperation of the Department of
Commerce. The construction and installation of this hall will be made
possible by the participation of the related maritime industries.

The Museum’s first floor was enhanced by the addition of The Smithso-
nian Bookstore, which opened on 17 June. It was installed and is operated
by McGraw-Hill Book Company in cooperation with the Institution. Ac-
cording to Publishers Weekly the bookstore contains “the world’s largest
collection of retail books on American civilization . . . arranged topically
HISTORY AND ART 85

as opposed to the traditional categories of fiction, nonfiction and poetry
.... Not only is this the largest collection of books of Americana on sale,
it is also the largest museum bookstore in the world... .’’ Because the
Bookstore spotlights a variety of specimens from the Museum’s collections,
it is literally ‘ta bookstore in a museum and a museum in a bookstore.”
Featured is a reproduction of the facade of Shakespeare & Co., which
Sylvia Beach operated during the early decades of the century in Paris and
which formed a center for American writers abroad.

The Museum was particularly fortunate also in acquiring a number of
significant items, ranging in size from an elegant little document box used
for keeping legal papers during the enforcement of the Stamp Act in 1765
to a full size nineteenth-century country store post office. The post office

has been officially designated the Smithsonian Station of the U.S. Postal |
Service and is operated daily during public hours by clerks of the Postal |

Service. This new facility has added a new dimension to the Museum’s
exposition of history and has proven to be a total success.

A considerable amount of the scholarly resources of the Museum have
been used for the Bicentennial exhibitions, particularly the “‘Nation of
Nations,” in addition to the planning for a new major Hall of Political
History, and for developing long-range plans for research centers which
will enlist the support of institutions outside the Museum towards a fuller
understanding of American civilization.

DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED ARTS

Plans were initiated and installation work was well advanced on the
reconstruction of exhibition halls for Monetary History and Medallic Art,
Graphic Arts, News Reporting, Photographic History, and Philately and
Postal History. These major exhibits, which will emphasize the theme of
communications in history, will restore the gallery areas that were
damaged by the fire on the third floor.

The opening of the nineteenth-century post office and general store on
27 September 1971 culminated a two-year research and exhibition project
undertaken jointly by the Division of Postal History and the U.S. Postal
Service. Mr. Charles Rowell, restoration specialist, dismantled the building
which had stood at Headsville, West Virginia, since about 1861 and
reassembled it at the Constitution Avenue entrance to the Museum. The
U.S. Postal Service assigned a staff of three clerks, in appropriate costume
of the period, to provide philatelic and regular mail services to museum
visitors.

The special exhibits program was significantly carried forward when
Mrs. Elvira Clajin-Stefanelli organized a special exhibit illustrating recent
developments of medallic art in the United States for the F.I.D.E.M.
Congress in Cologne, Germany, in September 1971. Dr. V. Clain-Stefanelli
was an initial organizer and the Chairman of the Exhibits Committee for
the 1971 National Convention of the American Numismatic Association
which was held in Washington. The special exhibit, “Mexican Stamps
Designed by America’s Lance Wyman,” held in the Museum, was
supplemented by special philatelic exhibits in New York City, Anaheim,
and San Francisco.

At the close of the special exhibit “Dorothy Liebes Retrospective Show
of Textiles,’ forty-three fabric examples were chosen for the permanent
collections of the Division of Textiles. Another outstanding collection
received was of ninety hand-embroidered and lace handkerchiefs of the
nineteenth century presented by Mr. Leon Orlowski.

HISTORY AND ART 87

DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL HISTORY

A special exhibition, ““A Children’s World,” was the result of an
extraordinary gift of more then 2800 cast iron and tin-plate toys from
Sears, Roebuck and Co., which also sponsored the exhibit. The 350th
anniversary of the Pilgrims’ first Thanksgiving occasioned a Mall entrance
holiday exhibit, which opened with a reception in honor of the Honorable
Dorothy F.W. Innes, The Lord Mayor Alderman of Plymouth, England.

Several other major acquisitions have enhanced the Department of
Cultural History’s collections. The rural general store as an American
institution was given recognition in the gift of The George C. Seyboldt
Collection of Marketing Artifacts, numbering several hundred objects. The
Robert Young Brown American Stoneware Pottery Collection came as a

significant supplement of 135 items to the Museum’s holding of American
ceramics. A joint acquisition of the Divisions of Ceramics and Glass and
Preindustrial Cultural History, this is an important element in a new
American Ceramics Study Center developed by both divisions. The gift by
Lemuel Pope of colonial and federal period furniture is important for its
HISTORY AND ART 89

history of continuous use by the Pope family of Iiassachusetts. A rare
violin by Jacobus Stainer, several eighteenth-century items of clothing, and
a large number of examples of late nineteenth-century Japanese porcelains
made for the California market are other significant acquisitions.

The Division of Musical Instruments again distinguished itself in a series
of evening concerts. In support of such concerts, the recently formed
Friends of Music at the Smithsonian collaborated with the division to
sponsor a musical weekend in April. Designed to communicate to musical
friends of the Smithsonian the visual and aural richness of the musical
instrument collections, this elegant occurrence included demonstrations,
tours, social events, and a concert of baroque music superbly performed.

Four projects currently supported by the Smithsonian Research
Foundation include the compilation of on-site information about
eighteenth-century Mexican organs, field research on the remarkable
material culture of Blacks in coastal South Carolina, investigations
concerning a German-American cabinetmaker of Wisconsin, and research

on American pottery.

DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIES

Fiscal year 1972 witnessed the publication of three books by staff
members of this Department. They included the elegant and exhaustive
study of Frederick Carder, founder of the Steuben Glass Works, by Paul V.
Gardner. John Schlebecker authored two valuable reference works for
agricultural historians and museologists which will be published by the
Smithsonian Institution Press.

Five full-size additions to the vehicle collection include a 1912 Knox
tractor, the predecessor of the modern day tractor trailer. The railroad

collection was enriched by the acquisition of the John Bull (1831)
locomotive’s original whistle which was obtained by private funds at the

Penn Central auction in Philadelphia. The Section of Mining acquired a |

Draeger portable breathing lung of 1904. This was the first style of mine
rescue breathing apparatus used in the United States.

Significant additions to the collections of the Division of Ceramics and
Glass are a Vienna porcelain candlestick (ca. 1730) and a Longton Hall
figure of ““Hercules and the Nemean Lion.”

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL AND MILITARY HISTORY

The most important addition to the arms collections in the past 50
years was a group of 181 firearms from the Estate of William Goodwin
Renwick of Tucson, Arizona. Mr. Renwick was one of the foremost
collectors of this era. A number of the pieces are masterpieces of design
and armament reflecting the skill of fine artisans. Included also are many
with historical associations from Maximilian I in the 15th century to
General J.E.B. Stuart, Confederate States Army, in 1863.

A full-rigged model of the Continental Gondola Philadelphia, finely
detailed to represent that surviving naval relic of the War for Independence
as originally commissioned on Lake Champlain in 1775, was completed by
Museum Specialist Howard P. Hoffman. The Division of Naval History also
secured a model of the Continental Frigate Confederacy (1778), con-
structed on British Admiralty plans. Another notable acquisition was a rare
white summer service uniform worn by Ordinary Seaman Charlton H. Wing,
USN, during the Civil War, donated by his grandson, Bradford L. Cleveland.

A very significant specimen received in the Division of Political History
is a unique tooled leather document box that was used to hold the
pre-stamped papers required for legal documents during the enforcement
of the Stamp Act in the American Colonies in 1765. Another valuable
addition is the chair President Abraham Lincoln used in the Cabinet room
at the White House during his administration. This chair was the gift of Mr.
Elwood Middleton.

A silver coffee service owned by Mary Todd Lincoln and some pieces of
china from a dessert service used in the White House was a bequest from
Lincoln Isham, great grandson of President and Mrs. Lincoln. The National
Collections received as a gift from Mr. August Belmont the inlaid lacquer
Japanese ladies’ desk brought back from Japan by his ancestor, Com-
modore Matthew Perry, when he returned from his expedition in 1854.

DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

A second section of the Hall of Electricity was opened, covering the
development of the science of electricity in the second half of the
HISTORY AND ART 91

nineteenth century. There is also a special reference area where the visitor
can leaf through collections of photographs and look at books related to
the subject. Special exhibits on the laser and on electrical appliances also
opened in this hall. Among the series of monthly exhibits, special mention
might be made of one featuring the work of the department’s technical
laboratory, giving the visitors an idea of the special talents necessary in a
museum.

Some major collections were obtained by the department, including
automatic control devices from Taylor Instrument Co., some unique early
plastic materials from the Celanese Plastics Co., experimental psy chology

equipment from Cornell University, a twelfth-century rare Persian drug jar |
from the E. R. Squibb Fund, a major coilection of instruments from the |
Maryland Medical and Chirugical Faculty, materials related to the work of !
John William Draper from his descendents, and the contents of the
Western Union Museum. Hundreds of individuals and companies |
responded to a plea publicized in the spring of 1972 asking for early |
electrical appliances. As a result a fine collection ranging from toasters and
egg beaters to stoves and washing machines has been added to the National
Collections. On display in the Hall of Nuclear Energy is a model of a
boiling-water reactor presented by Babcock & Wilcox and a demonstration
of the thermonuclear pinch effect from Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

Increasing emphasis has been placed in recent years on the collection of |
documentary material to complement our artifacts. Two collections
mentioned already—Draper and Western Union—contain some very
important archival material that will be of great use for research being
done at the museum. Two formal archival collecting programs have been
started, one by the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering in
cooperation with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the
American Society of Civil Engineers, the other by the Division of
Electricity in cooperation with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers. A continuing special project of Robert Vogel has been the
development of industrial archeology. A number of sites have been
inspected—some with the help of the National Park Service—and a society
has been founded to promote wider interest in the subject in the Western
Hemisphere.

Archives of American Art

The Archives of American Art enjoyed an unusually successful year in
its work of acquiring, organizing, and giving access to documentation on
the visual arts in America. More than a hundred collections of personal
papers and institutional records came to the Archives during the year,
either as gifts or as loans for microfilming. Among the more important of
these were the correspondence and photographs of the influential
Philadelphia painter and teacher Thomas Anshutz; papers of the New York
painter Philip Evergood; correspondence of the nineteenth-century painter
Lily Martin Spencer; sketchbooks of the contemporary painter Karl
Knaths; correspondence and unpublished manuscripts of the architectural
historian Sybil Moholy-Nagy; and records of the Alan Gallery in New
York, of the Allied Artists of America, of the Corcoran Gallery, and of the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Institute of Contemporary Arts,
both in Boston.
HISTORY AND ART 93

The year saw a marked increase in use of the Archives by researchers in
the various regional offices. The 790 letters of inquiry were answered and
research was conducted on the premises by more than 700 historians,
curators, graduate students, and other scholars. Both figures represent
twice the volume of research during the previous year.

Two books published in 1972 based entirely on material in the Archives
are Ben Shahn, by John Morse, and Terminal Iron Works: The Sculpture
of David Smith, by Rosalind Krauss. Of the many other publications
dependent on Archives resources a few are Francis V. O’Connor’s The New
Deal Art Projects: An Anthology of Memoirs, Barbara Rose’s Franken-
thaler, Nathalia Wright’s Letters of Horatio Greenough, Whitney Museum

of American Art’s Eastman Johnson, and William Truettner’s

_ “William T. Evans: Collector of American Paintings” in The American Art
_ Journal.

Two projects initiated in 1972 under grants from the New York
Foundation and the Andrew Wyeth Foundation were the organization and

indexing of the Archives photograph collection and the editing for
_ eventual publication of a richly detailed late nineteenth-century diary kept

by the New York painter Jervis McEntee. Other projects continued during

_the year were the microfilming of the Black Mountain College Art

| Department records and the Archives Oral History Program, which

resulted in 90 tape recorded interviews, of which 65 have been transcribed.

A major activity was the preparation of a Guide to Archives resources,
to be published in the fall by R.R. Bowker Company. This volume, to be
offered to college, museum, and public libraries throughout the country,

_ will list and describe 550 collections of papers available to scholars at the

Archives of American Art.

Freer Gallery of Art

The Freer Gallery of Art continued to carry on research, curatorial, and
exhibition activities as in the past. The third Director of the Gallery, John
A. Pope, retired on 13 August 1972, after 28 years of distinguished
service. He was succeeded by Harold P. Stern, and Thomas Lawton was
appointed Assistant Director. In his retirement Dr. Pope will continue to
work for the Gallery with the goal of producing a comprehensive catalog
of the Freer’s Japanese ceramic holdings.

During this year, there were several special exhibitions in the Gallery.
To commemorate the superb objects bequeathed by the late Eugene and
Agnes E. Meyer, a Memorial Exhibition was opened in September. Many
of the Chinese and Japanese objects included in the exhibition had not
been shown previously, and all are regarded as significant additions to the

_ collection. To complement the Inaugural Exhibition of Japan House in

New York in September, the Gallery opened a special exhibition of
Japanese paintings of the Rimpa School. During the Christmas season, a
special showing of biblical manuscripts was organized, and in February an
exhibition of Persian art was opened as part of the Gallery’s program of

_ honoring the 2500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire.

The Freer Gallery of Art partook of and assisted the current national

_ interest and awareness of the People’s Republic of China by holding public
_ showings of a film made by Peking television on “‘Recent Archaeological
_ Discoveries in the People’s Republic of China.”” Arrangements for this film
_ were made with the knowledge of that government and the Gallery is

grateful for the opportunity of being able to offer the film to the public.
At the same time, the Director of the National Palace Museum in Taipei,
Taiwan, visited the Freer, and it is the Gallery’s intent to have close ties

_ with all scholars interested in the areas encompassed by the collections.

The Visiting Committee, composed of eight distinguished members,

| held its first meeting on 13 October 1971. Deliberations of the Committee
have been of great assistance to the Gallery, and their initial report was
| submitted to the Secretary for transmittal to the Board of Regents; a

second meeting was held on 31 May 1972.
The Freer Gallery of Art will commence the celebration of the 50th
anniversary of its opening on 2 May 1973. During that year, the Gallery

_ plans to hold three special exhibitions: (1) Japanese Ukiyoe painting, (2)

Chinese figure painting, and (3) Islamic art of the Book; to present three
Freer medals; and to conduct those symposia related to the special
exhibitions. As part of the anniversary year, a 50th Anniversary Fund

| Raising Program has been initiated.

National Collection of Fine Arts

Doubtless the most impressive event of the year was the opening late
in January of the Renwick Gallery. The staff has worked for several years
on plans for restoring the building at 17th and Pennsylvania that served as
the first Corcoran Gallery of Art, which now, bearing the name of its
architect, has been opened as a curatorial branch of NCFA for the
presentation of American craft and design. The central stairway, the large
salon and the octagon room have been restored in the style of the period.

_ The rest of the museum has been converted into modern gallery space,

always respecting the original lines of the building. In addition to the
permanent displays in the period rooms, the gallery opened with seven
exhibitions, the major being ‘““Woodenworks,” an exhibition of the works
of five designers in wood, and “‘Design is....” One of the galleries has
been set aside primarily for exhibitions from abroad sponsored through
embassies. The Renwick has very quickly become a favorite meeting place,
The installation of the Bombay Chandelier was one of the many technical problem
faced in completing the Renwick Gallery for its January 1972 opening.

HISTORY AND ART 97

and a very active program of lectures, demonstrations, and other public
events has been inaugurated.

In the Fine Arts and Portrait Gallery Building, there were 6 large and
17 smaller exhibitions presented during the year, all but 4 produced by the
staff of the NCFA and all designed and mounted by the museum. Seven
were accompanied by substantial publications, the largest being a
monograph on W.H. Johnson, the first serious study of the man. Others
were Boris Anisfeldt, Lee Gatch, Drawings of William Glackens, Two
American Painters, The Prints of J. Alden Weir, and National Parks and the
American Landscape. The exhibition of works by Johnson, a black painter
active chiefly in the 1930s, required several months of intensified work by
the conservation laboratory before these largely forgotten works could be
returned to public attention. This exhibition, as well as “Two American
Painters: Fritz Scholder and T.C. Cannon,” is circulating abroad. Also as
part of its program of exhibitions abroad, the NCFA sponsored an
exhibition of contemporary works, prepared by Mr. Walter Hopps, for

- showing at the Venice Biennale and elsewhere.

Six new galleries were opened in the museum, chiefly for the
presentation of the permanent collection. These include two galleries
devoted to nineteenth-century American landscape. As a result of work in
preparation for the Washington subway, which will pass the museum on G
Street, a crack developed in the Lincoln Gallery which weakened the
cornice and made it necessary to evacuate the large collection of works of
art from this beautiful and historic space and place them in storage. When
the Lincoln Gallery is reopened, the entire gallery will be reorganized and
relit in the manner of the already completed twentieth-century section.

Recording of the collection on the computer reached the first stage of
completion, marking further progress in the restudy and total inventory of
works. During the year, 1590 new works were accessioned; among the
notable acquisitions were October (1867) by John W. Ehninger, Mary
Elizabeth Francis, the Artist’s Daughter (c. 1840) by John F. Francis, a

_ large painting by Esteban Vicente, two drawings by Edward Hopper, and

25 drawings by Alfred Maurer.

Two postdoctoral Fellows and four student Fellows spent the year at
the Collection, and an internship in museum education was provided a
student preparing for the degree of Master of Arts in Teaching. A new
intern program in museum training leading to a Master’s degree in the

_ History of Art with concentration in museum practice was instituted in

association with George Washington University, and plans were made for
year-long internships in museum training for advanced students to begin in
the autumn of 1972.

The Department of Education inaugurated a stimulating program,

_ Discover Graphics, which brought groups of high school students and their

teachers into active participation with a resident graphic artist in the new
Graphics Workshop established at the museum. Study was divided between
the workshop and the print-and-drawing study room. Associated in the
program was a group of young artists from Federal City College. The
active corps of docents, trained by the NCFA education staff, conducted
283 gallery sessions for schoolchildren, and 234 sessions for the general
public. This dedicated group has also taken charge of all exhibition
openings at the NCFA.

The Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service , administered
by NCFA, provided exhibitions on art, history, and science for 550
installations throughout the country to an estimated audience of four
million. To aid in the mounting and packing of exhibitions, NCFA’s newly
established carpenter shop was turned over entirely to the SITES
operation.

This has been an expanding year for the Bicentennial Inventory of
American Paintings before 1914 since the well-laid plans of last year have
been providing astonishing results from around the country. The staff has
been increased to record the many works reported. Plans have been made

also for a series of exhibitions in all areas of the museum to commemorate
the Bicentennial of the American Revolution.

National Portrait Gallery

Two major exhibitions on widely differing themes were mounted by
the Gallery during the course of the year. The first of these, which opened
in the fall, was entitled “Portraits of the American Stage 1771-1971.”
Organized by Monroe Fabian, associate curator of the Gallery, who also
wrote the accompanying catalog, the exhibition contained nearly 100
likenesses of significant theatrical personalities, as well as a large number
of associated objects. The Gallery’s spring exhibition, “ ‘If Elected...’
Unsuccessful Candidates for Presidency 1796-1968” was conceived by
Beverly Cox, assistant historian of the NPG, and organized by her in
collaboration with Harold Francis Pfister, curatorial assistant at the
Gallery. It was accompanied by a 512-page catalog written by the
Gallery’s historian, Lillian B. Miller, and other members of her staff, as
well as a 48-page student-oriented synopsis of the catalog, which is being
distributed nationally in an edition of 60,000 copies by Education
Ventures, Inc., of Middletown, Connecticut, together with teaching guides
and color-slide sets. Portraits of 80 losing candidates for the presidency,
including major third party contenders, were included in the exhibition,
which also contained more than 500 political campaign items of all kinds,
many drawn from the great Ralph E. Becker Collection in The Museum of
History and Technology. Installed in a fashion suggesting the panoply of
political campaigning by James J. Shelton, chief, and Michael Carrigan,
assistant chief, of Exhibits Design, the portraits and associative objects
were accompanied by a 45-minute continuously playing tape of campaign
songs and speeches, as well as a film showing such candidates as Norman
Thomas, Al Smith, and Wendell Willkie. ‘““‘A Glimmer of Their Own
Beauty; Black Sounds of the Twenties,’ an exhibition organized by the
Gallery’s Education Department was held during the summer months. A
two-part exhibition of Black history in the District of Columbia.
“Washington from Banneker to Douglass, 1791-1870” and “‘Washington in
the New Era, 1870-1970” was held in the fall and spring of the year,
respectively.

Ninety-nine portraits were acquired during the course of the year.
Important purchases included a striking oil of General William Clark (of
the Lewis and Clark Expedition) by famed Indian painter George Catlin; a
William Jewett portrait of John C. Fremont, the western explorer known
as the “Pathfinder,” who was also the first Republican candidate for the
presidency; a likeness of the aged Andrew Jackson painted in 1840 by
Trevor Fowler; the group portrait of Zachary Taylor and his military aides
100 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

painted in Mexico in 1848 at the behest of a Richmond, Virginia,
newspaper editor, who believed (correctly as it turned out) that Taylor

would be the next president; a small oil of Confederate General Joseph E. ©

Johnston by Benjamin F. Reinhardt; a rare and moving portrait of
Charlotte Cushman by William Page; a magnificent likeness of the Black

actor Ira Aldridge by Henry Perronet Briggs, purchased from the Player’s |

Club in London; and a pastel of the great dancer Ruth St. Denis by Max
Wieczorek.

Among the important portraits which came to the Gallery by gift were
a self-portrait of Alexander Calder, presented by the artist; a self-portrait
of William Glackens, the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Ira Glackens; a marble bust
of Josiah Quincy by Horatio Greenough, given by Edmund Quincy; an
exceptional folk art sculpture of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, presented
by Richard Guggenheim; an Eastman Johnson portrait of President Grover
Cleveland, given by the subject’s son Francis; and a Norman Rockwell
portrait of President Nixon, funds for which were provided by the Nixon
Foundation.

Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

During fiscal year 1972 construction continued on the Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden. The scheduled completion date is May
1973:

In addition to preparing the Museum’s collections for the move to
Washington, building the professional staff and projecting future Museum
activities, plans for the inaugural exhibition were advanced, and the
selection of paintings and sculpture to be displayed was completed. The
selected works, currently being researched and prepared, will be installed
to greatest advantage in the Museum’s galleries and garden. Mr. Douglas
MacAgy, formerly director of national exhibitions, National Endowment
for the Arts, was named curator for the opening exhibition.

The catalog of the inaugural exhibition is being prepared for publica-
tion. One thousand paintings and sculpture will be documented and
reproduced—more than two hundred in color—in this volume, which will
serve as an introduction to the scope and variety of the Museum’s
collections.

An event of outstanding importance in fiscal year 1972 was the formal
commitment of 326 outstanding paintings and sculpture by Mr. Hirshhorn
to the Museum. This gift, valued at more than seven million dollars, adds a
group of significant works of art to the collections and goes far beyond the
agreement entered upon by the donor and the Smithsonian Institution.

The Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum held its first meeting
on 25 September 1971 at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

f

Presidentially appointed members of the Board are: Dr. Daniel P.
Moynihan, Chairman, Dr. George Heard Hamilton, Vice-Chairman, Mr. H.
Harvard Arnason, Mr. Leigh B. Block, Mr. Theodore E. Cummings, Miss
Elizabeth Houghton, Mr. Taft B. Schreiber, and Mr. Hal B. Wallis.

During this period of organization and acceleration of overall activities,
the Museum has continued its policy ofproviding replies to public requests
for research information as well as of lending outstanding works of art to
national and international exhibitions. More than 295 requests for research
information and photographs were answered. Eighty-three paintings and
sculpture were loaned to 50 museums, galleries, and institutions. More
than 115 scholars, artists, and officials visited the Hirshhorn Museum
office and warehouse in New York. Approximately 2300 people attended
33 tours of the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden, Greenwich, Connecticut, for
the benefit of educational, cultural, and philanthrophic organizations.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design

The plan for establishing a national museum of design is close to
becoming a reality. The Carnegie Corporation has given the Andrew
Carnegie property (consisting of the mansion, an adjoining townhouse and
gardens) to the Smithsonian as a new home for the Museum. A gift of
$500,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a comparable
amount in smaller donations will make it possible to proceed with the
renovation. The firm of Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer Associates has been
commissioned to do the architectural work.

With an exciting future ahead, the Museum has been able to attract
many gifts. The collection was enriched by 3036 works of art from 78
donors. The most significant gifts were: a collection of over 200 examples
of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century French wallpapers, a
collection of 187 marionettes, two eighteenth-century chinoiserie terra
cotta figures, a seventeenth-century Spanish bird cage, an early seventeenth-
century altar frontal, two Louis XV lacquer commodes, a large sample of
eighteenth-century Chinese wallpaper, eleven stage designs by Stewart
Chaney, and a glass and metal chandelier from a room designed in 1929 by
the firm of Alavoine. Objects cataloged numbered 1362.

A designer’s Pictorial Reference Library containing over 300,000 items
has been promised to the Museum; the first installment of 12 vertical file
drawers has been received. The library has been expanded to include a
Color Archive containing publications, manuscripts, swatches, standards,
instruments, and other materials related to the study of color. Eight
hundred volumes were added to the library, including 46 scrapbooks, 173
rare architectural books, and 310 rare textile books ranging from the
sixteenth to nineteenth centuries.

|

HISTORY AND ART 103

The Museum’s long-term loan program has been extended throughout
the renovation period. An additional 568 objects were included in
exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum, National Collection of Fine Arts,
Museum of American Folk Art, Birmingham Museum, Brooklyn Museum,
Corcoran Gallery, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Philadelphia Museum,
Dayton Art Institute, Parrish Art Museum, John and Mable Ringling
Museum, Colorado State University, Mary Washington College, Plattsburgh
State College, Hofstra, and the University of Michigan.

Five exhibitions made up entirely of objects from the collection were
shown elsewhere: “Salute to the Cooper-Hewitt” at the Winter Antiques
Show in New York; Albrecht Durer prints at the Detroit Institute of Art;
“New York As It Was and Might Have Been” at the Century Club;
ceramics from the James Hazen Hyde Collection of the “Four Continents”
at the opening of the Smithsonian’s new Renwick Gallery in Washington;
and a benefit exhibition of Winslow Homer paintings, drawings, and prints
at the Wildenstein Gallery for which the Smithsonian Institution Press
published a catalog.

The Museum was given a grant by the National Endowment for the Arts
to install a permanent outdoor display featuring changing film programs
on urban design. The Carnegie facilities were made available to numerous
outside organizations for educational purposes. Members of the com-
munity were offered a program of 24 events, including curatorial lectures,
children’s workshops, tours, and social activities. The study collections
were used by over 200 scholars from this country and abroad. Ten student
interns and fifty-seven volunteers received training at the Museum.

The staff was honored in a variety of ways. Catherine Lynn
Frangiamore was awarded a fellowship to pursue independent research
next year; Regina Solinger and Eliane Zuesse were given stipends to
participate in a summer workship at Cooperstown; Elaine Dee and
Christian Rohlfing received travel grants to attend international
conferences; and Milton Sonday published an article in the December issue
of the Textile Museum Journal.

Four new members were added to the Advisory Board: The Honorable
Robert Weaver, former Secretary of HUD and now professor of urban
affairs at Hunter College; Mr. Cass Canfield, Jr., the publisher; Mr. Sydney
Gruson, Vice President of the New York Times Company; and Mr. Thomas
E. Murray II, a Member of the New York Stock Exchange.

Planning for the future has been in progress over the past year. A major
grant from the New York State Council on the Arts has enabled the
Museum to conduct studies and conferences leading to a redefinition and
expansion of its role. As the need for a museum of design process becomes
more evident, the staff looks forward to the Museum’s reopening with
great anticipation.
104 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972
National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board

During fiscal year 1972 the major endeavor of the National Armed
Forces Museum Advisory Board, assisted by its staff, was toward the
establishment of Bicentennial Outdoor Museum. To that end, and also to
designate the study center authorized under Section 2(a) of Public Law
87-186 as the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research, S.
2153 and H.R. 10311—identical bills—were introduced into the 92nd
Congress.

The proposed legislation was approved by the National Capital Planning
Commission, the Department of the Army (on behalf of the Department
of Defense), and the Department of the Interior. At the request of the
National Park Service the proposed legislation was changed to designate
the prospective facility Bicentennial Outdoor Museum, rather than
Bicentennial Park. The Department of the Interior further recommended
the outright transfer of Fort Foote Park and Jones Point Park to the
administrative custody of the Smithsonian Institution upon appropriation
of funds for the museum’s development, rather than joint use by the two
agencies.

The proposed legislation received the strong support of the Adminis-
tration. President Nixon, in a special Bicentennial message to the Congress
on 4 February 1972, endorsed Bicentennial Outdoor Museum as an
“important undertaking to give the bicentennial activities metropolitan
scope,” and asked “prompt Congressional action to approve the Bi-
centennial Outdoor Museum and to authorize appropriations for planning
it.” At the same time the Office of Management and Budget, Executive
Office of the President, included funds for planning the museum in the
Administration’s budget for fiscal year 1973.

Joseph Henry Papers

Volume one of The Papers of Joseph Henry, documenting his early
years in Albany, New York, is scheduled for formal release on 26
December 1972 at ceremonies to be held in the Great Hall of the
Smithsonian Building. Accompanying the ceremonies will be an exhibit
displaying a selection of Henry manuscripts, items from his personal
library, as well as research materials and techniques used in various stages
of the editorial process. A number of items to appear in future volumes
will also be exhibited.

Work is presently underway on volume two, which documents Henry’s
first years at Princeton University as Professor of Natural Philosophy
(from the end of 1832 through 1835). While family connections and old
scientific friends still tied Henry to Albany, his arrival at Princeton marks a

- HISTORY AND ART 105

new stage in his career. Building up the facilities for scientific teaching and
research at Princeton, Henry enters the national and international
scientific scene. An extensive run of laboratory notes shows the
intensification of his pioneering work in electromagnetism begun in
Albany. Aside from documenting other aspects of Henry’s widening
scientific interests, correspondence and personal journals illuminate the
developing environment for science not only at Princeton but at national
centers like Philadelphia and New York.

The Nineteenth-Century Seminar continued its successful run under the
direction of Nathan Reingold, who also organized a series of three
Saturday Conferences in spring 1972 on the history of science and its
social and cultural context.

Office of American Studies

The Office of American Studies conducts a formal graduate program in
material culture of the United States which is directed to the original
Smithsonian purpose: “the increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
Graduate students from area universities participated in the program,
gaining academic credit toward advanced degrees at those universities. All
entering graduate students take the seminar in “Material Aspects of
American Civilization,’ which was taught by Dr. Harold K. Skramstad,
Chief of Special Projects, National Museum of History and Technology,
and which dealt this year with the theme of ethnicity. Dr. Cary Carson,
Coordinator of Research of the St. Mary’s City Commission and Adjunct
Scholar of the Smithsonian Institution, again gave his seminar in
“Historical Uses of Vernacular Architecture” during the spring semester.
Dr. Paul Kleppner, Visiting Postdoctoral Research Associate attached to
the American Studies Program, gave a year-long seminar on American
voting behavior in the nineteenth century. A Work-Study Program in
Historical Archaeology, offered by the St. Mary’s City Commission in
cooperation with the American Studies Program of the Smithsonian,
George Washington University, and St. Mary’s College of Maryland, was
held from 19 June to 25 August 1972, with participation by graduate
students and Smithsonian staff members. In addition to these formal
seminars, supervision of individual reading and research projects, thesis
direction, and preparation of comprehensive examinations were under-
taken by the director and cooperating Smithsonian staff members.

Office of Academic Studies

The Office of Academic Studies, under the direction of the Board of
Academic Studies, administers Institution programs in higher education,
106 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

including fellowship and administrative support for pre- and postdoctoral
Fellows engaged in independent research, for graduate and undergraduate
students in directed research and study assignments, for short-term visitors
studying in the Smithsonian’s collections, and for departmental seminars.

For academic year 1972-1973, 26 predoctoral and 30 postdoctoral
fellowships were awarded. Three of these postdoctoral fellowships were
supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities
for research in American Indian studies. For several years the Smithsonian
has cooperated with universities in jointly funding fellowships for graduate
students pursuing course work partly at their home universities and partly
at the Institution. This year two such fellowships were awarded in
American Civilization at Georgetown University. In addition one doctoral
candidate in the History of Science and Technology is being jointly
supported with the University of Maryland. With the continued develop-
ment of the conservation training program of the Cooperstown Graduate
Programs, the Smithsonian anticipates extensive cooperation in offering
laboratory experience to Cooperstown graduate students.

Appointments for directed research and study were awarded to 80
graduate and undergraduate students during the year, of which 22 were
supported under grants from the National Science Foundation. Many of
these students have received academic credit from their home institutions
for studies conducted at the Smithsonian.

Two departmental seminars were supported. The number of short-term
visitors to the Institution increased during this year, 26 individuals
receiving partial or full support.

Smithsonian Institution Archives

During 1972, the Smithsonian Archives assumed its responsibilities for
archival resources throughout the Institution. The Preliminary Guide to
the Smithsonian Archives, which appeared in September in conjunction
with the Smithsonian’s 125th anniversary served as an example of how
Smithsonian archives should be made known and available for research.
The Archivist discussed archival needs with members of numerous bureaus
and set priorities.

The Archives’ first priority is care of archives in the National Museum
of Natural History, which contains a wealth of resources for research in
the history of science. Working with curators, the Archives’ goal is to
publish a full guide to archival and manuscript resources of the National
Museum of Natural History. The Archives receives and cares for inactive
records, and processes on location those records open to scholars which
remain in the Museum for use with the National Collections.
HISTORY AND ART 107

An archives committee was formed in the National Museum of Natural
History and the National Museum of History and Technology. Archives
staff continued to develop computerized finding aids with the Smithsonian
Information Systems Division. In summer 1972 the Archives supervised
two deaf students from Gallaudet College in study of archival administra-
tion.

Other projects during 1972 included a survey of administrative office
records; supervision of arrangement and microfilming of the Registrar’s
accession records; appraisal of records at the Astrophysical Observatory;
processing 125 cubic feet of National Zoological Park records; and
submission of the Smithsonian’s first report to the National Union Catalog
of Manuscript Collections.

Office of Seminars

Improved public understanding of the international and research bases
of modern science was the aim of two major efforts of the Office of
Seminars in 1972. One was the establishment of an advisory committee to
serve the Secretary in his capacity as chairman of the December 1972
meetings in Washington of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. The other was working out arrangements for co-sponsorship,
by the Smithsonian and the National Academy of Sciences of an
international symposium, “The Nature of Scientific Discovery.” The
symposium is scheduled for 25-27 April 1973 in commemoration of the
500th anniversary of the birth of Copernicus. A joint program-planning
committee under the chairmanship of Professor John Wheeler, the
Princeton physicist, was appointed to consider recommendations of a
larger Smithsonian consultative panel. United States observance of the
Copernican Quinquecentennial was being coordinated with UNESCO, and
financed by contributions sought from foundations and corporations.
Professor Owen Gingerich of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
and Harvard University was named editor of the symposium volume—one
of several multimedia educational materials to be produced by the
symposium. (The 1969 symposium volume, Man and Beast: Comparative
Social Behavior, continued to prompt book reviews and sales to colleges.)

“The Educational Uses of Museums” was the theme of lectures given by
the Director of Seminars in five Asian countries in October-November
1971 under auspices of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of
the Department of State. He spoke to museum officials and professional
societies in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and
Indonesia, returning via the University of the South Pacific in Fiji and the
East-West Center, Honolulu. Films, from the Smithsonian’s Festival of Folk
Life on the Mall and the Anacostia Museum illustrated the lectures.
108 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

The Office of Seminars was responsible for organizing and coordinating
the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Smithsonian 26 September
1971. The occasion is described in a booklet featuring the anniversary
address by Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, “Museum Objects, Truth, and
Education,” to be published by the Smithsonian Institution Press. The
introduction was prepared by Wilton S. Dillon, who served as general
chairman.

An eight month seminar series, “Man’s Internal Environment,” sup-
ported by a grant from Dr. William D. Davidson, M.D., President, Institute
for Psychiatry and Foreign Affairs, explored research in the medical and
behavioral sciences relevant to understanding human capacities to control
problems of population, pollution, and violence.

Throughout the year distinguished scholars addressed the Smithsonian
staff and the general public. Governor Rolf Edberg, Swedish statesman and
author (On the Shred of a Cloud and At the Root of a Tree) spoke on
“Man and His Shrinking World,” the text of which appeared in the
Congressional Record. Dr. Avraham Biran, director of antiquities in Israel,
described recent archeological excavations in the Near East, and Dr. Caleb
Olaniyan, Nigerian biologist, spoke on the ecology of brackish water in
West Africa.

The Office also served as a resource for helping to plan or participate in
seminars, conferences, and symposia in other institutions. The director
opened a faculty seminar series at the University of Alabama with an
address on “Man and His Institutions.’ He spoke on “Anthropological
Perspectives on Violence” before the American College of Psychiatrists,
the Psychiatric Society of Washington, and the Department of Psychiatry,
Harvard Medical School. As president of the Anthropological Society of
Washington, he presided over a series of programs on “Ethnicity and
Ethnic Categories” held at American University and Catholic University.
The Office has been used also by the Department of State for discussions
with university officials about the future of area studies in the United
States and to cooperate with the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
in planning the 1972 Oxford Pugwash conference on science and world
affairs.

In 1972 the directer became president of the board of directors,
Institute of Intercultural Studies, American Museum of Natural History,
New York; secretary, boara of trustees, Phelps-Stokes Fund of New York;
and adjunct professor, University of Alabama.
SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS

The Smithsonian has maintained its continuing concern for achieving
the objectives envisioned by all museums. Through funding of the National
Museum Act programs, for the first time in fiscal year 1972, the
Smithsonian was able to provide increased technical aid and assistance to
museums throughout the United States and abroad. The Advisory Council
on National Museum Act programs developed guidelines and procedures
for applying for and receiving grants of funds to advance the museum
profession through research, publication, and training. Sixteen such grants
were awarded in fiscal year 1972.

Through United States membership in the International Centre for the
Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (Rome Centre), which
was authorized by the Congress, strides are being made on an international
basis to develop new techniques for the conservation of monuments and
works of art and for the training of conservators and preservations.

The Smithsonian also continued to support the common objectives of
the American Association of Museums and of the United States National
Committee of the International Council of Museums.

The Office of Exhibits Programs contributed substantially to the
educational aspects of all our exhibitions through imaginative techniques
in presenting information. An excellent example in fiscal year 1972 dealt
with the highly controversial subject of drug use and misuse; the exhibit
was titled “Drugs: A Special Exhibition,” and has evoked much interest
and many questions.

The Conservation-Analytical Laboratory continued to develop various
techniques for conserving and analyzing historic objects, advising
numerous inquirers on methods to assist them in identifying problems
concerned with artifact preservation.

The Smithsonian Institution Libraries, in addition to their normal serv-
ices, again served a clinical function in formal library education, cooperat-
ing in a predoctoral fellowship, a course on research methodology, and joint
cooperation in library studies with library schools of nearby universities.

The Office of the Registrar reported on the continuing public awareness
as evidenced by the multitude of inquiries received on a variety of
subjects.

The distribution of United States publications through the International
Exchange Service served to exchange information with organizations in
more than 100 countries. Exchange bureaus similar to the Smithsonian
International Exchange Service directed more than 100,000 publications
for distribution in the United States.

109
110 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Through these and other related activities, the Smithsonian is providing
needed services that have become increasingly appreciated by the museum
profession.

Office of Smithsonian and National Museum Programs

During the fiscal year, the Office of Museum Programs changed its
name to reflect a broad program of assistance, research, and information in
museum problems and in operations cf museums throughout the United
States and abroad. As an innovative program, all projects developed by
this Office endeavor to upgrade and advance professional practices.

The National Museum Act, authorized in 1966 received its first
appropriation of $600,000 in fiscal year 1972. In accordance with the
appropriation legislation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the
National Endowment for the Humanities each received $100,000 from the
above sum. Through the National Museum Act the Smithsonian Institution
is able to provide technical aid and assistance to museums throughout the
United States and abroad. Funds may be granted for specific proposals
that will advance the museum profession either through research,
publication, or training. An Advisory Council met for the first time on 10
November 1971 to recommend guidelines and procedures for granting
these funds. Science, history, and art museums, as well as museum-related
organizations, are eligible to apply for grants.

Sixteen applications were funded including, for example, support for
the six regional Museum Conferences, the development of a curriculum in
museum studies, three in-service seminars in museum administration, a
consultation service for small history museums, five in-service seminars on
history museums and historic house operations, internships in conservation
techniques, a publication: The /nterpretation of Historic House Museums,
an international exchange program for museum professionals, an ap-
prentice program for museum technicians and a publication: Guide to
Historic Preservation Historical Agencies, and Museum Practices: A
Selective Bibliography.

The office continues to receive innumerable requests from museums for
technical assistance. Such questions as (1) how to raise funds, (2) how to
create an exhibition program, (3) how to organize an education program,
(4) how to train museum personnel, and (5) how to care for collections are
most frequently asked.

Continuing a tradition of exchange of ideas, this office has supported
directly a number of other important programs, such as, (1) a Conserva-
tion Information Project which will produce approximately 100 video- and
audiotapes on conservation techniques, practices, and problems; (2)
a Systematic Biology Conference for the Development of a National
SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS 111

Program on Resources and Resource Management; (3) a special three day
symposium on psychological and sociological studies of the museum
environment and the publication of the proceedings of this meeting; and
(4) the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee, which studies the
interphase and cooperation between various museum computer programs.

As a special project this year, the Smithsonian Institution opened its
Drug Exhibit. This office sponsored an adjunct activities area in which
panel discussions, lectures, live theatrical performances, film shows, and
other presentations on drugs were held. This added dimension to the
exhibition provided an excellent opportunity for the museum visitor to
receive more information on drugs and enrich his museum visit.

Office of Exhibits Programs

The Office of Exhibits Programs—restructured and more efficient—
produced more than 200 separate exhibits and exhibits-related projects in
fiscal year 1972. The professional resources of the OEP assisted virtually
every Smithsonian area from the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum to
National Zoological Park.

A special exhibition in the Great Hall of the Smithsonian Building
heralded the Institution’s 125th anniversary, while ‘““Drugs—A Special
Exhibition” created nationwide interest for its unique multifaceted
commentary on a current sociai crisis. Our Restless Planet, a permanent
hall of physical geology, opened in the National Museum of Natural
History; and development progressed on “It All Depends,” a major
exhibition on environmental responsibility that will open in 1973. The
popular Insect Zoo was among the special exhibitions at Natural History.

The new, permanent Monetary History and the Graphic Arts halls were
completed in fire-damaged areas of the National Museum of History and
Technology; the remaining galleries—Philately, News Reporting, and
Photography—will open in fiscal year 1973.

The first new-concept National Air and Space Museum exhibitions,
“Ballooning” and “World War I Fighters,” opened in the Arts and
Industries Building.

The Office of Exhibits Programs contributed substantially to the new
Renwick Gallery and to several major SITES presentations, including
“Greenland.”

The death of John E. Anglim (23 May 1972) was a grievous loss to the
entire museum world. In large measure, he had been personally responsible
_ for the development of exhibits at the Smithsonian, and had trained or
_ advised many of today’s exhibits specialists.
112 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Conservation-Analytical Laboratory

Conservation effort within our confining walls has reduced the backlog
of unstarted requests to about 70. Upon request we have advised twelve
bureaus, other museums, and about five hundred enquirers on safe
environments for many different kinds of objects and on methods of
mounting and cleaning them. Documents, graphics, and objects of fibers,
leather, metal, stone, and wood, ranging in date from prehistoric to the
present and in culture from Ancient Chinese to Cosmonaut, have been
collected or excavated, cleaned, repaired, and chemically stabilized. Causes
of damage have included accident, corrosion, unchecked decay and insects.

Members of the staff have attended courses in paper conservation and
in use of the polarizing microscope for fiber and pigment identification;
shared in an encounter between paper conservators and scientists;
organized a conference section on spectrographic techniques in the
Museum Laboratory; and lectured regularly on conservation to fifty
interested persons and irregularly to numerous special-interest groups, as
well as maintaining active relationships with national and international
organizations concerned with artifact preservation.

Analytical facilities have been supplied for curators to about 270
samples, resulting in 5600 elernental and other analyses, 1150 of them on
medieval glass by neutron-activation techniques, 4000 on materials of all
kinds by UV spectrography, 500 by X-ray fluorescence analysis. Pigments,
minerals, corresion products have been identified by X-ray diffraction and
infrared spectrophotometry—used also to identify commercial materials
proposed for long-term contact with artifacts. The structures of metals and
layering of paints on religious objects, decorated gourds, and transport
vehicles have been studied in cross-section at various magnifications.

Office of the Registrar

This year the Office of the Registrar’s activities encompassed again its
traditional roles as record keeper for the museums and as service office for
the Institution providing assistance to the staff and public in such matters
as mail distribution, shipping, customs procedures, official travel, and
public inquiries.

A long overdue project expected to take several years for completion
was begun in cooperation with the Smithsonian Archives to microfilm the
Office of the Registrar’s holdings of accession records. These irreplaceable
original records are the basic documentation of the National Collections,
dating from the establishment of the National Museum. They are not
duplicated elsewhere, and their safety has been of increasing concern.

|

SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS 113

Twenty-nine hundred and twenty-seven accession memoranda covering
the acquisition of a much larger number of individual items for the
collections were recorded:during the year. Some two million pieces of mail
were handled in serving Smithsonian personnel in the four buildings on the
Mall and in various offices in other parts of the city. Shipments processed
by the office numbered 24,433 pieces totaling 1289 tons, and involved
over a hundred customs entries. Passports, visas, and other diplomatic
travel documents were obtained for approximately three hundred official
travelers. Public awareness of the Institution continues to be evidenced by
the lively pace of inquiry mail on a variety of subjects and in response to
Smithsonian programs.

Smithsonian Institution Libraries

All recorded use of the Libraries increased in fiscal year 1972. User
contacts were up 17 percent to more than 47,000, and circulation
increased 34 percent. About one-quarter of the material used was
borrowed from other libraries. The cataloged collections grew by nearly
15,000 volumes.

The General Library was administratively reorganized, with services to
the bureaus featured separately from the general services. A Technical
Processing Center was established to combine the acquisitions and
cataloging work under one supervisor. An outstanding special librarian was
recruited to fill the newly created position of head of the National Air and
Space Museum Branch Library, and three positions were added to the
service staffs for branches in the National Museum of Natural History and
the National Museum of History and Technology.

Space modification for better collection management and flow of
materials was begun in three locations: a rare book room in the A&l
Building, a stack area in the S.J. Libraries Center at Lamont Street, and a
decking over of the cataloging area in the Natural History Building.

The Libraries again served a clinical function in formal library
education, cooperating in a predoctoral fellowship, a course on research
methodology, and a field work project. Five students were involved from
the library schools of the University of Maryland and the University of
Washington.

Automation proceded slowly. All serials titles were stored in the
computer and output was obtained on microfilm. At year’s end the
Director established an ad hoc study group for a Federal Library Service
Center to develop cooperative automation projects among federal libraries.
PUBLT GrSERMIICE

The Office of Public Service has the distinction of beginning each of its
fiscal years with a lively event—the Festival of American Folklife
sponsored by the Division of Performing Arts. The fifth annual festival
featured the state of Ohio, and for the first time had a major contribution
on the American laborer from the AFL-CIO. Thousands thronged the Mall
to watch bakers, iron workers, meatcutters and other union workers
perform their skills. Indian tribes from the Northwest presented their
traditional arts and discussed contemporary problems in workshops and
seminars. The division is conducting its fieldwork for future years’ festivals
with an eye toward the Bicentennial where there may be a festival lasting
several months, and featuring several states.

Two new publications were begun this past year to keep the public
aware of the Smithsonian’s many diverse activities. The Office of
Elementary and Secondary Education began publishing on a bimonthly
schedule the Smithsonian Institution Bulletin for Schools. It is sent to all
teachers in the metropolitan area to keep them informed of and involved
with exhibits and programs of special interest to their students. OESE has
also designed several’ new tours in the museums where students are
encouraged to study a few selected exhibits in depth.

The Smithsonian magazine continued into its third successful year with
a National Associates membership of well over 300,000. During the past
year there were more than 34 articles either about Smithsonian exhibitions
or written by staff members. Our National Assocfates program provides
special services to its members as announced through the magazine, such as
domestic and foreign study tours, and a book service, whereby Associates
can buy curator-selected books at a discount. The Smithsonian ‘magazine
thus serves to educate and entertain its readers, and provides information
about tangible benefits available only to Smithsonian Associates.

The Smithsonian Institution Press designed and published several new
publications relating to exhibits this past year. The Press has found that in
order to sell adaptations of exhibit-related material to schools, they must
be part of an audiovisual package, so the Press is exploring with other
divisions of the Institution the fields of cassettes, recordings, and films for
future projects. Three editors won Federal Editors Association Awards for
outstanding government publications, and Stephen Kraft won both first
and second awards of the Art Directors Club for his design work. The Press
shipped a total of 266,000 publications during the year.

“The Evolution of a Community” at the Anacostia Neighborhood
Museum was another of its successful exhibits suggested and planned by

114
PUBLIC SERVICE 115

the Neighborhood Advisory Committee. The History of the community
was conveyed to the visitor through old photographs, films, and taped
interviews with older residents of Anacostia. The Neighborhood Museum
has prepared a major proposal for Bicentennial funds to construct an
Exhibits Design and Production Laboratory. The laboratory will be used
to train minority people in the planning, design, and production of
exhibits and related educational materials. It will, in addition, strengthen
Secretary Ripley’s vision of the Museum as a center that answers
person-to-person needs and involves itself at all levels of the community.

Smithsonian Associates

The year was a period of review and consolidation of Associates
activities. National and resident programs were brought together under the
management of an executive director, and a Corporate and Individual
Membership program was formed.

In October the recently established National Board of the Smithsonian
Associates met under its chairman, Regent Thomas J. Watson, Jr. This
group of industrial and citizen leaders is committed to assisting the
Institution extend its appeal to business organizations for private financial
support. In return, the Institution is preparing to render counsel and
appropriate assistance to corporations in employee education and support
of local museums and similar institutions. By June the Board’s member-
ship of 27 persons had begun a corporate member solicitation. Pilot
projects were being investigated in Peoria, Illinois, and San Francisco,
California. In the fiscal year, ten Corporate Members contributed $56,740
to the Institution’s general funds in addition to gifts of objects and project
support.

The individual membership (persons making larger annual contribu-
tions) brought the Institution $15,500 in donations. Members in the
Washington, D.C., area enjoyed participation in several important oc-
casions during the year.

Study of the relations between national and resident members led to an
extensive review of the Resident program and survey of the local
membership. As a result, plans were made to extend the scope of resident
programs to serve a larger part of the National Capital area population, and
to experiment with off-Mall programs. Smithsonian magazine, formerly an
optional benefit of resident members, would become the journal of all
Associates at no increase in cost.

The Members’ Reception Center was staffed and furnished in a room
adjoining the Great Hall of the Smithsonian Institution Building to provide
increased information services to members and museum visitors. A devoted
group of 100 volunteers operated information desks in Smithsonian
116 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

museums and carried out 193 service projects. Another 65 volunteers were
placed in special projects by the Center.

In its sixth year the Resident Program served more than 15,000
members. It continued to provide opportunities for people to explore the
collections, learn about the museums’ research, and study with both
Smithsonian and visiting scholars and craftsmen. During the year, more
than 2000 adults and young people took 82 courses in a variety of subjects
ranging from Near Eastern archaeology and Peruvian art to American
political history, oceanography, and bird behavior. Adults participated in
new studies of Washington, D.C., and an innovative course in city-building
for young people was developed. In addition, more than 1200 members
created their own works of art in 38 craft workshops.

Over 140 special events were offered including openings, luncheon
talks, lectures, films, museum tours, field trips, day tours, fashion shows,
concerts and other performing arts attended by more than 25,000 persons.
Members had fun making stone-age tools, learning of the Mall’s history,
and sharing some new facts about Nefertiti revealed by a major
computer-research project. Some 2000 young people also participated
in six children’s programs, and Associates families undertook 39 field trips
led by Smithsonian scholars.

The Women’s Committee pursued nearly two dozen projects to aid the
Institution and managed two benefits; a fashion show of Sikkimese
clothing and an old-fashioned Christmas dance. Proceeds from these events
provided scholarships for 208 young people in Associates classes,
supported the Insect Zoo, and helped a visual education program at the
Anacostia Neighborhood Museum.

Office of Public Affairs

A significant event for the Office of Public Affairs during the year was
the launching of a new quarterly Smithsonian Institution Research
Reports. First published in May for distribution to news media, libraries,
and other academic institutions, the quarterly will be a means of focusing
attention on the diverse interesting and important work done behind the
scenes by scientists and curators throughout the Institution. In the past
twelve months, the OPA News Bureau wrote and distributed a record total
of almost 300 news releases and more than 100 radio announcements. The
bureau also played major roles in publicizing the opening of the Renwick
Gallery and the openings of a number of major exhibitions. “Radio
Smithsonian” began its third year in September 1971, and is now heard
over 84 stations in 33 states. Work proceeded in the past year on a new
film, Dilemma of the Museums, in which various challenges and oppor-
tunities before Smithsonian museums are explored. Work has begun on a

|

second version of Around the Clock at the Smithsonian. This film will be

used for visitor orientation in the museums. Smithsonian exhibits also have
been the subject of a number of films made by various groups for
educational and other uses. In recent months, OPA has undertaken a
general review of the Institution’s aims and goals in the television field.

| Other OPA activities include publication of the Smithsonian Torch and
monthly Calendar of Events, and revised guides to Smithsonian museums
_of which more than three million copies were printed. A total of 41,358

callers dialed the Dial-A-Museum answering service, and 100,138 dialed the
Dial-A-Phenomenon service. In addition, thousands of inquiries from
visitors, media, and citizens throughout the world were handled by the
staff of the Office of Public Affairs.

Office of International Activities

The Office of International Activities fosters new dimensions to

' Smithsonian programs abroad. In the past year, the Institution’s scientific

and cultural exchanges with the People’s Republic of China, its inter-
national art programs, as well as cooperative programs in environmental
research and conservation, have received special attention. Specifically, a
revised agreement between the Smithsonian and the United States
Information Agency was signed supplying that Agency exhibits in the arts.
Moreover, the Office is now working actively with foreign embassies in
Washington and other foreign organizations to bring exhibitions from
abroad to the international exhibition rooms of the new Renwick Gallery.

The Office of International Activities administers the Smithsonian
Foreign Currency Program which received an appropriation of $3.5 million
in “excess” foreign currencies for fiscal year 1972 for the support of
grants to United States institutions of higher learning for “museum
programs and related research in the natural sciences and cultural history.”
The program has awarded more than $15 million in foreign currency
grants to more than 65 United States institutions of higher learning over
the past seven years. Major environmental research programs initiated this
year with Program support include two major limnology studies in
Yugoslavia, one in India, and one Desert Biome study in Tunisia, the
latter, part of the United States contribution to the International
Biological Program.

Division of Performing Arts

The Division of Performing Arts continued to present ex4mples of the
American esthetic experience with particular emphasis on illuminating the
Smithsonian collections.
118 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

The fifth annual Festival of American Folklife featured the state of |

Ohio and Indian tribes from the Northwest. A notable new feature was a
new exhibit which dealt with American workers and was presented with
the sponsorship of the AFL-CIO. The skills and crafts of iron workers,
bakers, glass bottle blowers, and meatcutters were demonstrated, and
workshops explored the relationship of the worker to his union and
society.

Noted Jazz scholar, Martin Williams, joined the staff of the Division of
Performing Arts to plan and implement scholarly activities, live concerts
and a series of recordings dealing with the history of Jazz.

The Perceptions series continued to offer performances by contempo-
rary creative figures, including composer Steve Reich and_ the
improvisational theater group, The Proposition.

The Division of Performing Arts again joined with the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts and the American Theater Association in
the production of the American College Theater Festival, which was
housed in the new Eisenhower Theater in the Kennedy Center. The twenty
productions ranged from Oedipus Rex presented by Southern Methodist
University, to the contemporary 365 Days presented by the University of
Minnesota.

The Smithsonian Touring Performance Service continued to provide
performances not available through commercial management to museums,
colleges, universities and cultural centers throughout the country. The
Smithsonian Puppet Theatre completed a full year of operation offering
performances of original scripts dealing with museum related themes. A
notable success was achieved in the production of Eureka relating the
adventures of a small boy and his friend as they travel through time and
ideas.

Belmont Conference Center

The Belmont Conference Center has now entered its sixth year of
operation, with the goal of providing a secluded, gracious setting for
small groups needing an exclusive and relaxed working atmosphere.
Through word-of-mouth recommendations by previous guests (Belmont
does no advertising of any kind), the Center finds itself host to more
groups each year: forty-five in fiscal year 1969, fifty-eight in 1970,
sixty-nine in 1971, and seventy-nine in 1972; over 1650 participants have
been welcomed in the last twelve months.

Belmont accepts conferences from all types of groups and this year has
received guests from 35 government agencies, 53 colleges and universities,
5 foundations, 2 Presidential commissions, and 15 private groups. An
astounding 40 percent of these groups has been holding conferences at
Belmont for at least three of the past five years.

PUBLIC SERVICE 119

Twenty-four residents can be accommodated at Belmont, with facilities
for meetings and meals for thirty people. The 240-year-old manor house is
now air conditioned, and ever-continuing improvements make the
residence and 365 surrounding acres of lawns, fields, and forests more
enjoyable each year. The availability of such a beautiful location, together
with the advantage of easy access to Washington’s National and
Baltimore’s Friendship airports, has proven most convenient for Belmont’s
guests.

Anacostia Neighborhood Museum

Black scientists and their achievements from early days to the present
time were honored in the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum’s exhibit
“Science: Man’s Greatest Adventure.” The life stories of seven of the
contemporary scientists were compiled into a booklet entitled They Were
Determined and distributed to junior and senior high school tour groups,

‘libraries, and science supervisors in the District of Columbia public

schools.

Old photographs, films, and tape recordings traced the history of
Anacostia in the exhibit “The Evolution of a Community.” Visitors
walked through replicas of the Old Douglass Hall, Birney School, a section

of a neighborhood church, and a family parlor of the early twenties.

Douglass Hall served Black residents of Anacostia as a meeting place and
social center in the early 1900s. Interviews with oldtime residents were
recorded on tape by the staff of the Museum’s Center for Anacostia
Studies. The exhibit was conceived by the Neighborhood Advisory
Committee of the Museum.

The Mobile Division has been able to increase its services to the
community with the acquisition of video-tape equipment that will be used
to give an increased dimension to the Museum’s exhibits and create a
video-record of its programs.

A children’s room now occupies a section of the exhibit area.
Demonstrations of how soap, butter, ice cream, taffy, and candles are
made together with multimedia presentations on Black history are among
the various programs offered to children by the Museum’s education
department.

Smithsonian

Smithsonian, the Institution’s national magazine, began its third year of
publication with the April 1972 issue. At the close of the fiscal year, net
paid subscriptions had climbed well past 300,000. Subscribers are National
120 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Members of the Smithsonian Associates, and thus form a reservoir of
interest and support for the Institution.

Although the magazine is not a Smithsonian “house organ,” it is
appropriate that much of the editorial content is generated by the
activities or interests of the Institution. During the last year there were 34
major articles either directly related to Smithsonian exhibitions and
research projects or written by Smithsonian staff members. Subjects
ranged from the paintings of the neglected Black artist William H.
Johnson, given his first major exhibition by the National Collection of
Fine Arts last fall, to Dr. Dale W. Jenkins’ sobering study of toxic metals
in the environment (not to mention the first color photographs of the
National Zoological Park’s most celebrated acquisitions, the giant pandas).

Non-Smithsonian authors who contributed important articles during
the year include Isaac Asimov, Lionel Casson, Emmet John Hughes,
Margaret Mead, John Bakeless, and Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Among the
photographers represented were such well-known names as Dmitri Kessel,
Loomis Dean, and Farrell Grehan, and there were special commissioned
drawings such as Robert Osborn’s.

Smithsonian has become a means of communication between the
Institution and its constituency, and is a major item in the benefits to the
National Members of the Associates. Other benefits are foreign and
domestic study tours and discounts on items sold in Museum Shops and on
the publications of the Smithsonian Institution Press. These privileges will
extend to more and more people as the magazine continues to acquire new
readers.

Smithsonian Institution Press

Progress continued this year in the development of our museum-related
publications program. Two attractive booklets were produced for new
exhibits in the National Museum of Natural History and were to be made
available at the exhibit sites. Unfortunately, our experiment with an honor
system dispenser for a ten-cent pamphlet was an unqualified failure. Until
we can devise foolproof vending devices, we shall have to be content with
pamphlets located only in the Museum Shops, often far away from the
exhibit and the moment of highest visitor-interest.

Several attempts were made during the year to make arrangements with
commercial publishers for the adaptation of our museum-related
pamphlets (Our Restless Planet, All About Pandas, If Elected) to the public
school market. Educational publishers prefer “packages,” including audio-
visual programs, with the book or pamphlet as one component. The Press
recommends a coordinating panel for the various Smithsonian offices

i
0
PUBLIC SERVICE 121

_ which are already, or soon will be, producing recordings, cassettes, films,
and other items that could make up a marketable educational package.

Three Press editors won Federal Editors Association Awards for
Outstanding Government Publications in 1972: Louise Heskett for Apes
and Angels: The Irishman in Victorian Caricature, Joan Horn for History
of Letter Post Communication Between the United States and Europe, and
Ernest Biebighauser for Hold the Fort! The Story of a Song from the
Sawdust Trail to the Picket Line. Stephen Kraft won both the First and
Second Awards of the Art Directors Club of Metropolitan Washington for
The Hand of Man on America and Music Machines—American Style.

Production costs of 112 publications were funded by federal ap-
propriations in the amount of $412,569.39; 16 were supported wholly by
Smithsonian Institution private funds in the amount of $73,379.16. The
total publications list for 1972 is given in Appendix 5. The Press
warehouse, the Superintendent of Documents, and George Braziller, Inc.
(The Press’ sales and distribution agent) shipped, on order and subscrip-
tion, a total of 265,903 publications during the year. In addition, 293
recordings were distributed by the Press.

Reading Is Fundamental

The National Reading Is Fundamental program is now in its fifth year as

_an independent unit under Smithsonian sponsorship. RIF’s purpose is to
_ motivate disadvantaged children and adults to want to read, by making
_ available a wide variety of interesting and inexpensive paperbacks. The two

motivational forces built into the RIF program have proven to be sound
educational practice—freedom of choice and pride of ownership.

The number of local RIF projects has grown from 18 in 1971 to 55 in
1972, with many more in the developing stage. Seven hundred and fifty

_ thousand children have received 2.75 million RIF books.

A national advertising council campaign, started in September 1971, has
elicited a gratifying response from professional educators and the public.

National RIF acts as liaison with the publishing industry, federal and
local governments, schools, and libraries about book programs and
provides technical assistance and information to those interested in
developing a local project. The sponsoring groups throughout the country
are responsible for local funding, selection of book titles, and distribution.

The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation has committed up to
$1,150,000 to RIF over a three-year period. The grant covers administra-
tive support for National RIF as a Smithsonian activity. Policy guidance is
provided by the National Advisory Board composed of 44 distinguished
Americans. The founder of RIF is Mrs. Robert S. McNamara; Secretary
Ripley serves ex-officio as a member of the RIF Board.
122 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Office of Elementary and Secondary Education

A variety of new learning opportunities for students has been
introduced this year under the administration of this Office for the
museums on the Mall, pertaining both to the scheduled visits by school
groups and to new services being extended to the schools.

New techniques have been developed in the presentation of several
additional lesson tours in the museums of Natural History, and History
and Technology. Students are encouraged to study in depth a few selected
exhibits and artifacts to draw inferences from their observations of these
items, and to develop some general concepts concerning them. In this way
students are guided through an experience of discovery, using not only the
objects on exhibit but touchable objects as well. The fourth season of
utilizing volunteer high school students as guides in the Mall museums
during the summer months was successfully implemented by the
“Info-71” program.

First efforts to extend the resources of the Smithsonian by directly
reaching out to the classroom have been undertaken. Materials in kit form
have been assembled and released on loan to the schools. A demonstrations
workshop on American folk musical instruments has been provided in
many classrooms of the metropolitan area under the direction of a staff
associate with trained volunteers. Publication of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion Bulletin for Schools was inaugurated this year on a bimonthly
schedule to provide a full range of timely information on activities at the
Smithsonian with particular interest to teachers and students.

Representatives of the volunteer corps and members of OESE met in
workshop sessions with elementary-level curriculum specialists from the
six school districts of the Washington area during the months of April and
May.

ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT

In July, a Deputy Under Secretary, Robert A. Brooks, joined the staff.
During the year, in addition to participating in the full range of activities of
this Office, he undertook independently special assignments from the Sec-
retary and the Under Secretary. At the Secretary’s request, the Smithsonian
Institution began a major effort to identify, define, and resolve significant
operating issues which are of concern to all Smithsonian program and
support organizations. These relate to current operations and to future
growth and development. A small working group was established for this
effort under the supervision of the Deputy Under Secretary. This activity
represents a major new step in the decision-making process. The active in-
volvement of all bureaus and offices is required to help bring into clearer

focus the Institution’s resource management priorities and alternatives.

In February, the Director of Support Activities was designated by the
Secretary to serve as liaison for the new Fort Pierce Bureau in Florida. In
addition to this interesting assignment, the Director continued to supervise

and provide management leadership to the support groups that report

directly to him. The International Exchange Service was added to this
group during the year. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries also was
included, pending the appointment of the Assistant Secretary for Museum
Programs. The Libraries’ report appears under “Special Museum Pro-
grams.” Brief descriptions of the major activities of the other units in this
group are given below.

Buildings Management Department carried out its basic responsibilities
to operate, restore, renovate, maintain, and protect Smithsonian buildings.
To cope with increased workloads without attendant expansion of
personnel resources, a variety of management improvements were made.
These included the development and implementation of standards for
housekeeping and maintenance functions; installation of new equipment
and systems for telephone and telegraph communications; introduction of
a cargo shuttle to move small shipments among Smithsonian buildings in
the Washington area; re-emphasis on the need for regular and complete
coordination of activities; implementation of more effective procedures

_and operational methods, and clarification of the scope of authority and

responsibilities at all levels in the Department.

Major projects underway during the year included supervising the
construction contract for the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden; planning for the new National Air and Space Museum Building;
restoring and opening the Renwick Gallery; altering interior of the Arts
and Industries Building; renovating library space in the Natural History

123
124 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

Building; installing a planetarium exhibit in the Air and Space Building;
and developing plans and specifications for construction of the new
Ramsey Building at Silver Hill. Small projects undertaken included
constructing and renovating office and laboratory spaces; modifying
heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment; supporting exhibits
construction and installation; and providing extensive design work for
other proposed projects.

Measures taken by the Protection Division to achieve maximum
security in face of increased incidents of crimes, harassments, thefts,
vandalism, and bomb threats included: expansion of the Guard training
program; adjustment of post assignments; and employment of more
electronic security and fire prevention systems.

Support of other Smithsonian programs remained at a high level, with
approximately 20 percent of the Department’s productive manpower
devoted to these activities. The special events portion of this effort
required over 6000 manhours.

The Safety Management Office reported that the 12 percent reduction

in lost-time injuries may be attributed to the excellent support given by |
Smithsonian managers and employees to the “ZERO IN on Federal

Safety’ program.

In the area of personnel management, a new union contract was
negotiated, the awards program was used to greater advantage, and training
was intensified throughout the Department.

Information Systems Division develops and coordinates the use of |

automatic data processing support throughout the Institution. Advances
continued to be made through computer utilization in the areas of
administration, management of national collections, and _ scientific

research, and most bureaus increased their use of this support. Research ©

was conducted to enhance the ways of entering data into the computer |

and the ways of obtaining better output products, such as optical —

character recognition for entering data directly from a printed page; ©

terminal devices to enable telephone communication with the computer;
and computer output to microfilm and microfiche; as well as plotted maps
and other graphical presentations.

Individual research assistance to curators and scientists expanded and
broadened in scope as the Division made available additional mathematical
techniques and software packages.

New developments and refinements enhanced support for the manage-
ment of the national collections in history, art, and science. A recently
developed, but not yet completed, generalized information management
package called SELGEM has aroused much attention within and outside
the Institution because of its potential as a standard for the computerized
management of collections.

{Honeywell Information Systems and Smithsonian representatives at the ribbon-
cutting ceremony after the installation of the Honeywell-2015 computer system
‘in the Information Systems Division.

As a service to the museum and university community at large, the
Division published information about the SELGEM system in its technical
: bulletin, Smithsonian Institution Information Systems Innovations. The
| “Innovations” series acquaints the reader with automated systems and
I procedures specifically designed to solve collection and research problems
| in museums and herbaria.

Though no totally new systems evolved during the year, many

specialized systems for administration, curation, and analysis were
| expanded to meet changing requirements.

The new Honeywell-2015 computer system, purchased by the
) Smithsonian Institution, was operational in November.

Management Analysis Office, formerly the Administrative Systems
Division, continued to work with members of the Executive Committee
and heads of organization units on management improvement projects. In

| June, two of the analysts were assigned to assist the Deputy Under
_ Secretary in helping to resolve a variety of specific management issues.

During the year, 182 management issuances and one handbook were

_ researched, coordinated, and published, and 5 handbooks and 17 major
issuances were in various stages of completion at year’s end. In addition to
| the management surveys and studies required to accomplish this, the staff
participated in 25 additional studies which resulted in improved manage-

/ ment and operations.

One internal directory and 13 external publications were updated and
16 external special management reports were completed.

. In June, a contract was awarded for the preparation of a manuscript
_ copy of a Smithsonian Correspondence Handbook.
126 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

The Forms Management Unit provided four million copies of 690 forms
to 85 separate Smithsonian units. A feasibility study for an ADP program
to support forms management and control also was completed.

Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. Under the personal leader-|
ship of the Secretary, the Smithsonian’s Equal Employment Plan of
Action was revised. The expanded plan provides for improved recruiting
practices and programs for career advancement, including methods for |
acquiring specific educational and experience requirements, and for
gaining information about educational opportunities available in the
Washington Metropolitan area. The realistic program is designed to assure
equality of opportunity in all official actions of the Institution.

Additionally, a Smithsonian Women’s Council was established to
provide women employees of the Institution a forum for the expression of |
mutual interests. This channel facilitates communication and encourages |
action by the exchange of information and ideas and lends cooperative |
strength to individuals and groups seeking to promote the good of all -
Smithsonian employees.

During the year, 64 consultations were conducted with individual
supervisory staff members on matters relating to their selections of
candidates for promotion under the Merit Promotion Program. Some 34 |
informal complaints were discussed and reviewed and, as factual informa-
tion was developed, the necessary adjustments were accomplished. One
formal complaint was settled to the satisfaction of the complainant, and
one hearing decision is pending.

Three special training sessions were conducted for supervisory
employees. The discussions stressed the necessity for eliminating personal
prejudices, indifference to the needs of employees, and favoritism in
supervisory practices.

Office of Personnel Administration, following its consultative role in
advising and assisting all Smithsonian staff in creating an environment for
individual growth, has as its major thrust to give responsive and positive
assistance to program directors and managers. The principal emphasis
during the year was to bring managers and employees closer together to
develop a more viable relationship. The Office also concentrated on
personnel program development and analysis as a beginning toward
assuring that our personnel management effort serves the needs of the
Institution while fully recognizing that our most precious resource is our
employees.

Labor-Management Relations continued to represent a significant
effort. New contracts were negotiated with the National Zoological Park
and with the Buildings Management Department. An election for union
representation resulted in the Office of Exhibits Programs’ employees
voting for union recognition. Informal and formal meetings between labor
| ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT 027

‘and management were encouraged, and both groups are getting closer
together in recognizing legitimate needs of employees while becoming
more aware of the needs of the Institution.

An Executive Manpower Resources Board was established to assist in
identifying and developing high potential employees so they will be able to
assume greater responsibilities.

A Learning Laboratory was established to provide employees an
opportunity to gain basic skills to assist in their self-development. Over
150 employees have enrolled in individual instruction which allows them
to develop at their own pace.

Additional improvements included the beginning of an alcoholism
program to assist employees and managers in coping with this complex
illness and a revised merit promotion program. A complete survey was
made of the Institution’s Health Services used by employees and visitors.
The awards program was emphasized and managers were encouraged to be
»more aware of employee contributions.

Improved visible recognition with support of top management has

contributed to a more productive, better motivated workforce. These
accomplishments were especially significant in a year when employment
‘cutbacks and average grade controls imposed difficult burdens on
-management. The Office of Personnel Administration in conjunction with
the Office of Programming and Budget and the excellent cooperation of
“managers withstood these restrictions without seriously affecting
employee relations.

Photographic Services Division was reorganized in 1972. All like-type
-work was consolidated into one physical area and maximum production
‘techniques were applied. A backlog of 700 jobs was reduced to
approximately 120, production units increased by 68 percent, and job
time was reduced from two to three months to one to two weeks.

The Sales Section provides students, educators, scientists, and the
general public with photographs of the Smithsonian collections. Its
mission is to insure maximum “diffusion of knowledge” through the visual
media. During the first six months, the pay order backlog was eliminated
and the average processing time was reduced from two months to
approximately two weeks. Sales increased 81 percent over the same period
in 1971.

The Library Section centralized 200,000 negatives into temperature-
and humidity-controlled space in the History and Technology Building.
Sixty-five thousand negatives were pulled from the files to fill customer
orders. Fifteen thousand negatives and 1000 transparencies were
numbered, captioned, and filed; plans were formulated for captioning,
indexing, restoring, filing, retrieving, and cataloging all negatives. A
comprehensive study was made by the Management Analysis Office to

128 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

determine resources necessary to accomplish the above plans. Planning was
initiated to put all information into the Smithsonian computer. To the
2000 color slides transferred from the Office of Public Affairs, the Section
added 1500 new ones.

The Laboratory Section overcame a tremendous backlog of work.
Consolidation of all wet processes in one location resulted in a 68 percent
increase in production; the new black and white film processor resulted in
a 75 percent savings in film-processing time; print production increased
from 120,000 last year to over 200,000 this year; and copy negatives
increased from 10,000 to 28,000. The Laboratory produced 28,000 8 X 10
inch glossy prints for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the
Interior, on a contract through the Department of Anthropology. It
contributed photographs for the Balloon exhibit; World War I exhibit;
Korean Village exhibit; the Arabia Felix show; a Japanese exhibit for
SITES: the toy exhibit; the new Numismatics Hall; and the Graphic Arts
exhibit.

The Assignment Section also benefitted from the new processing
equipment as more time of the photographers was released for studio
work. Assignments of interest were The Queen of Sikkim fashion show, —
visits of Mrs. Tito and Mayor Willie Brandt, unveiling of President Nixon’s |
portrait at the National Portrait Gallery, the Renwick Gallery Opening, the
Folklife Festival, the 125th anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution,
and Mrs. Richard M. Nixon receiving the giant pandas.

Supply Division processed over 33 percent more procurement actions
this year than in fiscal year 1971. The successful accomplishment of this
workload, with no increases in personnel, is recognized as a major
contribution to the achievement of the program goals of all Smithsonian |
organizations. As in past years, the Division overlooked no opportunity to —
acquire useful excess government property.

Travel Services Office continued to experience growth in its major —
services, i.e., air and rail reservations booked were up 10 percent; travel _
itineraries issued up 12 percent; transportation requests prepared up 15—
percent; and the dollar value of all transportation purchased was some |
$108,000 higher than last year. !

Planning data, advisory services, and travel arrangements were provided
for the annual Folklife Festival, and for national and international —
conferences, meetings, and expeditions; e.g., the three-week systematics
symposium in Washington, D.C.; archeological expeditions to Yugoslavia, |
Israel, and Greece; and the international meeting in geology in
Novosibirsk, Siberia. Special attention was given to travel arrangements for
the Foreign Currency Program of the Office of International Activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT 129

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

The International Exchange Service is the one program bureau included
in the support group. During the year, the Service received publications
from approximately 400 United States organizations for exchange with
organizations in over 100 countries. Exchange publications weighing over
100,000 pounds were received from foreign exchange bureaus for
redistribution in the United States.

More than 450,000 pounds of official United States publications were
transmitted on exchange for official documents of other countries. There
were eight less recipients of full sets but the number of recipients of the
partial sets remained unchanged.

The daily issues of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register
were mailed to 137 foreign libraries in exchange for their parliamentary
journals.

Publications were forwarded by ocean freight to 38 exchange bureaus
in other countries for distribution to the addressees, and publications were
‘mailed to addressees in countries that do not have exchange bureaus.

Approximately 300 medical and dental organizations exchanged their
duplicate journals and books through the Service with libraries in other
countries.

A strike of the East Coast longshoremen in October and November
adversely affected operations.

The Service is again accepting packages of publications for transmission
to the mainland of China.

The Duplicating Section, administered by the Director of the Inter-
national Exchange Service, reproduces materials for all Washington-based
Smithsonian units and for several in the field. The Section’s objective is to
furnish quality material in a minimum amount of time. Management items
reproduced include forms, form letters, administrative directives, organiza-
tion charts, annual and special budget documents, and the Smithsonian
Institution Directory. Research support materials include scientific aad
technical reports, grant applications, information leaflets, preliminary
manuscripts, maps, graphs, charts and line drawings.

A serious loss was sustained with the resignation of the chief assistant in
October. Inability to fill the resulting vacancy for some six months caused
a six weeks backlog of work. This was reduced subsequently to a backlog
of some two weeks and further reduction is anticipated with the
acquisition this year of a new paper cutter and a new multilith machine.
These improvements together with an additional operator planned for the
forthcoming fiscal year should increase production and reduce the amount
of overtime required.
130 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972 |

During the year, the Office of Audits, which reports directly to the
Under Secretary, issued six audit reports on audits conducted by its staff
members. Recommendations made in these reports have resulted in |
improved management procedures and controls, sometimes pointing to |
potential dollar savings.

The Office also reviewed and closed out 47 foreign currency grants |
which were awarded in the total amount of $3.5 million. The close out of |
these grants resulted in $430,000 of unused funds being made available for
current research projects.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

J. Carter Brown, Director

The National Gallery of Art, although technically established as a

_ bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, is an autonomous and separately
_ administered organization. It is governed by its own Board of Trustees, the
_ statutory members of which are the Chief Justice of the United States,
(chairman), the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, all ex officio; and five general
' trustees. Paul Mellon continued as president of the Gallery and John Hay
| Whitney as vice-president during fiscal year 1972. The other general
trustees continuing to serve were Franklin D. Murphy, Lessing J.

Rosenwald, and Stoddard M. Stevens. The Gallery had approximately

1,586,550 visitors during the year.
During the past year, the excavation for the East Building was in large

| part completed, and the beginning of the foundation mat was laid.

Excavation under the east end of the present building was carried out in

_ preparation for the underground connection between the existing and the

new structures. Structural and mechanical plans were completed and
released for bid on | May.

A number of important acquisitions were made. Among them were
twenty-two works from the W. Averell Harriman Foundation in memory
of Marie N. Harriman, including At the Water’s Edge by Paul Cézanne,

_ Words of the Devil by Paul Gaugin, and Lady with a Fan by Pablo

Picasso. Other paintings acquired included Lozenge in Red, Yellow and
Blue by Piet Mondrian and Trumpeters of Napoleon’s Imperial Guard by
Théodore Géricault. Major sculpture acquisitions include A Classical

| Allegory: Victory with the Attributes of Peace, attributed to Antonio

Lombardo; and Torso of a Young Man by Raymond Duchamp-Villon.

Major temporary exhibitions held at the Gallery were “La Scala: 400
Years of Stage Design from the Museo Teatralle alla Scala, Milan,” “John
Sloan,” “Rodin Drawings - True and False,” and “The Art of Wilhelm
Lehmbruck.”

With the increase in staff of the Graphics Department, an active
acquisition policy was established. During the year, 472 prints and 85
drawings were added to the collection. These will be the subject of a
special exhibition in early 1974. There were nine exhibitions installed
devoted entirely to the graphic arts, one of the most outstanding of which
was that devoted to “Rare Etchings of G.B. and G. D. Tiepolo,” held in

131
32 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

honor of Lessing J. Rosenwald. A total of 122 loans were made to

institutions in this country.

The Index of American Design circulated nineteen exhibitions in
fifty-six bookings and prepared four exhibitions for special showings. Also,
782 sets of color slides were booked by schools, institutions, and clubs.
Visitors to the Index numbered 329.

During the fiscal year 1972, the Photographic Archives received 33 ,680
photographs and negatives. Some special purchases included 345 old and
valuable glass negatives from Reali of Florence and 8573 photographs of
Mexican Colonial architecture from Judith Sandoval. Noteworthy gifts
included the Clarence Ward Archive of 6993 negatives of French Medieval,
European, and American architecture and 1198 photographs of paintings
from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.

The Gallery’s new multimedia humanities program “Art and Man,”
published in cooperation with Scholastic Magazines, Inc., reached 6500
classes with more than 1.5 million magazines. As part of the program
128,000 slides, 10,000 recordings, 10,000 filmstrips, and 20,000 media
supplements were also distributed.

Films, color/sound slide lectures and traveling exhibitions were
distributed by the Gallery’s Extension Service to interested schools and
community groups in all fifty states and many foreign countries.

Through grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and
the Xerox Corporation, the Extension Service continued this year to
distribute Kenneth Clark’s thirteen-part film series, Civilisation, to a
national audience of colleges with enrollments of under 2000.

In March 1972, another National Endowment for the Humanities grant
was made to the Gallery for the distribution of a new Kenneth Clark
six-part film series, Pioneers of Modern Painting, to colleges with
enrollments under 2000 and cosponsoring museums and cultural arts
groups. The total number of bookings of all materials circulated by the
Extension Service was approximately 22,750.

Talks given by the Gallery’s Education Department and programs
presented in the auditorium totaled 134,321 for 2915 separate events. The
Gallery’s regularly scheduled programs included Tour of the Week,
Painting of the Week, Introduction to the Collection, films, and Sunday
auditorium lectures. There were twenty-nine guest speakers who lectured
at the Gallery during the fiscal year. They included the distinguished
German art historian Ludwig H. Heydenreich, the 21st annual Andrew
W. Mellon Lecturer in the Fine Arts, who gave six talks on Leonardo
da Vinci.

Twelve new publications were placed on sale through the Publications
Service, six of which were catalogs of exhibitions held at the Gallery. Sales
posters were published for three of these exhibitions.

Under the supervision of Richard Bales, forty concerts were given in the
East Garden Court at 7 o’clock on Sunday evenings. Ten of these were
‘by the National Gallery Orchestra. The Gallery’s 20th American Music
Festival took place between 16 April and 4 June 1972. Eight world
premieres and twenty-four first Washington performances were heard
throughout the season. All the concerts were broadcast in their entirety by
-WGMS, AM-PM in Washington.

To advance the methods used to maintain and preserve its collections,
the National Gallery of Art has, for more than twenty years, sponsored a
scientific research program at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie-Mellon University.
Extensive investigations on the harmful effects of light have led to the
ability to detect potentially serious forms of deterioration and to the
development of adhesives and protective varnishes of improved stability.
Advanced methods have been applied in the past year to the study of
special sections of the sculpture collection as well as to the enhancement
of our ability to characterize the traditional artist’s pigments.

Roger L. Stevens, Chairman

The concept of a National Cultural Center, first developed in 1958,
became reality in 1971 with the opening of the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts. Thirteen years of assembling the complex mosaic
of planning, fund-raising, construction and expectation culminated on the
evening of 8 September 1971 when the Opera House opened with Leonard
Bernstein’s Mass. The Concert Hall officially opened the following night
with a special performance by the National Symphony Orchestra, under
the direction of Antal Dorati, and the Eisenhower Theater took its
inaugural bow on 18 October 1971 when the Center presented Ibsen’s A
Doll’s House.

With its opening, the Center acknowledged four American Presidents:
President Eisenhower, who encouraged and signed the enabling legislation;
President Kennedy, who gave ardent support to the planning; President
Johnson, who broke ground for the building and signed legislation making
the Center the sole official memorial in Washington to the martyred
President; and President Nixon, who gave full personal support and
much-needed tangible support when he signed legislation authorizing
additional federal funding. The Center also acknowledged the public and
private support it had received: $23 million in matching federal funds; $28
million in private and corporate donations; and $20.4 million in the form
of a United States Treasury loan for construction of parking facilities.

The first season received unprecedented artistic and popular acclaim.
At a time when theaters throughout the country faced severe difficulties
in terms of audience attendance and available productions, the Center’s
three halls were virtually in constant operation, entertaining a total of
nearly 1.6 million people.

The Center’s first season offered an almost overwhelming program: 18
weeks of dance with distinguished companies from the United States and
abroad; 120 orchestral concerts by 20 major world orchestras, including
94 by the resident National Symphony Orchestra; 27 performances of 9
different operas; 60 concerts of popular music, folk, jazz and rock; 26
recitals by world famous musicians; 22 choral concerts; and 45 weeks of
drama and musical comedy with works of Shakespeare, Shaw, Saroyan,
Odets, Pinter, Bernstein, and Weill.

-JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS 135

The American College Theatre Festival, presented for the fourth
consecutive year by the Center and the Smithsonian, brought ten of the
nation’s finest college theater companies to perform for the first time in

the Center’s Eisenhower Theater. Produced by Frank Cassidy for the

American Theatre Association and the American National Theatre and

Academy, the Festival enjoyed the sponsorship of American Airlines and

the American Oil Company. Participating schools were selected during
twelve regional festivals held throughout the country and involving over

300 colleges and universities. Of special interest was the participation of
the first foreign theater group, the Aleksander Zelwerowicz State
Theatrical Higher School of Warsaw, Poland.

The third American College Jazz Festival, presented 28-29 May 1972,
under the sponsorship of American Airlines, included performances by
jazz ensembles from 15 colleges and universities.

The educational outreach of the Kennedy Center was very much in
evidence. Tens of thousands of school children from the greater

‘Washington area attended special concerts by the National Symphony

Orchestra at the Center which were arranged by the wives of Cabinet
members. Other performing arts organizations throughout the city also
sponsored a number of special programs. In cooperation with the National
Art Education Association, the Center offered an exhibit of paintings by
students from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

In addition, a commitment to making the Center accessible to all,
regardless of economic circumstances, resulted in the establishment of a
special ticket program subsidized by the Education Fund. Nearly 70,000
tickets to Center events were sold at half price to students, retired persons,
the handicapped, low income groups and military personnel in the lower
grades.

Throughout the year the Center continued to receive gifts of art objects
and furnishings from this country and abroad. By June 1972, twenty
nations had made contributions. Presented and dedicated since the
opening were gifts from Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Great
Britain, India, Israel, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.

The American artist, J. Anthony Wills, presented his portrait of
President Eisenhower, which now hangs over the Eisenhower Theater’s
Presidential Box, and the Texas State Society donated and dedicated a
bronze bust of President Eisenhower, the work of Felix W. de Weldon,
which is mounted over the Theater’s main entrance.

The development of private fund-raising program continued, and the
names of major donors were incised in the marble walls of the Hall of
States.

Probably the greatest success of the Center was found in the response
of the public to its working reality. In addition to those who attended
136 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1972

performances in the Center during its first season, well over two million
people came as visitors to enjoy and take pride in the long awaited, long
needed National Cultural Center.

So much success would imply calm seas and a prosperous voyage. This

is never the case with the creative arts and its institution. Growing pains.

are to be expected and provide measures for improvement. The Center has
unfinished areas, including the studio theater and public rooms on the
Roof Terrace level, and full landscaping of the 17 acre site is incomplete.

The enormous tourist response, which exceeded all expectations,
created an increase in maintenance and security costs. These demands
resulted in a severe financial strain, necessitating an appeal to Congress for
maintenance arrangements befitting a Presidential memorial. Consequent-
ly, the Congress responded by amending the John F. Kennedy Center Act
(72 Stat. 1698) to provide $1.5 million for fiscal year 1972. The
appropriation was designated for maintenance, security, and other services
necessary to the nonperforming arts functions of the Center. The
amendment also provided for the transfer of responsibility for these
functions to the Department of Interior as of 1 July 1972.

The Center is administered separately by a 45-member Board of
Trustees composed of 30 members appointed by the President to ten-year
terms and 15 members ex-officio from pertinent public agencies and from
the United States Senate and House of Representatives. Members of the
Board at the end of fiscal year 1972 are as follows:

WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL
CENTER FOR SCHOLARS

Benjamin H. Read, Director

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was founded by
the Congress in 1968 to be “a living institution expressing the ideals and
concerns of Woodrow Wilson ...symbolizing and strengthening the
fruitful relation between the world of learning and the world of public
affairs.” In keeping with this mandate, the Board of Trustees determined
that the Center would emphasize “studies designed to increase man’s
understanding of significant international, governmental and social
problems and to suggest alternative means of resolving them.”

Since doors opened in October 1970, a total of 87 men and women
from the United States and 20 other countries have been granted
fellowship and guest scholar appointments at the Center, and many scores
of other scholars have had occasion to use Center facilities. The
distribution between U.S. and non-U.S. fellows has been roughly 60/40.
Ages have ranged from the middle twenties to the early seventies.
Academic fellows have come from careers in the social sciences,
humanities, and natural sciences. Others have represented a broad range of
other occupations and professions. The projects of some two-thirds of the
fellows have related to one of the Center’s designated areas of emphasis—
international affairs, environment or oceans.

Center scholars have produced—or are in the process of producing for
publication—a substantial number of articles, monographs and book-length
manuscripts on a wide range of subjects, the majority related to one of the
Center’s three areas of emphasis.
