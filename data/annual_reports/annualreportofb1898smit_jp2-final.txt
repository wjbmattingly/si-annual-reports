PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING HELD JANUARY 26, 1898.

In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller), in the chair;
the Hon. Garret A. Hobart, Vice President of the United States; the
Hon. J.8. Morrill; the Hon. George Gray; the Hon. Joseph Wheeler;
the Hon. R. R. Hitt; the Hon. Robert Adams, jr.; the Hon. William
L. Wilson; the Hon. J. B. Henderson; the Hon. Alexander Graham
Bell; and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were presented from Senator Cullom and
Dr. William Preston Johnston.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read the minutes of
the last meeting in abstract.

The Chancellor said, in relation to the matter of the appointment of
an Acting Secretary, that he had found that his predecessor, when he
made an appointment of this kind, occasionally, he could not say always,
reported it to the Board, and as he had made an appointment of an
Acting Secretary last May, he would read its terms as a report to the
Board:

Whereas it has been signified to the undersigned, Chancellor of the Smithsonian
Institution, that the contingency of the inability of the Secretary of the Smithso-
nian Institution to discharge the duties of that office is about to arise, by reason of
his absence from the United States;

Now, therefore, by the authority conferred on me by the act of Congress entitled
“An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsoniau
Institution,” approved May 13, 1884 (23 Stat., 21), I hereby appoint Mr. Richard
Rathbun an Assistant Secretary of the Institution, to act as Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution during the inability of the Secretary to perform its duties.

Given under my hand at Washington, D. C., this 22d day of May, A. D. 1897.

MELVILLE W. FULLER,
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.

There being no further remarks, the Chancellor declared the minutes
approved.

The Secretary said that he had the sad duty to officially announce
the death of Mr. Gardiner G. Hubbard, a late resident Regent of the

Institution.
XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Mr. Wilson then offered the following resolutions:

Whereas the Hon. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a citizen Regent and a member of
the Executive Committee of the Smithsonian Institution, died at his residence in
this city on the 11th day of December, 1897;

Resolved, That the Regents of the Institution place upon their records this testi-
monial of their respect and admiration for Mr. Hubbard, as a singularly public-
spirited citizen, an ever-generous promoter of education, and active patron of
scieutific work; and this expression of their sincere regret for the loss of a colleague
and friend, whose life was adorned by so many personal virtues and whose associa-
tion with them has left so many endearing memories.

Resolved, That a copy of this minute be engrossed and transmitted to the family of
Mr. Hubbard.

General Wheeler said that Mr. Hubbard had impressed him so favor-
ably by his public spirit and by the great good he had done, that he
considered his death a loss not only to this Institution and to his friends,
but to the entire country.

On motion the resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.

The Secretary announced the appointment and reappointment of
Regents as follows:

Senator Justin S. Morrill reappointed by the Vice-President on March
15, 1897.

Mr. Joseph Wheeler, Mr. R. R. Hitt, and Mr. Robert Adams, Po reap-
ed by the Speaker on December 22, 1897.

Mr. J. B. Henderson and Dr. William Preston Johnston reappointed
by joint resolution of January 24, 1898.

Mr. Alexander Graham Bell appointed to the vacancy caused by Mr.
Hubbard’s death, by joint resolution of January 24, 1898.

The Chancellor stated that certain vacancies existed on the Execu-
tive Committee.

Mr. Adams moved—

That Mr. Henderson be reelected Chairman of the Executive Committee.

Oarried.

General Wheeler moved—

That Mr. Alexander Graham Bell be elected to fill the vacancy on the Executive
Committee caused by the death of Mr. Hubbard.

Carried.

The Secretary presented his annual report of the operations of the
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, stating that there
was very little to say in addition to the printed report, which he hoped
was self-explanatory, though he might add that he did not think there
had been any time in the history of the Institution when it had given
more gratifying evidence of its importance and growth. What it had
done in the way of publication during this period could be seen by a
glance at the table upon which the numerous new volumes were placed
for scrutiny.

On motion the report was accepted.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Senator Henderson presented the report of the Executive Committee
and explained that it brought the financial matters of the Institution
up to the 30th of June last.

On motion the report was adopted.

Senator Henderson introduced the customary resolution relative to
income and expenditure, which was adopted as follows:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1899, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secre-
tary with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part of
the Secretary as to items.

Senator Henderson, on behalf of the Permanent Committee, stated
that he had made a report at the last annual meeting on the condition
of the affairs of the Hodgkins and Avery Bequests, and that there was
. very little to add to it.

In regard to the Hodgkins fund, Dr. M. L. Chambers, the Executor of
Mr. Hodgkins, had lately requested to be relieved of his trust in connec-
tion with the estate. He still held the proceeds of two mortgage notes
amounting to about $10,000, having received notice that he would be
held responsible upon a warranty given by Mr. Hodgkins to Edward
Smith, of the title of certain premises in New York City. The case was
then pending in the Court of Appeals, and was expected to come up
for trial soon. Everything was going along properly and the Chair-
man hoped that at the next annual meeting he would be in a position
to make a report of the entire disposition of the property.

Concerning the Avery bequest, Senator Henderson said that Robert
Stanton Avery, who died at Washington on September 12, 1894, left the
bulk of his property to the Smithsonian Institution. His will was
probated February 2, 1895, the executrix had filed a first account, and
the estate was now nearly administered upon.

The personal estate was invested in Northern Pacific Railroad bonds,
which had to be sold at a very great discount on their face value. The
Institution was now in possession of five pieces of real estate and four
houses, located in northeast and southeast Washington. One of these,
the home of the testator, had been occupied since his death by the
executrix, Miss Avery, at a small rent. This property had been valued
by experts employed by the Institution at $4,750. Miss Avery offered
for it $4,500, the same to be set off against an allowance of $4,500 for
her services to her late uncle during his illness. Although this offer
was $250 less than the expert valuation, all things considered it seemed
a wise course to accept it, and this had lately been done.

One of the pieces of property stood in the name of the testator’s wife,
but his will expressly stated that he furnished the money for its pur-
chase, and the property was his. The Institution filed a bill in equity -
to enjoin the heirs at law of Mrs. Avery from asserting ownership. In
the Equity Court the prayer of the bill was granted. The Court of
Appeals reversed this decision, and the Institution carried the case to
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

the Supreme Court of the United States, where it was argued on the
12th instant.

The entire property, provided the suit in the Supreme Court was
favorably decided, would amount to about $30,000; otherwise, to about
$24,000. The houses were in good condition, and were bringing a fair
rental.

Miss Avery had presented a claim of $6,000 as compensation for the
very trying duties she had to perform in the care of her uncle. She
prosecuted her suit before the Probate Court, and the Permanent Com-
mittee had come to the conclusion, when the facts were presented, that
it would be better that she should be settled with than to go to a jury,
and they compromised on a settlement of $4,500. She now offered to
take the property at that figure in lieu of the money, and the Commit-
tee thought it was advisable to accept the offer; but the attorney
recently called attention to the fact that there was a doubt as to the
conveyance and the making of deeds by the Institution.

It seemed to him (Senator Henderson) that if the Institution were
authorized to hold property, it should certainly also by some means be
authorized to convey or exchange this property. The rental of this
particular piece did not much more than pay taxes and it was con-
sidered desirable to get rid of it. In order to meet the difficulty as to
conveyance, he would offer the following resolution, expressing the
opinion that it was the best arrangement that could be made:

Resolved by the Board of Regents, That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
is authorized and empowered to sell and convey, on such terms as may seem to him
most beneficial to the Institution, any and all lands, town lots, and improvements
thereon, which were devised or conveyed to said institution by R. 8S. Avery, deceased.

And in the execution of the power hereby conferred on him, the Secretary shall
execute to the vendees, respectively, written conveyances signed and acknowledged
by himself as Secretary aforesaid, and attested by the seal of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Senator Henderson stated that this covered the matters under the
charge of the Permanent Committee, except one of minor importance,
which had already been before the Board, namely, the question as to
whether Congress should be asked to remit taxes on real estate belong-
ing to the Institution.

The Chancellor said that three matters were under consideration :

1. In regard to the report. On motion, the report was accepted.

2. On the adoption of the resolution with regard te conveying real
estate. On motion, the resolution was adopted.

3. A general discussion then ensued in regard to the exemption from
taxation of the Avery property, and while no formal action was taken,
the prevailing opinion was that it was better to pay the taxes than to
ask exemption of Congress.

The Secretary announced his acceptance of the resignation of Prof.
Charles D. Walcott as Acting Assistant Secretary in Charge of the
National Museum, to take effect on July 1, 1898, and requested the
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

authority of the Board to transfer to that position, if it seemed best
for the Museum’s interests, the present Assistant Secretary in Charge
of Office and Exchanges, Mr. Richard Rathbun. The Board then
adopted the following resolution:

Resolved, That the restriction placed upon the duties of Mr. Richard Rathbun by
the terms of his appointment, approved by the Board on February 1, 1897, be
removed, to permit of his assignment by the Secretary to such duty as he may deem
best for the interests of the Institution; this to take effect not before July 1, 1898.

The Secretary asked authority to use a portion of the accrued
interest of the Hodgkins Fund in connection with his experiments in
mechanical flight. After discussion the Board adopted the following
resolution:

That the Board authorize any expenditures hereafter to be made from the income
of the Hodgkins Fund, having the approval of the Executive Committee, in regard
to the expenses of certain experiments being conducted by the Secretary in
mechanical flight; and that a report of these expenditures shall be submitted to
the Board at its next annual meeting.

The question being put, the motion was carried.
The Secretary said:

I explained last year to the Board the great difficulties which the Civil Service
rules introduced in making an appointment to the scientific bureaus of the Institu-
tion, and I again ask their attention to the letter of their colleague, Dr. Wilson,
then Postmaster-General, which I submitted to them at that time, as follows:

“OFFICE OF POSTMASTER-GENERAL,
““ Washington, D. C., January 25, 1897.
“(DEAR PROFESSOR LANGLEY: I submitted to the President the letter you gave me.
He seemed favorably inclined to your suggestion that the Assistant Secretary and
the four heads of bureaus should be excepted, and retained the letter, saying that
he would at once send it to the Civil Service Commission for that purpose. Unless
the Commission, therefore, make some adverse report, substantial enough to arrest
his inclination, I think the exception will be made.
“Yours, truly, W. L. WILSON.
“Prof. S. P. LANGLEY.”

I have twice urged upon the Commission the desirability of making this exception,
but they have not done so, though the head of the Commission expresses a willing-
ness to go with me to the President in asking him to make any specific exception to
some specific name, but this is not what the late President of the United States (as
interpreted by the late Postmaster-General) meant, for the President recognized,
when the subject was brought to his attention, that it was probably a very difficult
matter to get any man who was competent to take one of those positions, and espe-
cially that of the Assistant Secretary in Charge of the Museum, to stand an examina-
tion. Since this, an additional year’s experience has led me to feel that I may yet
be glad to see excepted, if not all positions in the Bureaus under the Board’s control,
then at least all scientific positions under them. I desire the instructions of the
Board on this point.

After some discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to request of the President such a modi-
fication of the Civil Service regulations relating to appointments as will permit an
exemption of such scientific positions under the Smithsonian Institution as the Sec-
retary may deem best for the interests of the Institution.
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINFS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The report of a special committee, of which Mr. Hubbard had been
chairman, was submitted by Senator Henderson, pointing out the need
for the National Museum of a new building, as well as an increase in
the scientific staff and a definite purchasing fund; for the Bureau of
American Ethnology the desirability of the passage of a law declaring
archeological sites on the public domain public monuments; and for
the National Zoological Park the need of greater facilities for the pur-
chase and housing of animals.

There was also a further suggestion of the form which the reports of
bureau officers on the property in their charge should assume.

Mr. Hitt moved—

That the report of the special committee be accepted and the commictee be dis-
charged.

Carried.
Senator Morrill here said:

As some of you know, I have been urging a new museum building for about ten
years. The bills 1 have introduced have passed through the Senate several times,
but never through the House. I may say now that I shall not live long enough to
get the measure completed. It was heretofore contemplated that there should be
a Museum building on the west of the Smithsonian building, in a position corre-
sponding with the present Museum building, and these two were to be connected
by a building on B street, thus making the largest museum in the country. I have
now about decided to abandon that plan and try to secure the building on B street
first. I merely state this in order to ascertain whether the change of plan is favored
by the Board of Regents.

It was moved—

That the Board approve the suggestion made by Senator Morrill in regard to a
new building for the National Museum.

Seconded and carried.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1898, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary or, in his absence, of the
Acting Secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

Statement of regular income from the Smithsonian fund available for use in the year end-
ing June 30, 1899.

of the Board, resolutions were unanimously adopted by a rising vote,
which will be found under the heading Necrology.

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell was appointed a regent (to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Hubbard) by joint resolution,
approved by the President of the United States on January 24, 1898.
Gen. John B. Henderson and Dr. William Preston Johnston were
reappointed by the same joint resolution. Senator Morrill was
reappointed by the President of the Senate on March 15, 1897, and the
Hon. Joseph Wheeler, the Hon. R. R. Hitt, and the Hon. Robert
Adams, jr. (Representatives), were reappointed by the Speaker of the
House on December 22, 1897.

Mr. Bell was elected a member of the executive committee, of which
General Henderson was reelected chairman.

The Secretary presented his annual report of operations to June 30,
1897, which was accepted. Reports were also presented by General
Henderson as chairman of both the executive and the permanent
committees.

The Secretary announced his acceptance of the resignation of Prof.
Charles D, Walcott as Acting Assistant Secretary in Charge of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

National Museum, and the Board passed a resolution modifying the
terms of the appointment of Mr. Richard Rathbun as Assistant Secre-
tary, so that his services might be utilized wherever it was deemed
best for the interests of the Institution.

The report of a special committee, of which Mr. Hubbard had been
chairman, was submitted by General Henderson, pointing out the need
for the National Museum of a new building, as well as an increase in
the scientific staff and a definite purchasing fund; for the Bureau of
American Ethnology the desirability of the passage of a law declaring
archeological sites on the public domain public monuments; and for
the National Zoological Park the need of greater facilities for the
purchase and housing of animals.

With regard to the recommendation of the desirability of the passage
of a law declaring archeological sites on the public domain public
monuments, a form of proposed legislation has been prepared which
may later be brought to the attention of the Congressional Regents in
their legislative capacity.

There was also a further suggestion of the form which the reports of
bureau officers on the property in their charge should assume, all of
which matters have had the Secretary’s attention.

At the beginning of the Spanish-American war the Hon. Joseph
Wheeler, a regent, was appointed major-general of United States Vol-
unteers, and went with the army to Cuba, where his service is matter
of public record. Dr. Andrew D. White, a regent, has been appointed
ambassador to Germany, and Dr. James B. Angell, another regent,
minister to Turkey. These gentlemen are still regents, though the
Institution has during the year been deprived of their valued services.

ADMINISTRATION.

As the business of the Institution itself and of the various Govern-
ment bureaus under its direction increases from year to year, the question
of administration and of a proper division of its cost among the various
bureaus becomes more pressing. It has been the purpose of the Secre-
tary to delegate to those in immediate charge of the bureaus as much

authority as is consistent with his responsibilities to the Board of

Regents and to Congress. The gradual growth of the bureaus both in
number and importance has thrown into the Secretary’s office a very
considerable amount of clerical labor pertaining almost exclusively to
Government work, and while the cost of clerical service for this central
control has been divided among the bureaus where practicable, yet
the limited income of the Institution must be drawn upon in larger
measure than seems proper until a suitable time for the organization
of a force, paid from an appropriation specifically for this purpose.
The Board has already authorized the Secretary to call upon Congress
for such an appropriation, but each year obstacles have arisen render-
ing action inexpedient.
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
FINANCES.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1897, the unexpended
balance, as stated in my last annual report, was $61,532.50. The total
receipts for the year were $67,178.22, being $56,400 derived from the
interest on the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, and
$10,778.22 received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $62,907.70, the details of
- which are given in the report of the executive committee. The balance
remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1898, for the
expenses of the Institution, was $65,803.02, which includes $10,000
referred to in previous reports, $5,000 of which was received from the
estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Gra-
ham Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote
certain physical researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds
of the Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
and other funds, which is held against certain contingent obligations,
besides relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which
may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific investiga-
tions and publications in progress.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming part
of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of the prop-
erties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the fun-
damental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

Lotalspermanent tun dies sepa eee eee ee eee

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding with the original bequest the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of
the purposes thereof.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Under this section, 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the above fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

During the fiscal year 1897-98 Congress charged the Institution with
the disbursement of the following appropriations:

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for disburse-
ments made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of the
receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October 2, 1888,
and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House
of Representatives.

The vouchers for all of the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to by
the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury
were as follows:

HAMILTON FUND.

The original amount of $1,000, the bequest of Mr. James Hamilton,
of Pennsylvania, received by the Institution in 1874, was increased in
1895 to $2,000 by the addition of accumulated interest under authority
given by the Regents in their meeting of January 23, 1895, the sum of
$150 expended from the income of fund in 1876 for explorations having
been refunded. The present income, together with interest accumulated
since 1895, seems to warrant some definite application of the interest
on the bequest, and I am now considering a plan of iectureships in
accordance with the testator’s purpose.

AVERY FUND.

Concerning the Avery fund I have to report that by a decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States the Institution has obtained a
clear title to the property on Capitol Hill claimed by the heirs of Mrs.
Avery. The executrix of the estate has settled her accounts, and a
small balance in cash has been paid to the Institution. Certain stocks
and bonds are held by a trust company, the income to be paid over to
Miss Avery during her lifetime, and upon her death the principal is to
be paid to the Institution. The Institution also holds some small pieces
of real estate which it is not deemed wise to dispose of at present. The
Commissioners of the District of Columbia have freed this property
from all claim for taxes. .

It may be recalled that the testator, while leaving his property abso-
lutely at the disposal of the Regents, expressed a wish that it might be

‘Item withdrawn, as the collection had been sold.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

made useful in promoting researches on the Ether, after certain mathe-
matical and phonetic publications and certain researches connected
with a special form of telescope had been made. The moneys received
from the estate are as yet too small to carry out any part of this pur-
pose but the last.

BUILDINGS.

No alterations were made in the Smithsonian Building during the
year except such slight repairs as seemed necessary to keep it in good
condition. The space in the rear of the building, however, which fora
number of years had been occupied by unsightly and dangerous storage
sheds and workshops, has been cleared of these and graded into a lawn,
thus very greatly improving the surroundings.

In the park south of the building, and at a distance sufficient to
prevent annoyance, there has been erected a temporary wooden
building of two stories for the use of the taxidermists and for other
purposes.

The investigations being prosecuted in the Astrophysical Observa-
tory requiring more space than is available in the old structure, plans
have been approved and some progress made toward the erection of
some very simple additions authorized by Congress at its last session by
a clause permitting the expenditure for this purpose of an unexpended
balance of the annual appropriation for the maintenance of the observ-
atory.

Four additional galleries have been erected in the Museum Building,
three for-exhibition purposes and one to serve as an increase for the
quarters for the Library, thus adding 6,650 square feet to the floor
space of the Museum, 6,040 square feet of which is available for exhi-
" bition purposes.

RESEARCH.

The promotion of original research has always been one of the prin-
cipal functions of the Institution. Investigations in the anthropological,
biological, and geological divisions of science have been extensively
carried on through the departments of the National Museum, and in
the Bureau of American Ethnology there have also been special
inquiries into Indian customs and languages. These lines of research
being well represented by its bureaus, it has remained for the Institu-
tion proper to devote its energies more especially to some of the physical
sciences. ;

The Secretary himself has carried on researches in the solar spectrum,
which, by the active assistance of the Aid in charge, have produced
results now shortly to be published. They are believed to be impor-
tant and are referred to in another portion of this report.

The Secretary has not wholly discontinued the studies which he has
made in regard to aerodromic experiments, and it is perhaps not
improper that he should state that these have attracted the attention
8 é REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of other departments so far that during the war with Spain a commis-
sion was directed by the Secretaries of War and the Navy to inquire
into them with a view of their possible utility in war. This is not the
place to state the results of these inquiries.

The Secretary desires to repeat, however, that his time is almost solely
given to administrative work, and that what he has been able to do in
these directions has been done largely in hours which he might consider
his own.

In addition, some very important investigations have been made and
others are in progress, by specialists, in the fundamental laws of sound,
of gases, the upper atmosphere, and on impure air and other important
questions, which are mentioned somewhat more in detail under the
heading of the Hodgkins fund.

HODGKINS FUND.

Although the Hodgkins fund competition announced by the Institu-
tion in the widely distributed circular of March 31, 1893, was definitely
closed so long ago as December 31, 1894, a very general interest is still
expressed in the subject, and specialists in our own and other countries
not infrequently forward copies of their original published memoirs as
contributions to the Hodgkins fund library of the Institution.

Frequent applications for grants are received, and, notwithstanding
the fact that the limitations on the use of the fund do not permit it to
be employed for the support of an investigation, unless under the
exceptional conditions of the first published announcement, it has still
been found practicable to approve several awards during the past year.

As noted in my last report, in July, 1897, an additional grant of $400
was made to Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch, of the Blue Hill Meteorological
Observatory, Readville, Mass., and in the following October a further
grant of $250 was approved to Mr. Rotch. These sums are to be devoted
to experiments with automatic kites, for determining, by means of self-
recording instruments, meteorological data in atmospheric strata
inaccessible except by some mechanical method of exploring the atmos-
phere, and it will be of possible interest to the Board to learn that
during the past year, and (to slightly anticipate), shortly after its close,

experiments of remarkable success and interest have been made by ~

Mr. Rotch, and, among others, that kites have been flown to the
unprecedented height of 11,086 feet above the station, carrying up
with them meteorological instruments which recorded the height, the
pressure of the wind, the dew point, and other facts of interest at
these great altitudes.

Those who remember the situation of Blue Hill, one of the highest
landmarks on the Atlantic coast north of the southern shores of the
Gulf, and the aspect of the hills, blue with the distance from which
they take their name, may be struck by the certainly notable fact that
in these experiments the kites sent up from Blue Hill, and held there
at the station, were occasionally directly over the distant ocean.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

November 1, 1897, a grant of $500 was made to Prof. William
Hallock, of Columbia University, New York City, for an investigation
having for its object the complete analysis of a particle of air under
the influence of articulate sounds, thus contributing a study of the
atmosphere in one of its most important functions, that of a conveyer
of speech.

In February, 1898, a final grant of $250 was made to Drs. Lummer
and Pringsheim, of the Physical Institute of the University of Berlin.
The investigation begun by them, in 1893, to determine the ratio of the
specific heats, at constant pressure and volume, for air, oxygen, car-
bondioxide, and hydrogen, has now so far progressed that the memoir
submitted by Drs. Lummer and Pringsheim, noting the results already
attained by them, has been published by the Institution in the Smith-
sonian Contribution to Knowledge.

A German edition of this original memoir, with the consent of the
Institution, is to be published by the authors, and it is understood
that, if found desirable, their research will be further prosecuted under
the direction of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, of Berlin,
Professor Dr. Kohlrausch, the president, having courteously signified
the readiness of that institution to furnish the means necessary for the
purpose.

In February, 1898, an additional grant of $250 was made to Mr. EH.
C. C. Baly, of University College, London, to enable him to continue
his research upon the decomposition of the atmosphere by electricity,
and upon the ozonizing of mercury. The report of Mr. Baly, stating
the result of these investigations, is now awaited by the Institution.

A grant of $250 to Prof. Arthur G. Webster, of Clark University,
Worcester, Mass., was approved in May, 1898, for the continuation of
a research on the properties of air in connection with the propagation
of sound, special effort being directed to the securing of data relating
to the influence of the viscosity of air on expiring or vanishing sounds.
An instrument devised by Professor Webster for use in this investiga-
tion gives the physical measure of a sound, not only when constant, but
when rapidly varying. It is expected that this research will furnish
results of high practical value in connection with the question of the
acoustics of auditoriums, and will contribute information upon points
- that have not heretofore been satisfactorily investigated.

A paper embodying the results of the interesting research, described
in the Secretary’s report for 1894, primarily conducted under a grant
from the Hodgkins fund to Dr. J. 8. Billings and Dr. 8. Weir Mitchell,
and continued, under their supervision, by Dr. D. H. Bergey, of the
Laboratory of Hygiene, University of Pennsylvania, has been pub-
lished in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Although the terms of acceptance of the Hodgkins bequest preclude
any general allotment of the accruing interest in the way of grants, no
request for an appropriation is left unconsidered, and any application
for the aid of a promising research in the hands of an investigator who
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

is able to comply with the strict, though not unreasonable, conditions
which necessarily govern the expenditure of this fund, is sure of
serious consideration.

NAPLES TABLE.

Among the applications for the occupancy of the Smithsonian seat at
the Naples table during the years 1897-98, the following have been
favorably acted upon:

Dr. Bradley M. Martin, of the University of Chicago, whose work has
been chiefly in the field of the alge, and who has published several
papers detailing his researches, was appointed for November, 1897, his
period at Naples to be supplemented by additional investigation in the
laboratory of Dr. Strasburger, of the University at Bonn.

Dr. H. W. Conn, of the department of biology, Wesleyan University,
received the appointment for six weeks early in the year 1898, Dr.
Dohrn, the superintendent of the station, kindly arranging for his
accommodation, although the Smithsonian table was occupied at that
time. The fact that Dr. Dohrn finds himself not only willing, but able,
to provide for two or, as in this case, even three students at the Smith-
sonian table during the same period, is a courtesy much appreciated by
the Institution.

Dr. D. M. Mottier, of the State University of Indiana, who wished to
supplement his investigations at Bonn and Leipzig by some weeks at
Naples, was appointed for the months of March and April, 1898.

Dr. W. T. Swingle, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
now honorary custodian of alge in the United States National Museum,
occupied the Smithsonian seat at Naples for an additional month dur-
ing the spring of 1898.

Dr. J. H. Gerould, of Dartmouth College, who prosecuted his inves-
tigations in the laboratory of Professor De Lacaze-Duthiers, at Roscoff,
Finisterre, France, during the summer, was appointed to the Smith-
sonian table at Naples for the month of November, 1898.

Although applications for the privilege of the table are often received
far in advance of the period for which occupancy is desired, in order
that all investigators may be given an equal opportunity to secure
appointment, no application is considered more than six months in
advance of the date for which the seat is desired, and no appointment
is made for a longer period than six months. An occupant is not, how-
ever, debarred from applying for an extension of time or for future
reappointment.

It may be repeated here that with a formal application for appoint-
ment, made to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the can-
didate should submit such credentials as he may desire to have on
record, among which should be an outline of his scientific history and a
list of his published memoirs. Investigators are expected to make a
report to the Institution at the end of their term at the table, or at the
end of three months, in case of a six months’ occupancy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Pt

During the past year a vacancy in the advisory committee of the
Naples table was caused by the death of Dr. Harrison Allen, who rep-
resented the Association of American Anatomists. Dr. Theodore Gill,
of Washington, has been appointed to fill the vacancy, Dr. G. S.
Huntington, of New York, to be held as alternate. During the absence
in Europe of Dr. C. W. Stiles, the duties of Secretary of the Commit-
tee have been performed by Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Department of
Agriculture.

The Secretary is under continued obligation to the committee for
valuable aid in the work of examining testimonials and recommending
action with regard to applications for the table.

EXPLORATIONS.

In the plan of organization of the Institution, among examples of
objects for which appropriations may be made, are cited:

Explorations in descriptive natural history and geological, magnet-
ical, and topographical surveys to collect materials for the formation of
a physical atlas of the United States.

Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the different
races of men in North America; also explorations and accurate surveys
of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our country.!

The first grant made by the Institution for scientific exploration and
field research was in 1848 to Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, for the
exploration of the bone caves and the local natural history of south-
eastern Pennsylvania; and during the half century that has elapsed
since the grant to that eminent man, who afterwards became the Sec-
retary of the Institution, every possible encouragement and support
has been given to natural history and ethnological explorations in
America and throughout the world. The income of the Institution has
not permitted the expenditure of large sums for this purpose, but valu-
able advice and instructions have been freely given to explorers con-
nected with Government and private expeditions, and agents of the
Institution have in very many cases participated in these explorations.
In recent years a vast amount of such work has been carried on by the
bureaus under direction of the Institution, a work made possible by
Congressional appropriations for this purpose.

As soon as there seemed a possibility of acquiring new territories as
a result of the present Spanish-American war I began formulating plans
for exploring the possible new regions, and in my next estimates to be
sent to Congress I expect to ask definitely for appropriations under
which exploring parties may be sent to them.

Itis hardly necessary to recall the lasting impression that the French
Government made through the researches of the corps of savants sent
along with the expedition to Egypt. It would seem incumbent upon this
Government, not only for practical economic purposes, but as a contri-

1Smithsonian Report, 1846, pp. 6, 7.
1 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bution to the general intelligence of mankind, to institute scientific
inquiry as to the natural history, geology, geography, ethnology, arche-
ology, and scientific utilities of any new possessions it may acquire.
These inquiries should be made coherently and without clashing on the
part of the various Government interests involved.

During the present year investigations among the American Indians
have been conducted by the Bureau of Ethnology, and several collabo-
rators of the Institution have made natural-history explorations, the
details of which are given in the paragraphs devoted to the National
Museum.

PUBLICATIONS.:

Secretary Henry said “It is chiefly by the publications of the Institu-
tion that its fame is to be spread through the world, and the monument
most befitting the name of Smithson erected to his memory.” From
the beginning of the Institution a considerable portion of its annual in-
come has been expended in publishing the Smithsonian Contributions
to Knowledge and the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Through
these series, supplemented by the Annual Reports printed at the direct
expense of the Government, and the publications of the National
Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, and the American Historical Asso-
ciation, issued under the direction of the Institution, nearly all branches
of human knowledge are represented in the works published during the
last fifty years, which form a library of nearly 250 volumes, beside sev-
eral hundred pamphlet reprints of the memoirs and articles contained
in the serial volumes.

Contributions to Knowledge.x—One new memoir of this series was pub-
lished during the year, the result of investigations by Drs. Lummer
and Pringsheim, of Charlottenburg, Germany, on the ratio of the
specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume of air,
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. This research was aided by a
grant from the Hodgkins fund of the Smithsonian Institution. After
a period of notable advance the kinetic theory of gases seems to have
fallen into temporary abeyance, possibly from a fundamentally imper-
fect understanding of their behavior. Progress in the knowledge of
this fundamental nature of gases may reasonably be looked for from
interpretative researches on their thermal capacity, and this paper may
be considered as a step in this direction. Aside from its exceptional
importance in thermodynamics, the heat ratio is of interest as affording
a clue to the character of the molecule, and Drs. Lummer and Prings-
heim, using a new method, appear to have for the first time reached
coincident results on the incoercible gases examined.

The original edition of the Secretary’s memoir on The Internal Work
of the Wind, published in 1893, having become exhausted, some addi-
tional copies have been printed from the stereotype plates, in which a
few minor changes have been made.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

The Secretary now has in preparation for this series a review of his
investigations in aerodynamics, and in particular of experiments in
developing the principles and methods of mechanical flight.

Miscellaneous Collections.—In this series five works have been pub-
lished since my last report. These are a Catalogue of Scientific and
Technical Periodicals, by Dr. H. C. Bolton; Catalogue of Pacific Coast
Earthquakes, by Prof. EK. S. Holden; Review and Bibliography of
Metallic Carbides, by Prof. J. A. Mathews; Bibliography of Metals of
the Platinum Group, by Prof. J. L. Howe, and a report by Dr. D. H.
Bergey on the results of experiments to determine whether impure
atmosphere produces a detrimental influence upon the animal organism
as shown in greater susceptibility to certain diseases.

There have been also reprinted from the stereotype plates new edi-
tions of the Smithsonian Meteorological, Geographical, and Physical
Tables. A Supplement to the Bibliography of Chemistry, by Dr. H.C.
Bolton, containing about 4,000 additional titles, is in hand, and about
half of the volume had been printed at the close of the year.

Smithsonian reports.—The Annual Reports of the Institution for the
year 1896 and 1897 had not been issued at the close of the fiscal year,
although the volume for 1896 was in the Government bindery, and press-
work was in progress on the report for 1897, their completion having
been delayed by the imperative need of supplying documents required
by Congress for the military departments by reason of the Spanish-
American war.

National Museum publications.—In addition to the Museum volume of
the Smithsonian report, two series of publications are issued directly
by the Museum, the Proceedings and the Bulletin. Of the first series
Volume XIX was completed in bound form, the separate papers having
previously been issued as pamphlets, and seventeen papers comprising
Volume XX were distributed in pamphlet form during the year. A
pamphlet containing instructions for collecting scale insects was pub-
lished as Part L of Bulletin 39, and a circular was issued relating to
the collection and preservation of the bones and teeth of the Mastodon
and Mammoth.

Bureau of Ethnology reports.—The seventeenth report of the Bureau
of Ethnology, for the year ending June 30, 1896, was sent to the Public
Printer on July 6, 1897, and proof reading was completed before June
30, 1898, but actual presswork has not begun. The eighteenth report is
also in the printer’s hands, but no progress has been made beyond the
revision of some first proofs.

Astrophysical Observatory publications.—There has been prepared and
is now ready for publication a full report on the results of the researches
carried on in the-Astrophysical Observatory since its establishment and
this work will probably be printed in quarto form during the next fiscal
year, the cost of the publication being charged to the appropriation for
the Observatory under authority of Congress,
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Historical reports.—The Report of the American Historical Associa-
tion for the year 1896 has been issued in two volumes, the first volume
containing 22 papers on various historical subjects, the second volume
being an exhaustive essay on the proposed amendments of the Consti-
tution of the United States during the first century of its existence by
Dr. H. V. Ames.

The report for the year 1897 was sent to the printer early in June,
1898, and much of it was in type before the fiscal year closed. It con-
tains 20 papers relating to American history, including some of timely
interest on the Cuban question, the Spanish policy in Mississippi after
the treaty of San Lorenzo, and an exhaustive bibliography of Alabama.

These reports are prepared by the association and transmitted to
Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in accord-
ance with the act of incorporation of the association. The series began
with the report for 1889, but until 1894 no extra copies of the reports
were printed for the use of the Institution. The edition is so small
that it permits of distribution only to the most important American
and foreign historical societies in exchange for publications of like
character. .

LIBRARY.

The number of accessions to the library has been greater than at
any time heretofore, the total entries of: volumes, parts of volumes,
pamphlets, and charts reaching 40,715, an increase of nearly 5,000 over
the previous year. The greater part of this has been sent to the
Library of Congress to be placed with the Smithsonian deposit.

The Museum library shows a greatly increased use over last year.
The limited quarters assigned for library purposes in the Museum are ©
so greatly crowded that it has become necessary to provide additional
book room, for which purpose a gallery directly adjoining the library
has been erected and fitted with shelves, where space is provided for
18,000 volumes. This is rendered necessary by the purchase for the
Museum, by Congressional appropriation, of the scientific library of
the late Dr. G. Brown Goode. The Institution is especially fortunate
in being able to obtain this library and the Museum now has the benefit
of possessing the collections of books both of Professor Baird and Dr.
Goode.

The relations between the Institution and the Library of Congress
have been friendly and intimate, as in the past. The entire library has
been transferred to the new building, and the small East stack, together
with the large room adjoining it on the main library floor, have been
assigned for the use of the Smithsonian deposit. ‘Thus far, in the main,
only publications of learned societies have been placed in this stack,
whose supposed capacity is about 175,000 volumes. It is known that
the titles of the Smithsonian publications number something like 350,-
000, but it has not been known until lately how many volumes were
represented. The classification, which is now going on, and the rescue
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

of the volumes from the condition in which they were put together,
rather than assimilated or arranged, in the old crowded quarters, has
enabled an approximate estimate to be made on this point. To what
extent the Institution’s collections have suffered from the crowded con-
dition which has been too publicly known, that I should have any hesi-
tation in thus referring to it, can not be definitely stated. It is believed
that about 100,000 volumes or their equivalent are all that can be con-
tributed to this stack.

The aecumulations of the Smithsonian deposit for the last ten years,
which had been unsorted in the old library, have been brought fairly
under control, though much remains to be done before these will be in
a Satisfactory condition. The present wise organization of the Library
of Congress into departments has yet one omission to which I feel
compelled to call attention as it affects the interests of the Institution.
No special provision was made for the care of the Smithsonian deposit.
Naturally enough in the immense labor which has fallen upon the
Library of Congress, the more pressing needs of the other departments
have been first considered, but I have full confidence that this will soon
be fully attended to.

The never-ending work of writing for exchanges and for the comple-
tion of incomplete sets, to which I have frequently referred, continues.
The time will come when all resources of exchange will fail and when
the deficiences in the important sets can only be provided by appropri-
ation from Congress. While I have had this matter in mind for several
years, I have been reluctant to bring it up for discussion at all until
the Library of Congress was in condition for an intelligent treatment
of the subject.

It will be seen from the library activities, a few of which I have
enumerated, that in spite of the endeavor made by Secretary Henry
to relieve the Institution of all expense of library work in arranging
for the deposit of the Smithsonian library at the Library of Congress,
by degrees a certain amount of such work and with it a very consid-
erable attendant expense has grownup. This I trust will always be
kept at a minimum, and the strength of the Institution, both through
its library work and exchange service, employed for the increase of the
Library of Congress and the Smithsonian deposit at that Library. It is
nevertheless quite plain that no scientific establishment can exist and
perform its functions without at least a considerable working library.

CORRESPONDENCE.

The present system of recording correspondence, which was fully
described in my report for 1890, has proved of great convenience in
handling the constantly increasing number of letters received from
correspondents in all parts of the world. Numerous letters continue
to be received seeking information on scientific and technical questions
as well as on political, economic, historical, and other matters, and,
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

while it has always been the policy of the Institution to give courteous
attention to all such inquiries, it has become impossible to reply in
detail to many of them; the writers, however, are referred to sources of
information. The Institution has, unfortunately, perhaps, come to be
considered a bureau of general as well as of scientific knowledge.

The following rule governing correspondence, adopted by the Regents
in 1855, is still in force.

Resolved, That all correspondence of this Institution with any person
or society shall be conducted by the Secretary, and no assistant or
employee shall write or receive any official letter or communication
pertaining to the affairs of the Institution except under the authority
and by the direction of the Secretary; and all such correspondence

shall be duly registered and recorded in such manner as the Secretary
shall direct.

As interpreted, this resolution is entirely consistent with the free
activities of the Institution and its bureaus in correspondence, the
requisite authority being always understood to be given and exercised
by the person to whom the Secretary delegates it in each instance.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES.

The Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists was held at
Paris from September 5 to September 12,1897. There were thirty-four
members registered from the United States, several of whom were
present and took an active part in the proceedings. Dr. Paul Haupt,
honorary curator of the division of historic archeology in the United
States National Museum and professor of the Semitic languages in the
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, represented the Smithsonian
Institution. There were also delegates from the American Oriental
Society, the American Philosophical Society, the University Archzo-
logical Association of Philadelphia, ete.

The Congress was organized in seven sections: I, Aryan; II, The
far East (including China, Japan, Indo-China, the Indian Archipelago,
etc.); ILI, Mohammedan; IV, Semitic; V, Egypt and Africa; VI,
Archaic Greece and the Orient; VII, Ethnography and Folklore.
Several of these sections were divided into two or three subsections.

Professor Erman, of Berlin, submitted the plan for a comprehensive
Thesaurus Verborum Aegyptiacorum, which is to be published under the
auspices of the royal academies of Berlin, Gottingen, Leipzig, and
Munich; it will contain all the words found in hieroglyphic and hier-
atic texts. The card catalogue for the work will be finished in 1904,
and the final redaction in 1908, while the printed edition will be com-
pleted in 1913. The assistance of Egyptologists all over the world is
solicited for this gigantic undertaking.

Professor Goldziher, of Budapest, presented a report on the great
Mohammedan Encyclopedia which is to be published under his edito-
rial direction, and Professor Haupt announced a complete bibliography

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. dlr

of Assyriology up to 1900, which is being prepared by Dr. Cyrus
Adler, of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Secretary was in July, 1897, appointed delegate of the United
States to the Seventh International Geological Congress, at St. Peters-
burg, Russia, during the first week of September. Other delegates
from this country were Prof. George P. Merrill, of the National
Museum, Rollin D. Salisbury, of New Jersey, and Charles R. Keys, of
Missouri, these names being announced by the Institution to the
Secretary of State, by whom the appointments were directly certified.

The special subjects under consideration related to stratigraphic and
petrographic classification and nomenclature and the rules regarding
the introduction of new terms into stratigraphic nomenclature. The
congress will always remain memorable on account of the number and
extent of the excursions offered the visiting geologists and the hospi-
tality with which they were everywhere greeted. The excursions

_ before the congress were: (1) to the Urals and Western Siberia; (2) to

Ksthonia, and (3) to Finland, and, after the congress, to the Caucasus
by any one of three routes; thence to Tiflis, Baku, and Batoum, with
side trips to Ararat, Mount Elbrous, the Crimea, and other lessimportant
points. The registration for the congress was unusually large, num-
bering some 850 signatures, of whom upward of 600 were actually in
attendance either at the meeting in St. Petersburg or on some of the
excursions. The next congress is to be held in Paris in 1900.

The Secretary presented to the Department of State the names of
Dr. C. W. Stiles and Prof. E. L. Mark, and they were appointed dele-
gates to the Congress of Zoology to be held at Cambridge, England.

The Secretary and Dr. Cyrus Adler were in June, 1898, appointed as
delegates of the United States to a conference to be held in England
for further consideration of an international catalogue of scientific lit-
erature mentioned in the last report.

EXPOSITIONS.

In my report for 1897 I made a brief reference to the participation of
the Smithsonian Institution and its dependencies in the 'Tennessee
Centennial Exposition, which was opened on May 1, 1897. A descrip-
tion of the exhibits prepared for that occasion under the direction of
the Institution will be published in the Museum volume of this report.

By direction of Congress the Smithsonian Institution and its various
bureaus have prepared exhibits for the Trans-Mississippi and Interna-

tional Exposition at Omaha, which opened on June 1, 1898. The sum

of $19,491.71 was allotted to the Institution out of a general appropria-
tion of $137,500 for the special exhibits of all the Executive Depart-

ments of the Government. A further allusion to this exposition will

be found in the Appendix, and a full statement will be (Tush te in

Sie REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Government of Norway invited this Government to participate
in an international fisheries exposition, to be held at the city of Bergen,
Norway, from May to September, 1898, and a resolution accepting this
invitation and authorizing the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to
arrange for a suitable exhibit was introduced into Congress. This reso-
lution contained a phrase which authorized the Commissioner to employ
the collections of the National Museum, at his discretion, for the pur-
poses of this exhibit, and while the Institution has always been willing
to aid any international exposition, a precedent might have been estab-
lished which would seriously embarrass the Museum and lead to the
temporary dismemberment of its collections. I accordingly took steps
to have the wording of the bill so changed that the Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries might, “‘ with the consent of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, use any portion of the fisheries collection in
the National Museum at said exposition,” and this was readily agreed
to by Congress, and enabled the Institution to be of service to the Fish
Commission in making a proper exhibit without establishing a precedent
dangerous to the Institution.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.

Under the act of incorporation of the American Historical Associa-
tion, approved January 4, 1889, the association reports annually to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings
and the condition of historical study in America, and the Secretary is
directed to ‘“‘communicate to Congress the whole of such reports, or
such portions thereof as he shall see fit.” Nine volumes of these
reports have so far been printed, and the report for the year 1897 is now
in press. The reports from 1889 to 1893 were not at the disposal of
the Institution, but beginning with the 1894 report a small edition has
been available, which is distributed to State historical societies and
some foreign institutions, the publications received in return being
placed with the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Congress.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Documentary history of the Institution.—In 1879 there was published
a history of the origin and progress of the Smithsonian Institution
from its establishment to the year 1877, including a full account of
legislative proceedings from the Twenty-fourth to the Forty-fourth Con-
gress wherein the Institution itself or any of its bureaus were con-
cerned. There has now been prepared a similar history of the period
from 1876 to 1896, which it is proposed to publish shortly.

Gifts and bequests—Among the collections received by the Institu-
tion during the year and deposited in the National Museum may be
mentioned a very interesting series of carbides and borides, presented
by M. Henri Moissan, the products of his investigations with the elec-
tric furnace, and a large collection of archeological objects pertaining
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

to the District of Columbia, bequeathed to the Institution by the late

Mr. W. Hallett Phillips.

An ancient bronze ewer was received as a gift from Chang Yen Hoon,
special ambassador from China to the United States.

Stereotype plates.—In the basement of the Institution building are
stored the stereotype plates of most of the Smithsonian publications.
These plates and engravers’ blocks of illustrations are cheerfully placed
at the disposal of publishers for supplementing or illustrating scientific
works privately issued. The series of Miscellaneous Collections and
Contributions to Knowledge are no longer stereotyped, but the regular
edition has been increased, and in the case of works that are likely to
be in more than ordinary demand extra copies are printed.

Smithson tablet—A duplicate of the Smithson tablet was sent to
Pembroke College, Oxford, the college from which Smithson was grad-
uated. The two tablets sent to Genoa have been set in position, one

‘of them at Smithson’s tomb and the other in the English Church.

During the last few years I have succeeded in getting some new infor-

~ mation concerning the personal history of Mr. Smithson, and I have

recently secured for the archives of the Institution a photographic
copy of his will.

Tropical botanical laboratory.—The botanists of the United States in
1897 determined to establish a botanical laboratory in the American
tropics, and a commission having been appointed to select a suitable
site, the Institution extended all possible courtesies to the commission
by presenting the plans of the project to the Department of State,
through which necessary international arrangements were made to
insure proper reception of the commission by the Governments of
Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. The commission con-
sisted of Prof. Douglas Campbell, of Leland Stanford University;
Prof. J. M. Coulton, of the University of Chicago; Prof. W. G. Farlow,
of Harvard University, and Prof. D. T. MacDougall, of the University
of Minnesota.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

~The temporary appointment of Mr. Charles D. Walcott as acting
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the
National Museum, following the death of Dr. Goode, was ratified by
the Board of Regents on January 27,1897. Mr. Walcott has continued
to act in this capacity through the fiscal year covered by this report,
and I take special pleasure in repeating my acknowledgment of the
value and efficiency of the services rendered by him. With a corre-
sponding regret I am obliged to announce that, owing to his exacting
duties as director of the United States Geological Survey, he has found
it necessary to terminate his official charge of the Museum with the
close of the fiscal year 1897-98, thus closing a relationship equally
Satisfactory on its official and on its personal side. The Museum
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

will continue to have the benefit of his association with it as honorary
curator of the division of stratigraphic paleontology.

The Regents are aware that the Secretary, with Mr. Walcott’s aid,
arranged a modification in the administration of the Museum, intended
to make it less dependent on the Secretary’s immediate oversight of
detaiis. This consisted in gathering the different departments under
- three heads and placing three scientific men, who were believed to have
shown a capacity as administrative officers, in their charge as head
curators. The arrangement has worked well, but it should be given a
longer trial before deciding that it is a suitable plan for the permanent
administration of the Museum.

Under the present method the Secretary will not be required to give
so much of his time to details of Museum administration as would
have becn demanded under the old system in the absence of a single
head, and this result he is largely able to accomplish through the aid
of the Assistant Secretary, who, without being designated to the exclu-
sive charge of the Museum, will make its oversight a portion of his
duties, in which he will be assisted by the head curators.

For the preservation and increase of the collections Congress appro-
priated $160,000 for the fiscal year now ended. From this appropria-
tion are paid all expenses incident to the preservation, exhibition, and
increase of the collections, except such as are referred to below. It
covers the compensation of the scientific and clerical staff, and of the
preparators, watchmen, and laborers; the cost of supplies required in
the conduct of the Museum, such as preservatives, stationery, and
other incidentals; the cost of transportation, the acquisition of speci-
mens, ete.

This sum still left me unable to provide for additional permanent —
curators for the care of collections now without adequate supervision,
and, for what is even a more urgent necessity, the means to pay for
proper administrative aid in carrying on the Museum’s work. Most of
the scientific assistants are required to give much of their time to the
performance of administrative duties in connection with the collections.
A large number of divisions, moreover, are dependent for their adminis-
tration entirely upon honorary officers, whose services have in the past
been cheerfully rendered; yet the fact that their primary obligations
are to other departments or bureaus of the Government has made it
impossible for them to give such attention to their work in the Museum
as the interest of the service really demanded, and has also prevented
the secretary from calling upon them in such a way as he might were
they paid officers of the Museum. Thus, while most fully recognizing
the value of the services which these gentlemen have rendered, and the
generous spirit in which they have been given, it yet does not seem
possible to permanently administer so large an interest with the assist-
ance of persons whose time can not be controlled by the chief officer
in charge.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. vad 8

I repeat, to make my meaning quite clear, that the most urgent need
of the Museum is the provision of an adequate fund for the adininis.
trative work, both in the handling of affairs and in the arranging of
collections.

The appropriation for cases and other fixtures was $30,000 and for
- heating and lighting the Museum building $14,000. The purchase of
books required for the technical library and the use of visitors in the
exhibition halls, which has up to the present time been made from the
appropriation for the preservation of collections, will hereafter be pro-
vided for specifically by a separate item, under which Congress has
allotted the sum of $2,000 for the ensuing year.

The sum of $4,000 was allowed for repairs to buildings, shops, and
sheds, and an item of $2,500 for the removal and rebuilding of the two
sheds adjacent to the south side of the Smithsonian building. The
latter, which have been a source of menace to the main building, were
torn down and reconstructed in other and more suitable locations.

The Museum. building not being provided with a basement, it has

been necessary to rent temporary quarters elsewhere for workshops and
for the storage of surplus specimens, and the furniture used for exposi-
tion purposes. These structures are not fireproof, and in the interest
of the safety of the Government property I therefore included in my
estimates for 1898-99 an item of $50,000 for the construction of a suit-
able building, 50 feet by 150 feet, and provided with a basement, which
should take the place of the various buildings and sheds already alluded
to. I suggested a site between the National Museum and the Army
Medical Museum buildings. I regret to say that this item was not
allowed, but in place thereof the amount appropriated for renting pur-
poses was increased from $2,000 (allowed for 1897-98) to $4,500 for the
year 1898-99. This will enable me to secure additional quarters for
immediate needs.
_ In 1897 and again in 1898 Congress appropriated $8,000 for erecting
galleries in the Museum building. This amount was sufficient for the
erection of seven galleries. An additional allowance of $10,000 has
also been granted by Congress for furnishing railings, painting the
galleries, connecting them with those in adjoining hall, placing a sky-
light in each court, and providing a ventilator in one of the ranges.

IT am pleased to report that the full amount asked for printing and
binding ($17,000) has been allotted, which will enable me to push for-
ward the publication of several important manuscripts, the printing of
which has long been withheld for lack of funds.

The expenditure of a sum not exceeding $5,500 from the ‘“ Preserva-
tion of collections” appropriation was authorized for the preparation
of drawings for the illustration of Museum publications.

For the purchase of the private library of the late Dr. Goode the sum
of $5,000 was appropriated by Congress. This library is a very valu-
able one, formed with rare discrimination and intelligence, and com-
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

prising the best treatises, chiefly on natural history and methods of
museum administration. It comprises 2,900 volumes, 18,000 pamphlets, -
and 1,800 portraits, autographs, and engravings.

The total number of lots of specimens received during the year was
1,441, some of these containing several hundred each. These acces-
sions include more than 450,000 objects, and I would call special atten- _
tion to this extraordinary increase, perhaps the largest during the last
fifteen years. This fact seems to establish in a marked degree the
popularity of the Museum and the general desire on the part of the.
public to aid in building up its collections. The conditions existing
during the year have been peculiarly unfavorable for making special
effort to increase the collections, and this large addition to them must
be regarded as the result of a very earnest desire of persons interested
in the Museum to assist in promoting its objects. The number of speci-
mens now recorded in all the departments of the Museum is consider-
ably more than four millions.

The Museum has continued its practice of carrying on exchanges of
Specimens with museums and individuals in foreign countries. Among
the most important ones initiated or completed during the year 1898
may be mentioned those with the Imperial Royal Natural History
Museum, of Vienna; the Paleontological Museum of the Royal Acad-
emy, Munich, Bavaria; the Natural History Society of New Brunswick,
St. John; the Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia; the Zoological
Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg; the
Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, and the
Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland.

A more detailed reference to these transactions may be found in the ~
Appendix.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Researches relating to the American Indians, conducted under the
Smithsonian Institution in accordance with the act of Congress, have
been continued by Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Bureau,
assisted by Mr. W J McGee, Mr. F’. W. Hodge, and other scientific col-
laborators, whose respective services will be found more fully detailed in
the director’s report. The field operations have been extended into a
large number of States and Territories; and also incidentally into dis-
tricts of neighboring countries occupied by tribes affiliated with the
aborigines of the region now comprised in the United States. In the
office studies have been carried on of the field material, with a view to
defining those characteristics of primitive culture affecting relations
among the tribes.

The work of exploration has been conducted in several parts of the
United States. An examination was made into the shell mounds on the
coast of Maine, resulting, in the opinion of the director, in the identi-
fication of the Mound Builders with the tribes found on that coast at
the settlement of the country. From excavations in Mexico and Arizona

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

a large collection of interesting objects were obtained and much arche-

ological and ethnological data acquired. The difficult ascent of the
summit of the Mesa Encantada, near Acoma, was accomplished, and
from relics found there the essential features of the Acoma tradition
have been substantiated. Explorations were also extended across the
frontier into Mexico, resulting in the acquirement of information tending
to throw much light on the little-known customs of the border tribes.
The objects collected during these various explorations have been
placed in the National Museum and the new information acquired has
been added to the archives of the Bureau and incorporated in memoirs
now in preparation or completed for publication.

The study and arrangement of the collections of aboriginal handi-
work obtained in Florida has been continued and progress made in the
preparation of a report on the prehistoric key dwellers on the eastern
shore of the Gulf of Mexico.

The study of decorations and researches into their symbolic uses
have been continued.

Interesting observations on the development of institutions among
the Papago and other American tribes and satisfactory progress in
the researches in linguistics, particularly in the preparation of a com-
parative vocabulary of Algonquian dialects, as well as in studies of
the Iroquoian languages, the dialects of the Mescalero and Jicarilla
Apaches, and of the Cherokee myths, have been made. Researches in
Indian sign language have been resumed. The director has continued
the development of a system of classification designed to indicate the
place of the the American Indians among the peoples of the earth.

Satisfactory progress has been made in the revision of the proofs of
the seventeenth and eighteenth annual reports and in editorial work
on the manuscript of the nineteenth annual report. The demand for
these reports in advance of their publication is great, while the supply
of those of previous years is practically exhausted.

Further details concerning the operations of the Bureau may be
found in Director Powell’s report, forming Appendix II.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

I need hardly repeat what I have already said in previous reports—
that the growth of the operations of the exchange service testifies to
its good management and general acceptability, even with the disad-
vantages under which its labors are carried on. In 1887 it sent out 71
tons of documents and had 2,165 correspondents in this country and
7,396 correspondents abroad; during the past year it transmitted 151
tons and had 6,915 correspondents at home and 22,543 abroad. ‘There
is no part of the Smithsonian Institution which more efficiently carries
out the large purpose of its founder, to diffuse knowledge among men,

and it is through this, as much as through any other branch, that its

hame is known throughout the world.
24 ‘REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Fifty years ago, when this work was first commenced, entirely at
the charge of the Institution, an arrangement was made through the
generosity of certain steamship lines by which transport could be had
gratuitously. This arrangement has been, to a great extent, necessarily
continued, and, although conditions have entirely changed, the Institu-
tion is still compelled to carry matters of international interest and
importance by slow steamers because where the service is gratuitously
given no choice can be exercised. It is a mistaken economy to think
it for the advantage of the Government, which now spends so many
thousands of dollars on this work, to yet fail to meet the vital con-
ditions of business success—reasonable dispatch— because it would
involve the expenditure of some $3,000 additional annually.

At the present time it is unhappily true that different bureaus of the
Government which have the right to make use of this method prefer to
spend more money and to send their publications at their own costand
trouble, usually through the mails, only because they can deliver them
more promptly than those who would gladly make it a special boast
that they were the promptest and most expeditious, as well as the
cheapest, of Government dispatches.

Where ocean freight is charged it is computed by the cubic foot, and
the average rate that is demanded by the fast steamers from New York
to European ports may be placed at 20 cents; but while the above esti-
mate is made upon the calculation that all shipments could be made at
the ton-measurement rate, quite two-thirds of them would measure
under a ton, and would come under the rate of what is known as
“minimum bill of lading charge,” which is never less than $5 for each
Shipment. This makes a total of about $2,000 from Washington to
various ports of debarkation throughout the world; and this, be it dis-
tinctly observed, is without ordinarily using the express either from
Washington to the port of shipment on this side or from the foreign
port of destination to the final address on the other.

It would doubtless be somewhat quicker if the express were used,
but the gain between Washington and New York in time would be less
than a day, and the cost on this part of the transit would be multiplied
nearly fourfold, so that if I look at the matter as though the interests
of an ordinary business were in question I do not feel that the expendi-
ture under these conditions for an express freight between Washington
and New York would be justified; and since it is as a business invest-
ment that I am asking Congress to consider this small appropriation, I
do not advise that it shall include the cost of the land express to be
used as an ordinary means.

It is to be understood, then, that under this estimate land transpor-
tation is still supposed to be, as a rule, by freight trains, both in this
country and in Europe. As the Institution has little to do with for-
warding exchanges from European ports to their ultimate destinations,
it is impossible to state definitely what the cost would be of improve-
ments which would bring in all desirable expedition to this part of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

“service, and it is not included here. It is, however, necessary that a
reasonable provision for the special transmission by express of belated
packages from Washington to New York and for the payment of post-
age on a certain limited number, mostly small and far remote destina-
tions, which can be forwarded more advantageously by the mail, with
some minor but needed matters, should be made, and this will add not
over $1,000, making the $3,000 estimated for.

With a view to improving the service and establishing more inti-
mate relations with the correspondents of the Institution, who have so
generously cooperated in its advancement, the chief clerk was instructed
_ to personally visit, in the autumn of 1897, the exchange agencies at
Brussels, Leipzig, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, and London. The work
accomplished was highly satisfactory, and resulted not only in making
many useful changes, but also in bringing about a closer relationship,
especially with those bureaus abroad which are conducted and sup-
ported by Government.

The exchange territory represented for many years by the agent of
the Institution at Leipzig has included not only Germany, but Austria-
Hungary and the Balkan countries as well. The constantly increasing
demands upon this agency has made it necessary to readjust its fune-
tions, and as a consequence new agents have been appointed at Vienna
and Budapest. While the necessary additional expenditure on account
of the new agencies will be considerable, the advantage to the service
will more than compensate for the increase.

The service provides for the forwarding of United States official
. publications to distributing centers abroad and for their systematic
delivery to specific addresses; for transmitting the reports and memoirs
of institutions and individuals of this country to their correspondents
in other parts of the world, and for the transmission to and delivery
in the United States of similar publications in exchange, even from
remote parts of civilization.

For defraying the expense of this service during the past year there
were available resources aggregating $25,193.53, of which amount
$19,000 were appropriated by Congress and $6,193.53 were derived
from repayments at the rate of 5 cents per pound on the exchanges of
Government bureaus and State institutions, this being a partial reim-
bursement of the expense incurred for packing, transportation, and
clerical work.

In my last report I stated that exchange relations were suspended
with Turkey, Greece, and Cuba, and I regret to say that even now the
Institution is awaiting the consummation of arrangements with the first
two countries named. An agency had been established in Havana just
prior to the blockading of that port by the United States fleet, and
it will doubtless be reestablished at an early date. Owing to restric-
tions placed upon all intercourse with Spain and her colonies during
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the recent war, no exchanges have of late been forwarded by either
country.

Comparison with the report for the year ending June 30, 1897, shows
a marked increase in the number of correspondents and the amount
of publications transmitted. The number of correspondents now aggre-
gates 29,458, and the weight of transmissions during the year exceeded
150 tons, distributed among 93 countries.

Since my last report a revised edition of the International Exchange
List has been published, containing the names of 9,414 institutions in
other countries which are in communication with institutions in the
United States through the Smithsonian Institution. The last edition
was published in 1885. Appended to this report is a map of the world
showing the distribution of the correspondents of the exchange service.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. .

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, the following appropriation
was made for the National Zoological Park by the sundry civil act
approved June 4, 1897:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwiseimproving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and transporta-
tion of animals, including salaries or compensation of all necessary
employees and general incidental expenses not otherwise provided for,
fifty-five thousand dollars; one-half of which sum shall be paid from
the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from the .
Treasury of the United States; and of the sum hereby appropriated
five thousand dollars shall be used for continuing the entrance into the
Zoological Park from Woodley lane and opening driveway into Zoolog-
ical Park, from said entrance along the bank of Rock Creek.

The sum thus appropriated was less by $10,000 than that for the
preceding fiscal year. This has necessarily occasioned some embar-
rassment in the administration, and retarded development, especially
in the construction of buildings. It will be remembered that no grant
has ever béen provided for any permanent structure for animals in the
park, other than the small ‘animal house,” so called, and the log cabin
where the elks are sheltered, so that nearly all of the animals are
after eight years still sheltered in the temporary sheds run up to
receive them at the time of the first appropriation. It had been hoped
that something would have been done this year, but it has not been
possible to erect the constructions mentioned in the last annual report
as desirable.

Through the courtesy of the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries the
park was able to secure the tanks and other apparatus used for the
exhibition of fish and aquatic animals at Atlanta, Ga. These tanks
have been temporarily installed in a shed formerly occupied as a work-
shop and constitute the nucleus of an aquarium which it is hoped may
become an attractive feature of the park. At present the exhibit com-

prises only fresh water species, but a series of tanks for sea water will
also be established. No part of the park attracts more attention or
interest than this, and I could wish that Congress would provide the
means for making a better exhibit. This is only one out of many
instances, however, of the need of buildings. The temporary sheds
already alluded to were put up at first in that form at the instance of
the Appropriation Committee, which desired to await the result of
experience before erecting permanent quarters. These sheds are rot-
ting and all but ready to fall, and some appropriation for buildings
must be made.

The births in the collection continue to be more frequent than was
anticipated. As wild animals do not ordinarily breed in captivity, this
increase is gratifying as bearing testimony to the care which has been
bestowed by their keepers to preserve them in proper conditions of
health and activity.

The roads of the park have received the usual attention during the
year. The appropriation bill provided for the continuation of the Rock
Creek drive along the creek. This work has been done, the amount
appropriated being sufficient to construct an excellent road from the
new bridge built last year to the bridge near the Quarry road entrance.
As funds become available this driveway will be continued toward the
upper end of the park. The completion of the portion of this roadway
connecting with Woodley road has been deferred for the present on
account of the probable addition of land to the area of the park in that
vicinity. A bill has been presented to Congress providing for such
addition, and the road can be much more advantageously constructed
should this increase of the park reserve be provided.

Itis hoped that the probable extension of the jurisdiction of the
United States over foreign territory may lead to increased collections
for the park. There are many animals and birds in Cuba, Porto Rico,
and the Philippines which are not represented here. It seems highly
desirable that the fauna of these regions should be more widely known,
and it is therefore intended, if funds are provided for the purpose, to
make a special exhibit of specimens collected in these countries. In
order to do this a new building especially constructed for tropical birds
is indispensable.

The collection has suffered somewhat during the year from the casu-
alties that are a necessary consequence of keeping wild animals in
confinement. The “cattle and game disease,” an epidemic disorder
that has proved very fatal in European collections, appeared suddenly
and carried off several animals. Its progress was soon arrested by
promptly disinfecting the pens, isolating the sick, and removing the
unaffected animals to other paddocks.

Several measures were introduced into Congress during the last ses-
sion which had for their object the readjustment of the boundary of
the park. Since the establishment of a permanent plan for the road-
ways of the District of Columbia it has been made evident that the
28 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

existing boundaries are not in all respects satisfactory, as they do not
always coincide with the regular highways, and therefore permit of build-
ings being placed in close proximity to the park, a condition obviously
unsuitable both for the seclusion of the animals and because of the
probability of disorderly conditions arising upon such properties.

The most notable of the efforts made to secure a better arrangement
was the bill on the subject introduced by Senator Gallinger, which was
favorably reported by the Committee on the District of Columbia of
the Senate, finally passed by the Senate on July 7, 1898, and is now
before the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds of the House
of Representatives.

The text of the bill as it passed the Senate is as follows:

S. 4191.

AN ACT To readjust the boundary of the National Zoological Park and preserve its
seclusion between Park road on the east and Cincinnati street and Connecticut
avenue on the west.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That a commission, to consist
of the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the president of the
Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Engineer
Commissioner of said board, is hereby authorized and empowered to
acquire, by purchase or condemnation, in the same manner as was
adopted for the acquirement of property already embraced in the
National. Zoological Park under the provision of the Act of March
second, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, the tract of land lying south
of the National Zoological Park owned by the Union Benevolent Asso-
ciation of the District of Columbia (colored) and now occupied as a
cemetery, and.such parcels of ground adjoining the said park and
between its present boundaries ‘and Connecticut avenue extended on
the west and the nearest road shown on the recorded highway exten-
sion plans of the first section on the east and south (inclusive of such .
road in case the same is not yet dedicated to public use) as they shall
deem necessary for preserving its safety and perpetuating its seclusion;
these properties, along with Joliet street, already purchased, to be made a
part of the said park, for which purpose the sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars is hereby appropriated, to be paid half out of the District funds
and half out of the United States funds. The Union Benevolent Asso-
ciation of the District of Columbia (colored) is hereby authorized to
sell and convey any portion or all of the tract of land owned by them
on the southern side of the Zoological Park now occupied as a cemetery.

It would seem that the passage of this bill is very desirable, and I
take occasion to refer in this connection to the letter which I quoted
from an eminent landscape artist, Mr. Olmsted, in my report for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The work of the past year has been successful beyond expectation,
and, as is stated in the report of the Aid acting in charge, it has
resulted in the discovery and determination of position of over 500
new absorption lines, so that we have now over 700 new lines of well-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. s 29

determined positions, and we may be said now to know, by the aid of
the bolometer and the labors of the observatory, more lines in this
invisible spectrum than were known in the visible one up to the great
research of Kirchoff and Bunsen, which opened the era of modern
spectrum analysis. Moreover, these lines, the exactness of whose
determination has now reached a surprising degree of perfection
through the recent improvements in the delicacy as well as the pre-
cision of both bolometer and galvanometer, and through other improve-
ments in the apparatus (improvements due principally to the present
Aid acting in charge), depend not only on the instruments, but on the
labors of those who have used them, the comparator measurements
alone having included, as stated in the body of the report, about 44,000
separate observations.

A great deal of other work has been done at the observatory, but
nothing which in importance and present and prospective interest com.
pares with this main research in the infra-red spectrum, which is now
known throughout nearly the whole of the invisible portion of the solar
energy, and extends through a range of wave lengths considerably over
twelve times that known to Sir Isaac Newton, the present exact knowl-
edge of this region being due not exclusively, but it may properly be
said principally, to the labors of this observatory.

I call attention in this connection to the interesting remarks made in
the report to the effect that very marked changes of absorption have
been observed at various parts of the infra-red spectrum. In one part
of the invisible region a decrease in absorption, amounting to nearly
half the total, took place in February, and this abnormal state con-
tinued until May, when the usual condition gradually returned. As
this change is found to occur yearly at about the same period, the
idea presents itself that the growth of vegetation, so rapid in these
months, may abstract from the air large quantities of vapor active in
absorption at this point in the spectrum, but this interesting possibility
has not yet, it will be understood, been fully verified.

In this, however, and other discoveries of a similar nature we have
the earnest of the fulfillment of long cherished hopes, already alluded
to by me, for the ultimate benefit of these researches, not only to science,
but to concerns of practical moment and even of national utility.

NECROLOGY.

Gardiner Greene Hubbard was born in Boston August 25, 1822, and
died in Washington on December 11, 1897. After preparation in the
Boston schools he entered Dartmouth College, being graduated bache-
lor of arts in 1841. He studied law in Cambridge, and was admitted
to the bar of Boston, where he practiced his profession for twenty
years, and later at the national capital.

His first interest in educational and scientific matters appears to
have been connected with the improved education of the deaf, and he

was the founder, in 1846, of the first school established in the United
_ States for teaching the deaf to speak. He was for ten years a member
of the State board of education of Massachusetts, and served as a
commissioner for that State to the Centennial Exhibition at Philadel-
phia in 1876. He was also connected with the department of awards
of the Atlanta Exposition, 1595, and the Nashville Exposition, 1897.
In'1876 he was appointed by President Grant chairman of a special
commission to investigate the question of railway mail transportation.
He was a doctor of laws of his-own college (Dartmouth), and of Colum-
bian University, at Washington, of which he was also a trustee.
During the last ten years of his life he evinced a very great interest
in the scientific work at the national capital. He was president of the
National Geographic Society, and labored unceasingly for the advance-
ment and popularization of its work. He was president of the Joint
Commission of the Scientific Societies of Washington, and was con-
nected with a number of the hereditary and patriotic organizations.
He was elected a regent February 27, 1895, and was made a member
of the executive committee, and gave much time and thought to all
his duties as regent. The Board of Regents unanimously adopted the
following minute by a rising vote in recognition of his services to the
Institution :

Whereas the Hon. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a citizen regent and
a member of the executive committee of the Smithsonian Institution,
died at his residence in this city on the 11th day of December, 1897,

Resolved, That the Regents of the Institution place upon their
records this testimonial of their respect and admiration for Mr. Hub-
bard as a singularly public-spirited citizen, an ever-generous promoter
of education, and active patron of scientific work; and this expression
of their sincere regret for the loss of a colleague and friend, whose life
was adorned by so many personal virtues, and whose association with
them has left so many endearing memories.

Resolved, That a copy of this minute be engrossed and transmitted
to the family of Mr. Hubbard.

Miss Fannie R. Schaeffer, for more than twenty years an Sue
clerk in the Institution, died September 18, 1897.

Respectfully annie

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the report of the National Museum for the year
ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Museum;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by

_ the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4, The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes,

I have the honor to report that the fixed property of the National Museum cou-
sists (in addition to its building, heating plant, and other equipments) of collections,
cases and other receptacles, office furniture, and books.

The collections include objects in every branch of natural history, geology, and
anthropology, and comprise more than 4,000,000 specimens.

The cases in the exhibition halls number about 2,000. Besides these, 130 cases
contain exhibits at the Omaha Exposition, and 1,300 are in use in the workrooms and
storage quarters.

The office furniture comprises about 900 pieces, such as tables, desks, chairs, file-
cases, typewriters, and book-cases, besides minor articles. The Museum also owns
485 lecture-room chairs of an inferior quality that should be replaced at an early day.

The library contains about 11,000 volumes and about 7,500 pamphlets.

During the fiscal year covered by this statement the Museum acquired more than
450,000 specimens and 441 books, 797 pamphlets, and 4,929 parts of periodicals, and
added to its permanent stock cases and other furniture and fixtures to the amount
of $30,000, of which $15,000 was used for furnishing the new galleries provided by
Congress.

During the year the sheds adjoining the Smithsonian building on the south side
were torn down and reconstructed at a safe distance from the building. The work
cost in round numbers, $2,000.

The galleries provided by Congress for the Museum building were erected during
the year. These were three in number, and cost $8,000, the amount appropriated.

The losses of property during the year were of trifling extent, and were only such
as naturally occur where very large numbers of receptacles, as cases, boxes, trays,
bottles, etc., are in use. It should be remarked in this connection that all cases
and other furniture and the like when worn out and no longer of use to the Museum,
are regularly condemned and sold at auction, and the proceeds turned into the
Treasury, as required by law.

In the following condensed statement the more important facts connected with
the work of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, are
presented :

The Museum staff.—A general reorganization of the scientific departments of the
Museum went into effect July 1, 1897. Under this plan Mr. W. H. Holmes was made
head curator of the newly organized department of anthropology, Dr. F. W. True

31
Sys REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

head curator of the department of biology, and Dr. G. P. Merrill head curator of
the department of geology.

Mr. W. H. Ashmead was appointed assistant curator of the division of insects
on July 1, 1897. On November 12 Dr. W. L. Ralph was appointed honorary custo-
dian of the section of birds’ eggs, and Dr. H. G. Dyar was made honorary custodian of
the section of lepidoptera. Mr. W. T. Swingle was appointed honorary custodian
of the section of alge, and Dr. D. G. Fairchild was appointed to a similar position
in the section of lower fungi. Both of these appointments took effect December 7.

Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., was given a temporary appointment as assistant curator
of the division of mammals on February 15, 1898. On April 30, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
was appointed a collaborator in the division of ethnology.

Accessions.—The accessions of the year number 1,442. While this record shows a
slight falling off when compared with that for the preceding year, it should he noted
that many of the accessions embraced a large quantity of material, so that the total
number of specimens acquired represents a very large increase over the acquisitions
of recent years. Altogether, more than 450,000 specimens, as already stated, were
added to the collections, raising the grand total on June 30, 1898, to above 4,000,000.

In calling your attention to the accessions of greatest importance, I will divide
my remarks under the three headings, anthropology, biology, and geology—these
being the designations of the three scientific departments of the Museum (under
which all divisions and sections are embraced) in accordance with the revised
scheme of classification now in effect.

Anthropology.—Considering first the department of anthropology, attention is
called to a large collection of antiquities and ethnological material, embracing more
than 12,000 specimens, bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution by the late W.
Hallett Phillips, by whom the material was largely collected. The specimens are
accompanied by notes prepared by Mr. Phillips, and the collection, as a whole, is of
exceptional value. It consists mainly of stone implements from the Potomac region,
but includes also 106 ethnological specimens from Polynesia. From the Bureau of
American Ethnology has been received a valuable series of ancient stone and earth-
enware utensils from graves and mounds in Arkansas, and a collection of antiquities
from the mounds of the Etowah group of Georgia. The last-named collection,
together with the material previously received from the same locality, constitutes
an exceedingly valuable assemblage of archeological material. Through the cour-
tesy of Surg. Gen. G. M. Sternberg, a series of over 2,000 human crania, mainly of
the Indian tribes of North America, has been transferred to the National Museum
from the Army Medical Museum. Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Ga., deposited
an extensive series of stone implements from various parts of Georgia, and M. Emile
Granier, Paris, France, deposited a collection of ethnological material from the
Indian tribes of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain region. Other loan col-
lections worthy of note are a series of personal mementos of the late Gen. W. S.
Hancock, deposited by G. R. Hancock, of the West Point Military Academy, a num-
ber of Jewish religious ceremonial objects, deposited by Mr. H. E. Benguiat, San
Francisco, Cal., and a valuable collection of Japanese porcelains from Miss E. R.
Scidmore. ji

Prof. Alexander Graham Bell deposited a large number of pieces of apparatus
made and used by himself in his experiments and researches, including a series
illustrating the invention and development of the Bell telephone. The General
Electric Company deposited several dynamos and other pieces of apparatus of great
historical value. The Coe Brass Manufacturing Company, of Ansonia, Conn., pre-
sented ten dynamos made between the years 1873 and 1879 by William Wallace.
Some of these machines were in practical operation during the Centennial Exhibi-
tion at Philadelphia. An electric generator made in 1867 by Mr. Charles A. Seeley
and an electric motor devised in 1834 by Thomas Davenport were received on deposit
from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Altogether, the pieces of elec-
trical apparatus received represent nearly the entire range of American invention,

forming the basis of the practical methods of electric arc and incandescent lighting.
Duplicates of few, if any, of these machines exist.

- Biology.—Among the additions to the collections in the department of pioloey the
largest and one of the most important is a collection of about 200,000 specimens of
Coleoptera, presented by Messrs. H. G. Hubbard and E. A. Schwarz, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. The addition of this material places the collection of insects
in the National Museum ahead of all others as regards North American Coleoptera.
Dr. W. L. Abbott has presented during the year large collections of birds, mammals,
reptiles, and insects from Lower Siam and Kashmir. The material which Dr. Abbott
has collected and donated to the National Museum during a period of several years
past now constitutes the most valuable portion of the Old World collections in its
custody. Valuable specimens of birds’ eggs have been received from Dr, W. L.
Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., another generous contributor to the national collections.
Prof. Dean C. Nionccetor, of Ann Arbor, Mich., presented 600 bird skins, 900 eggs,
and 250 nests, all from the Philippine Islands. Large additions to the collection of
fresh-water mussels have been made through the cooperation of Dr. L. T. Chamber-
lain, of New York City. A collection of more than 86,000 specimens of land and
fresh-water shells was presented by Dr. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Mass., presented an interesting series of bird skins from
Santa Marta, Colombia. Valuable accessions from the United States Fish Commis-
sion, the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, and other Government
bureaus, have been received. A collection of invertebrates obtained by the natu-
ralists of the steamer Albatross in 1896 from the coasts of California, Japan, Kam-
chatka, and in the Bering Sea, and a quantity of material, comprising more than
600 lots, collected by the assistants of the Commission during the past thirteen
years, deserve special notice. A number of valuable types and cotypes of fishes
have also been transmitted by the commission. A large lot of land shells collected
by the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, was received during the
year. This collection is regarded as the most intrinsically valuable acquisition of
the year in the division of mollusks, comprising as it does an unusual number of
undescribed species and others not before represented in the collection. A series
of about 240 specimens of rodents from Patagonia was obtained by purchase.

Geology.—The department of geology has been enriched by the addition of a con-
siderable quantity of important and interesting material. Through the bequest of
the late I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, a valuable collection, consisting of more
than 20,000 specimens of fossils, has been received. This is one of the finest collec-
tions of fossils of the Cincinnati group in existence. It is particularly rich in
starfishes, crinoids, and trilobites. Mr. R. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pa., has added to his
previous magnificent contributions by the donation of his collection of fossil insects,
comprising over 4,600 specimens, of which more than 200 are types. Six hundred
specimens of Kinderhook crinoids, corals, and mollusca were received from the
United States Geological Survey. A large amount of vertebrate paleontological
material, collected under the direction of Prof. 0. C. Marsh during his connection
with the United States Geological Survey, has been turned over to the Museum
during the year. A valuable collection of Mosasaurs from the Cretaceous of western
Kansas, two collections of Elasmobranch teeth and spines from the Carboniferous of
Iowa, and an unusually fine skull and some bones of Claosaurus were obtained by
Bee risc.

Specimens of many new minerals were received during the year and added to the
collections. The division of physical and chemical geology has been enriched by
the acquisition of a large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, Prussia, some
large masses of beautiful orbicular granite from Sweden, fulgurites on Andesite
from Little Ararat in Armenia, and a large amount of petrographic material from

_the United States Geological Survey and other sources. The head curator of the

department of geology collected some beautiful, clear masses of rock salt at Heil-

sm 98 3

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bronn, Prussia. Specimens of kaolin and clays from Germany and an excellent
series of telluride ores from Cripple Creek, Colo., have also been received.

Foreign exchanges.—A few of the more important exchanges with foreign establish-
ments and individuals are here referred to: From the Imperial Royal Natural History
Museum, Vienna, Austria, 66 specimens of Tertiary corals were received in exchange
for Lower Cretaceous fossils. The Paleontological Museum of the Royal Academy,

-Munich, Bavaria, received from the United States National Museum 16 specimens of
Cambrian fossils in exchange for material sent some time ago. Thirty-three speci-
mens of fossil plants, representing 20 species, were received from the Natural History
Society of New Brunswick, St. John, and 90 specimens of fossil plants have been
sent inreturn. The Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia, has received 170 bird skins
from the National Museum, in continuation of exchanges. Land shells from Trans-
caspia and the Caucasus and marine shells from the coast of Russia have been
received from the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St.
Petersburg, in exchange for about 2,000 specimens of shells from the National
Museum. Mons. M. Cossman, Paris, France, sent a collection of shells in exchange
for publications. Sixty-two specimens of Actinians have been transmitted to the
Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, in exchange for material yet
to be received. Crustaceans have been sent to the Museum of Natural History,
Geneva, Switzerland, in return for specimens already received and in continuation
of further exchanges.

Distribution of specimens.—There were sent out as gifts or in exchange during the
year about 32,000 specimens, a considerable increase compared with the number for
the preceding year. About one-half of the distributions consisted of marine inverte-
brates, a large number of these specimens having been prepared and transmitted to
schools and colleges throughout the country. Nearly 7,500 specimens were lent to
specialists for study.

Specimens received for determination.—There has been a decrease in the number
of specimens received for determination, the total having been 576 lots, or 140 lots
less than for the preceding year. Since very little material of value is acquired
in this way, this decrease is not to be regretted, although the work of identification
is not unwillingly undertaken, since it has long been the policy of the Museum to
render such assistance to collectors and others as may be practicable.

Explorations.—Material of great scientific value has been received as the result of
explorations conducted by the Bureau of American Ethnology. About 1,300 speci-
mens of pottery and other relics from Arizona have been added to the collections
through the efforts of Dr. J. Walker Fewkes, who has been particularly successful
in his archeological explorations in the southwest during the past few years. A
number of unique ethnological specimens from Patagonia were received from Mr.
J. B. Hatcher. Explorations undertaken by Mr. Gerard Fowke, of the Bureau of
Ethnology, in Brown County, Ohio, yielded a small collection of Mound Builders’
relics.

Mr. R. P. Currie, of the National Museum, visited Liberia with Prof. O. F..Cook,
for the purpose of collecting natural history material, and succeeded in gathering a
large number of insects, spiders, and myriapods. Valuable specimens of mammals,
birds, and reptiles were also secured, A number of rare birds from the vicinity of
Lake Okechobee, Florida, were collected by Mr. Robert Ridgway. Interesting
specimens of fishes and mollusks were obtained by Mr. Charles Schuchert near Disko
Island, Greenland. Some very rare insects from the Commander Islands were secured
by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger while serving as a member of the Fur-seal Investigation
Commission. Mr. J. N. Rose visited Mexico during the summer of 1897, and spent
about four months in making collections of botanical material. A large number of
valuable specimens were obtained, including representations of more than 100 species
new to science.

A large number of plants from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of northern
Greenland were obtained by Messrs. David White and Charles Schuchert. Mr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

Schuchert also made collecting trips to Missouri and northern New York. Dr. George

P. Merrill brought home some interesting geological material collected during his
visit to Russia in 1897.

Visitors.—During the year 177,254 persons visited the Museum building and 99,273
were admitted to the Smithsonian building, making a total of 276,527.

Publications.—The Annual Report of the National Museum for 1895 has been pub-
lished, the Report for 1896 was nearly all in type at the close of the fiscal year, and
the proof reading of the administrative portion of the volume for 1897 has been fin-
ished. The papers in the appendix of the volume for 1895 have been issued in separate
form. The nineteenth volume of Proceedings appeared during the year, and papers
1124 to 1139, inclusive, constituting Volume XX, have beon distributed. Part L
of Bulletin 39, containing instructions for the collection of scale insects, by Prof.
T. D. A. Cockerell, and Circular 48, relating to the collection and preservation of
the bones and teeth of the mastodon and mammoth, have been printed.

By your direction 5,800 copies of the Report of the National Museum are now dis-
tributed direct from the Museum, out of a total of 7,000 copies allotted by Congress
to the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum.

Tennessee Centennial Exposition.—As stated in the last Annual Report, the Museum
participated in the exposition held at Nashville from May 1 to October 31, 1897, for
the purpose of celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the admission of the
State of Tennessee into the Union. Highteen of the divisions and sections of the
Museum prepared exhibits for this occasion. A description of these exhibits will be
given in detail in the full report of the National Museum for the present year.

Trans-Mississippi and International Hxposition.—An exhibit was prepared by the
Museum for the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition which opened at
Cmaha on June 1, 1898. For this exposition Congress appropriated $62,500 for the
erection of Government buildings and $137,500 for the exhibits of the various Execu-
tive Departments and Bureaus. Of the latter amount the sum of $19,491.71 was
allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and its dependencies. Dr. F. W. True repre-
sents the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on the Government
board of management, and Mr. W. V. Cox acts as special agent in charge of the
exhibit. The report for the coming fiscal year will contain a complete description
of the collections which have been sent to Omaha by the Museum.

It was with no little regret that I advised you of the necessity of my relinquishing
the charge of the National Museum at the close of the present fiscal year. The tem-
porary appointment which you tendered me early in 1897 was accepted with mingled
feelings of satisfaction and hesitation. My admiration for the late Dr. Goode and
my long and pleasant acquaintance with him and his associates rendered the diffi-
cult task lighter than I anticipated, and now, in resigning the charge of the Museum—
although I gladly retain the honorary curatorship of the collections in stratigraphic
paleontology—I desire to express my sense of indebtedness for the honor which you
have conferred upon me and my wish for the ever-increasing prosperity of the
National Museum.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

S1tr: I have the honor to submit the report of the Bureau of Bihnoleea for the
year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments :—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Bureau;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes—

I have the honor to say that the property of the Bureau is, with the exception of
one or two items, small in amount and value. By far the most important and valu-
able property in the custody of the Bureau is the collection of manuscript records,
representing a considerable part of the work of the collaborators and the contribu-
tions of correspondents during the last twenty years, as well as the collection
originally acquired from the Smithsonian Institution. The greater part of the manu-
scripts are linguistic, and these are not in condition for publication, though invalu-
able for purposes of study and comparison. The entire collection, embracing more
than 2,000 titles, is catalogued and arranged in fireproof vaults in the offices of the
Bureau. A strict custody is maintained, under the immediate supervision of the
Director.

A related class of property comprises photographs of Indian subjects. So far as
practicable, these are represented by the original negatives with a systematic series
of prints. The collection comprises about 5,000 negatives, with about 3,000 prints,
including 800 prints from negatives which are not in the possession of the Bureau.
The collection is in constant use in connection with the preparation of illustrations
for the reports; its custody is vested in the illustrator of the Bureau.

Among the minor items the most important is the library of 7,900 volumes and
over 5,000 pamphlets, with plain wooden cases sufficient to accommodate them. The
greater part of the library represents the product of exchange, and in addition
there is a fair collection of books of reference and standard works on ethnologic
subjects obtained by purchase. The library is in immediate charge of Mr. F. W.
Hodge.

A class of property of some importance is the accumulated residue of publications.
The greater part of the edition of the reports available for distribution by the
Bureau is sent to exchanges and correspondents immediately on issue, but a limited
number of copies of each edition remains for distribution in accordance with subse-
quent demands. The residue of the several editions not completely exhausted is kept
under the supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. The editions of most of the reports are -
exhausted; the undistributed residue numbers about 4,300 volumes.

A somewhat important class of property, though of limited value, is office furni-
ture, with the requisite stationery for current use, as well as photographic apparatus
and material. The aggregate value of the furniture and apparatus is less than
aes The custody and use of furniture, apparatus, stationery, and other materials
o_o

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. one

“are regulated by a custodial system devised for the purpose, which has been found to

work satisfactorily.

A considerable number of original engravings used for the illustration of reports
are catalogued and arranged in cases in the office of the Bureau, while the original
copy for illustrations is also preserved, so far as practicable, in charge of the illus-
trator. The stereotyped plates from which the reports are printed are from time to
time turned over to the Bureau by the Public Printer. These are stored partly in
the Smithsonian building, partly in the basement of the building in which the office
is located.

Experience has shown that, under existing conditions, it is inexpedient to acquire
field property in any considerable amount, since the cost of purchase and mainte-
nance of animals, vehicles, and camp equipage exceeds the charges for hire; accord-
ingly, there is practically no field property in the possession of the Bureau.

The collaborators engaged in field operations collect ethnological material, in
greater or less quantities, for purposes of study. All such material is transferred
to the National Museum, and commonly the requisite studies are conducted within
that building.

During the last fiscal year satisfactory progress was made in enriching the manu-
script collections, the series of photographs, and the collections of material objects
for the Museum, as indicated in other paragraphs. The aggregate expenditures for
stationery and laboratory supplies were $1,900; for furniture, $750, and for the pur-
chase of necessary books of reference and standard works, $850.

The Bureau is domiciled in rented quarters, i. e., the sixth floor of the Adams
Building, 1333-1335 F street, Washington. These quarters are limited, hardly meet-
ing the requirements of the work. During the winter, when office work is in active
progress, it is sometimes necessary for as many as two or three collaborators to work
in private quarters, while some of the permanent property (stereotype plates, etc.)
of the Bureau is stored in the Smithsonian and National Museum buildings, and the
publications are stored in and distributed from the basement of the building occu-
pied by the United States Geological Survey, through the courtesy of the Director,
Hon. Charles D. Walcott.

Ethnologic researches have been conducted during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, in accordance with the act of Congress making provision “for continuing
researches relating to the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution,” approved June 4, 1897.

The work has been carried forward in accordance with a plan of operations sub-
mitted on June 14, 1897. The field operations of the Director and the collaborators
have extended into Arizona, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Indian Territory, Maine, New
Brunswick, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Ontario, and Texas, while special
agents have conducted operations in Alaska, Argentina, British Columbia, Califor-
nia, Chile, Greenland, Oregon, and Washington State. The office work has included
the collection of material from Indian tribes in Arizona, Idaho, Indian Territory,
Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New York, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas. The researches in the office have dealt
with material from nearly all of the States and from other portions of the American
continent.

The organization of the work has grown out of a classification of ethnic science
based on the researches of the Bureau. It is worthy of note that, while the science
of man has advanced rapidly during the last twenty years through the efforts of
able investigators in different countries, the advance has been particularly rapid in
the United States. No small part of this advance must be ascribed to the farsighted
governmental policy of maintaining researches among the aboriginal tribes of the
American continents, yet a part of the progress would seem to be due to the wide
range in ethnic phenomena with which American students are favored. The inves-
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tigator in this country may easily come in contact with representatives of every
-race—of every important strain of blood. At the same time he may study every
important grade in culture, from the savagery of some of the Indian tribes, through
the barbarism of others, up to the civilization and enlightenment represented by
the better part of our population. One of the consequences of this favorable con-
dition for study has been the stimulation of observation and the encouragement of
strictly scientific methods of research. Another result is found in the amassing of
trustworthy data in unequaled amount for comparative study. The general result
is expressed in extension and refinement of ethnic science, and to some extent in the
application of ethnology to practical affairs.

The systemization of the science which results from a consideration of its subject-
matter as exhibited in the operations of the Bureau was set forth somewhat fully in
the last report, and it is followed in the present report. The science for which the
Bureau was organized under the act of Congress treats but slightly of the somatic
characteristics of the native tribes of America. Its researches extend rather over
those characteristics exhibited by men in the tribal state as they are portrayed in
cultural elements. These elements of character arise in the methods pursued by
the tribesmen for the purpose of securing pleasure, welfare, justice, expression, and
opinion. The pursuits involve activities which are esthetic, industrial, govern-
mental, linguistic, and educational, and these give rise to the sciences of esthetology,
technology, sociology, philology, and sophiology.

FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Director was engaged in an examination
of certain shell mounds on the coast of Maine reconnoitered during the preceding
season. Limited collections were made, but the associations were noted with care
and compared with those characteristic of the Indians still living in the vicinity.
The work resulted in the complete identification of the mound builders with the
tribes found on the same coast by white men early in the settlement of this country.

During July Mr. F. W. Hodge repaired to Arizona, joining Dr. Fewkes during the
excavation of the ruins near Snowflake, south of Holbrook, and later accompanying
him to Tusayan for the purpose of gaining further insight into the summer ceremo-
nies of the Hopi Indians and additional knowledge of the ruins of their former
villages. Leaving Dr. Fewkes and his party late in August, he visited the remark-
able, but little-known, ruins on the mesas surrounding Cebollita Valley, about 35
miles south of Grant, N. Mex., making photographs of noteworthy features and
ground plans of some of the more interesting structures. After spending several
days in this work Mr. Hodge visited the pueblos of Laguna and Acoma, witnessing,
at the latter village, the interesting Fiesta de San Estevan, and, on September 3,
proceeded with his party to the widely known Mesa Encantada, some 3 miles from
Acoma, the traditional home of these Indians during prehistoric times. The pre-
cipitous height was climbed, the night was spent on the summit, and after carefully
examining its entire surface Mr. Hodge was successful in finding ample traces of
Indian occupancy at aremote period. He also found traces of an ancient pathway
leading toward the summit, and quantities of prehistoric ware in the talus, to
which it had evidently been washed from the summit of the mesa; accordingly he
was able to substantiate the essential features of an Acoma tradition.

The beginning of the year found Dr. J. Walter Fewkes occupied in collecting
aboriginal material from a prehistoric ruin known as Kintiel, or Pueblo Grande,
located on an upper wash of the Colorado Chiquito, between Navaho station and
Ganado, in eastern central Arizona. Situated midway between the Tusayan and
Zuni groups of pueblos, the origin of this ruin has for a number of years been
a problem to investigators in this field; but the researches of Dr. Fewkes show
quite conclusively that the art remains unearthed resemble more closely those of
Halona, Heshotauthla, and other ancient Zuni villages tham those of the prehistoric
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

pueblos of Tusayan. Excavations were conducted in the cemeteries, as well as in

the ruin of the village, in each of which an interesting collection of pottery and
bone and stove implements was unearthed.

Fully satisfied with the results at this point, Dr. Fewkes returned to the rail-
road, and from Holbrook proceeded to the vicinity of Pinedale, near the northern bor-
der of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, where another interesting collection
of objects was made. Although the ruins from which they were recovered are more
remote from the present Tusayan villages than are those of Kintiel, they are more
closely similar in form and in symbolic decoration to ancient Tusayan art products
than are the specimens obtained from the latter place.

Excavations were next conducted in an interesting ruin about 4 miles west of
Snowflake, which, like those of Pinedale, were hitherto unknown to archeologists.
Researches at this point extended over a period of a fortnight, being conducted both
in the house ruins and in the cemeteries northward and southwestward thereof. An
unusually large collection of fictile ware, as well as a very interesting but smaller
collection of bone, stone, and shell objects, were here recovered. By the middle of

_August Dr. Fewkes returned with his party to Holbrook, and proceeded thence to

the Tusayan villages, where he made observations supplementary to those conducted
in previous years in connection with the Snake Dance and related ceremonies.

During September Dr. Fewkes visited that part of the upper Gila Valley called
Pueblo Viejo, and examined the exterior ruins in that region discovered and described
by Emory and Johnston in 1846. He conducted archeological work in mounds near
Solomonville and San Jose de Pueblo Viejo, and collected several hundred objects
from these localities. These ruins were found to bear close architectural resemblance
to those near Phenix and Tempe, and to indicate adobe houses with walls supported
by logs and stones, clustered about a central building which served for protection or
for ceremonial purposes. Pottery and other objects from these ruins were found to
be identical with those from near Casa Grande. It was discovered that the ancient
people of this valley sometimes buried their dead in their houses, but that the larger
number were cremated. The calcined houses and ashes of the latter were placed in
decorated jars and buried in pyral mounds. Remains of extensive prehistoric irri-
gating ditches, reservoirs, and terraced gardens show that the valley was extensively
farmed in ancient times, and the large number of ruined houses indicate an extensive
population. An instructive collection of pottery, beads, shells, and sacrificial objects
was obtained from a cave in the mountains north of Pueblo Viejo.

During a part of his field season Dr. Fewkes had the aid of Mr. F. W. Hodge, and
during the entire summer the assistance of Dr. Walter Hough, of the United States
National Museum. The researches of Dr. Fewkes conducted during this summer
were remarkably successful both in the extent and value of the collections acquired
and in the archeologic and ethnologic data recorded.

Toward the end of September Mr. James Mooney took the field in New Mexico,
Texas, and contiguous Mexican States for the purpose of collecting, among various

. tribes, information additional to that obtained among the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache

of Oklahoma concerning the primitive rites in which peyote, more popularly known
as “‘mescal,” is used as a narcotic and stimulant. Incidentally to this work, Mr.
Mooney made a brief visit to a series of interesting pueblo ruins, attributed to the
neighboring Tewa Indians, on a mesa 12 miles westward from Espanola, above
Santa Fé, on the Rio Grande, in New Mexico. These remains are of considerable
local repute, bnt thus far they have not been seriously excavated.

_ The Jicarilla Apache, numbering 850 on a reservation in northern New Mexico,
were the next object of Mr. Mooney’s attention. This tribe formerly roamed over
the section eastward of the mountains of New Mexico, on the head waters of Arkansas
and Canadian rivers, but affiliated with the Ute rather than with the plains tribes.

It was found that they knew of the peyote only through temporary association with

the Mescalero a few years ago when the two tribes were for a time on one reserva-
tion. The Mescalero Apache, numbering 450 on a reservation in southeastern New
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

' Mexico, were next visited. These Indians, whose popular name is derived from
their use of the ‘‘mescal” or peyote, are regarded by the plains tribes as masters
in all that concerns the plant, but from information received through their best
informants, as well as from actually witnessing the ceremony, Mr. Mooney found
the rite to be declining among them, largely through the difficulty of procuring the
plant in their isolated condition, as it requires five days’ journey on horseback to
obtain anecessary supply. Living with the Mescalero, Mr. Mooney discovered a num-
ber of Lipan and a few Kiowa-Apache Indians. ‘The Lipan were a predatory tribe of
eastern Texas and were practically exterminated some thirty years ago on account
of their raiding propensities against both Texas and Mexico. Ofthe remnant a few
are incorporated with the Tonkawa, a few joined the Mescalero and Kiowa-Apache,
while others, probably the larger number, fled to the Santa Rosa Mountains, in
northern Mexico, where they still live. Mr. Mooney obtained through the Lipan
further information in regard to several Texan tribes, including the Karankawa
and Tonkawa, of whom little has been known, and from them also definite infor-
mation was obtained in regard to the use of peyote among the Tarahumari of Mexico.

Having completed his investigations among the tribes of New Mexico in the early
part of December, Mr. Mooney devoted attention to the remnants of the Piro, Tiwa,
Suma, and Manso tribes on the Rio Grande, below El Paso, in Texas and Chihuahua.
These Indians, now practically Mexicanized, are the descendants of a large number
of natives who were taken by Governor Otermin on his retreat from Santa Fé to El
Paso and settled at their present location during the Pueblo rebellion in 1680. He
obtained valuable information in regard tothe former status of these people, and
conducted also some linguistic researches to which reference will later be made.

Mr. Mooney next proceeded to the mountain country of Texas, southeastward
from E] Paso, for the purpose of locating the peyote from information given by the
Mescaleros. ‘Two or more varieties of the plant were found in this section, on both
sides of the Rio Grande. In January Mr. Mooney continued southward to the Tara-
humari country in quest of additional information concerring the rites and customs
of that tribe of which peyote forms the feature. The Tarahumari is one of the most
populous tribes in North America, their number being variously estimated at from
50,000 to 80,000; they occupy nearly the whole mountain region of the State of Chi-
huahua. They perform a number of interesting ceremonies in which the peyote
plays an important role; indeed, the plant is a prominent part of the medicine
man’s stock in trade, rather than something used by the tribe at large, as among the
Kiowa and associated tribes to the northward. Several varieties of the peyote are
recognized by the Tarahumari, who procure the plant chiefly about Santa Rosalia,
in southeastern Chihuahua. Information concerning the ceremonial use of the
peyote by the neighboring Tepehuan tribes was likewise gained, and the-southern-
most limit of its use in Mexico was also determined.

Aside from his researches in this interesting subject, Mr. Mooney made an exami-
nation of some large burial caves near Aguas Calientes, about 200 miles southwest-
ward from Chihuahua city. Although the principal one of these caves had been
excavated by residents in the hope of finding buried treasure, and their contents
thereby disturbed, Mr. Mooney succeeded in recovering a well-preserved mummy
with its original wrappings of matting and native cloth and the accompanying food
and water vessels, which have been deposited in the National Museum. These and
kindred observations throw much light on the little-known mortuary customs of the
region.

During August and September Dr. Albert S. Gatschet was occupied in linguistic
researches begun during the preceding year among the Algonquian tribes in Maine
and contiguous parts of New Brunswick. His work resulted in the enrichment of
his vocabularies and in the preparation of numerous texts, valuable not only as
indices of linguistic structure, but as records of tribal history, customs, social
organization, and beliefs.

Mr. J.N. B. Hewitt spent the autumn in the field in northern New York and neigh-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

boring parts of Ontario, collecting linguistic and sociologic data required for the
full comparative study of the Iroquoian tribes. He was also able to obtain new and
valuable additions to the series of creation myths for which these Indians are nota-
ble, and through which their names have become entensively incorporated in the
literature of the world.

On November 4, 1897, Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of Princeton University, who was about
to sail for Argentina, was specially commissioned to make collections among the
Indian tribes of South America; and toward the end of the fiscal year he sent his
first shipment of material, representing the natives of Patagonia, whose character-
istics have attracted attention for centuries.

On January 11, 1898, Mr. Gerard Fowke was employed temporarily to make archzo-
logical surveys and excavations in an interesting locality in Kentucky. These exca-
vations were particularly successful, yielding a considerable quantity of valuable
archeologic material, which has been placed in the National Museum.

Shortly before the opening of the fiscal year Dr. Robert Stein, attached to Lieut.
R. E. Peary’s Arctic expedition for the purpose of exploring a little-known stretch
of the coast of western Greenland, was commissioned to make archcological
researches and collections. He was landed on August 10, 1897, and remained until
September 1, when he was taken up by Lieutenant Peary on his return trip. During
Dr. Stein’s stay on a part of the coast not now inhabited, he discovered abundant
traces of ancient habitation by the Eskimo, and collected a quantity of somatologic
and other material.

The objective material collected during these explorations has been placed in the
National Museum; the new data have been added to the archives and incorporated
in memoirs now in preparation or completed for publication, as indicated in other
paragraphs. The scientific results of the work are summarized in the following
pages.

OFFICE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing has continued the study and arrangement of his
collections of aboriginal handiwork from western Florida, and has made progress in
the preparation of a report on the prehistoric key-dwellers of the eastern shore of
the Gulf of Mexico. During the greater part of the year the collections were kept
in the Museum of Archeology of the University of Pennsylvania, where they were
shipped on account of the inadequate space then afforded by the National Museum
for unpacking and assembling; toward the end of the fiscal year, as the capacity of
the Museum was increased by the introduction of galleries, the greater part of the
collection was brought to Washington and arranged in cases and on tables for pur-
poses of comparison and study. In the course of his work Mr. Cushing has made
extensive comparisons between his specimens and those obtained by other archeolo-
gists from different portions of the United States, and the comparative studies are
highly significant. The Florida collections are rendered exceptionally valuable by
reason of the large number of specimens made from and decorated with animal and
vegetal substances, which are ordinarily perishable, though preserved in high per-
fection in the muck-beds associated with the Florida Keys. Accordingly, the material
serves better than any other collection thus far made to connect the records of the
early explorers with the observations of later times; at the same time it serves to _
round out knowledge concerning the pre-Columbian handiwork of the Indians in all
of the softer, more flexible, and more easily destructible substances, and accordingly
permits comparison of designs wrought in a wide range of materials.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes has continued the preparation of reports on his archzo-
logic researches in Arizona and New Mexico. These researches were undertaken
primarily for the purpose of enriching the collections of aboriginal art products for
the National Museum. The large collections embrace a remarkably complete series
4? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of primitive designs and motives in fictile ware, including the adaptation of myth-
ologic, animal, bird and feather, insect, and reptilian figures. Many of these are so
highly conventionalized that they would have been practically uninterpretable
without the knowledge of Tusayan mythologic and sociologic concepts which Dr.
Fewkes fortunately possesses; consequently he has been enabled to make sub-
stantial contributions to knowledge of the development of artistic concepts, the
results of which are incorporated in two memoirs for publication, respectively, in
the seventeenth and nineteenth annual reports.

In connection with other researches, Mr. W J McGee has made inquiries from dele-
gations of Indians visiting Washington concerning the symbolic use of feathers,
especially in connection with headdresses. It is well known to students that the
use of feathers, which, at first sight, would seem to be decorative merely, is essen-
tially symbolic; but the meanings of the symbols have not been ascertained hitherto,
save casually and among a few tribes. During the year, the feather symbolism of
the Ponka and Ojibwa tribes has been discovered and recorded with tolerable com-
pleteness.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

Arts and industries are correlated factors in human progress, and the lines of con-
ceptual development traced through the study of art motives elucidate the growth
of industrial devices. Accordingly, the work of the collaborators in connection
with art motives has contributed both directly and indirectly to aboriginal technol-
ogy. During the year special attention was given to lines of technical development,
as indicated in previous reports and in the acquisition of material for study and
preservation in the Museum. Especially valuable is the Steiner collection, from the
mounds of Etowah Valley, Georgia. It comprises 3,215 specimens of stone imple-
ments, earthenware, and symbolic and decorative objects of copper, shell, and stone.
The Indians of this district, builders of the great Etowah mound and other monu-
ments, were peculiarly fertile in artistic and industrial devices. In this region the
progressive tribes of the Siouan stock, the vigorous Cherokee, one or more of the wide- —
ranging Algonquian tribes, the little-known Yuchi, and some of the Muskhogean
tribes came in frequent contact, while the influence of the arts and industries of the
key-dwellers of Florida was constantly felt. Here, as elsewhere, ideas and ideals were
stimulated by contact, whether peaceful or not, and the devices representing the
rapidly growing concepts are especially significant and useful in tracing the course
of industrial development among the aboriginal tribes. Another noteworthy acqui-
sition is the Morris collection from Arkansas, comprising 181 pieces of pottery,
together with a number of stone implements and other objects. ‘The collection is
especially valuable as an illustration of types of pottery hitherto rare or unknown.
But the most important acquisition of archeologic objects procured during the year
is comprised in the collections made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes from the ruins of Kin-
tiel, Pinedale, Four-mile, Solomonville, and others in eastern and southern Arizona
and southwestern New Mexico, an elaborate report on which is now being prepared.
Like the collections obtained at Sikyatki, Awatobi, and other Tusayan ruins, these
include fictile and textile products, stone, bone, and wooden implements, and objects
of shell and stone used for personal adornment. In symbolic decorative features
the mortuary food and water vessels, as well as many of the utensils recovered from
the houses, are exceedingly rich. The collections have been deposited in the
National Museum.

The process of culture in all the five departments is by invention and accultura-
tion. The invention is at first individual, but when invention is accepted and used
by others it is accultural, and the invention of the individual may be added to the
invention of others, so that it may be the invention of many men. Objects may be
used without designed modification, or they may be designedly modified for a purpose.
The use of objects without the designed modification of them has been appplied
to Seri stone implements by Mr, McGee, when he calls such modified implements
Pri

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

protolithic, while the modified stone implements he calls technolithic. The two
phases are widely distinct, not only in type of object, but even more in the mental
operations exemplified by the objects; for the protolithic objects represent unde-
signed adaptation and modification of cobbles picked up at random, while the others

. represent designed shaping in accordance with preconceived ideals. The coexist-

ence of the incongruous types seemed puzzling at the outset, but was provisionally
ascribed to the difference in occupation between the sexes, the women using the
protolithic implements and the warriors making and using the technolithic weapons.
Further study showed that the objects of chipped stone imitate in every essential
respect the aboriginal weapons of the hereditary enemies of the Seri, including the
Papago and Yaki; and this fact, coupled with the mysticism thrown around the
stone arrowpoints by the Seri shamans, indicated that the idea of the technolithic
weapon was acquired through warfare. Examination of other characteristics of the
Seri in the light of this interpretation served to explain various puzzling features
and at the same time established the validity of the interpretation. The Seri
have been at war with alien tribes almost constantly since the time of Columbus,
and indeed long before, as indicated by archwologic evidence. Most of their arts
and industries are exceedingly primitive; yet here and there features imitating
those characteristic of neighboring tribes, or even of white men, are found. Thus
they use ollas for carrying water which are fairly distinctive in type, though appar-
ently based on alien models, yet make no other use of baked clay. They substitute
cast-off rags and fabrics obtained by plunder for their own fabrics, wrought with
great labor from inferior fibers. Since the adjacent waters have been navigated
they have learned to collect flotsam, using tattered sailcloth in lieu of pelican-skin
blankets, cask staves in lieu of shells as paddles for their balsas, hoop-iron in lieu
of charred hardwood as arrowpoints for hunting, and iron spikes in lieu of bone
harpoons for taking turtles; and almost without exception these modifications in
custom have arisen without amicable relation and despite—indeed largely by
reason of—deep-seated enmity against the alien peoples.

SOCIOLOGY.

In soziology Mr. McGee has observed some interesting facts which give light on
the development of institutions among the tribes of America, especially in the
acculturation that spreads from one unfriendly tribe to another, which he calls
piratical acculturation. The Apache and Papago tribes have been bitterly inimical
from time immemorial, the oldest creation legends of the Papago describing the
separation of the peoples in the beginning; yet there is hardly a custom among them
which has not been shaped partially or completely by the inimical tribe. The
habitat of the Papago in the hard desert is that to which they have been forced by
the predatory Apache; the industries of the Papago are shaped by the conditions of
the habitat and by the perpetual anticipation of attack; the traditions recounted by
the old men are chiefly of battle against the Apache; even the ceremonies and beliefs

_are connected with that eternal vigilance which they have found the price of safety,

and with the wiles and devices of the ever-present enemy. Perhaps the most
important element in the acculturation is that connected with belief, for to the
primitive mind the efficiency of a weapon is not mechanical but mystical, an expres-
sion of superphysical potency, and each enemy strives constantly to coax or suborn
the beast-gods and potencies of the other; so the Papago warrior went confidently
to battle against the Apache when protected by a charm, or fetish, including an
Apache arrowpoint taken in conflict, and felt assured of victory if his warclub was
made in imitation of that of the enemy and potentialized by a plume or inscription
appealing to the Apache deity. Even later in the scale of development, after the
piratical acculturation is measurably amicable, this factor remains strong, as among
the clans of the Kwakiutl and some other tribes in which the aim of marriage set-
tlement is the acquisition, not of property or kindred per se, but of gods and tradi-
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tions concerning them. The general law of piratical acculturation finds innumera-
ble examples among the more primitive peoples of the world, and phases of it have
been recognized in the proposition that conquering tribes take the language of the
conquered. Other phases have been perceived, e. g., in the hypothesis of primitive
‘marriage by capture.” Various earlier students have noted that actual or cere-.
monial capture of the bride is a part of marriage among certain tribes, and have
assumed that this was the initial form of mating among primitive peoples; later
researches have shown that, in the lowest of the four great culture stages, mating
is regulated by the females and their male consanguineal kindred, so that mar-
riage by capture of brides can not occur; yet there is a step early in the stage of
paternal organization in which a certain form of marriage by capture has arisen in
America, and may easily have become prominent on other continents. When tribes
are in that unstable condition of amity resulting in peaceful interludes between
periods of strife—a stage characteristic of savagery and much of barbarism—the
intertribal association frequently results in irregular matches between members of
the alien tribes; commonly such mating is punished by one or both tribes, though
among many peoples there are special regulations under which the offense may be
condoned—e. g., the groom may be subjected to fine, to running the gantlet, to
ostracism until children are born, etc. Yet while both bride and groom incur dis-
pleasure and even risk of life through such matches, there is a chance of attendant
advantage which may counterbalance the risk; for it frequently happens that the
groom, especially if of the weaker tribe, eventually gains the amity and support of
his wife’s kinsmen, while in some cases the elder men and elder women of one or
both tribes recognize the desirability of a coalition which can tend only to unite
the deities of both, and so benefit each in greater or lesser measure. Researches
among the American aborigines have already shown that, so far as this continent is
concerned, exogamy and endogamy are correlative, the former referring to the clan
and the latter to the tribe or other group; they have also shown that the limitations
of exogamy and the extension of endogamy are ingenious devices for promoting
peace; and it is now becoming clearer that intertribal marriage, whether by
mutually arranged elopement or by capture of the bride, may be a means of extend-
ing endogamy and uniting aliens, and thereby of raising acculturation from the
piratical plane to that of amicable interchange. The applications of the law of
piratical acculturation are innumerable. In the light of the law, it becomes easy to
understand how inimical tribes are gradually brought to use similar weapons and
implements, to adopt similar modes of thinking and working, to worship similar
ceities, and thus to be brought from complete dissonance to potential harmony when-
soever the exigency of primitive life may serve; and thus the course of that con-
vergent development, which is the most important lesson the American aborigines
have given to the world, is made clear. Some idea may be formed, also, of the his-
tory of piratical acculturation.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY,

Dr. Albert S. Gatschet has continued the preparation of a comparative vocabulary
of Algonquian dialects, making satisfactory progress. The Algonquian linguistic
stock was the most extensive of North America, both in the number of dialects
and in the area occupied by the tribes using them. For this and other reasons
the stock has been a source of much labor among philologists, and there has
been considerable diversity of opinion as to its classification. One of the tasks
undertaken by the Bureau early in its history was the review of Algonquian
linguistic material for the purpose of formulating a definite and satisfactory classi-
fication. Many vocabularies have been collected and compared; to aid in the
determination of affinities, grammatic material has also been obtained in consider-
able volume; and still further to elucidate relations, a body of records of myths and
ceremonies has been accumulated. ‘The lexic, grammatic, and mythologic records of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AD

the Algonquian stock collected by collaborators of the Bureau and obtained from
correspondents form several hundred manuscripts; and it is from this voluminous
material that the comparative vocabulary is compiled. In addition to this routine
work on the vocabulary, Dr. Gatschet has from time to time prepared linguistic
material for use in answering inquiries of numerous correspondents.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the study of the Iroquoian language during the
year. As noted in former reports, he has also carried forward a general study of the
pronoun as used in primitive tongues, with a view to the preparation of a memoir on
linguistic development. Partly as a means to this end, partly because of the inhe-
rent interest of the subject, he has undertaken a comparative study of the creation
myths of the Iroquoian and some other tribes. During the latter portion of the year
the greater part of his time has been devoted to this study, with highly satisfactory
results.

During his operations among the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache tribes of New
Mexico, mainly for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the ceremonial use
of the peyote among those people, as recorded in previous paragraphs, Mr. James
Mooney accepted the opportunity of obtaining vocabularies for comparison with cog-
nate dialects together with their genesismyths. The Mescalero and Jicarilla dialects
are practically the same, and the cosmogony of the two tribes is also nearly identical,
although they were generally at war with each other, the Mescalero cooperating
with the plain tribes while the Jicarilla were allies of the Ute. Owing to the fact
that the Lipan were exterminated nearly a generation ago, and by reason of the
isolation of the surviving remnants, doubt has been expressed as to their true affinity,
but from a vocabulary obtained by Mr. Mooney from members of this tribe associated
with the Mescalero on their reservation, it is now known that they speak % well-
defined Athapascan dialect. Such iinguistic researches as the present meager
knowledge of their language would permit were also conducted by Mr. Mooney
among the modified Tiwa and Piro Indians on the Rio Grande below El Paso.

Returning from the field for the purpose of revising proofs of a memoir on the Cal-
endar History of the Kiowa Indians, in course of composition as a part of the seven-
teenth annual report, Mr. James Mooney remained in the office during the last quarter
of the year, occupied, in the intervals of proof reading, in the translation and arrange-
ment of a large collection of Cherokee myths recorded in the original syllabary as
well as inthe English. Satisfactory progress was made in preparing the material
for publication.

During the later part of the year the researches in Indian sign language, which
were brought to a close by the death of Colonel Mallery in 1894, were resumed
through the collaboration of Capt. Hugh L. Scott, U. S. A. Captain Scott was sta-
tioned for some years on the frontier, where he was in constant contact with various
Indian tribes, including the plains Indians, among whom the sign language was
highly developed. Early in his stay he became interested in the signs and began
acquiring this interesting art of expression, and his studies continued until he became
proficient and able to use the sign language habitually in communicating with
various tribes. His knowledge of the system is undoubtedly superior to that of
any other white man, and his acquaintance with individual signs exceeds that of any
Indian with whom he has come in contact. During the winter Captain Scott was
transferred to Washington, and through the courtesy of the Secretary of War and
the Commanding General of the Army he was authorized to take up the record and
discussion of sign language under the direction of the Bureau. Considerable progress
had been made in the work when it was interrupted by conditions connected with
the war with Spain.

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

The Director continued the development of a system of classification designed to
indicate the place of the American Indians among the peoples of the earth; during
the latter part of the year he took up the voluminous material in the Bureau

46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

archives relating to aboriginal mythology. While in charge of the United States
Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain region, before the Bureau
was instituted, the Director began the collection of myths among the Indians of the
Territories, and when the Bureau was created this material, in connection with a
body of linguistic manuscripts obtained by the Smithsonian Institution, formed the
original archives. Additional material was collected from time to time by the
Director and by several of the collaborators, and there are now some hundreds of
manuscript records ready for study. Satisfactory progress has been made in the
preliminary arrangement of the manuscripts and in the extraction and classification
of salient features in the primitive mythology prevailing among all of the native
tribes before the advent of the white man. ;

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson has continued the final revision of her manuscript
for a memoir on the Zuni Indians, designed for incorporation in the nineteenth
annual report. Most of the chapters are now complete, and nearly all of the illus-
trations are ready for reproduction. The Pueblo Indians well illustrate certain
results of environment in the development of belief and ceremony. A harsh envi-
ronment begets profound faith; this is illustrated by the history of many cults.
The Pueblo region was a gathering ground of primitive faiths, each fertilizing the
others in accordance with the law already set forth and each intensified by hard
local conditions. The northern tribes, who furnished much of the blood of the Pueblo
peoples, were pressed down from more humid regions and brought into conflict with
alien warriors and with an arid habitat in which the specters of thirst and famine
were ever present; the southern tribes, who furnished most of the culture of the
Pueblos, were in part at least forced up toward the plateaus from the still more arid
district$ about the present national boundary into which they had fled, as the excess
of population from the more fertile districts of pre-Columbian Mexico. Ali of the
peoples were shadowed by the dangers of drought and by the hard labor required for
the maintenance of existence; all were accustomed to invocations for rain; all were
accustomed to ceremonies connected with the growth of corn; all were accustomed
to reverence of beast-gods, and all ascribed their preservation from ever-present
danger to their success in propitiating the maleficent mysteries by which they were
surrounded—for that which is simply a hard natural condition to the advanced
thinker is always a maleficent potency to the primitive thinker. All of the circum-
stances were such as to develop a profoundly devotional cast of mind among the
Pueblo peoples; and their myths and ceremonies became so striking as to attract
the attention of students throughout the world, as white men came in contact with
them. Mrs. Stevenson’s researches concerning the myths and ceremonies have been
exceptionally thorough, and the results now nearly ready for publication will form
a substantial contribution to the knowledge of aboriginal mythology.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

During the year the important work of compiling a Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes
of North America was continued by Mr. F. W. Hodge, with the assistance of Dr.
Cyrus Thomas, the former carrying forward the work in connection with other
duties. Dr.Thomas completed the preliminary arrangement of the material relating
to the tribes of the Algonquian stock, submitting the material for editorial revision.
He afterward took up the manuscript and literature relating to the tribes of the
Siouan stock, and has made satisfactory progress in the arrangement of the material.

COLLECTIONS.

A number of collections have been acquired during the year under the more imme-
diate direction of the Secretary. Some of these are noted above; in addition there
have been acquired (1) a collection of Jamaican antiquities by MacCormack, includ-
ing 160 specimens of ancient stone implements, earthenware, etc., and 20 petaloid
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ; AT

implements; (2) the Palmer collection of 98 ethnologic specimens from Mexico, and
(3) the Gane collection of cliff-house relics, comprising fictile ware, bone imple-
ments, etc., from San Juan Valley, Utah. In addition, the Muniz collection of
trephined skulls, illustrated and described in the sixteenth annual report, was
finally transferred to the Museum. A considerable number of separate objects and
minor collections obtained by exchange for reports and by gift has also been turned
over to the Museum during the year; among these was a Muskwaki hand-loom
obtained by Mr. McGee for the express purpose of filling an hiatus in the national
collection.
PUBLICATION.

Satisfactory progress has been made by Mr. Hodge in the revision of the proofs of
the seventeenth and eighteenth annual reports and in the editorial work on the
manuscript of the nineteenth annual report. The seventeenth report was trans-
mitted to the Public Printer by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution on
July 6, 1897, the first proofs being received on September 20, and by the end of
June, 1898, the two volumes comprising the work were practically all in type. In
addition to the usual account of the operations of the Bureau the seventeenth annual
report will contain four memoirs, bearing the titles, ‘‘The Seri Indians,” by W J
McGee; ‘Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians,” by James Mooney; ‘‘Navaho
Houses,” by Cosmos Mindeleff, and ‘‘Archzeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895,”
by J. Walter Fewkes.

The eighteenth annual report was transmitted to the Public Printer by the Secre-
tary on March 11, 1898. It comprises, in addition to the report of operations for the
fiscal year 1896-97, two papers entitled, respectively, ‘‘The Eskimo About Bering
Strait,” by E. W. Nelson, and ‘Indian Land Cessions in the United States,” by
-C. C. Royce. Like the seventeenth annual report, this also will appear in two
volumes. The first galley proofs were received from the Public Printer in the latter
part of June.

While all the material for the nineteenth annual report is not yet in hand, satis-
factory progress has been made in its preparation, and it is believed that a sufficient
number of memoirs have already been received from the collaborators of the Bureau
to warrant the publication of the report in at least two volumes. These memoirs
are: “Cathlamet Texts,” by Franz Boas; ‘‘Archzological Researches in 1896 and
1897,” by J. Walter Fewkes; ‘‘Tusayan Snake and Flute Ceremonies,” also by Dr.
Fewkes; ‘‘ Localization of Gentes,” by Cosmos Mindeleff; and ‘‘Aboriginal American
Architecture,” also by Mr. Mindeletf. It is expected that several other noteworthy
papers will be received from their authors in ample time for incorporation as a part
of this report.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

As set forth in a previous report, the bibliography of the aboriginal languages of
Mexico, which was left uncompleted at the time of Mr. Pilling’s death, has been con-
tinued through the generous services of Mr. George Parker Winship, librarian of
the John Carter Brown library at Providence, with the courteous permission of Mr.

_John Nicholas Brown. The unusual facilities afforded by the excellent library under
Mr. Winship’s care has enabled him to make marked progress with this work during
the fiscal year; much, however, yet remains to be done ere the work will be ready
for publication.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Tibrary.—The maintenance of the library has continued under the supervision of
Mr. Hodge, and the distribution of the publications of the Bureau has also been
conducted under his direction. At the close of the last fiscal year, as mentioned in
the report covering that period, the volumes in the library numbered 7,138; to these
756 volumes have been added, making a total of 7,894 volumes at the close of the
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

year. In addition several thousand pamphlets and scientific periodicals have been
received.

Illustrations.—The preparation of the illustrations, including the photographic
work, was continued under the direction of Mr. Wells M. Sawyer until March 17,
1898, when he resigned to accept another Federal appointment. From that time
until the close of the year the preparation of illustrations was conducted under the
able supervision of Mr. De Lancey Gill, of the United States Geological Survey,
through the courtesy of Hon. Charles D. Walcott, director of that Bureau. During
the year about 75 negatives and 610 photographic prints were made for purposes of
illustration and exchange. The preservation and cataloguing of the Bureau’s
negatives have continued with the aid of Mr. Henry Walther.

Respectfully submitted. J. W. POWELL,

APPENDIX III.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the International Exchange Service
for the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Exchanges;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes;

I have the honor to say that the property belonging to the International Exchanges
is contained in six rooms in the basement of the Smithsonian building. The furni-
ture and fixtures consist of desks, sorting tables, racks, and bins for the assembling
and classification of exchanges, the usual appliances of a well-equipped office, a type-
writer, shelves for directories and reference books, and several filing cases for sys-
tematically arranging all invoices, letters, and the card record of exchange corre-
spondents. This record contains a complete debit and credit exchange account with
all persons or institutions corresponding with the service wherever located, and at
present embraces the names, addresses, and records of all packages sent to or received
from 30,000 correspondents.

Aside from the office equipment above mentioned, it is necessary to constantly
carry in stock from 100 to 300 packing boxes, used for the shipment of exchanges
abroad, wrapping paper, twine of various sizes, nails and screws in quantity, from
40,000 to 60,000 manila envelopes of various sizes and weights for inclosing books
and pamphlets, a large supply of printed cards for indexing, cataloguing, and for
the acknowledgments of exchanges, both foreign and domestic.

The office furniture and fixtures represent an original expenditure of about $1,800,
and, taking into account the depreciation resultant from use, are at present valued
at $1,200. The cost of stationery and supplies on hand averages about $500.

During the twelve months ending June 30, 1898, the cost of materials purchased
from the Congressional appropriation for that year aggregated $938.48 and from
repayments $1,177.79.

The premises occupied by the exchange service are the property of the Smithsonian
Institution and are assigned gratuitously to the exclusive use of the International
Exchange Service, together with repairs, which are made by the Institution as they
become necessary.

I am pleased to report that during the past year there have been no losses of .
property and no damages beyond those due to the results of constant use.

Concerning the operation of the service during the year, I have the honor to report
that the total number of packages from all sources handled was 84,208, representing
an increase of 3,046 in number and nearly 22 per cent in weight over the exchange
shipments of the previous year. Of this number, 58,640 packages originated in the
United States and were forwarded to 93 foreign countries, while the remainder were
received from 40 different countries abroad for distribution in the United States.

There has also been an increase of 1,450 in the number of correspondents, foreign and
domestic, which now aggregate nearly 30,000 addresses, representing practically
every civilized part of the world.

The work of the service is succinctly given in the following table:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by
Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for that purpose and in part by appropria-
tions to different bureaus of the Government for repayment to the Institution of a
portion of the cost of transportation, the rate of which repayment was fixed by the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

Board of Regents in 1878 at 5 cents a pound. A similar charge is also made in the
case of State institutions. During the past year the total amount available for
the support of the service aggregated $25,195.33, of which sum $19,000 was appro-
priated by Congress and $6,193.33 was derived from repayments.

The appropriation by Congress, being for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, and
forming an item in the sundry civil act approved June 4, 1897, was made in the fol-
lowing terms:

‘“‘Wor expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, nineteen thousand dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements for the year to July 1, 1888, were as follows:

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

So far as the appropriations permitted, the facilities for rapid transportation of
exchanges have been improved, but until more ample funds shall be made available
it will be necessary to continue to rely largely upon the liberality of the several
trans-oceanic steamship lines which have for so long a time been giving free trans-
portation.

Through the courtesy of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mis-
sions and the Board of Foreign Missions ef the Presbyterian Church in the United
States, packages of miscellaneous publications are forwarded to Turkey, but the
transmission of United States Government documents has not been revived since its
discontinuance in 1896, as explained in my last report. The extensive demand for
scientific publications from this country is expected to result in the near future in
the establishment of an exchange bureau in Japan. Until that is done, or at least
until some responsible institution is prepared to undertake the distributiom of
exchanges intended for that country, the forwarding of all miscellaneous exchanges

must remain in abeyance. Negotiations are now pending, through the intervention

of the United States minister to Greece, for the reopening of exchange relations with

the National Library at Athens, which have now been suspended for several years,

and it is anticipated that satisfactory arrangements will soon be completed.

With the exceptions mentioned above and the interruption of intercourse with

Spain and her colonies on account of the war, exchange relations throughout the
world are more completely established than ever before, and it is believed that
the few connections still remaining to perfect the system will be made at no distant
time.

For many years all exchanges for Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, and the Balkan
countries have been forwarded, in conjunction with German exchanges, through the
agency of the Institution at Leipzig. This indirect system of transmission was
inaugurated at a time when the total amount of the shipments to those countries

_ was relatively small and the practice has been allowed to continue in view of the
zealous and efficient manner in which Dr. Felix Fliigel has performed his duties
as agent. The rapid increase in recent years in the amount of work at this agency
has made the burden too heavy, however, especially when taking into considera-
tion the formalities necessary for clearing and transporting packages between Ger-
many and the other countries that participate in this arrangement, and rendered it
necessary to provide for more direct means of communication. Thus it was found
desirable, as suggested in my last report, to establish agencies in Austria and Hun-
gary, to which shipments could be made direct. With this end in view the chief
clerk of the international exchanges was instructed to visit those countries late
in the summer of 1897, and upon his return to recommend the designation of suit-
able agents. As aresult Dr. Joseph von Korésy, director of the Statistical Bureau
of Budapest, and the Imperial Royal Central Statistical Commission of Vienna
were appointed agents of the service, thus eliminating the entire territory of
Austria-Hungary from the jurisdiction of the overburdened agency at Leipzig. In
addition to securing these new agents, the representatives of the exchange service
at Leipzig, Brussels, Paris, and London were visited and much valuable information
obtained, which has already been productive of many improvements in the service.

Messrs. William Wesley & Son and Dr. Felix Fliigel, the agents of the exchange
service at London and Leipzig, respectively, have been so long identified with the
Institution that no comment as to their efficiency or faithful service is necessary.
Great credit is due the clerical force of the exchange service. While the work is at
times burdensome and requires extraordinary effort, the force has always been found
equal to any emergency.

The following list represents the names of companies and other mediums of trans-
portation that have aided the Institution during the past year in the transmission
and distribution of exchanges, either without compensation or at minimum rates,
some of which have extended equal courtesies to the Institution for many years:

APPENDIX IV.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the National Zoological Park for
the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Park;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. Theextent and kind of improvements made in the buildings and grounds during
the past year and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property and the origin and causes—
I have the honor to say that at the end of this period there were in the park thir-
teen buildings for animals, which have cost about $50,000; six buildings for admin-
istrative purposes, costing about $9,000; fences and outdoor inclosures, costing
about $20,000; machinery, tools, and implements, valued at $2,000; horses, valued
at $885; office furniture, fixtures, and books, worth about $950; and nurseries of
trees and shrubs, estimated at $1,000. The value of the roadways constructed in the
park since its occupation by the Government is about $35,000.

The collection of living animals used for purposes of exhibition comprised 549
specimens, embracing 124 species, most of which were the property of the Govern-
ment. The estimated value of the animals owned by the Government is $25,000.

There was acquired during the twelve months covered by this report property
amounting to about $11,000, about $6,200 being for buildings and $2,500 for animals,
including their transportation. A considerable number of animals were presented,
the most valuable of these being a Virginia deer, a capuchin monkey, 2 coyotes,
some cockatoos and macaws, the white and the wood ibis. The herd of bison now
comprises 10 specimens, and as they seem to thrive in captivity, it is hoped that
they may be indefinitely perpetuated. It will, no doubt, often be desirable to cross
this herd with others in order to prevent the evil effects of too close breeding.

Twelve animals have bred in the park, producing an aggregate of 35 births. A
few animals were received from the Yellowstone Park, among which were 8 speci-
mens of the American white pelican.

A considerable improvement has been effected in the buildings by removing the
group of shops and the property yard from the prominent place which they occupied
to the northward of the main building. It was never intended that this should be
adopted as the permanent situation of these buildings, and as the development of
the park proceeded their intrusion became more and more irksome. Some consider-
able difficulty was experienced in properly locating the shops. It is necessary that
they should be conveniently accessible, and at the same time where they do not
markedly attract public attention. After carefully weighing all practicable loca-
tions, it was finally decided that the best place was one originally proposed by Mr.
Olmsted, which is on the banks of Rock Creek, a few hundred yards above the
Quarry Road bridge, not far from the paddocks for deer and llamas. Their situa-
tion is not very suitable for animals, and is not in public view from the main road.
A long, low building was here erected to serve as a carpenter and blacksmith shop.
Its cost was about $1,000.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

~ The ground vacated upon the hill, which is one of the most desirable sites in the
park for buildings, was used for the erection of a large shed suitable for herbivorous
animals requiring a moderate degree of heat. This house is about 40 by 100 feet
with a wing 30 by 40 feet. The small sum available made it necessary to limit the
construction to bare necessities. It was therefore impossible to lay a floor or to
finish the interior in any but the roughest manner. Eventually this house will be
used mainly for such animals as antelopes and tropical deer. It is therefore known
as the antelope house. Its cost was about $3,500.

The aquarium received from the Atlanta Exposition was partly set up in one of
the abandoned sheds. About $200 was expended on this during the vear. In order
to obtain a suitable person for keeping this aquarium a competitive examination was
held by the Civil Service Commission and the successful competitor was finally
appointed. The first tanks to be established were those for fresh water. These
have been fed by water from the city mains, but as this is frequently very turbid it
became necessary to use an alum filter for the purpose of clearing it. This is dis-
advantageous, as it requires constant care and watchfulness to prevent an excess of
the salt impregnating the water and injuring the fish. It is thought that a more
satisfactory water supply can be obtained by sinking wells near the creek and fore-
ing the water to the aquarium by a pump.

A new deer paddeck was established during the year upon the high ground near
the western entrance at a cost of $800. The cold damp exposure near the creek,
where the paddocks have been situated, is found to affect the health of the animals,

Small shelters and alterations amounting to $700 were made during the year.

There was expended upon the continuation of the road along the meadow and its
slopes $4,800. Repairs to existing roads amounted to about $1,000. Upon walks
there was spent $650.

The seeding, planting, sodding, and improving of grounds cost in the neighborhood
of $1,200.

Considerable deterioration in the buildings and inclosures of the park has occurred
during the year, due in great measure to the temporary character of these structures.
The elephant barn is still in a very serious condition, the floor in the principal ani-
mal house greatly needs to be wholly replaced, and the smaller buildings and cages
must, many of them, soon be entirely rebuilt. The bridge over Rock Creek near the
Quarry road shows signs of decay in some of its principal timbers, and will soon
have to be replaced by a more permanent structure. It is estimated that this will
cost about $8,500.

The losses of animals were no greater than is usual among animals kept in con-
finement, although several of the buildings are by no means suitable for the animals
confined in them. Tropical birds and monkeys necessarily suffer when placed in
buildings that are not kept at a constant temperature of at least 70°. It is hoped
that houses specially adapted to these classes of animals may be erected in the park
at no distant day.

I append herewith a list of the animals in the park at the close of the year; also
the accessions from various sources during the year.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the Astrophysical Observatory for

the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments:
1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Observatory.
2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report.
3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost.
4, The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes.
I have the honor to report:

The most important features of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory during
the past year have been as follows:

1. The instrumental equipment has received valuable accessions, including a highly
sensitive galvanometer, designed and constructed at the Observatory; two cylindric
mirrors by Brashear (which, as used for collimation of the spectroscope, are equiva-
lent to a lens of 64 meters focal length), and, finally and most important of all, a
system of cooling by the expansion of ammonia, which has made possible an exten-
sion of constant temperature conditions to cover the five months of March, April,

69
TO REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

May, September, and October, otherwise frequently too warm. At present the
change of temperature of the inner room between these warmer and the coldest win-
ter months is only a fraction of a degree centigrade, and during an hour’s observa-
tion it is generally less than one-tenth degree, the control being automatic.

2. Many bolographs of the infra-red solar spectrum have been taken, which, in
consequence of these improvements, have yielded results threefold richer in ‘‘real”
detail corresponding to solar and telluric absorption lines than any hitherto obtained.

3. About 40 of these bolographs have been compared, as described in the Appen-
dix to the Secretary’s Report for 1896, and 21 of the most perfect have been measured
upon the comparator to determine the positions of the deflections found to be ‘‘real,”
or, in other words, corresponding to either solar or telluric absorption lines. These
comparator measurements included about 44,000 separate observations.

There have thus been found over 700 absorption lines in the infra-red solar spec-
trum between wave lengths 0.76 sc and 6.0 4, an increase of about 500 over last years’
results.

4, With the purpose of making a more accurate determination of the wave lengths
corresponding to the well-determined positions of the absorption lines discovered
in the rock-salt prismatic spectrum, a very exact comparison of the dispersion of
rock salt and fluorite has been made. This comparison will allow the indirect
employment of certain recent and apparently very accurate determinations of the
wave lengths in the fluorite prismatic spectrum. Apparatus has been made ready
and certain preliminary observations have been taken to directly measure the dis-
persion of rock salt. It is hoped that these steps will result in furnishing the wave
lengths of the infra-red absorption lines to a degree of accuracy corresponding to
che exactness of the determination of their prismatic deviations.

5. Many interesting instances of local variations in the absorption have been
noticed. Among these by far the most striking is a great decrease in the absorption
at the longer wave-length side of the great band wat about 1.4 ~. This change
occurred about February 15, 1898, and caused the bolographs to take on quite a dif-
ferent form at the place in question. This new form continued through the months
of March and April, but in the month of May the usual form was gradually restored.
It is found, by reference to former bolographs, that this marked decrease in absorp-
tion at this point takes place annually at about the same period, which coincides
(fortuitously or otherwise) very nearly with that at which there is the greatest
activity of growth in the vegetable kingdom. This raises the question whether the
growth of vegetation does not abstract from the air great quantities of some select-
ively absorbing vapor active in absorption at this wave length.

Whether such be the case or not future investigation must determine, but enough
variations in the absorption have been observed to indicate that the Observatory
is now in condition to make advances along the line indicated in the Secretary’s
report for 1892, in which is pointed out the important relations of astrophysics to
meteorology.

FULLER DETAILS OF THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

The best design for a sensitive galvanometer of the Thomson reflecting type was
investigated, with the following results: ‘The most suitable electrical resistance of
a galvanometer for the bolographic work proposed was determined. Expressions
were deduced from which the size and relative efficiency of coils of the best form
and of a given resistance, but differently wound, could be computed. Computations
were made which determined the best sizes of wire and the best apportionment of
resistance for a coil of the most suitable total resistance wound in three sections.
Four such coils were wound. Several experiments were made to determine the best
construction of galyanometer needle, and two needles were made which are found
to be very satisfactory. The coils were mounted in a galvanometer case constructed
at the Observatory shop, and the needle was suspended by a quartz fiber of exceeding
fineness.

Notwithstanding the greater sensitiveness of the first needle, the second has been
employed in taking bolographs for two reasons: First, because its mirror (of 2 mil-
ligrams weight, by Brashear) gave better definition; and second, because the needle
was steadier on account of its greater weight. It is probable that means could be
devised, though not without considerable time and expense, to use the first needle
with as much satisfaction as the second, and thus to gain four times in sensitiveness.

The achievement of this very considerable advance in sensitiveness made the use
of both a narrower bolometer and a narrower slit to the spectrobolometer possible.
The former was already at hand. To reduce the linear width of the slit would have
resulted in a waste of radiations because of diffraction, a danger to which some
reference was made in last year’s report. ‘To reduce the angular width of the slit
by a collimating system of spherical mirrors of longer equivalent focus would have
resulted in a waste of radiations, because of the vertical spreading out of the beam.
In these circumstances an arrangement of cylindrical collimating mirrors was
designed, with the aim to avoid both horns of this dilemma. These mirrors, one
convex of 57 centimeters focus and one concave of 544 centimeters focus, were exe-
cuted by Brashear and give equally as good definition as the spherical concave mir-
rors before employed, while reducing the angular width corresponding to a given
linear aperture of the slit to about one-seventh of its former magnitude. The
angular widths of slit and bolometer strip have now each been reduced to about 1.3
seconds of arc.

In the use of the new arrangements much trouble was at first experienced from
“drift” and accidental disturbances of the galvanometer. The ‘‘drift” was reduced
to nearly its former harmless magnitude by added precautions to avoid temperature
changes. But the accidental disturbauces, especially with the very narrow bolom-
eter (0.03 millimeter), were very serious, and on days when there was the slightest
breeze absolutely prohibitive to observation. It was found at length that by mak-
ing the chamber occupied by the bolometer air-tight to a difference of pressure of
one-third of an atmosphere all prejudicial effects of the wind, except such slight
ones as were due to mechanical jarring, were avoided. Bolographs may now be
taken with good results on the very windiest days.

Mechanical jarring of the galvanometer has been reduced by floating it in a pan
of mercury, which is itself supported upon the table of the Julius suspension intro-
duced here in 1895.

Bearing in mind the advantage derived from inclosing the bolometer in an air-
tight compartment, an air-tight galvanometer case was designed, and having been
constructed was made use of for some of the latest bolographs. The advantage
derived from its use, however, proved slight.
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Some decrease in the accidental defiections of the ‘‘ battery record” was effected
by the substitution of a ‘‘Cupron” battery of 10 cells for the great storage battery
of 60 cells.

A new design for a bolometer has been prepared, in which the sensitive threads,
balancing coils, and adjusting slide wire are all contained in one compact water-
jacketed case with air-tight chamber. This instrument is under construction, and
will, it is believed, do away wth certain sources of accidental disturbance, and will
be far more easy to use satisfactorily than the present form.

With the improvements above described all or in part installed, there were taken
135 bolographs between December 1, 1897, and July 1,1898. Of these 68 were with
the great rock-salt prism, 41 with the great glass prism, and 26 with a small prism
of fluorite. Fifteen of those taken with the rock-salt and 8 taken with the glass
prism were measured upon the comparator to establish the discovery and positions of
the 700 absorption lines in the infra-red already mentioned. Fifteen taken with the
fluorite prism were measured upon the comparator to determine the position of about
50 absorption lines identifiable on both the rock-salt-prism and the fluorite-prism
bolographs, with the design of thus deducing the dispersion of rock-salt indirectly
from the wave-length determinations of Paschen in the fluorite spectrum.

Apparatus, including a concave grating, has been arranged for the purpose of
directly measuring the dispersion of rock salt, but the actual observations were
not begun at the close of the period covered by this report. It is hoped that this
research will make it possible to give the wave lengths of the absorption lines dis-
covered to the degree of accuracy corresponding with that of the prismatic devia-
tions. The Observatory is peculiarly fitted to obtain results of great accuracy, in
that, first, it is in possession of such an extraordinary equipment of rock-salt prisms
that one great one is provided with a thermometer at its center and used solely to
determine the temperature of the optical one; second, a constant temperature may
be maintained, and hence the temperature of the salt can be certainly known;
third, the great sensitiveness of the bolometric apparatus allows of the employment
of narrow slit widths; fourth, the bolographic method can be employed, which,
being independent of circle readings, and involving instead a clock work of extreme
accuracy, gives differences of deviation with extraordinary precision, reaching, as
we said in last year’s report, to within a second of arc.

Several energy curves, extending from the violet through the visible and infra-red
spectrum as far as 5 yw, were taken with a sheet of bright copper in place of the sil-
vered glass mirror at the siderostat. It was found that there was no appreciable
difference in quality or amount of reflecting power between the copper and silver
surfaces, except in the violet. Here the copper gradually deteriorated as a reflector,
which accounts for its red color.

Observations have been made with the ‘‘hot box,” a device similar to the garden-
er’s hot bed intended to obtain a very high temperature from the sun’s rays without
the use of lenses or mirrors. A temperature of 120° C. was obtained, which is, to
be sure, considerably above boiling water, but not in excess of that obtained by
Herschel with the same device in South Africa many years ago. The results of the
observations are merely tentative.

A considerable number of observations have been made to determine the accuracy
of the bolometer as a heat-measuring device; that is, its capacity for repeating the
same measure of radiations under like conditions. For this purpose successive first
throws of the galvanometer were observed when the radiations from a student lamp
burning good-kerosene oil were alternately allowed to fall on the bolometer and cut
off by a water screen at constant temperature. The variations in the deflection
were very slight, and indicated rather a variation of the burning of the lamp than
any inaccuracy of the bolometer. Thus for ten successive measures the average
probable error.of the separate observations was only 0.035 of 1 per cent, or 1 part in
3,000; but, as has just been intimated, this is a maximum value, since no absolutely
-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

constant source of heat has been found, and all the variations of the source employed
are included in this 0.035 of 1 per cent. In the earlier use of the bolometer such
precision would have been unattainable, owing to the nonstability of the zero point
of the galvanometer, but the ‘‘drift” and tremor have now been so far eliminated
as to make such results quite possible.

ACCESSIONS OF APPARATUS.

There have been added to the equipment of the Observatory during the year the
following considerable pieces of apparatus:

One Richard barograph.

One Crova actinometer.

' One Fuess spectrometer, with 17 centimeter circle reading to 10 seconds. Acces-
-sories consisting of reading and collimating telescopes, micrometer slit, and one
liquid prism.

Company.

One “ hot box” provided with equatorial mounting.

Two cylindric collimating mirrors by Brashear, already referred to.

Ten cells ‘‘Cupron” battery, Type I, from Umbreit & Matthes, of Leipzig, for use

_ ou the bolometer circuit.

SUMMARY.

In conclusion I may say that the investigations of the absorption bands in the
infra-red solar spectrum, reopened by the securing of more highly sensitive bolo-
graphic apparatus during the unavoidable delay in publication of the results
attained Jast year, has been attended this year with a degree of success exceeding
anything which could be hoped for. The result now reached, which will undoubtedly
be ready for the press early in the coming calendar year, includes the discovery and

es REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

determination of position of over 700 such absorption lines, and is one with which
the research, so far as it concerns only the discovery of new absorption lines, may
suitably close.

The results we have already indicate the complete fulfillment of your expectation
that this great region is the chief seat of the telluric absorption, and confirm your
hopes that these researches may soon lead to knowledge of a character of perma-
nent utility to mankind. The gradual collection and improvement of apparatus
attending the prosecution of this investigation has placed the Observatory in a
condition to enter under highly favorable circumstances upon other researches
connected with radiant heat.

APPENDIX VI.
HPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to present herewith the report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898.

The work of the library consists of various activities. Greatest in bulk is the
reception, cataloguing, acknowledgment, and the conducting of necessary corre-

“spondence for that portion of the collection of books which is known as the Smith-
sonian deposit of the Library of Congress.

Next in quantity is the work connected with the books belonging to the National
Museum. Small collections of reference books are being made for the Zoological
Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, and the Exchange Service. A special section
of law reference for the use of the Institution is also being established, and a section
relating to erodromics is maintained. A small library has been purchased for the
use of the employees of the Institution. The Museum library has itself 21 sections.
In addition to the care of these branches of the library work, the library has been
frequently referred to for information, bibliographical and otherwise.

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Con-
eress extend from 364973 to 390914.

The following table gives an analysis in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and
charts, of the accessions during the year:

This exhibits an increase over 1897 of more than 4,500 entries for this branch alone.
One-fourth of this matter has been temporarily retained in the library of the United
States National Museum for use.

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
employees library, and library of the Astrophysical Observatory, 701 volumes and
pamphlets and 2,080 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,781, and a grand total of
40,715 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts of accessions for the year.

The Library of Congress was removed from the old quarters in the Capitol to the
new Library building, in the months of August and September and was reopened for
use in November, 1897. The east stack, the smaller of the three stacks in the Library,
was set apart for the Smithsonian deposit, and a commodious room directly adjoin-
ing this stack on the main floor was assigned as an office and work room. Into this
a large part of the accumulation of the last ten years was placed, and these have
been to a certain extent arranged and catalogued. It is the desire and intent of the

75
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Librarian of Congress that all the Smithsonian books shall be placed together in this
stack and steps are being taken toward that end. The bill passed by Congress pro-
viding for the arrangement and organization of the Library in its new building,
however, made no provision, either for this work or for the care of the Smithsonian
stack, and it has resulted that all work in connection with this collection of books
must be done in the spare time of persons who already had other duties. While,
therefore, a great deal has been accomplished in a comparatively short space of
time, the Sinithsonian deposit is as yet by no means in a satisfactory condition.

SECRETARY’S LIBRARY.

The Secretary’s library, a special collection of reference books for the use of the
Secretary, which may be, under certain restrictions, consulted by other persons, now
numbers about 600 volumes. These books are kept in the Secretary’s office and in
rooms in close proximity to it. A new bookcase was assigned, thus rendering pos-
sible a better disposition of the books than heretofore. The increase of this collec-
tion was 42 volumes and 182 parts of periodicals.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

With the establishment of the Observatory in 1891 it was found necessary to pro-
vide a small collection of books for its use. In view of the crowded condition of the
Observatory and of the fact that its building was not fireproof, the Secretary desired
that as few books as possible be kept in the Observatory. A room was accordingly
assigned for this purpose on the third floor of the Smithsonian building, only a few
books and pamphlets being kept in the Observatory itself. The increase of this
library during the past year has been 30 volumes and 357 parts of periodicals.

LIBRARY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

A small collection of books relating principally to parks and zoological gardens
and other matiters intimately associated with the work of the Park, are kept in a
room in the Holt House. In accordance with the Secretary’s instructions, and with
the advice of the Superintendent of the Park, I shall endeavor in the course of next
year to enlarge this collection, more especially in books relating to parks, park
architecture, etc. It is only with great difficulty that sets of guides to zoological
gardens are obtained, as these publications are fleeting in their nature and not usu-
ally preserved. ‘The Secretary, in connection with the repairs in the Holt House,
the office of the Zoological Park, has sanctioned improved facilities for the mainte-
nance of this collection of books.

EMPLOYEES’ LIBRARY.

There has been purchased a collection of about 400 books of literature, good fiction,
history, biography, and popular science, which together with the bound volumes of
popular periodicals and the current numbers form a circulating library for the
employees of the institution. The library is open to all employees of the institution
under the following regulations :

1. All persons desiring to withdraw books must first file with the librarian a cer-
tificate of identity from the chief clerk of the Bureau or office in which they are
employed.

2. The library will be open for the withdrawal and return of books from 12 m. to
1p. m., and from 4 to 4.30 p. m.

3. Books may be taken for the period of one week, with the privilege of one
renewal. z

4, The popular magazines on the table may be taken out at 4 o’clock p. m., to be
returned at Y a. m. the following morning.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77

_ 5, Any book or periodical injured, defaced, or lost, while in the possession of the
borrower, must be replaced by a new copy.

6. Before a book is borrowed it must first be submitted to the librarian for

‘registry.

7. No person will be permitted to take more than one book and magazine at a
time.
8. The librarian is authorized to suspend or refuse the issue of books to persons

_ violating any of the above rules.

The members of the staff and the employees of the institution have already begun

_ to use this library, and I feel sure that it will be a source of instruction and pleasure
_ to many.

EXCHANGE SERVICE.

For the Exchanges the attempt has been made to secure as good a collection of
directories and books containing addresses as possible. The greater part of such
publications are received in exchange, but some few have been purchased.

LAW REFERENCE LIBRARY.

The work of the Institution and its bureaus requires the reference to so many
public documents and law books, that the necessity has been found for the establish-
ment of a small collection of works on this subject. These are provided by the Insti-
tution and are for the present deposited in the office of the chief clerk of the National
Museum.

LIBRARY OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Museum library has received during the year 441 books, 797 pamphlets, and 4,926
parts of periodicals. Four hundred and seven volumes, 1,148 pamphlets, and 11,817
parts of periodicals belonging to the Smithsonian deposit have been temporarily
retained for the National Museum. The late Dr.G. Brown Goode had formed a col
lection of scientific works relating more especially to museum work and natural
history, which, during his lifetime, had always been at the disposal of his associates
in the Museum. The work of the Museum would have been seriously hampered had
this collection gone elsewhere. By an arrangement with his executor, an offer of
the collection was made to the Institution, and its value having been appraised by
Dr. Theodore Gill and myself, the Secretary applied to Congress for a special appro-
priation for the purchase of this collection. This has been duly authorized by Con-
gress, and in the coming year this valuable library, consisting of 2,900 volumes, 18,000
pamphlets, and 1,800 autographs and engravings, will become the property of the
National Museum.

Over 3,000 volumes were placed in the sectional libraries during the past year,
3,500 books were borrowed and returned, and 17,127 books were consulted in the
library itself. This indicates a greater use of the library than at any time heretofore.
A more detailed account of the operations of the Museum library, together with a
list of accessions by gift, will be found in the report of the National Museum.

PURCHASE OF BOOKS.

In the legislative, executive, and judicial act approved by the President on March
15, 1898, the following proviso was contained:

That hereafter law books, books of reference, and periodicals for use of any
executive department, or other Government establishment not under an executive
department, at the seat of Government, shall not be purchased or paid for from any
appropriation made for contingent expenses or for any specific or general purpose
unless such purpose is authorized and payment therefor specifically provided in the
law granting the appropriation.

As this portion of the act became effective immediately upon its passage no books
could be purchased during the remainder of the fiscal year. It has therefore been
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

found necessary in the estimates under the Smithsonian Institution for the coming
year to provide in some way for the purchase of books absolutely indispensable for
the bureaus of the Institution. An appropriation of $2,000 fer the purchase of
books for the National Museum was authorized by Congress, and for other bureaus
special clauses permitting ‘‘the purchase of necessary books and periodicals” were
introduced in the sundry civil act passed July 1, 1898.

The correspondence carried on was largely in accordance with the general instruc-
tion for the increase of the library or for completing imperfect series. One thousand
and eighteen letters were written, with the result that 427 new exchanges have been
added to the list and 329 defective series either completed or filled out as far as the
publishers were able to make good missing parts. The lists. collected under the
Secretary’s direction have been exhausted, but so many new periodicals and socie-
ties have sprung up that the year has been fully occupied in undertaking to secure
these new publications. I beg to recommend that this work be continued in the
future on two lines—first, by a methodical attempt to secure the publications of
the new learned societies which have been established all over the world, and sec-
ondly, to secure, where possible, the newer scientific and technical periodicals. The
care of correspondence and the revision of lists in connection with this work has
grown in magnitude, and more could be done if more aid could be had. Only
trained assistants with a knowledge of foreign languages could do this work, as the
correspondence received is in all modern languages, even including modern Greek.

The Secretary of State nominated the Secretary of the Institution and myself dele-
gates to the second conference on an international catalogue of scientific literature,
to be held in London during the coming autumn.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX VII.
REPORT OF THE EDITOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1898:

The publications of the Institution itself are in three series, the Contributions
to Knowledge in quarto form, and the Miscellaneous Collections and Smithsonian
Report in octavo. Under the direction of the Institution are also published the
Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum, the Annual Report of the Bureau
of Ethnology, and the Annual Report of the American Historical Association.

The libraries and institutions to which the ‘“‘Contributions” and ‘ Collections”
could be sent has always been very limited in number, though scattered widely
throughout the world, and in extending the number of libraries it has not been pos-
sible to furnish complete sets, but merely future volumes. Fifteen hundred copies
of these series are now printed, but this number, though all that the limited income
of the Institution can furnish, has not been found sufficient to meet the demand.

The general distribution is made, first, to those learned societies of the first elass
which give to the Institution in return complete sets of their own publications;
secondly, to colleges of the first class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and
students and publications relative to their organization and history; thirdly, to
public libraries in this country having 25,000 volumes; fourthly, they are pre-
sented in some cases to still smaller libraries, especially if no other copies of the
Smithsonian publications are given in the same place, and a large district would be
otherwise unsupplied; lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion
of particular branches of knowledge such of its publications are given as relate to
their special objects. These rules apply chiefly to distribution in the United States.
The number sent to foreign countries, under somewhat different conditions, is about
the same as that distributed in this country.

The edition of the annual report at the disposal of the Institution is 7,000 copies,
which is sufficiently large to permit of a comparatively wide distribution, though
the number printed is less than in former years.

Requests from individuals: are complied with when possible, but, as a rule, it is
found necessary to restrict the distribution of all publications to libraries and insti-
tutions of learning.

In the original ‘‘programme of organization” approved by the Regents in 1847
there was specified among the details of the plan for diffusing knowledge ‘‘ the publi-
cation of a series of reports giving an account of new discoveries in science, and of
the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not strictly pro-
fessional.” Andit was added that ‘‘The reports are to be prepared by collaborators
eminent in the different branches of knowledge.”

In the report for 1854 appeared for the first time an “appendix,” containing an
account of American explorations for the years 1853 and 1854, by Prof. S. F. Baird;
a full report of lectures delivered before the Institution by Marsh, Brainard, Loomis,
Channing, Reed, and Russell; extracts from the scientific correspondence of the
Institution, and miscellaneous papers relating to American archeology, geology, ete.

The general appendix to the annual report has been regularly continued to the
present time, and has served to bring the Smithsonian report into great popular
demand. It has long been the custom to enrich the report with memoirs illustrating

79
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the more remarkable and important developments in physical and biological dis-
covery, as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Institution;
and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, been carried out largely
by the publication of such papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by
scientific progress.

In 1880 Secretary Baird, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for thirty years previous had been issued by well-known pri-
vate publishing firms, had prepared by competent collaborators a series of abstracts,
showing concisely the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthro-
pology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfactorily, down
to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of presenting a
miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) embracing a considerable
range of scientific investigation and discussion.

So much trouble has been experienced in securing papers of the character desired
for the general appendix of the report that the Secretary has stated his ideas defi-
nitely in the following printed rules for the guidance of those who cooperate in
selecting the articles:

RULES FOR THE SELECTION OF PAPERS FOR THE GENERAL APPENDIX TO THE ANNUAL
REPORT.

So much difficulty has been found in obtaining the class of papers desired by the
Secretary for the appendix to his annual report that he takes this method of express-
ing his wishes to those gentlemen who are good enough to favor him with their
cooperation in making a selection.

He asks that it may be remembered:

1. That these papers have a purpose distinct from any others published by the
Institution. They are only occasionally original contributions to science. They are
not for the professional reader only, or even chiefly, but they are addressed to that
large body of the public which has a general interest in scientific matters without
special knowledge.

2. That while it is always a recommendation that they should have been written
by recognized authorities, yet this is of minor importance if the articles are sound
expositions of the subject. The essential thing is that they should be not only
sound and instructive, but timely and interesting to the nonprofessional reader, and
in that good sense popular. If they are accompanied by illustrations all the better.

3. As they are wanted to serve as a kind of survey of the whole field of the
sciences, both physical and biological, for the past year, it is as a rule impracticable
to print more than one on any particular subject. While the Secretary will be ver
glad, then, to have any number suggested in English, French or German which will
meet these requirements, he will not expect as a rule to make use of more than one.

4. The papers may be, in exceptional cases, as brief as 1,000 words. ‘They should
rarely exceed 10,000 or 12 ,000.

5. At the risk of needless iteration it is repeated that what is wanted is not for
the specialist, but interesting and popular expositions of what the specialist knows
to be sound and opportune.

II. MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Of the Miscellaneous Collections five new works have been published since the
editor’s last report, and the Smithsonian Meteorological, Geographical, and Physical
Tables have been reprinted.

At the close of the year much progress had been made in printing a Supplement to
Bolton’s Bibliography of Chemistry, which will include about 4,000 additional titles
of chemical publications.

Volumes XXXVIi, XX XVIII and XL of the Collections were also completed and the
covers, titles, and other preliminary pages distributed. Parts of Volume XXXIX
have been issued and the whole volume will soon be completed.

The new works are as follows: Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals;
Catalogue of Pacific Coast Earthquakes; Review and Bibliography of Metallic
Carbides; Bibliography of Metals of the Platinum Group; and a report on the
effects of impure air on the vital resistance of animals to disease.

No. 1076. A Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 1665-1895. By
Henry Carrington Bolton. Second edition. City of Washington. Published by
the Smithsonian Institution, 1897. 8. VII+ 1247 pp. (From Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, Vol. XL.)

In the preface the author says:

“As was stated in the first edition of this catalogue, issued in 1885, it is intended
to contain the principal independent periodicals of every branch of pure and applied
science published in all countries from the rise of this literature to the present time.
The compiler has endeavored to give full titles, names of editors, sequence of series,
and other bibliographical details, and to arrange the whole on a simple plan con-
venient for reference. The range of topics is shownin the Index of Subjects; while
medicine has been excluded, anatomy, physiology, and veterinary science, being
related to zoology, have been admitted. With a few exceptions serials constituting
transactions of learned societies have been omitted; those admitted either form part
of a series begun or ending in an independent periodical, or are presumably not
exclusively devoted to the proceedings of the societies by which they are edited.

“Some of the journals included in this catalogue are of doubtful scientific value,
and the right of some to be classed as periodicals is questionable. In these and other
debatable cases many titles have been admitted on the ground that ‘in a biblio-
graphy it is much better that a book should be found which is not sought, than
that one should be sought for and not found.’ (Zuchold.)

“The plan of the catalogue is as follows: The titles are arranged alphabetically
by the first word, the articles and the adjective ‘new’ (with its equivalents in dif-
ferent languages) alone excepted. The various titles borne by a periodical at differ-
ent times are arranged in chronological order under the first or earliest titles of the
series. Cross-references have been freely introduced, and are of four kinds: (1) from
the later to the first title of a periodical which has suffered changes in title; (2)
from short titles in common use to the correct designations; (3) from the names of
the principal editors to the journals conducted by them; (4) in the case of astro-
nomical publications, from the places in which the observatories are situated to the
titles of the periodicals issued therefrom.

“Part I of the alphabetical catalogue is a reprint from the plates of the first edi-
tion after having made the changes necessary to bring the titles down to date.
Part II contains additions to the titles of Part I that could not be inserted in the
plates, together with about 3,600 new titles. The letter ‘s’ following a title in »
Part I refers to additional information in Part II. Numbers inclosed in brackets in
Part II denote that earlier data will be found in Part I.

“The chronological tables are designed to give the date of the publication of each
volume of the periodicals entered, asexplained on pages1018 and 1019. By these tables
the date of a given volume in a given series of a given work may be found, or the
number of a volume may be ascertained when the date only is known. Librarians
will find the tables of service in determining bibliographical data of series not in
their collections. The alphabetical list of periodicals should always be consulted
in connection with the chronological tables. An index to the periodicals contained
in the tables will be found at their close.

“The library check list, showing in what American libraries the periodicals may
be found, is an attempt to carry out on a continental scale that which has been done
by librarians in several localities. The data were gathered by means of circulars
and forms distributed by the Smithsonian Institution to about 200 libraries. The
returns from 133 libraries were codified by the institution. It is believed that the

new check list to the second edition is far more complete and accurate than the former,
and justifies the delay of nearly twelve months in the publication of the volume.
The number of periodicals noted is about 3,160 out of the 8,600 in the catalogue.

““The material for this work has been gathered from all available bibliographies
and by personal examination of the shelves and of the printed and manuscript cata-
logues of many libraries in the United States, England, France, Belgium, Germany,
and Italy. As a last resort circulars were sent out through the Smithsonian Insti-
tution to publishers in several countries asking for specimen numbers of their jour-
nals; the titles were then transcribed from the numbers received.”

This paper is an exhaustive list of earthquakes recorded on the Pacific coast from
1769 to 1897 and includes a complete acceunt of the earthquake observations at
Mount Hamilton during the years 1887 to 1897, together with an abstract of infor-
mation which has been collected regarding Pacific coast earthquakes during that
period.

No. 1090. Review and Bibliography of the Metallic Carbides. By J. A. Mathews,
M.S., M.A., F.C. 8. City of Washington. Published by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. 1898. 32 pp. (Forms part of Vol. XXXVIII, Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections. )

In general plan the work gives a condensed account of the methods of prepara-
tion, and the physical and chemical properties of the carbides, arranged in alpha-
betical order, following each descriptive portion with references to the literature
bearing thereon. The author says:

““Within the last five years the renewed attention of chemists has been turned
toward this class of compounds, and new carbides have been produced in rapid suc-
cession. Experiments upon the reduction of metallic oxides by means of carbon in
an electric furnace have resulted in the production of many of the newly discovered
carbides. In studying the literature of these compounds the work of one man is
especially noticeable. More than to all other chemists together is praise due M.
Henri Moissan for the untiring energy with which he has investigated the carbo-
metallic compounds. So often has he astonished chemists with the results of his
electro-chemical experiments that new discoveries by him are likely to be considered
as a matter of course. M. Moissan’s work upon artificial diamonds is one of the
greatest achievements of science in imitating nature’s methods.

“Tn conducting his experiments Moissan makes use of an electric furnace of very
simple construction. It consists of a limestone block, in the upper surface of which
is chiseled a rectangular cavity, which is lined with a coating of magnesia and of
carbon. Through opposite sides of the block are inserted stout carbon electrodes,
and through one of the other sides is an opening through which a carbon tube is
inserted. In this tube the materials to be heated are placed and thus inserted into
the arc. It is estimated that a temperature of 4,000° is obtained in this furnace.
Before using the furnace it is covered with another piece of limestone, on the lower
side of which are layers of magnesia and carbon, which fit into or cover the cavity
of the lower block. So poorly do these materials conduct heat that the hand may
be kept on the outside of the furnace for several minutes after the current is started.”

No. 1125. An investigation on the Influence upon the Vital Resistance of Animals
to the Micro-organisms of Disease brought about by Prolonged Sojourn in Impure
Atmosphere. By D. H. Bergey, M. D. City of Washington. Published by the
Smithsonian Institution, 1898. 8°. 10 pp. (Forms part of Smithsonian Miscella-
neous Collections, Vol. XX XIX.)

This is a report of an investigation outlined by and conducted under the super-
vision of Drs. John S. Billings and S. Weir Mitchell, in which an attempt has been
made to determine whether impure atmosphere produces detrimental influence upon
the animal organism, as shown in greater susceptibility to certain diseases, The
yi

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

impurities tested were carbonic-acid gas and respiratory impurities, and the micro-
organisms were staphylococcus, diphtheria, and bacillus tuberculosis. Dr. Bergey
summarizes the results of his investigation as follows:

“Tn the staphylococcus and diphtheria inoculations the cultures used appear to
have been insufficiently attenuated to show any difference in the effect produced
upon the animals under experiment and the control animals. It is, however, very
doubtful whether cultures of these organisms could be attenuated to such a degree
as to still kill a weakened animal and not kill a control, healthy animal.

“The anthrax vaccines used do not kill a healthy guinea pig, but it was expected
that the animals might present sufficient lowering of the vitality to become attected
by the vaccines. This, however, was not the case. The animals having failed todie
from the effects of the anthrax vaccines, they were then inoculated with an atten-
uated culture of tuberculosis. All the animals under experiment died much earlier
than the control animals. These results indicate a lowered vitality. Whether
this lowered vitality was brought about by the atmospheric conditions under which
they had lived, or whether it was brought about solely through changes in their
diet while under experiment, or whether both these causes were active in producing
the result, if is impossible to say. The animals lost flesh and decreased in weight
while under experiment. It is not improbable that the loss in weight and the
decrease in vitality are both traceable to the same causes.”

APPENDIX VIII.

REPORT ON THE TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION, NASHVILLE,
TENN., 1897.

S1r: I have the honor to submit the following report on the exhibit of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the National Museum, and other bureaus under the direction of
the Institution, at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.

In an act of Congress approved December 22, 1896, provision was made for partici-
pation in the exposition by the Executive Departments of the Government, the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, and the United States Fish Com-
mission. ! :

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was intended to illustrate as fully as
possible the character and scope of the work accomplished by the Institution and
the several bureaus under its direction. For obvious reasons the activities of the
National Museum could be represented in a more complete manner than was possible
in the case of the Institution proper, or of any of the other bureaus under its
direction. Almost every department of the National Museum furnished an exhibit,
although some of the latter were much fuller than others.

The space assigned to the Institution was in the northeast corner of the Govern-
ment building and comprised about 5,000 square feet. There was a frontage of 101
feet on the main aisle running east and west, with a width of 48 feet. At the west
end of the space there was a series of alcoves, but otherwise the cases were placed
in rows. Two short aisles led from the main aisle, at right angles with it, their
inner ends joining an aisle which ran parallel to the main thoroughfare.

Against the east wall were installed the exhibits of the Institution proper, the
Bureau of International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
Physical Observatory.

In the center of the north hall was the exhibit of the Bureau of Ethnology. The
remainder of the space was devoted to the collections of the National Museum.

In the windows were transparencies showing the seal of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion; the Smithsonian and National Museum buildings, with interior views of each;
four views of the National Zoological Park; four geological subjects—an Australian
coral reef, the Yosemite Valley, the Devil’s Tower in Wyoming, and the Mammoth
Hot Springs; four zoological subjects—a deep-sea fish, a cuttlefish, a hydroid, and
sea-lilies: and eight ethnological subjects.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

A complete set of tke publications of the Institution, including those of the
Bureau of Ethnology and the National Museum, formed one of the principal features
of the exhibit. Adjoining this was an exhibit of title-pages and some of the more
important illustrations in these publications.

Portraits of James Smithson, the founder of the Institution; of Secretaries Joseph
Henry, Spencer Fullerton Baird, and Samuel Pierpont Langley, and of the late
George Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary, were hung upon the wall.

In a separate case was displayed a photographic portrait of Thomas G. Hodgkins,

1 The act referred to is given in full in the Report of the Smithsonian Institution
for 1897, Pages XLY-XLVII. e

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

together with examples of the medals awarded in 1895 to writers of essays compet-
ing for the Hodgkins fund prizes, and copies of the prize memoirs which had been
published.

On the wall adjacent was a cast of the memorial tablet which had recently been
placed, by order of the Board of Regents, on the tomb of Smithson, in Genoa, Italy.

Two enlarged photographs of Secretary Langley’s aerodrome (flying machine),
which twice flew over one-half mile on May 6, 1896, near Quantico, Va., were also
exhibited. The photographs were of different views of the machine, and two-fifths
its actual size. :

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The exhibit of this Bureau consisted of one-half of a Kiowa camping circle in
miniature, the material for which was collected by Mr. James Mooney, of the
Bureau.

The entire exhibit was the work of Kiowa Indians, the insignia emblazoned on the
tepees and shields being executed, almost without exception, by those having an
inherited right to bear them. This aboriginal tribe is now the only representative
of a distinct stock or linguistic family of priscan people.

Owing to the restricted space available, the skin tents were reduced from 16 or 18
feet in height to about 2+ feet, while their number was reduced from about 150 (half
of the 300 or more tents forming the entire circle) to 25, exclusive of the ceremonial
lodges within the circle.

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Mr. James Mooney, under the direction
of Mr. W J McGee.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The extent and topography of the National Zoological Park were well shown in
the model exhibited, on which the buildings, roadways, and bridges, and the woods,
ereek, and other natural features were faithfully represented.

In the windows along the Smithsonian section were several transparencies, includ-
ing one of the carnivora house, one of the bridge, and one of a buffalo. There
were also exhibited three water-color paintings and one drawing, the work of Mr.
Glenn Brown, illustrating other attractive features of the park.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

A’ principal exhibit of this bureau was a complete set of the publications of the
United States Government for one year, being one of the fifty sets, such as are dis-
tributed annually by the bureau to libraries throughout the world.

On the wall was a large map showing the geographical distribution of the corre-
spondents of the Institution, 24,000 in number, as entered on the registers of the
Bureau. =

Near the map was a diagram illustrating the number of publications, including
books and pamphlets interchanged between each State and Territory in the United
States and fureign countries during the ten years preceding January 1, 1896.

The exhibit was prepared by Mr. W. I. Adams.

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The exhibit of the observatory consisted of photographs of the exterior and inte-
rior of the building located on the Smithsonian grounds, and of the principal
instruments, such as the siderostat, galvanometer, spectrometer, and water-jacketed
bolometer and rheostat. Enlarged photographs of portions of the spectrum of the
sun were also exhibited. With these objects was a bolometer, or electrical thermom-
eter, of extreme delicacy, the invention of Mr. S. P. Langley.
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

As already stated, the exhibit of the National Museum was of much greater
extent than that of any of the other Smithsonian bureaus.

Two objects were kept in mind in its organization:

(1) To show as far as possible the extensive scope of the Museum.

(2) To indicate the manner in which the collections are arranged, labeled, and
displayed in the Museum building in Washington.

In carrying out the first idea it was necessary to exhibit a small number of objects
from many different kinds of collections, which had a certain disadvantage in a
space so comparatively small, as the bringing into close proximity of objects not
nearly related could not be avoided. It wasimpracticable, on account of the limited
space, to show all the different classes of objects in the Museum. Z ;

The greater portion of the labels, cases, stands, bases, backgrounds, and other
fittings and furniture were from the regular stock of the Museum, although a few
methods of installation entirely novel were introduced for the first time in connec-
tion with the exhibit.

Department of mammals.—This department exhibited in two cases a representation
of the interesting order of mammals known as the lemurs—monkey-like animals—
especially characteristic of the island of Madagascar, but having representatives
on the continents of Africa and Asia. The group comprises about 35 species, of which
18 were shown, among them the especially remarkable aye-aye, so long a puzzle to
zoologists on account of peculiarities of its structure, and one of the Tarsiers ( Tarsius
spectrum) which are notable for the great size of their eyes.

On the walls were casts of heads of two genera of tke so-called Ziphioid whales,
Mesoplodon and Ziphius; of the Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia, and of the New Zealand
Whale, Neobalena, the smallest and rarest of the true whalebone whales.

The exhibit was prepared and installed, under the direction of the curator of
mammals, by Mr. William Palmer. ;

Department of birds.—The birds were exhibited in four cases on the main aisle, one
of which contained a representation of the parrots, and the other a faunal collection
from British Guiana, South America.

Parrots.—This collection comprised 124 specimens, representing about 100 species,
or about one-fifth of those that are known. All the subfamilies were represented
and the more important genera, so that the collection was a fair exhibit of the
group. ;

Birds of Guiana.—This exhibit represented a tropical bird fauna notable for
bright colors and peculiar forms. It was, of course, very incomplete, as it was
impracticable to show all of the eight hundred or nine hundred species which are
found in Guiana.

The exhibit was prepared by Mr. Robert Ridgway, assisted by Mr. C. W. Richmond.

Department of reptiles and batrachians.—The exhibit of this department consisted
of a group of the poisonous snakes of the United States, cast in plaster, and a similar
group of the fresh-water and land tortoises of North America. <A cast of the head
of a logger-head turtle was also included. The specimens were brought together
from widely separated localities.

The following species were represented :

Poisonous Snakes of the United States.—Diamond rattlesnake, Crotalus adamanteus,
Southeastern States.

Banded rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus, Kastern States, south to Florida and the
the Mexican Gulf, v est to Kansas.

Prairie rattlesnake, Crotalus confluentus, Great Plains.

Western diamond rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox, Southern United States, from Texas
to the Gulf of California.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

Southern ground rattlesnake, Sistrurus miliarius, Southeastern States.

Copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix, Eastern and Southern States.

The group of tortoises included the following species:

Gopher, Gopherus polyphemus, Florida.

Agassiz’s gopher, Gopherus agassizii, Arizona and Southern California.

Berlandier’s gopher, Gopherus berlandieri, western Texas.

Box tortoise, Terrapene carolina, Eastern States.

Western Box tortoise, Terrapene ornata, Central States.

Blanding’s tortoise, Emydoidea blandingii, Massachusetts to northern Illinois.

Wood tortoise, Clenmys marmorata, California.

Elegant terrapin, Trachemys elegans, Central and Southern States.

Yellow-bellied terrapin, Trachemys scripta, Southeastern States.

Florida terrapin, Pseudemys floridana, Florida.

Neat terrapin, Pseudemys concinna, North Carolina to Texas.

Red-bellied terrapin, Pseudemys rubriventris, Middle Atlantic States.

Painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, Eastern States.

Diamond-back terrapin, Malaclemys centrata, Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

Baur’s terrapin, Graptemys pulchra, Southeastern States.

Snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, North America, east of the Rocky Moun-
tains.

Mud turtle, Kinosternon pensilvanicum, east of the Rocky Mountains.

Soft-shelied turtle, Platypeltis ferox, Florida.

Department of fishes.—This department showed a selected series of fishes of the
deep sea, which formed the basis of the comprehensive work on ‘Oceanic Ichthy-
ology,” by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, published a few
months previous to the Exposition as a special bulletin of the Museum.

The exhibit was supplemented by a small number of casts of North Ameri-
can fishes painted in life colors and forming part of an extensive series in the
Museum.

The following fishes were represented by casts:

Calico bass, Pomoxys sparoides.

Sunfish, Lepomis pallidus.

Dolphin, Coryphena hippurus.

Mangrove snapper, Lutjanus stearnsi.

Sea robin, Prionotus evolans.

Red-mouth grunt, Hamulon arcuatum.

Cagon de lo Alto, Rhomboplites aurorubens.

Grouper, Mpinephelus drummond-hayi.

Scup, Stenotomus chrysops.

Hogfish, Lachnolemus maximus.

Parrot fish, Pseudoscarus guacamaia.

Rosy rockfish, Helicolenus maderensis.

Brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis.

Cavalla, Caranx hippos.

Sucking fish, Wcheneis naucrates.

Kelpout, Zoarces anguillaris.

Four-spotted flounder, Paralichthys oblongus.

Cowfish, Ostracion quadricorne.

The exhibit was arranged by Mr. Barton A. Bean.

Department of moliusks.—This exhibit was in two table cases and represented, as
far as space permitted, the families of mollusks and brachiopods. It also contained
illustrations of the utilization of materials derived from mollusks. Each family
was represented by one or more species, excepting those in which there is no solid
shell and which therefore could not be exhibited in a dry condition.
94 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The classification used was that adopted in the national collection.

Utilization of mollusks.—This series included pearls, cameo shells of various sorts,
specimens illustrating the formation of pearl in the shell, both fresh-water and
marine pearl mussels deprived of their outer coating so as to show the pearly
substratum, and manufactured articles, such as buttons and other objects, made
from pearl-bearing shells, of which specimens both in the natural condition and
decorticated—so as to show the shelly layer—and in the manufactured state, were
exhibited.

Byssus of the ‘‘wing-shell.”—A somewhat rare object was a glove resembling silk
woven by the nuns of Naples from the silky byssus of the pinna, or ‘‘ wing-shell,”
of the Mediterranean. :

In one of the windows was a transparency of a cuttle fish, Octopus verrucosus, and
suspended from the ceiling were life-size models of an octopus and of the giant squid,
Architeuthis harveyi.

The selections for the exhibit were made by Mr. C. T. Simpson under the direction
of Mr. W. H. Dall.

Department of insects.—This display occupied one side of two cases, and was
included in sixteen trays. _It was, of course, very far from complete, either as an
exhibit of insects or as an illustration of the wealth of material in the entomological
collections of the Museum. ‘Two different series were, however, shown—a systematic
series, and a series illustrating protective and aggressive resemblance and mimicry,
(the imitation, by insects, in form and color, or both, of objects met with in their
surroundings, and the imitation of the form and color of other insects).

Systematic series.—This series was included in twelve trays, and represented the
more conspicuous insects of Tennessee and neighboring States, arranged according
to their scientific classification. The Lepidoptera was more fully represented than
any other order, since the species are generally large and showy, and well adapted
for exhibition purposes. Six trays were devoted to this order. The modern orders
corresponding to the older order Neuroptera were exhibited in one tray, and the
remaining five trays were taken up with the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera,
Hemiptera, Diptera, and Orthoptera. All of the smaller species were omitted, as
they could be represented adequately only by means of enlarged drawings or models
for the preparation of which funds could not be provided.

Protective and aggressive resemblance and mimicry.—This series occupied four trays
and was divided into seven groups. It consisted of specimens illustrating the
following phases of resemblance and mimicry:

(1) General protective resemblance (insects having a general resemblance in color
to their surroundings).

(2) Special protective resemblance (insects resembling objects in their surround-
ings, both in form and color).

(3) General aggressive resemblance (carnivorous insects having a general resem-
blance to their surroundings in color, thereby enabling them to more easily approach
their prey).

(4) Special aggressive resemblance (carnivorous insects resembling in form and
color some special object in their surroundings).

(5) Protective mimicry (insects which for their own protection mimic other insects
having some special means of defense, such as a sting or noxious odor, and which
for that reason are avoided by birds, lizards, etc.).

(6) Aggressive mimicry (insects which resembie ether insects in order to approach
or cohabit with them, either preying directly upon them or as parasites upon their
larve).

(7) Warning colors (insects which are already protected by a sting or in some
other way, but which have, in addition, some bright or conspicuous color, in order
to warn insectivorous animals from attacking them).

The collections were arranged by the late Mr. Martin L. Linell, under the direc-
tion of Dr. L. O. Howard.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95

Department of marine invertebrates.—This department has to do chiefly with the
many groups of invertebrate animals that inhabit seas and rivers, with the excep-
tion of mollusks, which on account of their great variety are placed in a separate
department. The groups selected for exhibition were the echinoderms (or sea
urchins and their allies), the corals, and the sponges. A representative series of
each class was shown.

The sponges or Porifera were principally from the East Indian region, and exhib-
ited in a wide range those species which, although graceful in form, are not used for
commercial purposes.

The corals were also chiefly from the Indo-Pacific. The diversity of form was the
prominent feature.

The echinoderms were arranged more systematically than was found practicable
with the other invertebrates of this department.

Among the transparencies in the windows were those of a sea-lily, Pentacrinus
decorus, hydroid, Acanthocladium huxleyi, and an enlargement of a specimen of Globi-
gerina bulloides (a species of foraminifer).

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Mr. James E. Benedict.

Department of comparative anatomy.—From this department two series were
selected, one showing the modification of the limbs of animals for different modes
of life, and another representing the structure of the human brain.

Modification of limbs.—A considerable series of specimens was exhibited, showing
the general plan of the limbs in vertebrates and the special modifications by which
they are adapted for walking, climbing, swimming, and flying.

The structure and development of the human brain.—'The structure, proportions, and
development of the human brain were illustrated by series of models showing vari-
ous stages in the growth of the brain in the embryo, and, on a large scale, details
of its structure in the adult. A number of diagrammatic models showed the com-
parative bulk of the brain of the male and female, the least amount of brain com-
patible with life, the proportionate amounts of gray and white matter, etc. These
models were supplemented by a small series of skulls, illustrating the diversity of
form found in various races of man.

Crocodiles.—Above the cases were placed a skeleton of the gavial or narrow-
beaked crocodile of the Ganges, erroneously supposed to be a ‘‘man-eater,” and a
very large skull of the true man-eating crocodile, Crocodilus porosus.

The exhibit was prepared and arranged by Mr. F.. A. Lucas.

Department of paleontology.—This exhibit occupied one side of three cases, and was
intended to show the character of the collections in the department and the manner
in which they are arranged, mounted, and labeled. Only the best-preserved speci-
mens, from which the adhering rock had been removed by careful working with
tools and chemicals, were exhibited. The trilobites and crinoids were mounted on
encaustic tiles, in preference to wood, paper, or slate tablets.

The groups of the fossils represented were—

(1) A collection of fossil fishes from the very ancient Bothriolepis to modern bony
fishes, like the shad.

(2) A synoptic collection of trilobites—a group of crab-like animals—of singh
all forms became extinct subsequent to the ceal period. This collection was prepared
to show the structure, geological development, and grouping cf the various forms
into families and orders.

(3) A synoptic collection of fossil crinoids or ‘‘sea-lilies.”

The specimens were selected and grouped by Mr. Charles Schuchert.

Department of geology.—In two cases there was exhibited a collection illustrating
the occurrence and association of gold and silver in nature, thus described by Prof.
George P. Merrill.

“The exhibition begins with specimens showing both the native metals and their
compounds in the condition of greatest natural purity. This is followed by a series

of the same compounds with their characteristic associations, but in which the
metal-bearing portions are still plainly evident, and this in turn by a third series
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

showing selected types of ores as mined, but in which, as a rule, the metal or its
compounds are scarcely discernible.

‘<Tn the series as exhibited attention is called, first, to the native gold—that is, the
gold found in the metallic state in nature, as displayed in the form of nuggets, leaf
gold, wire gold, and gold dust from various localities; second, to the compounds of
gold with silver, tellurium, antimony, and sulphur, as shown in the minerals pet-
zite, sylvanite, krennerite, and nagyagite; third, to the occurrence of the native
metal with its associates, either as dust or nuggets, in sand and gravel, or impreg-
nating quartz, slate, calcite, and other minerals forming the characteristic gangue,
and lastly, to the series of gold ores, representing the metal-bearing rocks as usually
mined and which, while, as above noted, show no trace, on casual ‘inspection, of the
precious metal, nevertheless contain it in sufficient amount to render its extraction
by chemical or ‘mechanical means a profitable industry.

‘The silver-bearing series is arranged in a similar manner. It is to be noted that
while gold is common in deposit of sand and gravel as placer gold, silver very
rarely occurs in this form, and is represented here only by the silver-bearing sand-
stone from Washington County, Utah. Native silver in the form of wire or moss
silver is, however, comparatively common, as shown in the specimens from Mexico
and Saxony. Some of the silver-bearing compounds are of great beauty, as illus-
trated in the ruby silvers proustite and pyrargyrite.”

In addition to the general series, a number of casts of exceptionally large and
interesting nuggets of gold and silver was arrayed in a separate case. Each cast
was accompanied by a descriptive label. ;

In the windows were transparencies, showing an Australian coral reef and views
from the Mammoth Hot Springs, the Yosemite Valley, and the Devil’s Tower, in
Wyoming.

The specimens were selected and prepared by Prof. G. P. Merrill and installed by
Mr. W. H. Newhall.

Department of minerals.—The exhibit of this department consisted of a series of
about five hundred specimens, selected and labeled to illustrate the several proper-
ties or characters of minerals. The general plan of arrangement will be understood
from the synopsis here presented.

(1) Chemical mineralogy: Types of minerals. Variation in composition. Rela-
tion of water to composition. Relation of composition to physical properties.

(2) Physical mineralogy: The crystal. The crystallographic axes. Crystal sys-
tems. Compound crystals. Imperfections of crystals. Crystalline aggregates.
Pleomorphs. Isomorphs. Pseudomorphs, (a) by substitution; (b) by deposition;
(c) by alteration. Cleavage. Fracture. Tenacity. Hardness. Color, (a) essential
color; (b) nonessential color; (c) varieties of color. Luster. Diaphaneity.
Fusibility.

Special attention was paid to the order of arrangement. The several specimens
illustrating the chemical and physical properties of minerals were arranged to be
studied from left to right, beginning with the upper left-hand corner and regarding
each quadrant of the case as a unit.

Chemical mineralogy, which treats of those properties relating to chemical com-
position or atomic structure of a mineral and the chemical relations of the several
kinds of minerals, was illustrated by 184 specimens. Physical mineralogy, which
treats of those properties relating to form or molecular structure of a mineral and
the action of the various physical forces aio the several kinds of minerals, was
illustrated by 315 specimens.

Department of ethnology.—The ethnological exhibit consisted of two parts:

(1) An exhibit of the home life and industries of the Eskimo.

(2) An exhibition of the domestic life and arts of the Pueblo region.

In the first group the most conspicuous object was a house similar in construction
to those occupied by the natives of Norton Sound.

This exhibit was prepared under the direction of Mr. E. W. Nelson, and was built
of logs set on end, the corner posts being the larger. Above these were placed
series of logs growing shorter with each layer, a square smoke hole being left at the
peak of the roof. The furniture of the house consisted of a bed made of driftwood,
of a fireplace on the floor with a curious device for directing the draft and smoke
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

out of the smoke hole, and a clay lamp for lighting the pipe and other like domestic
purposes. In the house were the lay figures of a man and of a woman, in full native
costume, the latter tending the fire, the former watching her movements and lighting
his pipe. Around the different parts of the room were such furniture as would be
found inanativehut. As the plan of this structure was given by one who had spent
along time in the country, the details were quite accurate.

Associated with this group and mounted in separate sliding-screen cases were
shown a large number of objects connected with the life of the Eskimo.

Case No. 1, fronting the group, contained masks, carved from driftwood and orna-
mented with feathers, such as are used in the dramas of the Eskimo during the long
winter season, when the sun has left the Arctic region. On the back of this same
case were shown examples of the needlework of the Arctic tribes, including beaded
work from Greenland, exhibiting the Scandinavian influence—a complete suit fora
man, made of different furs cut in strips, which were inserted to produce various
pleasing patterns; a full suit of man’s clothing from Ungava, north of Labrador,
made of reindeer skin, the hair being removed; a deerskin suit for winter wear,
made from the skin of the caribou with the hair on.

Case No. 2 contained an exhibit of the various types of basketry in Alaska and
on the Pacific coast of America southward to the borders of the United States.

Case No. 3 was devoted to the work of the Eskimo and their neighbors, in skins
and other animal products, such as workbags for women, tobacco pouches, tool bags,
belts, made from the skins of seals and other animals, with or without the fur, and
also from the intestines of the seal, sewed with sinew and decorated with feathers
and worsteds.

Case No. 4 illustrated the traveling devices of the Eskimo. Snowshoes of coarse
texture used by the tribes farthest north and in out-of-the-way places, and those
with footing of sinew, finely twisted and woven, similar to those in use by the
Athapascan tribes in the neighborhood, were shown; also models of boats in two
types, the kaiak, or hunting canoe, and the umiak, or woman’s boat. There were
also to be seen in this case the tools used by the Eskimo in digging in the ice and
removing snow and broken ice.

On the opposite side to that in which the Eskimo material was installed was the
Pueblo collection. The chief exhibit in this area was a group showing several
Moki females grinding corn and making bread. (Case No.5.) In association with
this group of breadmakers were examples of the objects used in the industrial and
social life of the Tusayan and other Pueblo people.

Case No.6 was devoted to the display of the various kinds of weaving employed
in the Pueblo region.

Case No.7 contained examples of pottery from Pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona,
and showed a variety of shapes, colors, and decorations in cups, bowls, vases, and
animal forms.

Case No.8. On one side was exhibited (in comparison and contrast with the tex-
tile art of the Pueblo tribes) the bead work and substitutes for textile work among
tribes on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, including work on soft buckskin,
on the surface of hard leather, on flannel and other cloths of European manufacture,
and finally beadwork forming part of the textile art; that is, in which the beads are
not laid on the surface of another substance, but form a part of the fabric, so that
the same figure is shown on both sides, as in a piece of stained glass. -

In front of this case was arranged a collection of Moki gods and dolls and head-
dresses connected with their religious services; also sacred blankets and wrappings,
wands and shields, associated with the intricate and dramatic worship of these
Pueblo tribes.

On the wall above these exhibits were to be seen ornamental shields of wood on
which were set large collections of Eskimo and African weapons, ornamental paddles
of the North Pacific coast Indians, and other decorative objects.

98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition, an ethnological exhibit installed in thirty-two unit boxes, was dis-
played in the annex to the woman’s building. Each contained a typical example of
woman’s work in America, Africa, Polynesia, and a few from other regions.

These examples of woman's work related to the arts of food gathering, preparing,
and serving; to clothing in its various forms derived from the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, and of the furniture of the habitation. In addition to these there were
exhibited the primitive ideas of women connected with form and color in decoration.

In front of these cases, were three cases in which were three American Indian
women in costume: (1) An Eskimo woman of Bathurst, the whole costume being
made of reindeer skin, trimmed with the fur of small animals; (2) A Kiowa woman
in native costume of buckskin, colored green, and carrying on her back a cradle or
papoose frame, in which was shown a child securely wrapped; (3) A Piute woman
from the great interior basin, gathering seeds from the wild grasses, to be subsequently
ground and made into bread.

In addition to the specimens and lay-figures shown, there was, in connection with
the ethnological exhibit, a collection of ethnographic transparencies, which aided
in the understanding of the specimens in relation to their environments.

The exhibit was prepared by Prof. O. T. Mason, and installed by Mr. T. W.
Sweeny.

Department of prehistoric anthropology.—The exhibit of this department was con-
fined to a display of prehistoric objects from foreign countries. This restriction in
the scope of the exhibit was made in the belief that the weapons, implements, and
ornaments found in the Tennessee Valley and other sections of the United States,
would be amply illustrated in the various local exhibits of prehistoric objects.

The Paleolithic period was represented by specimens from a large portion of the
Eastern Hemisphere—England, France, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Hindustan, and other
countries.

The Neolithic period was represented by different implements, principally of pol-
ished stone, from great areas. They were classified chiefly according to function.

The distribution of nucleii (or cores), flakes, and hammerstones, polished stone
hatchets, scrapers, arrowheads and spearheads, and similar implements was shown to
be world-wide. Special attention was called to the similarity of the polished stone
hatchets from distant and widely separated countries throughout the world.

An entire case was devoted to a display of objects belonging to the bronze age.
These began with the most primitive implements, as the plain hatchet, and ulti-
mately included many other weapons, implements, utensils, and ornaments of later
date. Among these were hatchets, swords, daggers, knives, sickles, fishhooks,
household utensils, mirrors, combs, thimbles, bracelets, fibulas, rings, pins, objects
and ornaments of dress and for the boudoir.

The collection was selected and arranged by Dr. Thomas Wilson.

Department of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonials.—The exhibit of this
department consisted of objects intended to illustrate Brahmanism and Buddhism
(the principal religions of Eastern Asia), Mohammedanism, the literary history of
the Bible, and the religious ceremonials of the Jews.

Brahmanism was represented by a collection of images of the principal divinities
and by various implements and paraphernalia illustrative of the religious worship,
the ascetic life of devotees, and the institution of caste, which plays such an impor-
tant part in the religious and social life of India.

Buddhism was represented by several images of Buddha and of Buddhist saints,
and by a collection of musical instruments and other objects used by the Buddhists
in their religious worship.

The history of the Bible as a book was illustrated by a collection of Bibles, which
included manuscripts and old and rare editions of the original texts, as well as of
the most important ancient and modern translations of the Scriptures. The collec-
tion thus afforded an interest not only to biblical knowledge, but also to the study
of paleography and literary history.

The Jewish religious ceremonials were represented by a collection of modern
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oa

objects used by the Jews in their religious rites, which have their origin in and are
based upon biblical ordinances.

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, under the direc-
tion of Dr. Cyrus Adler.

Section of technological collections.—Owing to the geographical location of Nash-
ville, it was thought that a presentation of some of the early methods of transpor-
tation in the Southern States might be of special interest.

A small series of models was selected to show the development in transportation
from its beginning in colonial days, when the sledge was almost the only method of
locomotion, to the introduction of the first railroad train in the Southern United
States, which ran on the South Carolina Railroad in 1851.

A rigged model of the Savannah, the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean,
was also included in this exhibit. The Savannah sailed from the city of that name,
one of the most important ports in the Southern States, in the year 1819.

From the section of naval architecture was selected a model of a full-rigged ship.
In order to make plain to the visitors the nomenclature of the ropes, spars, sails,
etc., over four hundred labels were attached to as many different parts of the model.

From the electrical collection was sent a series representing the early instruments
of Franklin, Henry, Morse, Vail, and Page, and illustrating the development of the
motor and telegraph from the beginning of knowledge concerning static electricity
to the more recent discoveries in electro-magnetism. A full-sized model of the large
electro-magnet which was constructed by Joseph Henry in 1851 for Yale College
was placed on the case containing the electrical collection.

The selections for the exhibit were made by Mr. J. EK. Watkins.

- Section of historical relics, coins, and medals.—The collection of coins and medals
was exhibited in two table cases, and included—

(1) The principal coins in use in the North American colonies from 1652 to the
establishment of the United States Mint in 1793, and types of the later coinage of
the country.

(2) Medals commemorative of events in the colonial history of the country during
the war of the Revolution and the war of 1812.

(3) Medallic portraits of the Presidents of the United States.

Among the most interesting coins shown were the ‘‘ pine and oak tree” shillings
of 1652, the ‘‘Mark Newby” penny, the ‘‘ Rosa Americana” penny, the Continental
dollar of 1776, and the copper coins of Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New
Jersey, and other colonies, prior to coinage by the Mint.

There were also shown specimens of the North Carolina and Georgia private gold
coinage of 1830 to 1840, of the Mormon gold coins of 1849, and some shell money,
or ‘‘wampum,” which was given a legal value in New England in 1637.

A spinning wheel and distaff which was used during the period of the war of the
Revolution was exhibited in the History building.

The collection was selected and arranged by Mr. A. Howard Clark.

Section of materia medica.—Two series of specimens were sent from the extensive
collection in the section of materia medica, the first consisting of samples of natural
and cultivated cinchona barks and their products, and the second showing the com-
mercial varieties and the alkaloids of opium.

The exhibit was prepared by Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S.N.

Department of arts and industries.—This department exhibited an attractive collec-
tion representing animal form in pottery, including the principal wares of Japan,
and selections from Prussia, Saxony, Copenhagen, Denmark, and France.

Exhibit of laces.—A collection of specimens of network and embroidery, illustra-
ting the various epochs of lace making, was exhibited in the annex to the Woman’s
building, by Dr. Thomas Wilson. The collection comprised about 1,000 specimens
and may be classified under the following general divisions:

(1) Prehistoric: Implements for, and specimens of, sewing, weaving, embroidering,
and tapestry making.
100 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

(2) Prior to 1550 A. D., anterior to lace making: Knotted net, darned work,
drawn work, cut work.

(3) From 1550 A. D.: Reticella, point coupe, point lace, and bobbin lace of Venice,
Milan, Genoa, Flanders, France, and England.

(4) Modern laces.

(5) Series showing process of manufacture of point and bobbin lace, needles, thread,
cushions, bobbins, etc.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the National Museum, was in immediate charge of
the entire exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum.

Credit is due to Mr. J. S. Goldsmith and Mr. C. A. Steuart for their efficient super-
vision of the mechanical operations connected with the preparation and installation
of the collections.

The amount appropriated by Congress for the Government exhibit was $100,000, -
and for the Government building $30,000. The sum allotted to the Institution and
Museum was $16,200, the actual cost being $16,073.61, as shown in the following

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
_ orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on

special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-

sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1898.

RECENT PROGRESS ACCOMPLISHED BY AID OF PHOTOG-
RAPHY IN THE STUDY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE)!

By MM. LoEwy and PUISEUX.

(With three plates. )

I.—RESUME OF THE PRINCIPAL QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTED BY LUNAR OBSERVATIONS.

Next to the sun, which furnishes us with heat and light, the moon,
of the remaining celestial bodies, excites the greatest curiosity and
suggests the greatest number of problems to investigators. The suc-
cession of its phases has furnished a unit of time, intermediate between
that of the day and the year, which has been universally adopted.
The eclipses which our satellite undergoes or occasions when it aligns
itself with the earth and the sun have excited even the most undevel-
oped imaginations since antiquity. They still serve chronologists in
verifying historical dates. Representing a source of important progress
in physical astronomy, they give rise, several times in a century, to
reunions and to the combined efforts of many astronomers. The rapid-
ity of the apparent motion of the moon among the stars makes it very
valuable for the determination of geographical coordinates; its ephem-
eris 1S an indispensable manual to travelers and to mariners. The
researches of mathematicians have shown that the attraction of our
satellite is the principal cause of the tides, and of precession and nuta-
tion, that is, changes in the direction of the earth’s axis in space. The
perturbations which the moon undergoes in its orbit teach us much in
regard to the interior structure of our globe, of its ellipticity and of the
fundamental constants of astronomy, such as the mass of the earth and
the solar parallax. Its influence on the meteorological phenomena,
strongly fixed in popular opinion, is still the object of persevering and
impartial researches. Finally, by its relative proximity, the moon pre-
sents itself as an obliging stepping-stone when we wish to extend our
investigations beyond the limits of the globe which has been assigned
to us aS our abode. Deprived of the vaporous envelopes which appear
to obscure the surfaces of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, it reveals even in
the smallest telescopes numerous sharp and persistent details. No

planet, therefore, seems capable of giving us greater information in
regard to the question whether the physical forces (the effect of which
we observe on our globe) act similarly ‘on othr celestial bodies. It lends
itself, perhaps, better than the earth, on account of exposing to view a
whole hemisphere at once, to the study of certain captivating and diffi-
cult problems, those for instance concerning the origin and the evolu-
tion of satellites in general. Indeed, one can not examine the moon
without being led to ask if conditions favorable to the development of
vegetation and of life can be found on other celestial bodies beside the
earth, a question too often agitated, although always attracting philo-
sophical interest.

The first serious attempts made to attack this problem date to the
invention of the telescope. But, although skillful observers have
devoted themselves to a study of the moon, it ts remarkable that until
recently no powerful telescope had ever been applied to a study of our
satellite as a whole. Under these conditions the multitude of visible
details is so great that an isolated investigator can not undertake to
deseribe or to delineate them. On the other hand, if the task be
divided among a number of astronomers, or if the attention be fixed on
some particular region, there is the risk in either case of losing the char-
acter of unity of the undertaking, and in addition the physiological or
accidental errors of observation would impart a provoking uncertainty
to any conclusions which might be thus deduced.

II1.—ADVANTAGES OFFERED IN THIS RESPECT BY PHOTOGRAPHY.

The invention of photography opened an avenue of escape from these
difficulties. However, many years have been necessary for astronomers
to put to application all the advantages offered to them by the new
process. Their first attempts indeed met with three principal difficul-
ties which, for a long time, were regarded as insurmountable or at
least as certainly placing photography at a disadvantage with respect
to visual observation.

The first difficulty was due to the imperfect achromatism of the
objectives, until recently always designed for direct vision so as to
bring to the same focus the brightest rays of a star without taking into
account the rays which have the greatest chemical activity.

The second difficulty was due to the lack of a suitable control mech-
anism which would assure a persistent agreement between the displace-
ment of the telescope and the apparent movement of the focal image of
the object.

Finally, the lack of sensitiveness of photographic plates made it
necessary to have recourse to relatively long exposures, which increased
all the displacement due both to a defective motion of the telescope and
to atmospheric undulations.

The first difficulty was overcome by MM. Paul and Prosper Henry,
who demonstrated the possibility of increasing the photographic efii-
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 107

ciency of large objectives by causing those rays which have the strong-
est reducing action on the silver salts to be brought to a common
focus. By means of this improvement, photography, compared with
direct vision, found itself in possession of an advantage which might
have been theoretically predicted.

For a given diameter of the objective, the chemical rays emitted by
a star will naturally produce an image richer in detail than that pro-
duced by the visible rays capable of affecting the retina. As is well
known, the image of a Juminous point is a small circular spot, the
diameter of which is proportional to the wave length emitted. Actinic
rays, more refrangible than the visible rays of the spectrum, correspond
to a shorter wave length, and consequently give rise to a sharper and
more detailed image if these rays are made to converge by a suitable
choice of lenses.

The second difficulty has been eliminated, at least in ordinary cases,
by the employment of an auxiliary telescope mounted coaxially with
the photographic telescope. It therefore becomes easy to observe a
star directly during the whole duration of the exposure, and to maintain
the image precisely at the intersection of two fine cross hairs, by adjust-
ing, as often as may be necessary, the mechanism controlling the motion
of the telescope. in this manner the relative immobility of the stars
with respect to the plates may be assured. This method can, how-
ever, only give its best results in the hands of a watchful and skillful
observer. It enables, by means of prolonged exposures, sharp images
of the smaller stars, suitable for the most precise measurements, to be
obtained. This advance, which is also due to MM. Paul and Prosper
Henry, has rendered possible the great international undertaking of
mapping the heavens.

The method we possess of prolonging the exposure, almost without
limit, has in certain cases a great advantage. It gives rise to an indefi-
nite accumulation, so to speak, of luminous impressions at a given
point on the plate, and thus reveals perceptible images of objects too
dim to affect the retina. By this means vast regions of nebulous
matter and numerous small planets have been discovered which no
eye-piece, associated with the same objective, could have been able to
reveal.

An amelioration of this difficulty has also been obtained in another
manner, for chemists have succeeded in increasing the sensitiveness
of photographic plates, especially by the substitution of gelatine for
collodium as a body for the silver salts. In certain cases the duration
of exposure has been reduced to a few hundredths or even thousandths
of a second, and thus photographs of objects in motion, too rapid to be
analyzed by the eye, have been obtained. In astronomy we may cite,
as examples, the photography of sun spots and of granulations of the
photosphere, as well as meteoric trajectories. For such a brief expo-
sure only an approximate coincidence between the movement of the
108 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

telescope and the apparent displacement of the star is necessary, and,
moreover, atmospheric undulations also cease to exert an injurious
influence on the image formed.

IlI.—CHARACTERISTIC DIFFICULTIES IN THE REGISTRATION OF
LUNAR IMAGES.

All these advances have led to a kind of revolution in the methods
of observation. They have also led us to undertake the solution of a
great number of new problems in sidereal and physical astronomy, but
none of the methods we have been discussing give entirely satisfactory
results when applied to the moon. The employment of a finder makes
it possible to obtain regular disks for stellar images if the stars are not
too close to one another, but it does not eliminate the confusion of
adjacent details in an extended object which we seek to reproduce with
every possible refinement. It is necessary to adopt special mechanical
contrivances to follow the moon’s motion, coustantly variable both in
direction and in velocity. Various solutions to establish this concord-
ance have been proposed, and, on the whole, with success. At Paris
this has been accomplished in a very satisfactory manner by making
the telescope immovable. The plate holder being moved by a separate
motor, its orientation is therefore entirely under the control of the
observer. However, as the moon is not sufficiently luminous to pro-
duce a suitable image in a smail fraction of a second, it has been impos-
sible up to the present to eliminate the effects due to the undulations of
atmospheric origin. These are almost completely beyond the control
of astronomy, and it is therefore necessary to select moments when they
make themselves least felt. Very often they render the theoretical
superiority of large objectives illusory. ‘To show how harmful their
influence is, it is sufficient to say that at Paris after four years, during
which every opportunity which has appeared to be favorable for photo-
graphing the moon has been utilized, only a dozen evenings, at most,
have given really satisfactory negatives which would stand strong
magnification.

IV.—ADVANTAGES OF PHOTOGRAPHY OVER DIRECT OBSERVATION.

It seems that in this respect direct observation must claim a distinct
advantage over photography. A very short time, indeed only a few
hundredths of a second, are necessary to affect the retina.

The observer, with his eye at the ocular, can thus, if he is watching
the object which he wishes to examine, take advantage of the rare
intervals of calmness which are lost in photography. The nights
suitable for observing will then, in the former case, be much more
numerous. Notwithstanding this, however, there still remains a great
superiority for photography, for a single negative obtained under
favorable conditions includes an abundance of data and exact details
which it would be impossible for the most patient and skillful observer

to collect during a number of years; moreover, the quantity of data is
of less value than their certainty. Delineations and descriptions of
difficultly visible objects are in a certain measure necessarily a product
of interpretation and memory. Their agreement is even very fre-
quently not a guarantee of the fidelity of the observer, often influenced
by preconceived opinions. The conditions in photography are entirely
different. Instead of being temporary, as is the case with the retinal
image, the chemical impression is permanent and can be rendered
indestructible. A certain control can be assured by making, as is
nearly always done, a number of exposures which no personal prejudice
ean alter. They escape all physiological and mental influences which
might make the hand or the judgment of the artist deviate from the
truth.

Another cause which aggravates the difficulties of direct vision is
due to the presence of a complex tableau which is being continually
transformed. The sensitive plate furnishes a faithful image corre-
sponding to a given epoch.

Lack of time prevents the portrayer not from perceiving the details,
but from reproducing all of them, and the subject even experiences
important modifications before the work of delineating is completed.
Delicate markings might be altered by the inevitable impurities of the
sensitive films, of the developing baths, or of the wash water, but such
alterations are easily recognized, at least as long as they do not affect
details bordering on the limit of visibility. In any case, however,
errors which might be introduced can easily be eliminated by making
a number of exposures at short intervals apart.

It can therefore be truly affirmed that photography, having become
an indispensable auxiliary for stellar astronomy, can also render impor-
tant services in the physical study of the surfaces of our planets.
The moon, much nearer to us than any other celestial body, would,
reasoning in this manner, be a most fertile field for discoveries. Dur-
ing the last few years the most powerful telescopes of the Lick Observ-
atory, in California, and of the Paris Observatory have been utilized
in its study. The collections of negatives of the two observatories,
taken together, inclose the elements of a complete atlas or our satellite
(at present in course of publication). Not only do they reveal a multi-
tude of details outside of those which are enumerated and represented
on lunar maps, but they also furnish a certain basis for the recognition
and analysis of the variations which may be wrought by time on the
surface of our satellite.

V.—SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE SUPPOSEDLY
‘BEEN OBSERVED ON OUR SATELLITE.

The importance of a verification of such changes is extreme, and
selenographers appear to have early recognized this. Fearing natu-
rally to get lost in the infinite multitude of details, they have devoted
110 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

themselves to the study of those concerning the existence of which
there can be no doubt. Their efforts have been directed to obtain exact
images of them and to compare their present state with previous
descriptions. In the absence of precise ideas in regard to the physical
constitution of the moon, they flattered themselves to have encountered
traces of an evolution as active as that of which our globe is the seat;
of having seen manifestations of the circulation of water, of vegeta-
tion, and of life. This hope appeared at first justified by the results.
Discrepancies, which were revealed in large numbers, were interpreted
as indications of probable changes. We shall briefly point out those
which appear most worthy of attention.

At the bottom of the gulf, situated between the Caucasus and the
Lunar Alps, we find Cassini, a crater 60 kilometers in diameter, whose
ramparts rise 1,000 meters above the surrounding plain and above the
interior floor. This formation, which the smallest telescope at the
present day clearly reveals, is wanting on the maps of Hevelius and of
Riccioli, who have represented many other objects in its neighborhood
much less visible. It was first mapped in 1680 by Dominique Cassini,
the author justly celebrated for the discovery of the laws of libration.

At the present day we see in the southern part of the ‘‘Sea of Rains,”!
two twin craters very close together nearly equal in every respect,
having a diameter of 20 kilometers and a depth of more than 1,000
meters. These two have been named Helicon and Leverrier. Hevelius
and Riccioli again agree in mapping at this point only a single circle.

Cichus, a crater of a considerable circumference, forming part of the
southern border of the ‘‘Sea of Clouds,”? has a paracitic crater which
interrupts the regularity of its contour. On three different maps of
Schroter, made between 1784 and 1802, this object is represented rela-
tively one-half as large as it now appears.

In the same region all modern photographs show in the neighborhood
of the crater ‘‘ Hell” a very bright spot, in which are assembled several
craters. Cassini assures us that he observed this region covered by a
temporary white cloud, which disappeared to give rise to a new formation.

We actually see in the dark part of the ‘Sea of Clouds” a round
bright spot called Alpetragius d., about 20 kilometers in diameter, with-
out any appreciable relief. Médler represents at this point a crater 8
kilometers in diameter, of which not the least trace can at present be
found.

In the middle of the “‘Sea of Fertility” * there arise a pair of craters
named after Messier. They attract attention by the straight white
bifurcated trail which extends from them in an easterly direction, and
resembles in a most remarkable manner the tail of a comet. These
two circles, so close together, appeared exactly similiar to Beer and
Madler. Their attention having been attracted to this point by a

between 1828 and 1837 without being able to distinguish the two for-
mations from one another except by their coordinates. To-day they
differ from one another both in form and in dimensions, and their dis-
similarity, unanimously recognized, is so pronounced as to strike even
the least attentive observer. !

The phenomenon described above, in the case of Alpetragius d., is
repeated in the case of Linné, a white spot situated in the ‘Sea of
Serenity.”” Rieccioli, Lohrmann, Midler, and Schmidt all agree in rep-
resenting in this place a very deep crater, from 6 to 10 kilometers in
diameter and quite visible. Schmidt himself, in 1866, pointed out the
disappearance of this crater. Since this epoch the spot of Linné only
shows an extremely small opening, bearing no resemblance to the old
descriptions.

It would be easy to extend this list by citing numerous examples
taken principally from Scréter and Gruithuisen. We have only
described those cases which are based on independent and concordant
testimony. Indeed, in such matters the sources of error are very
numerous, and the selenographers of former days do not appear to have
sufficiently guarded against them. The sun, moon, and earth are only
found in the same relative positions at rare intervals. A change of a
few degrees in the position of the circle of illumination, or in the decli-
nation of the earth relative to the lunar equator, modifies in a marked
degree the aspect of the formations which are adjacent either to the
terminator or to the center of illumination. The part due to these
influences being known, it remains well established by photographs,
which are to-day in our possession, that the old drawings are no longer
true. Do the differences correspond to effects really observed? It
seems almost certain that there is no escape from this conclusion in the
case of Messier, and very probably in tbat of Linné. In the latter case,
however, there is some room for doubt, for although several drawings
indicate changes, there are others which might be cited which contra-
dict them, and hence make them open to suspicion. To show how
uncertain conclusions thus established may be, it would be easy to find
drawings of Mars made on the same day and at the same hour by two
different observers in which even the most important markings could

1Since this verification is the most precise we possess, we will quote from the
writings of Beer and Midler, whose authority in selenography is so great and so
well founded: ‘To the east there arises a crater similar to the first in all respects
in form, height, depth, color of the interior and of the rampart, and even in the
position of certain summits on the latter. ‘The entire agreement is so pronounced,
that it must have been due to a singular stroke of chance, unless some unknown law
of nature has thus manifested itself. We are certain that since 1829 we have seen
this region, as we have just described it on more than three hundred occasions; in
other words, as often as it could be observed. In a formation so well characterized
the least changes of size, shape, or luminosity would have made themselves visible,
the observations of Schréter having induced us to keep a sharp watch on this
locality.”

not be identified. If two such drawings were considered as relating to
different epochs, there would have been a great temptation to assume
that there had been a profound transformation, while everything is
explained by errors of interpretation of a physiological origin, which
arise when the attention is concentrated for a long time on objects
which are scarcely visible. The situation would be entirely different
for the moon if we had negatives taken fifty or sixty years ago com-
parable in quality with those obtained at the present time. Under
these circumstances there would be no uncertainty as to surface changes
of any moment.

VI.—INDICATIONS FURNISHED BY RECENT PHOTOGRAPHS IN REGARD
TO THE ORIGIN OF THE LUNAR CORE.

Let us now examine what profit science can hope to reap from the
study of photographs taken in the last few years. They confirm, on
the whole, the correctness of the work of Midler and Schmidt, and
show that no phenomenon which has modified in any permanent man-
ner the general aspect of the moon has taken place in the last half cen-
tury. Concerning local variations, it would be wise not to draw any
absolute conclusions and to consider the recent photographs as bea-
cons erected for the future. The value of lunar photographs can not
fail to increase with time, and they will doubtless permit us to draw
definite conclusions within a few years which the sketches of two cen-
turies ago would not authorize. Moreover, the photographs are even to
furnish us at once with other very important data from another point of
view, for giving, as they do, a homogeneous and simultaneous represen-
tation of the whole visible disc, they lend themselves very well indeed
to a study of the origin of the lunar soil. They possess particular
advantages in the recognition of the general alignments in the struc- -
ture of the soil, the delicate tracings which extend for great distances,
such as the so-called cracks and radiating streaks.

These objects are most difficult to distinguish by direct observations,
the attention of the astronomer being in this case strongly concentrated
on a restricted portion of the image. Another valuable property of
photography is that it brings out in an expressive manner, possibly
slightly exaggerated, the differences in the tint of two neighboring
regions. Such indications have a great value in the study of the actual
physical state of the moon, and, notably, in proving the presence or
absence of air and water on its surface. We are now to take up a con-
- sideration of this question, which is intimately connected with the prob-
lem so often suggested of the habitability of the planets.

VII.—ON THE EXISTENCE OF WATER AND AIR ON THE MOON.

The complete absence of air and of water on the moon would be con-
sidered at first sight as an abnormal condition. It is indeed difficult,
whatever cosmic theory one adopts, not to regard the moon as a depend-

ency or a colony of the earth. To be more precise, and considering the

question from the standpoint of Laplace, the satellites ought to be con-
sidered as fragments of the planet they accompany, these fragments

having been derived from its equatorial and superficial layers. The
materials which predominate in the original body ought to be repre-
sented in the satellite, and especially the fluids and other light sub-

stances which gravity tends ceaselessly to conduct to the surface. This
supposition is confirmed by the low mean density of the moon, hardly
greater than one-half of that of the earth. It might generally be sup-
posed that the division of the original atmosphere would have taken
place in proportion to the masses of the two bodies, and one ought not
to expect to find the air on the surface of our satellite forming a layer
as dense as that on the terrestrial globe. The ratio of the surface to
the volume of the moon is four times as great as that of the earth, and
gravity, reduced to a sixth part of its value, would more or less effi-
ciently counterbalance the expansive force of gases and vapors. The
lunar atmosphere would therefore be expected to extend to a much
greater height than ours, producing a corresponding decrease in its
density. For these two reasons it may be predicted that the air at the
surface of the moon can not possess a refracting power as great as one-
fiftieth of that on the earth’s surface. Observation, however, shows
that it must be very much less than even this.

VItL—INDICATIONS THUS FAR OBTAINED BY DIRECT OBSERVATIONS.

If our satellite possessed a layer of air of appreciable density its
presence would surely be revealed in several different ways: (1) The
diameter of the moon would be increased, its apparent contour being
no longer determined by straight tangents drawn from the observer to
the lunar globe, but byrays which are tangent to its surface, after hav-
ing been curved in its atmosphere. Assuming that refraction is still
sensible at a height of five kilometers above the lunar surface, this would
result in an increase of about five seconds in its apparent diameter,
and in a band of about two seconds width, there would be a superposi-
tion of images, which would detract very much from the sharpness of
the moon’s outline. Bright stars would, before disappearing, seem for a
few seconds to travel on tbe lunar disk. (2) The apparent diameter,
calculated from the duration of the occultation of stars, would, on the
contrary, be smaller than the apparent diameter defined by geometric
tangents. A phenomenon similar to that observed at the rising and
“setting of the stars would result. Refraction transforms the luminous
-Yrays into curvilinear trajectories, with their concavity always turned
toward the center of the earth. Therefore, for example, the time of
sunset is retarded and that of sunrise is hastened by the same amount.
_ In the case of an occultation the effect would be twice as great seen from
the earth as it would be for an observer on the moon at the point of
_tangency of the luminous ray emitted by the star. Theray, to reach us,
ae sm 98——8

114 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

would, in fact, have to traverse the lunar atmosphere twice, being
twice deflected, but always in the same direction. To be concise, the
duration of an occultation would be shortened and the diameter of the
disk, calculated from the time of entry and exit, would be less than the
true diameter, and, a fortiori, less than the diameter, given by micro-
metric measurements or by transit observations. In the case of an
oblique passage of a star behind the disk the trajectory of the star
would be sensibly inflected. (3) On days preceding or following new
moon the narrow horns, which terminate the illuminated portion,
ought to be prolonged beyond their geometric limits—a twilight effect.
(4) In an eclipse of the sun that portion of the lunar disk not projected
on the sun’s surface should appear, partly, at least, surrounded by an
aureole similar to that which has often been observed during the
transits of Venus. The light from the solar corona would be reinforced
in these parts, the refracted rays adding their effects to those which
are directly transmitted. (5) The spectral rays of atmospheric origin,
compared with those of solar origin, should be relatively more pro-
nounced in the light reflected by the moon than in that received
directly by the sun. (6) Finally, if one assumes that the atmosphere
of the moon contains a considerable quantity of water vapor, as does
our own, it would appear improbable that this vapor, submitted to
extreme temperature changes due to days and nights fifteen times
as long aS our own, would not condense to form clouds or deposits of
snow readily visible.

Most of these indications have repeatedly been observed, according
to the statements of astronomers worthy of belief. They can, however,
hardly be considered as established by sufficiently precise and con-.
cordant testimony, depending, as they do, on such data as the prolonga-
tion of the horns by night and the theoretical duration of occultations.
To cite one more fact, the only one on which a numerical evaluation can
be based, and which has only been brought to light quite recently; itis
to-day admitted that the semidiameter of the moon, deduced from
meridian observations should be diminished two to two and a half sec-
onds, to conform to observations of occultations and eclipses. At the
beginning of this century, on account of thelack of sufficiently numerous
and exact measurements, the two values of the diameter were regarded
as identical. Based on this assumption, the illustrious Bessel was of
the opinion that he could affirm that the atmospheric density at the sur-
face of the moon could not be greater than 5}; of its value on the sur-
face of the earth. If the same calculation be repeated on the basis of
the recent discussion of accumulated observational data, it would lead
to the assumption that the moon does possess an atmosphere and that
its density is slightly greater than that assigned by Bessel as a maxi-
mum limit.

It would be wrong, however, to accept this conclusion as absolute.
We do not know the diameter of the moon,as determined by direct
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 115

measurements, with sufficient exactness, and consequently we are not
able to affirm that the discordance pointed out may not be due to other
physical causes. However, it remains established that the principal
reason usually given for denying the existence of an appreciable atmos-
phere around the moon has actually no value, and the probabilities
should rather be considered as in favor of its existence.

From this ensemble of facts the conclusions may be drawn that the
density of the atmosphere on our satellite is certainly very much less
than it ought to be, if its division between the moon and the earth had
originally taken place in proportion to their masses. This result might,
moreover, have been foreseen by theory. Indeed, during the separation
of the earth and moon there must have been a considerable time during
which the two planets were enveloped in a common atmosphere. The
action of masses at a distance being governed by the law of universal
attraction, it would necessarily follow that the atmosphere would be
divided, not in the ratio of 1 to 8, which is that of the two masses, but
in the ratio of 1 to 729, which is that of the volumes of the attracting
spheres.

This remark permits us to consider the small relative density of the
lunar atmosphere, verified by observation, as being perfectly in har-
mony with Laplace’s hypothesis.

Should one conclude from the above that our satellite has always

possessed only an extremely rare atmosphere, incapable of sustaining
life, and of being the seat of meteorological phenomena of importance?
By no means. It may be supposed that at the epoch when the divi-
sion of the atmospheres of the two globes was accomplished, that of
the earth was incomparably more extended than to-day. An eleva-
tion of the the temperature of a few hundred degrees would transform
the water of the ocean into water vapor and would also set free all the
carbonic acid locked up in limestone formations. The small portion
of the common atmosphere with which our satellite was endowed
ought, then, on this principle, to have had a density much greater than
its present value.
The examination of recent photographs furnishes us with numerous
and decisive data even on this important. question, enabling us to
affirm with certainty that the lunar atmosphere was at some previous
time much more dense. This conclusion is almost forced upon us by
intense and manifold volcanic phenomena, of which we discover unde-
niable traces in nearly every region of the moon.

Even if the inferior density of the materials displaced be considered,

explosions and upheavals could not have been produced on such a
large scale without having been accompanied by an abundant disen-
gagement of gases. It must be evident, from our knowledge of active
volcanoes, that no agent could have supplanted water vapor in this
function. The scattering of eruptive products to great distances in
the form of radiating streaks which clear all obstacles can not be com-

prehended except on the assumption that they were emitted in a pow-
dered state and held in suspension in an LIS OU sufficiently dense
to temporarily support them.

IX.—CAUSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
THE WATER AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

The preceding conclusions, taken together, lead to the result that
the moon is incapable of preserving in a gaseous state the substances
distributed over its surface. Its feeble gravitational attraction would
permit the lighter gases, such as hydrogen, etc., to escape if they be
raised to a high temperature or be endowed with sufficient kinetic
energy. The denser gases, having entered into stable combinations,
would have become incorporated with the core. The liquid portions
would have disappeared by means of mechanical absorption. The
continuity and the efficiency of this tendency are manifested by the
phenomena which are daily taking place about us.

Thus the continually increasing predominance of solid compounds in
a gradually cooling body would result in accordance with the most
general laws of chemistry. Most saline compounds contain water of
combination which they set free on being heated and which they take
up again on cooling in a moist atmosphere. This phenomenon would
be limited, both by the complete saturation of the salts and by the total
disappearance of free water vapor. These two conditions can be
experimentally realized in laboratories. The first is that generally
presented on the surface of the earth, but the second would be found
on a planet less well provided with water. =

It is even probable that the evolution of the earth on which we dwell
will not cease to continue in the same direction. The incessant cycle
of changes which water undergoes under our very eyes, and which
seems a necessary condition for vegetation and life, is not fixed and will
not endure forever. The formation of deposits of rock salt, gypsum,
and nitrates effectively abstracts a very considerable quantity of water
from circulation. The water uniting with the solid salts can then no
longer be separated from them by the ordinary operation of natural
forces. What we have said above in regard to the water applies
equally well to the other components of the atmosphere. Fromit have
been abstracted the carbon contained in limestone formations and in
coal beds, the nitrogen in vegetable soils and in the Peruvian nitrate
beds, and finally the oxygen of siliceous rocks. Nothing indicates that
this transformation has already been completed, and that 1t will not be
continuously manifested by the lowering of the ocean level and of the
barometric column.

There is, moreover, a Special cause operating to abstract water from
circulation apart from chemical action. The major part of the terres-
trial core is formed, as is well known, of permeable rocks. The water
carried down by rain filters through them, saturating them more or —
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. LEZ

_ less completely, according to the season, filling the cavities which there
- avound or circulating in capillary fissures, compressing and expelling
"any gases which are encountered. The same phenomenon must also
_ be going on at the sea bottom, and in addition gravity always tends to
remove the water farther away from the surface. The absorption is,
- however, limited by the internal heat of the globe. At a depth of 3,000
- er 4,000 meters the water would be brought in contact with layers at
- atemperature of 100°. It would therefore be vaporized and the ten-
sion of the vapor formed would be sufficient to partly drive back the
water into the upper layers or even to spurt it out in the form of
thermal springs. This subterranean circulation of the water is prob-
ably the most active cause of the loss of the internal heat of the globe.
In proportion. as the cooling progresses the depth of the layer, in which
water can exist in the liquid state, would increase and its capacity for
‘absorption would thus be still further augmented.

If we give due weight to the difference in the physical conditions on
the earth and on the moon we become, without difficulty, convinced
that all the causes which have tended to diminish the height of the

- atmosphere and the volume of the ocean on our globe must have had a
still greater influence on our satellite. Less well provided with air and
water originally, and with a greater extent of surface in proportion to

_ its volume, the moon would take less time to consume the reserve sup-
plies. The formation of saline compounds, of limestone, gypsum, and
nitrates must have been able to effect a nearly complete absorption of
the water before even the cooling would have permitted its condensation
on the surface. The remainder, having escaped these causes of absorp-
tion or having been again set at liberty by volcanic eruptions, must
have filtered into the innumerable orifices of every size which honeycomb
the lunar core. In addition, the penetration would be more easily
effected than on the earth, for the internal temperature, decreasing
more rapidly with the depth, would not tend to prevent that action to
the same extent. To briefly summarize the above it must be consid-

ered as established by observation that the moon does not at present
contain either bodies of water having a free surface or an appreciable
atmosphere. If it be demonstrated, however, that water in the form

_ of vapor has actively contributed to the formation of the present relief,

_ we can not tell a priori whether water has ever circulated in the liquid

_ form at some intermediate period or whether it had time to be con-

' densed on the surface before being absorbed, before accomplishing

- important mechanical effects, or before finally giving rise to the forma-
tion of great accumulations of ice.

On these different points there is abundant opportunity for interro-
gating unprejudiced observation, and for examining if our satellite

_ Shows any evidences of eroded valleys, sedimentary deposits, and ice
_ fields of considerable extent—phenomena which ought to result from
_ the prolonged action of water. Modern photographs will throw much

valuable light on this subject. 3

118 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

Although it is easy indeed to find on the surface of the moon regions
sinilar in their aspects both to the low plains and the elevated plateaus
of the earth, the differences become accentuated on comparing the
mountainous regions, properly so called; that is to say, those in which
differences in level of several thousand meters appear short distances
apart. Wherever this condition is encountered on our globe it may be
observed that the relief of the surface has been totally transformed by
the action of water, and the inspection of sedimentary deposits shows
that our present mountain chains are but a small residue of the primi-
tive formations. Formations rising boldly above the general level
have undergone a progressive erosion, especially their contour, and the
direction of their greatest elongation is to-day marked by a crest or a
divide the more marked the higher the mountains.

The causes which lead to the appearance of these divides also give
rise to the formation of secondary ridges. Between these ridges the
valleys appear, which deepen and enlarge gradually from their source
to their junction with the plains below. Some of them, deepened by
numerous rivers, conduct to a common destination all the waters
of a vast region, and not infrequently acquire important dimensions.
There is often a distance of 10 to 15 kilometers between the ridges on
either side. Vast basins would also be easily recognized under an
oblique illumination on the present scale of lunar photographs, and
we would be able to verify without any difficulty their general charac-
ter of convergence.

The evidences which we to-day possess cause the lunar mountains
to appear in an entirely different aspect. Rarely is a sharply defined
watershed found, and even in this case it is easily recognized that it
is the edge of a plateau of which only one side shows a marked decliy-
ity extending for a considerable distance and marked differences in
level. From this standpoint, at least, we should have conditions most
favorable for indicating the action of flowing water. We find, however,
that there are no large basins formed such as abound among the high
mountains of our globe. The depressions there encountered are iso-
lated and closed from all sides. They show no progressive extensions,
no tendency to ramify toward the ridges or to converge in descending
toward the plains.

These facts taken together appear to us irreconcilable with the idea
that there was ever an important circulation of water on the moon.
It is hardly necessary to point out that if there were any bodies of
water at present they would be revealed by their aspects and by their
power of reflecting solar light.

X.—THE PRESENCE OF ICE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

It might be thought that if water has not accomplished any impor-
tant mechanical changes on our satellite this might be due to the rapid
cooling of the lunar globe, the water having thus passed in a short
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 119

space of time from the gaseous to the solid state. It may be assumed
from this standpomt that the moon is enveloped, even at present, by an
uninterrupted coating of ice. This view has been adopted by various
skillful observers, especially by Raynard. It is my opinion that it can
no longer be defended to-day, and that the modern photographs do not
permit us to assume the presence of any considerable quantity of ice
upon the surface of the moon.

The hypothesis of an ice coating appears seducing on account of the
fact that a general cooling appears to progress more rapidly than the
absorption of the water, at least on the earth’s surface. Accordingly
it may be predicted that at some future time the greater part of the
ocean will have been transformed into the solid condition. The moon,
therefore, would offer us an image of the future state of our globe.

It is also true that the measurements of radiant heat made by various
physicists, especially by Langley, have led to the view that, on the
whole, the lunar disk is at a very low temperature even when in
opposition.

On the other hand, if the lunar disk were covered with ice one ought
to see a luminous spot periodically appear following the motion of the
sun. Ice, indeed, possesses a marked power of reflecting light, although
to a smaller degree than water. Neither photography nor visual obser-
vation indicate anything of this kind, besides the measurements of M.
Landerer give a value for the angle of polarization of the surface of
the moon differing from that of ice and agreeing much better with that
of voleanic rocks.

It seems also very improbable that a bed of ice spread over the
equatorial zones could undergo for two consecutive weeks the direct
action of the solar rays, to be for several times twenty-four hours
beneath the sun near its zenith, without being heated to the melting
point and consequently giving rise to the production of bodies of water
and of clouds. Although the high summits of terrestrial mountains
remain cold in the summer and although the snows which cover them
melt but slightly, this may be attributed to the violent winds which
there abound and which prevent the temperature of the surface from
exceeding that of the air. But the melting of the snow does take
place under the sun’s exposure in localities sheltered from the wind.
On the moon, however, the air is too rare to remove by convection any
considerable quantity of heat from bodies, and hence the action of the
sun is exercised in an extremely energetic and prolonged manner. The
supposition that the glacial coat of the moon is covered by another,
formed of scoriz and cinders, is in better agreement with its superficial
aspect, but the resistance past and present offered by the ice to fusion
must still be regarded as most mysterious. The scorivw indeed should
have an elevated temperature, for they heat up under the action of the
sun even more readily than ice. Water surfaces should therefore
appear periodically at least in the bottoms of great depressions.
120 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

The hypothesis that the entire surface of the mcon is covered with
ice appears to us inadmissible. It is natural to inquire whether its
accumulation might not take place exclusively in the neighborhood of
the poles as in the case of the earth and probably that of Mars. No
doubt these regions nearly deprived of the action of solar heat ought
to cool down first.

The vapors formed in the low latitudes would condense at the poles
in the form of snow, and would thus be withdrawn from circulation,
since the temperature at the poles must have become too low to melt
or vaporize it. Starting from the moment this temperature is reached,
the ice would not cease to accumulate at the poles until the equatorial
zone itself had permanently cooled to the freezing point. Moreover,
since this general cooling could only have been accomplished extremely
slowly, the poles would have time to accumulate a great quantity of
ice. Their aspect would consequently be more united than that of the
equatorial regions on account of the effacement of the smaller depres-
sions. The lunar photographs, however, reveal just the contrary. The
southern region of the moon is particularly mountainous, bristling with
irregular formations. The craters are very numerous in this locality,
many touching the limit of visibility, and there are, without doubt,
many more which escape our means of observation. On the hypothesis
of two polar ice caps it seems impossible for the intermediate zones not
to be distinguished by too easily distinguished lines of demarcation
undergoing periodic oscillations. Indeed, no known rock taken as a
whole possesses a power equal to that of snow or of ice for reflecting
and diffusing light. The distinction could perhaps be made without
difficulty on terrestrial mountains 200 kilometers off, through the low-
est and most highly refracting layers of the atmosphere, conditions
under which these mountains would appear infinitely less sharply
defined than the craters of the moon. It seems that all we can reason-
ably admit is the possible existence of deposits of ice on the floor of the
craters in the polar regions. There they would be nearly removed
‘from our sight and sheltered from the radiation of the sun. Reduced
to these terms the question can only be answered by an absolute nega-
tive. It may be pointed out, however, that the bottoms of the craters
appear relatively white in the neighborhood of the poles but never
more so than the neighboring crests and plateaus. There can exist,
therefore, only glacial masses of slight thickness and of small extent,
probably covered with cinders. Notwithstanding this, it is to be hoped
that the changes which should accompany their temporary liquefac-
tion ought to be revealed some day by the careful comparison of
photographs. .

XI.— CONCLUSIONS.

The result of this inquiry, as may be seen, is unfavorable to the
actual existence of water, air, and ice in any considerable quantity
on the moon. The climatic conditions must therefore be very severe, —

‘not only in the polar regions, hardly touched by the grazing rays of the

sun, but even in the equatorial regions. Deprived of the protecting
mantle formed by the air and the water vapor, it is subjected to the same
conditions, in a more aggravated form, as the highest terrestrial moun-
tains, the most extreme dryness, intense nocturnal radiation, and a very
low mean temperature. One can hardly imagine an abode more unfa-
vorable for the existence of human life, and as even the most rudimen-
tary forms are absent on the earth at great altitudes, it is impossible to

conceive of any which could adapt themselves to the moon in its present
state.

The same conclusion seems valid, however deeply the question be
considered.

Without doubt the elements of our terrestrial atmosphere have
existed on our satellite. Water in the form of vapor has exerted a
most energetic action, and has formed a relief more marked, on the
whole, than that of the earth. The atmosphere must, however, have
been quite rare when the surface temperature reached the condensation
point, and must have been almost entirely absent when it reached the
freezing point. The conditions of humidity and temperature required
for the development of terrestrial organisms are therefore never found
together on the moon. Its history has many features in common with
the primitive evolution of the earth, though none, it appears, in com-
mon with the contemporaneous period. The moon seems like a planet
of which the development has been prematurely arrested, fixed in its
final form, to become a mute spectator of our own agitations.

Should we for this reason forsake the study of that sterile globe as
being without interest? We should regard the question from a broader
standpoint. The period when life flourishes is but a chapter in the
history of a celestial body, although without doubt the most interesting
one, but we can not consider it only at its best without extending our
researches still further. Physical and chemical laws develop their con-
Sequences within the widest limits of time, and we find in the series of
transformations of a planet a subject having an almost equal philo-
sophical importance. The photographic observation of our satellite is,
from this point of view, full of promise.

Although incapable of sustaining organized life, the moon will never-
theless continue to exert a permanent action in the development of the
human mind. By the study of the important phenomena which are
connected with its attraction for the earth, it has given rise to the
highest efforts of mathematical genius. It aids us in conceiving a
more just and disinterested view of the universe as a whole. It makes
us reach out in thought, not only from ourselves, but from the earth
where we abide, and from the short lifetime in which all our experiences
are embraced.

THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES:!

By GEORGE E. HALE.

The annual exhibitions of the New York Academy of Sciences afford
excellent opportunities for studying the progress of science. The pho-
tographs and specimens gathered here to-night are substantial evi-
dence that in no department of research have investigators been idle
during the last twelvemonth. So true is this, that to sketch the year’s
advances in even a single field would consume more time than is
allotted to the annual lecture. It therefore seemed to me wise, in
responding to the courteous invitation with which I was honored by
the council, to select a subject involving certain details of astronomical
progress, without attempting to undertake the inviting task of portray-

ing the rapid advances which make up the recent history of the science,

I accordingly invite your attention to some considerations regarding
the function of great telescopes.

On the 21st of last October, in the presence of a large company of
guests, the Yerkes Observatory was dedicated to scientific investiga-
tion. The exercises were held under the great dome of the observa-
tory, beneath the 40-inch telescope. Is there reason to suppose that
some in the audience, particularly those having no great familiarity
with astronomical instruments, were inclined, in the course of the reflec-
tions to which the occasion may have given rise, to attribute to the
great mass of steel and optical glass rising far above their heads some
extraordinary and perhaps almost supernatural power of penetrating
the mysteries of the universe? It is not at all unlikely that this was
the case. For there apparently exists in the public mind a tendency
to regard astronomical research with a feeling of awe which is not
accorded to other branches of science. In its power of searching out
mysterious phenomena in the infinite regions of space, a great telescope
seems to stand alone among the appliances of the investigator. Partly
because of this special veneration for its principal instrument, and per-
haps still more on account of the boundless opportunity for speculation
regarding the origin and nature of the universe, astronomy appears to
command the interest of a great portion of the human race. No doubt
there are also historical reasons for the special attraction which the

subject seems to exercise. In the more prosperous days of the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean astrology played an important role,
and medieval history illustrates most clearly the ascendency which
the fancies of the astrologers had acquired over even cultivated minds.
So strong was the tendency of the times that even so able an astrono-
mer as Tycho Brahe was wont to cast horoscopes, in the significance of
which he firmly believed. He concluded that the new star of 1572
prognosticated. great changes in the world. Similarity to the ruddy
planet Mars pointed to wars, pestilence, venomous snakes, and general
destruction, and its resemblance to Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn at other
times foretold temporary pleasant influences, followed by death and
famine.! Thus the heavenly bodies in their courses were supposed to
exercise evil or benign influences upon the human race, and the appari-
tion of a great comet or a new Star gave rise to endless speculations
regarding the fate to which the inhabitants of the earth were shortly to
beexposed. Even in our own day it can not be said that we have alto-
gether escaped from the entangling meshes of the astrological net.
With that strong desire to be humbugged which Dr. Bolton has so well
illustrated in his recent paper in Science on latro-Chemistry, a portion
of the general public seems to devote itself with enthusiasm to the
encouragement of charlatans, whether they deal with alchemy, with
medicine, or with astrology. So it is that astrologers flourish to-day,
and continue to derive profit from their philanthropic desire to reveal
the future to inquiring minds.

The interest of cultivated persons in astronomy and in the possibilities
of great telescopes is by no means to be compared with the blind group-
ing of less-developed intellects after the mysteries of astrology. But
if we must regard the large circulation of certain newspapers as any
index to the popularity of their contents, we are forced to admit that
their readers may comprise a class of persons whose admiration for the
science is ac least distantly related to the love for the sensational
which dominates the followers of modern seers and soothsayers.
Great telescopes are no sooner erected than these papers begin to
demand extraordinary revelations of celestial wonders. The astrono-
mer, quietly pursuing his investigations in the observatory, is from
time to time startled by imperative demands to introduce a waiting and
anxious public to the equally expectant inhabitants of Mars. Minute
particulars as to the appearance, strength, stature, and habits of these
hypothetical beings, whose existence is freely taken for granted, are
expected to be the results of a few moments’ observation with the great
telescope. When the astronomer mildly protests that his observations
are likely to afford little or no material for discussions of such topics,
he is at least supposed to so cultivate his imaginative powers that he
shall be able to supplement his unsatisfactory observations by intui-
tive perception of things which are beyond his telescope’s unaided

appreciation. And it must be admitted that this demand on the part

of some portion of the public press, while in one sense only a certain
phase of the almost universal desire for sensation, has not lacked
encouragement from men who are generally regarded as serious
astronomers, intent on arriving at the truth by the methods of exact

‘science. ‘T’o such is due a widespread belief in the inhabitants of Mars,

who in the popular novels of the day have not even been content with
life upon their own planet, but, in accordance with the astrological sig-

‘nificance of the god of war, have come to bring destruction upon the

inhabitants of the earth. However entertaining we may find the doings
of these strange individuals, whether at home or abroad, we must not
make the mistake of classing the works which describe them with the
literature of science, but rather accord them their proper place among
the pleasant romances which we owe to men of letters.

I can not better illustrate one phase of this pseudoscience than by a
reference to the celebrated ‘‘Moon Hoax,” which caused such a stir at
the time of its appearance. When Sir John Herschel sailed for the
Oape of Good Hope in 1833 he little imagined what marvelous discov-
eries lay before him. It is true that he was provided with a great
reflecting telescope of 20 feet focal length, which was to be used upon
the previously unexplored regions of the southern heavens, and it
could not have been difficult for him to form some conception of the
valuable additions he was certain to make to astronomical knowledge.
But the imagination of others by far outran the more prosaic course of
his own mind, and results were obtained for him which unfortunately
his telescope never served to show. Many who are present are no
doubt familiar with a pamphlet entitled Great Astronomical Discoveries
lately made by Sir John Herschel, LL. D., F. R. 8., ete., at the Cape of
Good Hope, which was ‘first published in the New York Sun, from
the supplement to the Edinburgh Journal of Science.” In the truly
entertaining pages of this ingenious narrative we find an example
which certain reporters of our own day seem to have taken to heart.
Let me quote a paragraph of nonsense which is so amusingly conceived
and proved so effective when published that one is almost ready to
forgive the perpetrator. After a lucid historical discourse on the great
telescopes which had been made by Sir William Herschel and other
previous investigators, followed by an impassioned paragraph which
may well be considered to approach in eloquence the most fervid
astronomical literature of our own day, our author treats us to an
account of a conversational discussion between Sir John Herschel and
Sir David Brewster, which began with a consideration of certain sug-
gested improvements in reflecting telescopes, and soon directed itself

“to that all-invincible enemy, the paucity of light in powerful magni-
' fiers. After afew moments’ silent thought, Sir John diffidently inquired

whether it would not be possible to effect a transfusion of artificial
light through the focal object of vision! Sir David, somewhat startled
126 THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES.

at the originality of the idea, paused a while, and then hesitatingly
referred to the refrangibility of rays and the angle of incidence. Sir
John, grown more confident, adduced the example of the Newtonian
reflector, in which the refrangibility was corrected by the second specu-
lum, and the angle of incidence restored by the third. ‘And,’ continued
he, ‘why can not the illuminated microscope, say the hydro-oxygen, be
applied to render distinct, and, if necessary, even to magnify, the focal
object?’ Sir David sprung from his chair in an eestacy of conviction,
and, leaping half-way to the ceiling, exclaimed, ‘Thou art the man!’
Each philosopher anticipated the other in presenting the prompt illus-
tration that if the rays of the hydro-oxygen microscope, passed through
a drop of water containing the larve of a gnat and other objects invis-
ible to the naked eye, rendered them not only keenly distinct, but
firmly magnified to dimensions of many feet, so could the same artificial
light, passed through the faintest focal object of a telescope, both dis-
tinctify (to coin a new word for an extraordinary occasion) and magnify
its feeblest component members.”

Here, indeed, was a discovery fit to startle the world; and one can
not be punpriced that, after so extraordinary an advance, Sir John
Herschel should have immediately arranged for the construction of an
object glass 24 feet in diameter. Contributions toward this important
work were received from many royal personages, culminating in a gift
by His Majesty the King of some £70,000, which was considered ample
to meet all expenses. Many difficulties were encountered in casting
the great object glass, which was composed of ‘‘an amalgamation of
two parts of the best crown with one of flint glass, the use of which in
separate lenses constituted the great achromatick discovery of Dollond.”
Notwithstanding the prodigious size of this enormous lens, which
weighed 14,826 pounds after being polished, and whose estimated mag-
_ nifying power was 42,000 times, Sir John was not satisfied. Not con-
tent with the mere illuminating power of the hydro-oxygen microscope,
“he calculated largely upon the almost illimitabie applicability of this
instrument as a second magnifier which would supersede the use and
infinitely transcend the powers of the highest magnifiers and reflecting
telescopes.” Indeed, so certain was he of the successful application of
this idea that he counted upon “his ultimate ability to study even the
entomology of the moon in case she contained insects upon her surface.”

It would be interesting, if time permitted, to consider with our
inspired author the various further details in the construction of a tele-
scope which was the first to render visible the inhabitants of the moon.
It may well be imagined with what breathless interest the report of Sir
John’s extraordinary discoveries, which constitutes the body of our
pamphlet, was received by a willing public. “It was about half-past 9
o’clock on the night of the 10th, the moon having then advanced within
four days of her mean libration, that the astronomer adjusted his instru-
ments for the inspection of her eastern limb. The whole immense power

of his telescope was applied, and to its focal image about one-half of the

power of his microscope. On removing the screen of the latter, the
field of view was covered throughout its entire area with a beautiful,
distinct, and even vivid representation of basaltic rock.” For further
details regarding the rock and the lunar flora which covered it, refer-
ence must be made to the original pamphlet. There, too, can be found
descriptions of deep blue oceans, breaking in large billows upon beaches
of brilliant white sand, girt with wild castellated rocks. Passing inland,
wide tracts of country of apparently volcanic character were rapidly
passed over, soon bringing to the observer’s eye lofty chains of slender
pyramids of faint lilac hue, which, when examined with the highest
power of the instrument, were seen to be monstrous amethysts reach-
ing to the height of 60 to 90 feet, and glowing in the intense light of
the sun. It must not be supposed that such delightful regions were
devoid of life. Birds and beasts of strange and uncouth form were
soon brought to view, and, last and greatest marvel of all, the observer
was permitted to behold beings of manlike form. Although not seen
engaged in any work of industry or art, they were evidently of a high
order of intelligence, and to them was doubtless due a magnificent
temple, built of polished sapphire, with roof of yellow gold. The
observer did not at the moment pause to search out the mystery syin-
bolized in the unique architectural details, for he was then “more desir-
ous of collecting the greatest possible number of new facts than of
indulging in speculative theories, however seductive to the imagination.”

But we have already dwelt too long upon this product of enterprising

journalism, which poor Sir John was too far away to be able to contra-

dict. It is enough to remark that the author accomplished his immedi-
ate purpose, and moreover bequeathed to future generations a classic
in this special field of literature.

The astronomer of to-day is unfortunately exposed to similar mis-
representation. On account of the fact that it is a little larger than
any other refractor, the Yerkes telescope is particularly open to attack.
Take, for example, these sentences from a newspaper which would not
ordinarily be considered as one of the sensational class: “After Pro-
fessor Barnard had swept the sky in the region of the nebule he pointed
the instrument toward a region located to the astronomer in Pos. 312
degrees; Dist. 53 minutes. He swung the giant tube toward the region,
and the first discovery at the Yerkes Observatory was registered on the
dial near the dome.” ‘This is merely the newspaper’s own peculiar way
of paraphrasing a simple statement in the Astrophysical Journal regard-
ing the detection of a faint star near Vega. A persistent search by all
the members of the staff has not yet brought to light the mysterious
“‘dial near the dome,” with its precious record of discovery. It seems
probable that the same dial must have treasured up the remarkable
observations of the moon, which the Associated Press thought worthy
of transmission to Europe, though they originated in a reporter’s fertile
128 THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES.

brain, and still remain unknown to the telescope to which they were
ascribed. -An influential newspaper selected these latter observations
as the text of an editorial setting forth the marvelous benefits the
Yerkes telescope is destined to confer upon mankind.

It may be added that the great telescope of the “moon hoax” is
hardly more extravagant in conception than certain schemes which have
been proposed in all seriousness within the past year. One of these
inventors, whose familiarity with the difficulties of telescopic observa-
tion is certainly surpassed by his optimism, remarks: ‘I think the limit
(of magnification) will be due to the shaking of the instrument caused
by the trembling of the earth and of the clockwork mechanism which
moves the telescope. Under these high magnifications extremely mi-
nute vibrations are so much magnified that a small object like that of a
house upon the surface of Mars would dart in and out of the field of
vision so as to prevent its being photographed.” And this he believes
to be the only obstacle (though fortunately it is to be overcome) which
can interfere with his studies of Martian architecture.

So far we have considered only what great telescopes can not accom-
plish, and were I not to pass rapidly on to some positive statements of
another character I might be supposed to believe that they have no
reason for existence, or at best are no better than small ones. But I
shall endeavor to show that exactly the contrary is true; that while
large telescopes do not possess the extraordinary powers conferred upon
them by fertile imaginations, they nevertheless play a most important
part in scientific research, and render possible many investigations
which are altogether beyond the reach of smaller instruments. It seems
the more necessary to dwell upon this point, for only a few years ago
there appeared in print an article entitled ‘‘Do large telescopes pay?”
which was evidently not written by one of those to whom reference has
just been made, but by one of another class, whose known acquaintance
with astronomical work would tend to give his opinion considerable
weight with many intelligent readers. In discussing the subject it was
seriously asked whether the great investments of money which had been
made in the giant instruments of the latter half of the nineteenth cen-
tury had been attended by commensurate advances in astronomical
knowledge. The question is certainly one that deserves serious con-
sideration, for it would surely be poor policy to erect great telescopes
if they are no better than smaller and much cheaper ones. It is desir-
able, therefore, to point out, if I can, some of the elements of superiority
of large instruments which seem to me to make them worth all that
they cost and more.

Leaving aside reflecting telescopes, as most of the very costly instru-
ments in use are refractors, it will be seen that our problem is, for the
most part, a comparison of the proprieties of alarge achromatic lens
with those of a small one. To render the discussion more definite let
us compare a 40-inch lens of 62 feet focus with a 10-inch lens of 153 feet
YHE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES. 129

- focus. The large lens, then, has a diameter four times that of the small
one, which means that its area is sixteen times as great. It will thus
receive upon its surface from a given star sixteen times as much light,
and all of this will be concentrated in the point-like image of the star,
except that portion which is lost in transmission through the lens. On
account of its greater thickness the large lens transmits only about 65
per cent of the visual rays that fall on it, while the small lens trans-
mits about 77 per cent. But after allowance has been made for the loss
due to both absorption and reflection it is found that the image of a
given star produced by the large telescepe will be nearly fourteen times
as bright as that given by the small one. In this instance all of the
light is concentrated in a point, but in the case of a planet or other
extended object, on account of the fact that the focal length of the tele-
scope increases as its aperture increases, the brightness of the image is
no greater with the large glass than with the small one. The image is,
however, four times as large, and this has a most important bearing
upon certain classes of observations, particularly in photographic and
spectroscopic work.

There remains still another peculiarity of the large lens as distin-
guished from the small one. On account of the nature of light, the
power that a lens possesses of separating two luminous points which
are so close together as to be seen as a Single object by the unaided eye
depends directly upon its aperture. Thus, if we consider a double star
the two components of which are separated by a distance of 0.5’ of are,
it will be barely possible with a 10-inch telescope to resolve the star
into two points of light just touching one another. If the members of
the pair are closer than this, they can not be separated with a 10-inch
glass, no matter whatmagnifying power is used. With a 40-inch tele-
scope, on the other hand, it is not only a simple matter to separate
Stars 0.5’ apart, but it is even possible to distinguish as two points of
light the components of a double star of only 0.12” separation.

To sum up, then, we see that the principal advantages of a 40-inch
object glass as compared with one of 10 inches aperture are, first, its
power. of giving much brighter star images, and thus of rendering
visible faint stars which can not be seen with the smaller telescopes;
second, the fact that it gives at its focus an image of any object, other
than a star, four times as large as the image given by a lens of one-
fourth its aperture and focal length; and, third, its capacity of render-
ing visible as separate objects the components of very close double
Stars or minute markings upon the surface of a planet or satellite.
Mention should be made here of the fact that the large glass assuredly
has some disadvantages as compared with the smaller one, particularly
in that it requires better atmospheric conditions to bring out its full
qualities. But [ think it will be seen from what follows that these dis-
advantages are by no means sufficient to offset the great advantages
possessed by the larger instrument, Let us now consider what practi-

sm 98——9

cal benefit the astronomer enjoys from the special properties of large
lenses which have just been enumerated.

Like other scientific men, astronomers who expect to accomplish
much of importance at the present day find it necessary to specialize,
and to devote their attention to certain classes of work in which long
study and experience have given them particular skill. Thus it is that
to some astronomers certain of the advantages of a large telescope
appeal much more strongly than do others. In fact, in order to derive
the best results from the use of the instrument it is necessary to have
observations made with it by men who are capable of bringing out its
best qualities in various kinds of investigation. Thus the first-men-
tioned property of rendering visible faint objects should be utilized by
an astronomer who has gained much experience in searching for and
measuring objects at the very limit of vision. One who has not given
special attention to this class of work would be surprised to see in a
large telescope certain of the faint stars or satellites of whose discov-
ery he may have read. When the fifth satellite of Jupiter was discov-
ered at the Lick Observatory by Professor Barnard, in 1892, claims
were put forward by certain amateur astronomers who possessed small
telescopes that they themselves were entitled to the honor of the dis-
covery, for they had seen the satellite long before. Such claims might
be taken in earnest by one unfamiliar with the instruments employed
by the respective observers. But it is only necessary to examine this
minute object with a 36-inch or a 40-inch telescope in order to appre-
ciate the great merit of the discovery and the absurdity of such claims
as have been mentioned. The tiny satellite is so faint that hitherto it
has been seen with very few telescopes, all of them having large aper-
tures. In its rapid motion close to the surface of the great planet it is
completely invisible to an eye unprotected from the brilliant hght of
Jupiter. ven the close approach of one of the other satellites is suf-
ficient to cause it to disappear. In measuring the satellite Professor
Barnard finds it necessary to reduce the light of Jupiter with a piece
of smoked mica, through which the planet is still clearly visible and
easily measurable, though not annoying to the eye. Without an
instrument like the Lick telescope the fifth satellite of Jupiter would
never have been known. It may be interesting to mention here that
Professor Barnard’s recent measures of this satellite with the Yerkes
telescope have shown that his original determination of the time of its
revolution in its orbit, made five years ago at Mount Hamilton, was not
in error more than 0.03 second. It was found that the time of elonga-
tion differed less than half a minute from the time predicted in the
Nautical Almanac. The period is now known within a few thousandths |
of a second. In this connection, also, it is well to add that Prof. Asaph
Hall’s discovery in 1877 of the two small satellites of Mars was directly
due to the advantage given him by the large aperture of the 26-inch
telescope at the United States Naval Observatory.
4

Such small members of the solar system are by no means the only
feebly luminous objects which great telescopes have brought to light.
Faint stars in the close proximity of bright ones are usually beyond
the reach of small telescopes. Thus the companion of Sirius was not
seen until 1862, when the late Alvan G. Clark encountered it jn his
tests of the 18-inch objective now at the Dearborn Observatory, which
was the largest glass that had been constructed up to that time. The
small companion to Procyon, discovered not long ago by Professor
Schaeberle with the Lick telescope, is another object of the same type.
These are conspicuous examples of that great class of objects known
as double stars, which consist of two stars revolving about their com-
mon center of gravity. From the third advantage of large instruments,
to which reference has already been made, it will be seen that they are
peculiarly adapted for the investigation of these binary systems, not
only because of their power to show faint objects in the neighborhood
of brighter ones, but also on account of their capacity to separate two
closely adjacent stars which in a smaller instrument would be seen as
one. Thanks to this property, many interesting binary systems whose
components are exceedingly close together have been found by Pro-
fessor Burnham with the Lick telescope, and, although he has devoted
no special attention to a search for such objects, Professor Barnard has
already encountered several of them in his work with the Yerkes
refractor. From what the spectroscope has taught us of binary sys-
tems, we have every reason to believe that telescopes may go on
increasing in aperture almost indefinitely without ever arriving at the
possibility of separating into their component parts all existing double
stars. As has been stated, the Yerkes telescope can show as distinct
objects stars which are no farther apart than 0.12” of arc, and on
account of the elongation of the image a double star whose compo-
nents are only 0.1’ apart can be distinguished from a single star. But
there undoubtedly exist stars far closer together than this, some of
which can be separated by an aperture of not less than 40 feet.

There has been much discussion in recent years regarding the rela-
tive advantage of large and small telescopes for observations of the
markings on planets. I do not propose to enter into the details of this
discussion, partly because my own investigations are primarily con-
cerned with observations of another nature, and thus have not espe-
cially qualified me to form an opinion on this point, and partly on
account of the fact that additional arguments in favor of large instru-
ments would serve little purpose. It seems to me only necessary for an
unprejudiced person to examine a planet first with a small telescope of
from 5 to 15 inches aperture, and then to look at the same object with

_ an instrument of 36 or 40 inches aperture, under identical atmospheric
conditions. When the seeing is distinctly bad, that is, when the
_ atmosphere is in so disturbed a state that the images are blurred and
unsteady, the smaller instrument will assuredly show all that can be

seen with the larger one. But with better atmospheric conditions, to
my eye at least, the advantage lies wholly on the side of the larger
instrument, whether the object be the moon, Jupiter, Mars, or Saturn.
In the case of the moon particularly, much fine detail which I have
never been able to see with the 12-inch telescope is clearly and beauti-
fully visible with the 40-inch. I am certainly inclined to think that
large telescopes are greatly to be preferred to small ones for work of
this character. But I give much less weight to my own opinion on this
subject than to that of Professor Barnard, who for many years has.
