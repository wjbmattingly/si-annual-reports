PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING HELD JANUARY 26, 1898.

In accordance with the resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday of January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (Mr. Chief Justice Fuller), in the chair;
the Hon. Garret A. Hobart, Vice President of the United States; the
Hon. J.8. Morrill; the Hon. George Gray; the Hon. Joseph Wheeler;
the Hon. R. R. Hitt; the Hon. Robert Adams, jr.; the Hon. William
L. Wilson; the Hon. J. B. Henderson; the Hon. Alexander Graham
Bell; and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were presented from Senator Cullom and
Dr. William Preston Johnston.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read the minutes of
the last meeting in abstract.

The Chancellor said, in relation to the matter of the appointment of
an Acting Secretary, that he had found that his predecessor, when he
made an appointment of this kind, occasionally, he could not say always,
reported it to the Board, and as he had made an appointment of an
Acting Secretary last May, he would read its terms as a report to the
Board:

Whereas it has been signified to the undersigned, Chancellor of the Smithsonian
Institution, that the contingency of the inability of the Secretary of the Smithso-
nian Institution to discharge the duties of that office is about to arise, by reason of
his absence from the United States;

Now, therefore, by the authority conferred on me by the act of Congress entitled
“An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsoniau
Institution,” approved May 13, 1884 (23 Stat., 21), I hereby appoint Mr. Richard
Rathbun an Assistant Secretary of the Institution, to act as Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution during the inability of the Secretary to perform its duties.

Given under my hand at Washington, D. C., this 22d day of May, A. D. 1897.

MELVILLE W. FULLER,
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.

There being no further remarks, the Chancellor declared the minutes
approved.

The Secretary said that he had the sad duty to officially announce
the death of Mr. Gardiner G. Hubbard, a late resident Regent of the

Institution.
XI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Mr. Wilson then offered the following resolutions:

Whereas the Hon. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a citizen Regent and a member of
the Executive Committee of the Smithsonian Institution, died at his residence in
this city on the 11th day of December, 1897;

Resolved, That the Regents of the Institution place upon their records this testi-
monial of their respect and admiration for Mr. Hubbard, as a singularly public-
spirited citizen, an ever-generous promoter of education, and active patron of
scieutific work; and this expression of their sincere regret for the loss of a colleague
and friend, whose life was adorned by so many personal virtues and whose associa-
tion with them has left so many endearing memories.

Resolved, That a copy of this minute be engrossed and transmitted to the family of
Mr. Hubbard.

General Wheeler said that Mr. Hubbard had impressed him so favor-
ably by his public spirit and by the great good he had done, that he
considered his death a loss not only to this Institution and to his friends,
but to the entire country.

On motion the resolutions were adopted by a rising vote.

The Secretary announced the appointment and reappointment of
Regents as follows:

Senator Justin S. Morrill reappointed by the Vice-President on March
15, 1897.

Mr. Joseph Wheeler, Mr. R. R. Hitt, and Mr. Robert Adams, Po reap-
ed by the Speaker on December 22, 1897.

Mr. J. B. Henderson and Dr. William Preston Johnston reappointed
by joint resolution of January 24, 1898.

Mr. Alexander Graham Bell appointed to the vacancy caused by Mr.
Hubbard’s death, by joint resolution of January 24, 1898.

The Chancellor stated that certain vacancies existed on the Execu-
tive Committee.

Mr. Adams moved—

That Mr. Henderson be reelected Chairman of the Executive Committee.

Oarried.

General Wheeler moved—

That Mr. Alexander Graham Bell be elected to fill the vacancy on the Executive
Committee caused by the death of Mr. Hubbard.

Carried.

The Secretary presented his annual report of the operations of the
Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, stating that there
was very little to say in addition to the printed report, which he hoped
was self-explanatory, though he might add that he did not think there
had been any time in the history of the Institution when it had given
more gratifying evidence of its importance and growth. What it had
done in the way of publication during this period could be seen by a
glance at the table upon which the numerous new volumes were placed
for scrutiny.

On motion the report was accepted.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Senator Henderson presented the report of the Executive Committee
and explained that it brought the financial matters of the Institution
up to the 30th of June last.

On motion the report was adopted.

Senator Henderson introduced the customary resolution relative to
income and expenditure, which was adopted as follows:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1899, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secre-
tary with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part of
the Secretary as to items.

Senator Henderson, on behalf of the Permanent Committee, stated
that he had made a report at the last annual meeting on the condition
of the affairs of the Hodgkins and Avery Bequests, and that there was
. very little to add to it.

In regard to the Hodgkins fund, Dr. M. L. Chambers, the Executor of
Mr. Hodgkins, had lately requested to be relieved of his trust in connec-
tion with the estate. He still held the proceeds of two mortgage notes
amounting to about $10,000, having received notice that he would be
held responsible upon a warranty given by Mr. Hodgkins to Edward
Smith, of the title of certain premises in New York City. The case was
then pending in the Court of Appeals, and was expected to come up
for trial soon. Everything was going along properly and the Chair-
man hoped that at the next annual meeting he would be in a position
to make a report of the entire disposition of the property.

Concerning the Avery bequest, Senator Henderson said that Robert
Stanton Avery, who died at Washington on September 12, 1894, left the
bulk of his property to the Smithsonian Institution. His will was
probated February 2, 1895, the executrix had filed a first account, and
the estate was now nearly administered upon.

The personal estate was invested in Northern Pacific Railroad bonds,
which had to be sold at a very great discount on their face value. The
Institution was now in possession of five pieces of real estate and four
houses, located in northeast and southeast Washington. One of these,
the home of the testator, had been occupied since his death by the
executrix, Miss Avery, at a small rent. This property had been valued
by experts employed by the Institution at $4,750. Miss Avery offered
for it $4,500, the same to be set off against an allowance of $4,500 for
her services to her late uncle during his illness. Although this offer
was $250 less than the expert valuation, all things considered it seemed
a wise course to accept it, and this had lately been done.

One of the pieces of property stood in the name of the testator’s wife,
but his will expressly stated that he furnished the money for its pur-
chase, and the property was his. The Institution filed a bill in equity -
to enjoin the heirs at law of Mrs. Avery from asserting ownership. In
the Equity Court the prayer of the bill was granted. The Court of
Appeals reversed this decision, and the Institution carried the case to
XIV JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

the Supreme Court of the United States, where it was argued on the
12th instant.

The entire property, provided the suit in the Supreme Court was
favorably decided, would amount to about $30,000; otherwise, to about
$24,000. The houses were in good condition, and were bringing a fair
rental.

Miss Avery had presented a claim of $6,000 as compensation for the
very trying duties she had to perform in the care of her uncle. She
prosecuted her suit before the Probate Court, and the Permanent Com-
mittee had come to the conclusion, when the facts were presented, that
it would be better that she should be settled with than to go to a jury,
and they compromised on a settlement of $4,500. She now offered to
take the property at that figure in lieu of the money, and the Commit-
tee thought it was advisable to accept the offer; but the attorney
recently called attention to the fact that there was a doubt as to the
conveyance and the making of deeds by the Institution.

It seemed to him (Senator Henderson) that if the Institution were
authorized to hold property, it should certainly also by some means be
authorized to convey or exchange this property. The rental of this
particular piece did not much more than pay taxes and it was con-
sidered desirable to get rid of it. In order to meet the difficulty as to
conveyance, he would offer the following resolution, expressing the
opinion that it was the best arrangement that could be made:

Resolved by the Board of Regents, That the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
is authorized and empowered to sell and convey, on such terms as may seem to him
most beneficial to the Institution, any and all lands, town lots, and improvements
thereon, which were devised or conveyed to said institution by R. 8S. Avery, deceased.

And in the execution of the power hereby conferred on him, the Secretary shall
execute to the vendees, respectively, written conveyances signed and acknowledged
by himself as Secretary aforesaid, and attested by the seal of the Smithsonian
Institution.

Senator Henderson stated that this covered the matters under the
charge of the Permanent Committee, except one of minor importance,
which had already been before the Board, namely, the question as to
whether Congress should be asked to remit taxes on real estate belong-
ing to the Institution.

The Chancellor said that three matters were under consideration :

1. In regard to the report. On motion, the report was accepted.

2. On the adoption of the resolution with regard te conveying real
estate. On motion, the resolution was adopted.

3. A general discussion then ensued in regard to the exemption from
taxation of the Avery property, and while no formal action was taken,
the prevailing opinion was that it was better to pay the taxes than to
ask exemption of Congress.

The Secretary announced his acceptance of the resignation of Prof.
Charles D. Walcott as Acting Assistant Secretary in Charge of the
National Museum, to take effect on July 1, 1898, and requested the
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

authority of the Board to transfer to that position, if it seemed best
for the Museum’s interests, the present Assistant Secretary in Charge
of Office and Exchanges, Mr. Richard Rathbun. The Board then
adopted the following resolution:

Resolved, That the restriction placed upon the duties of Mr. Richard Rathbun by
the terms of his appointment, approved by the Board on February 1, 1897, be
removed, to permit of his assignment by the Secretary to such duty as he may deem
best for the interests of the Institution; this to take effect not before July 1, 1898.

The Secretary asked authority to use a portion of the accrued
interest of the Hodgkins Fund in connection with his experiments in
mechanical flight. After discussion the Board adopted the following
resolution:

That the Board authorize any expenditures hereafter to be made from the income
of the Hodgkins Fund, having the approval of the Executive Committee, in regard
to the expenses of certain experiments being conducted by the Secretary in
mechanical flight; and that a report of these expenditures shall be submitted to
the Board at its next annual meeting.

The question being put, the motion was carried.
The Secretary said:

I explained last year to the Board the great difficulties which the Civil Service
rules introduced in making an appointment to the scientific bureaus of the Institu-
tion, and I again ask their attention to the letter of their colleague, Dr. Wilson,
then Postmaster-General, which I submitted to them at that time, as follows:

“OFFICE OF POSTMASTER-GENERAL,
““ Washington, D. C., January 25, 1897.
“(DEAR PROFESSOR LANGLEY: I submitted to the President the letter you gave me.
He seemed favorably inclined to your suggestion that the Assistant Secretary and
the four heads of bureaus should be excepted, and retained the letter, saying that
he would at once send it to the Civil Service Commission for that purpose. Unless
the Commission, therefore, make some adverse report, substantial enough to arrest
his inclination, I think the exception will be made.
“Yours, truly, W. L. WILSON.
“Prof. S. P. LANGLEY.”

I have twice urged upon the Commission the desirability of making this exception,
but they have not done so, though the head of the Commission expresses a willing-
ness to go with me to the President in asking him to make any specific exception to
some specific name, but this is not what the late President of the United States (as
interpreted by the late Postmaster-General) meant, for the President recognized,
when the subject was brought to his attention, that it was probably a very difficult
matter to get any man who was competent to take one of those positions, and espe-
cially that of the Assistant Secretary in Charge of the Museum, to stand an examina-
tion. Since this, an additional year’s experience has led me to feel that I may yet
be glad to see excepted, if not all positions in the Bureaus under the Board’s control,
then at least all scientific positions under them. I desire the instructions of the
Board on this point.

After some discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to request of the President such a modi-
fication of the Civil Service regulations relating to appointments as will permit an
exemption of such scientific positions under the Smithsonian Institution as the Sec-
retary may deem best for the interests of the Institution.
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINFS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The report of a special committee, of which Mr. Hubbard had been
chairman, was submitted by Senator Henderson, pointing out the need
for the National Museum of a new building, as well as an increase in
the scientific staff and a definite purchasing fund; for the Bureau of
American Ethnology the desirability of the passage of a law declaring
archeological sites on the public domain public monuments; and for
the National Zoological Park the need of greater facilities for the pur-
chase and housing of animals.

There was also a further suggestion of the form which the reports of
bureau officers on the property in their charge should assume.

Mr. Hitt moved—

That the report of the special committee be accepted and the commictee be dis-
charged.

Carried.
Senator Morrill here said:

As some of you know, I have been urging a new museum building for about ten
years. The bills 1 have introduced have passed through the Senate several times,
but never through the House. I may say now that I shall not live long enough to
get the measure completed. It was heretofore contemplated that there should be
a Museum building on the west of the Smithsonian building, in a position corre-
sponding with the present Museum building, and these two were to be connected
by a building on B street, thus making the largest museum in the country. I have
now about decided to abandon that plan and try to secure the building on B street
first. I merely state this in order to ascertain whether the change of plan is favored
by the Board of Regents.

It was moved—

That the Board approve the suggestion made by Senator Morrill in regard to a
new building for the National Museum.

Seconded and carried.

There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion
it adjourned.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payment from the
Smithsonian income during the year ending June 30, 1898, each of
which bears the approval of the Secretary or, in his absence, of the
Acting Secretary, and a certificate that the materials and services
charged were applied to the purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the several appro-
priations committed by Congress to the Institution, and finds that the
balances hereinbefore given correspond with the certificates of the dis-
bursing clerk of the Smithsonian Institution, whose appointment as
such disbursing officer has been accepted and his bond approved by
the Secretary of the Treasury.

The quarterly accounts current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

Statement of regular income from the Smithsonian fund available for use in the year end-
ing June 30, 1899.

of the Board, resolutions were unanimously adopted by a rising vote,
which will be found under the heading Necrology.

Dr. Alexander Graham Bell was appointed a regent (to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Hubbard) by joint resolution,
approved by the President of the United States on January 24, 1898.
Gen. John B. Henderson and Dr. William Preston Johnston were
reappointed by the same joint resolution. Senator Morrill was
reappointed by the President of the Senate on March 15, 1897, and the
Hon. Joseph Wheeler, the Hon. R. R. Hitt, and the Hon. Robert
Adams, jr. (Representatives), were reappointed by the Speaker of the
House on December 22, 1897.

Mr. Bell was elected a member of the executive committee, of which
General Henderson was reelected chairman.

The Secretary presented his annual report of operations to June 30,
1897, which was accepted. Reports were also presented by General
Henderson as chairman of both the executive and the permanent
committees.

The Secretary announced his acceptance of the resignation of Prof.
Charles D, Walcott as Acting Assistant Secretary in Charge of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

National Museum, and the Board passed a resolution modifying the
terms of the appointment of Mr. Richard Rathbun as Assistant Secre-
tary, so that his services might be utilized wherever it was deemed
best for the interests of the Institution.

The report of a special committee, of which Mr. Hubbard had been
chairman, was submitted by General Henderson, pointing out the need
for the National Museum of a new building, as well as an increase in
the scientific staff and a definite purchasing fund; for the Bureau of
American Ethnology the desirability of the passage of a law declaring
archeological sites on the public domain public monuments; and for
the National Zoological Park the need of greater facilities for the
purchase and housing of animals.

With regard to the recommendation of the desirability of the passage
of a law declaring archeological sites on the public domain public
monuments, a form of proposed legislation has been prepared which
may later be brought to the attention of the Congressional Regents in
their legislative capacity.

There was also a further suggestion of the form which the reports of
bureau officers on the property in their charge should assume, all of
which matters have had the Secretary’s attention.

At the beginning of the Spanish-American war the Hon. Joseph
Wheeler, a regent, was appointed major-general of United States Vol-
unteers, and went with the army to Cuba, where his service is matter
of public record. Dr. Andrew D. White, a regent, has been appointed
ambassador to Germany, and Dr. James B. Angell, another regent,
minister to Turkey. These gentlemen are still regents, though the
Institution has during the year been deprived of their valued services.

ADMINISTRATION.

As the business of the Institution itself and of the various Govern-
ment bureaus under its direction increases from year to year, the question
of administration and of a proper division of its cost among the various
bureaus becomes more pressing. It has been the purpose of the Secre-
tary to delegate to those in immediate charge of the bureaus as much

authority as is consistent with his responsibilities to the Board of

Regents and to Congress. The gradual growth of the bureaus both in
number and importance has thrown into the Secretary’s office a very
considerable amount of clerical labor pertaining almost exclusively to
Government work, and while the cost of clerical service for this central
control has been divided among the bureaus where practicable, yet
the limited income of the Institution must be drawn upon in larger
measure than seems proper until a suitable time for the organization
of a force, paid from an appropriation specifically for this purpose.
The Board has already authorized the Secretary to call upon Congress
for such an appropriation, but each year obstacles have arisen render-
ing action inexpedient.
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
FINANCES.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1897, the unexpended
balance, as stated in my last annual report, was $61,532.50. The total
receipts for the year were $67,178.22, being $56,400 derived from the
interest on the permanent fund in the Treasury and elsewhere, and
$10,778.22 received from miscellaneous sources.

The disbursements for the year amounted to $62,907.70, the details of
- which are given in the report of the executive committee. The balance
remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1898, for the
expenses of the Institution, was $65,803.02, which includes $10,000
referred to in previous reports, $5,000 of which was received from the
estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like sum from Dr. Alexander Gra-
ham Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the Secretary to promote
certain physical researches. This latter sum was, with the donor’s
consent, deposited by the Secretary to the credit of the current funds
of the Institution.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
and other funds, which is held against certain contingent obligations,
besides relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which
may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific investiga-
tions and publications in progress.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming part
of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of the prop-
erties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the fun-
damental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

Lotalspermanent tun dies sepa eee eee ee eee

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding with the original bequest the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of
the purposes thereof.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Under this section, 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the above fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the
United States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest
alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

During the fiscal year 1897-98 Congress charged the Institution with
the disbursement of the following appropriations:

The executive committee has examined all the vouchers for disburse-
ments made during the fiscal year, and a detailed statement of the
receipts and expenditures will be found reported to Congress, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October 2, 1888,
and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House
of Representatives.

The vouchers for all of the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to by
the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury
were as follows:

HAMILTON FUND.

The original amount of $1,000, the bequest of Mr. James Hamilton,
of Pennsylvania, received by the Institution in 1874, was increased in
1895 to $2,000 by the addition of accumulated interest under authority
given by the Regents in their meeting of January 23, 1895, the sum of
$150 expended from the income of fund in 1876 for explorations having
been refunded. The present income, together with interest accumulated
since 1895, seems to warrant some definite application of the interest
on the bequest, and I am now considering a plan of iectureships in
accordance with the testator’s purpose.

AVERY FUND.

Concerning the Avery fund I have to report that by a decision of the
Supreme Court of the United States the Institution has obtained a
clear title to the property on Capitol Hill claimed by the heirs of Mrs.
Avery. The executrix of the estate has settled her accounts, and a
small balance in cash has been paid to the Institution. Certain stocks
and bonds are held by a trust company, the income to be paid over to
Miss Avery during her lifetime, and upon her death the principal is to
be paid to the Institution. The Institution also holds some small pieces
of real estate which it is not deemed wise to dispose of at present. The
Commissioners of the District of Columbia have freed this property
from all claim for taxes. .

It may be recalled that the testator, while leaving his property abso-
lutely at the disposal of the Regents, expressed a wish that it might be

‘Item withdrawn, as the collection had been sold.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

made useful in promoting researches on the Ether, after certain mathe-
matical and phonetic publications and certain researches connected
with a special form of telescope had been made. The moneys received
from the estate are as yet too small to carry out any part of this pur-
pose but the last.

BUILDINGS.

No alterations were made in the Smithsonian Building during the
year except such slight repairs as seemed necessary to keep it in good
condition. The space in the rear of the building, however, which fora
number of years had been occupied by unsightly and dangerous storage
sheds and workshops, has been cleared of these and graded into a lawn,
thus very greatly improving the surroundings.

In the park south of the building, and at a distance sufficient to
prevent annoyance, there has been erected a temporary wooden
building of two stories for the use of the taxidermists and for other
purposes.

The investigations being prosecuted in the Astrophysical Observa-
tory requiring more space than is available in the old structure, plans
have been approved and some progress made toward the erection of
some very simple additions authorized by Congress at its last session by
a clause permitting the expenditure for this purpose of an unexpended
balance of the annual appropriation for the maintenance of the observ-
atory.

Four additional galleries have been erected in the Museum Building,
three for-exhibition purposes and one to serve as an increase for the
quarters for the Library, thus adding 6,650 square feet to the floor
space of the Museum, 6,040 square feet of which is available for exhi-
" bition purposes.

RESEARCH.

The promotion of original research has always been one of the prin-
cipal functions of the Institution. Investigations in the anthropological,
biological, and geological divisions of science have been extensively
carried on through the departments of the National Museum, and in
the Bureau of American Ethnology there have also been special
inquiries into Indian customs and languages. These lines of research
being well represented by its bureaus, it has remained for the Institu-
tion proper to devote its energies more especially to some of the physical
sciences. ;

The Secretary himself has carried on researches in the solar spectrum,
which, by the active assistance of the Aid in charge, have produced
results now shortly to be published. They are believed to be impor-
tant and are referred to in another portion of this report.

The Secretary has not wholly discontinued the studies which he has
made in regard to aerodromic experiments, and it is perhaps not
improper that he should state that these have attracted the attention
8 é REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of other departments so far that during the war with Spain a commis-
sion was directed by the Secretaries of War and the Navy to inquire
into them with a view of their possible utility in war. This is not the
place to state the results of these inquiries.

The Secretary desires to repeat, however, that his time is almost solely
given to administrative work, and that what he has been able to do in
these directions has been done largely in hours which he might consider
his own.

In addition, some very important investigations have been made and
others are in progress, by specialists, in the fundamental laws of sound,
of gases, the upper atmosphere, and on impure air and other important
questions, which are mentioned somewhat more in detail under the
heading of the Hodgkins fund.

HODGKINS FUND.

Although the Hodgkins fund competition announced by the Institu-
tion in the widely distributed circular of March 31, 1893, was definitely
closed so long ago as December 31, 1894, a very general interest is still
expressed in the subject, and specialists in our own and other countries
not infrequently forward copies of their original published memoirs as
contributions to the Hodgkins fund library of the Institution.

Frequent applications for grants are received, and, notwithstanding
the fact that the limitations on the use of the fund do not permit it to
be employed for the support of an investigation, unless under the
exceptional conditions of the first published announcement, it has still
been found practicable to approve several awards during the past year.

As noted in my last report, in July, 1897, an additional grant of $400
was made to Mr. A. Lawrence Rotch, of the Blue Hill Meteorological
Observatory, Readville, Mass., and in the following October a further
grant of $250 was approved to Mr. Rotch. These sums are to be devoted
to experiments with automatic kites, for determining, by means of self-
recording instruments, meteorological data in atmospheric strata
inaccessible except by some mechanical method of exploring the atmos-
phere, and it will be of possible interest to the Board to learn that
during the past year, and (to slightly anticipate), shortly after its close,

experiments of remarkable success and interest have been made by ~

Mr. Rotch, and, among others, that kites have been flown to the
unprecedented height of 11,086 feet above the station, carrying up
with them meteorological instruments which recorded the height, the
pressure of the wind, the dew point, and other facts of interest at
these great altitudes.

Those who remember the situation of Blue Hill, one of the highest
landmarks on the Atlantic coast north of the southern shores of the
Gulf, and the aspect of the hills, blue with the distance from which
they take their name, may be struck by the certainly notable fact that
in these experiments the kites sent up from Blue Hill, and held there
at the station, were occasionally directly over the distant ocean.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

November 1, 1897, a grant of $500 was made to Prof. William
Hallock, of Columbia University, New York City, for an investigation
having for its object the complete analysis of a particle of air under
the influence of articulate sounds, thus contributing a study of the
atmosphere in one of its most important functions, that of a conveyer
of speech.

In February, 1898, a final grant of $250 was made to Drs. Lummer
and Pringsheim, of the Physical Institute of the University of Berlin.
The investigation begun by them, in 1893, to determine the ratio of the
specific heats, at constant pressure and volume, for air, oxygen, car-
bondioxide, and hydrogen, has now so far progressed that the memoir
submitted by Drs. Lummer and Pringsheim, noting the results already
attained by them, has been published by the Institution in the Smith-
sonian Contribution to Knowledge.

A German edition of this original memoir, with the consent of the
Institution, is to be published by the authors, and it is understood
that, if found desirable, their research will be further prosecuted under
the direction of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, of Berlin,
Professor Dr. Kohlrausch, the president, having courteously signified
the readiness of that institution to furnish the means necessary for the
purpose.

In February, 1898, an additional grant of $250 was made to Mr. EH.
C. C. Baly, of University College, London, to enable him to continue
his research upon the decomposition of the atmosphere by electricity,
and upon the ozonizing of mercury. The report of Mr. Baly, stating
the result of these investigations, is now awaited by the Institution.

A grant of $250 to Prof. Arthur G. Webster, of Clark University,
Worcester, Mass., was approved in May, 1898, for the continuation of
a research on the properties of air in connection with the propagation
of sound, special effort being directed to the securing of data relating
to the influence of the viscosity of air on expiring or vanishing sounds.
An instrument devised by Professor Webster for use in this investiga-
tion gives the physical measure of a sound, not only when constant, but
when rapidly varying. It is expected that this research will furnish
results of high practical value in connection with the question of the
acoustics of auditoriums, and will contribute information upon points
- that have not heretofore been satisfactorily investigated.

A paper embodying the results of the interesting research, described
in the Secretary’s report for 1894, primarily conducted under a grant
from the Hodgkins fund to Dr. J. 8. Billings and Dr. 8. Weir Mitchell,
and continued, under their supervision, by Dr. D. H. Bergey, of the
Laboratory of Hygiene, University of Pennsylvania, has been pub-
lished in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Although the terms of acceptance of the Hodgkins bequest preclude
any general allotment of the accruing interest in the way of grants, no
request for an appropriation is left unconsidered, and any application
for the aid of a promising research in the hands of an investigator who
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

is able to comply with the strict, though not unreasonable, conditions
which necessarily govern the expenditure of this fund, is sure of
serious consideration.

NAPLES TABLE.

Among the applications for the occupancy of the Smithsonian seat at
the Naples table during the years 1897-98, the following have been
favorably acted upon:

Dr. Bradley M. Martin, of the University of Chicago, whose work has
been chiefly in the field of the alge, and who has published several
papers detailing his researches, was appointed for November, 1897, his
period at Naples to be supplemented by additional investigation in the
laboratory of Dr. Strasburger, of the University at Bonn.

Dr. H. W. Conn, of the department of biology, Wesleyan University,
received the appointment for six weeks early in the year 1898, Dr.
Dohrn, the superintendent of the station, kindly arranging for his
accommodation, although the Smithsonian table was occupied at that
time. The fact that Dr. Dohrn finds himself not only willing, but able,
to provide for two or, as in this case, even three students at the Smith-
sonian table during the same period, is a courtesy much appreciated by
the Institution.

Dr. D. M. Mottier, of the State University of Indiana, who wished to
supplement his investigations at Bonn and Leipzig by some weeks at
Naples, was appointed for the months of March and April, 1898.

Dr. W. T. Swingle, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
now honorary custodian of alge in the United States National Museum,
occupied the Smithsonian seat at Naples for an additional month dur-
ing the spring of 1898.

Dr. J. H. Gerould, of Dartmouth College, who prosecuted his inves-
tigations in the laboratory of Professor De Lacaze-Duthiers, at Roscoff,
Finisterre, France, during the summer, was appointed to the Smith-
sonian table at Naples for the month of November, 1898.

Although applications for the privilege of the table are often received
far in advance of the period for which occupancy is desired, in order
that all investigators may be given an equal opportunity to secure
appointment, no application is considered more than six months in
advance of the date for which the seat is desired, and no appointment
is made for a longer period than six months. An occupant is not, how-
ever, debarred from applying for an extension of time or for future
reappointment.

It may be repeated here that with a formal application for appoint-
ment, made to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the can-
didate should submit such credentials as he may desire to have on
record, among which should be an outline of his scientific history and a
list of his published memoirs. Investigators are expected to make a
report to the Institution at the end of their term at the table, or at the
end of three months, in case of a six months’ occupancy.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Pt

During the past year a vacancy in the advisory committee of the
Naples table was caused by the death of Dr. Harrison Allen, who rep-
resented the Association of American Anatomists. Dr. Theodore Gill,
of Washington, has been appointed to fill the vacancy, Dr. G. S.
Huntington, of New York, to be held as alternate. During the absence
in Europe of Dr. C. W. Stiles, the duties of Secretary of the Commit-
tee have been performed by Dr. Albert Hassall, of the Department of
Agriculture.

The Secretary is under continued obligation to the committee for
valuable aid in the work of examining testimonials and recommending
action with regard to applications for the table.

EXPLORATIONS.

In the plan of organization of the Institution, among examples of
objects for which appropriations may be made, are cited:

Explorations in descriptive natural history and geological, magnet-
ical, and topographical surveys to collect materials for the formation of
a physical atlas of the United States.

Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the different
races of men in North America; also explorations and accurate surveys
of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of our country.!

The first grant made by the Institution for scientific exploration and
field research was in 1848 to Spencer F. Baird, of Carlisle, for the
exploration of the bone caves and the local natural history of south-
eastern Pennsylvania; and during the half century that has elapsed
since the grant to that eminent man, who afterwards became the Sec-
retary of the Institution, every possible encouragement and support
has been given to natural history and ethnological explorations in
America and throughout the world. The income of the Institution has
not permitted the expenditure of large sums for this purpose, but valu-
able advice and instructions have been freely given to explorers con-
nected with Government and private expeditions, and agents of the
Institution have in very many cases participated in these explorations.
In recent years a vast amount of such work has been carried on by the
bureaus under direction of the Institution, a work made possible by
Congressional appropriations for this purpose.

As soon as there seemed a possibility of acquiring new territories as
a result of the present Spanish-American war I began formulating plans
for exploring the possible new regions, and in my next estimates to be
sent to Congress I expect to ask definitely for appropriations under
which exploring parties may be sent to them.

Itis hardly necessary to recall the lasting impression that the French
Government made through the researches of the corps of savants sent
along with the expedition to Egypt. It would seem incumbent upon this
Government, not only for practical economic purposes, but as a contri-

1Smithsonian Report, 1846, pp. 6, 7.
1 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bution to the general intelligence of mankind, to institute scientific
inquiry as to the natural history, geology, geography, ethnology, arche-
ology, and scientific utilities of any new possessions it may acquire.
These inquiries should be made coherently and without clashing on the
part of the various Government interests involved.

During the present year investigations among the American Indians
have been conducted by the Bureau of Ethnology, and several collabo-
rators of the Institution have made natural-history explorations, the
details of which are given in the paragraphs devoted to the National
Museum.

PUBLICATIONS.:

Secretary Henry said “It is chiefly by the publications of the Institu-
tion that its fame is to be spread through the world, and the monument
most befitting the name of Smithson erected to his memory.” From
the beginning of the Institution a considerable portion of its annual in-
come has been expended in publishing the Smithsonian Contributions
to Knowledge and the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Through
these series, supplemented by the Annual Reports printed at the direct
expense of the Government, and the publications of the National
Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, and the American Historical Asso-
ciation, issued under the direction of the Institution, nearly all branches
of human knowledge are represented in the works published during the
last fifty years, which form a library of nearly 250 volumes, beside sev-
eral hundred pamphlet reprints of the memoirs and articles contained
in the serial volumes.

Contributions to Knowledge.x—One new memoir of this series was pub-
lished during the year, the result of investigations by Drs. Lummer
and Pringsheim, of Charlottenburg, Germany, on the ratio of the
specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume of air,
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. This research was aided by a
grant from the Hodgkins fund of the Smithsonian Institution. After
a period of notable advance the kinetic theory of gases seems to have
fallen into temporary abeyance, possibly from a fundamentally imper-
fect understanding of their behavior. Progress in the knowledge of
this fundamental nature of gases may reasonably be looked for from
interpretative researches on their thermal capacity, and this paper may
be considered as a step in this direction. Aside from its exceptional
importance in thermodynamics, the heat ratio is of interest as affording
a clue to the character of the molecule, and Drs. Lummer and Prings-
heim, using a new method, appear to have for the first time reached
coincident results on the incoercible gases examined.

The original edition of the Secretary’s memoir on The Internal Work
of the Wind, published in 1893, having become exhausted, some addi-
tional copies have been printed from the stereotype plates, in which a
few minor changes have been made.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

The Secretary now has in preparation for this series a review of his
investigations in aerodynamics, and in particular of experiments in
developing the principles and methods of mechanical flight.

Miscellaneous Collections.—In this series five works have been pub-
lished since my last report. These are a Catalogue of Scientific and
Technical Periodicals, by Dr. H. C. Bolton; Catalogue of Pacific Coast
Earthquakes, by Prof. EK. S. Holden; Review and Bibliography of
Metallic Carbides, by Prof. J. A. Mathews; Bibliography of Metals of
the Platinum Group, by Prof. J. L. Howe, and a report by Dr. D. H.
Bergey on the results of experiments to determine whether impure
atmosphere produces a detrimental influence upon the animal organism
as shown in greater susceptibility to certain diseases.

There have been also reprinted from the stereotype plates new edi-
tions of the Smithsonian Meteorological, Geographical, and Physical
Tables. A Supplement to the Bibliography of Chemistry, by Dr. H.C.
Bolton, containing about 4,000 additional titles, is in hand, and about
half of the volume had been printed at the close of the year.

Smithsonian reports.—The Annual Reports of the Institution for the
year 1896 and 1897 had not been issued at the close of the fiscal year,
although the volume for 1896 was in the Government bindery, and press-
work was in progress on the report for 1897, their completion having
been delayed by the imperative need of supplying documents required
by Congress for the military departments by reason of the Spanish-
American war.

National Museum publications.—In addition to the Museum volume of
the Smithsonian report, two series of publications are issued directly
by the Museum, the Proceedings and the Bulletin. Of the first series
Volume XIX was completed in bound form, the separate papers having
previously been issued as pamphlets, and seventeen papers comprising
Volume XX were distributed in pamphlet form during the year. A
pamphlet containing instructions for collecting scale insects was pub-
lished as Part L of Bulletin 39, and a circular was issued relating to
the collection and preservation of the bones and teeth of the Mastodon
and Mammoth.

Bureau of Ethnology reports.—The seventeenth report of the Bureau
of Ethnology, for the year ending June 30, 1896, was sent to the Public
Printer on July 6, 1897, and proof reading was completed before June
30, 1898, but actual presswork has not begun. The eighteenth report is
also in the printer’s hands, but no progress has been made beyond the
revision of some first proofs.

Astrophysical Observatory publications.—There has been prepared and
is now ready for publication a full report on the results of the researches
carried on in the-Astrophysical Observatory since its establishment and
this work will probably be printed in quarto form during the next fiscal
year, the cost of the publication being charged to the appropriation for
the Observatory under authority of Congress,
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Historical reports.—The Report of the American Historical Associa-
tion for the year 1896 has been issued in two volumes, the first volume
containing 22 papers on various historical subjects, the second volume
being an exhaustive essay on the proposed amendments of the Consti-
tution of the United States during the first century of its existence by
Dr. H. V. Ames.

The report for the year 1897 was sent to the printer early in June,
1898, and much of it was in type before the fiscal year closed. It con-
tains 20 papers relating to American history, including some of timely
interest on the Cuban question, the Spanish policy in Mississippi after
the treaty of San Lorenzo, and an exhaustive bibliography of Alabama.

These reports are prepared by the association and transmitted to
Congress by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in accord-
ance with the act of incorporation of the association. The series began
with the report for 1889, but until 1894 no extra copies of the reports
were printed for the use of the Institution. The edition is so small
that it permits of distribution only to the most important American
and foreign historical societies in exchange for publications of like
character. .

LIBRARY.

The number of accessions to the library has been greater than at
any time heretofore, the total entries of: volumes, parts of volumes,
pamphlets, and charts reaching 40,715, an increase of nearly 5,000 over
the previous year. The greater part of this has been sent to the
Library of Congress to be placed with the Smithsonian deposit.

The Museum library shows a greatly increased use over last year.
The limited quarters assigned for library purposes in the Museum are ©
so greatly crowded that it has become necessary to provide additional
book room, for which purpose a gallery directly adjoining the library
has been erected and fitted with shelves, where space is provided for
18,000 volumes. This is rendered necessary by the purchase for the
Museum, by Congressional appropriation, of the scientific library of
the late Dr. G. Brown Goode. The Institution is especially fortunate
in being able to obtain this library and the Museum now has the benefit
of possessing the collections of books both of Professor Baird and Dr.
Goode.

The relations between the Institution and the Library of Congress
have been friendly and intimate, as in the past. The entire library has
been transferred to the new building, and the small East stack, together
with the large room adjoining it on the main library floor, have been
assigned for the use of the Smithsonian deposit. ‘Thus far, in the main,
only publications of learned societies have been placed in this stack,
whose supposed capacity is about 175,000 volumes. It is known that
the titles of the Smithsonian publications number something like 350,-
000, but it has not been known until lately how many volumes were
represented. The classification, which is now going on, and the rescue
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

of the volumes from the condition in which they were put together,
rather than assimilated or arranged, in the old crowded quarters, has
enabled an approximate estimate to be made on this point. To what
extent the Institution’s collections have suffered from the crowded con-
dition which has been too publicly known, that I should have any hesi-
tation in thus referring to it, can not be definitely stated. It is believed
that about 100,000 volumes or their equivalent are all that can be con-
tributed to this stack.

The aecumulations of the Smithsonian deposit for the last ten years,
which had been unsorted in the old library, have been brought fairly
under control, though much remains to be done before these will be in
a Satisfactory condition. The present wise organization of the Library
of Congress into departments has yet one omission to which I feel
compelled to call attention as it affects the interests of the Institution.
No special provision was made for the care of the Smithsonian deposit.
Naturally enough in the immense labor which has fallen upon the
Library of Congress, the more pressing needs of the other departments
have been first considered, but I have full confidence that this will soon
be fully attended to.

The never-ending work of writing for exchanges and for the comple-
tion of incomplete sets, to which I have frequently referred, continues.
The time will come when all resources of exchange will fail and when
the deficiences in the important sets can only be provided by appropri-
ation from Congress. While I have had this matter in mind for several
years, I have been reluctant to bring it up for discussion at all until
the Library of Congress was in condition for an intelligent treatment
of the subject.

It will be seen from the library activities, a few of which I have
enumerated, that in spite of the endeavor made by Secretary Henry
to relieve the Institution of all expense of library work in arranging
for the deposit of the Smithsonian library at the Library of Congress,
by degrees a certain amount of such work and with it a very consid-
erable attendant expense has grownup. This I trust will always be
kept at a minimum, and the strength of the Institution, both through
its library work and exchange service, employed for the increase of the
Library of Congress and the Smithsonian deposit at that Library. It is
nevertheless quite plain that no scientific establishment can exist and
perform its functions without at least a considerable working library.

CORRESPONDENCE.

The present system of recording correspondence, which was fully
described in my report for 1890, has proved of great convenience in
handling the constantly increasing number of letters received from
correspondents in all parts of the world. Numerous letters continue
to be received seeking information on scientific and technical questions
as well as on political, economic, historical, and other matters, and,
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

while it has always been the policy of the Institution to give courteous
attention to all such inquiries, it has become impossible to reply in
detail to many of them; the writers, however, are referred to sources of
information. The Institution has, unfortunately, perhaps, come to be
considered a bureau of general as well as of scientific knowledge.

The following rule governing correspondence, adopted by the Regents
in 1855, is still in force.

Resolved, That all correspondence of this Institution with any person
or society shall be conducted by the Secretary, and no assistant or
employee shall write or receive any official letter or communication
pertaining to the affairs of the Institution except under the authority
and by the direction of the Secretary; and all such correspondence

shall be duly registered and recorded in such manner as the Secretary
shall direct.

As interpreted, this resolution is entirely consistent with the free
activities of the Institution and its bureaus in correspondence, the
requisite authority being always understood to be given and exercised
by the person to whom the Secretary delegates it in each instance.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES.

The Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists was held at
Paris from September 5 to September 12,1897. There were thirty-four
members registered from the United States, several of whom were
present and took an active part in the proceedings. Dr. Paul Haupt,
honorary curator of the division of historic archeology in the United
States National Museum and professor of the Semitic languages in the
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, represented the Smithsonian
Institution. There were also delegates from the American Oriental
Society, the American Philosophical Society, the University Archzo-
logical Association of Philadelphia, ete.

The Congress was organized in seven sections: I, Aryan; II, The
far East (including China, Japan, Indo-China, the Indian Archipelago,
etc.); ILI, Mohammedan; IV, Semitic; V, Egypt and Africa; VI,
Archaic Greece and the Orient; VII, Ethnography and Folklore.
Several of these sections were divided into two or three subsections.

Professor Erman, of Berlin, submitted the plan for a comprehensive
Thesaurus Verborum Aegyptiacorum, which is to be published under the
auspices of the royal academies of Berlin, Gottingen, Leipzig, and
Munich; it will contain all the words found in hieroglyphic and hier-
atic texts. The card catalogue for the work will be finished in 1904,
and the final redaction in 1908, while the printed edition will be com-
pleted in 1913. The assistance of Egyptologists all over the world is
solicited for this gigantic undertaking.

Professor Goldziher, of Budapest, presented a report on the great
Mohammedan Encyclopedia which is to be published under his edito-
rial direction, and Professor Haupt announced a complete bibliography

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. dlr

of Assyriology up to 1900, which is being prepared by Dr. Cyrus
Adler, of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Secretary was in July, 1897, appointed delegate of the United
States to the Seventh International Geological Congress, at St. Peters-
burg, Russia, during the first week of September. Other delegates
from this country were Prof. George P. Merrill, of the National
Museum, Rollin D. Salisbury, of New Jersey, and Charles R. Keys, of
Missouri, these names being announced by the Institution to the
Secretary of State, by whom the appointments were directly certified.

The special subjects under consideration related to stratigraphic and
petrographic classification and nomenclature and the rules regarding
the introduction of new terms into stratigraphic nomenclature. The
congress will always remain memorable on account of the number and
extent of the excursions offered the visiting geologists and the hospi-
tality with which they were everywhere greeted. The excursions

_ before the congress were: (1) to the Urals and Western Siberia; (2) to

Ksthonia, and (3) to Finland, and, after the congress, to the Caucasus
by any one of three routes; thence to Tiflis, Baku, and Batoum, with
side trips to Ararat, Mount Elbrous, the Crimea, and other lessimportant
points. The registration for the congress was unusually large, num-
bering some 850 signatures, of whom upward of 600 were actually in
attendance either at the meeting in St. Petersburg or on some of the
excursions. The next congress is to be held in Paris in 1900.

The Secretary presented to the Department of State the names of
Dr. C. W. Stiles and Prof. E. L. Mark, and they were appointed dele-
gates to the Congress of Zoology to be held at Cambridge, England.

The Secretary and Dr. Cyrus Adler were in June, 1898, appointed as
delegates of the United States to a conference to be held in England
for further consideration of an international catalogue of scientific lit-
erature mentioned in the last report.

EXPOSITIONS.

In my report for 1897 I made a brief reference to the participation of
the Smithsonian Institution and its dependencies in the 'Tennessee
Centennial Exposition, which was opened on May 1, 1897. A descrip-
tion of the exhibits prepared for that occasion under the direction of
the Institution will be published in the Museum volume of this report.

By direction of Congress the Smithsonian Institution and its various
bureaus have prepared exhibits for the Trans-Mississippi and Interna-

tional Exposition at Omaha, which opened on June 1, 1898. The sum

of $19,491.71 was allotted to the Institution out of a general appropria-
tion of $137,500 for the special exhibits of all the Executive Depart-

ments of the Government. A further allusion to this exposition will

be found in the Appendix, and a full statement will be (Tush te in

Sie REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Government of Norway invited this Government to participate
in an international fisheries exposition, to be held at the city of Bergen,
Norway, from May to September, 1898, and a resolution accepting this
invitation and authorizing the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries to
arrange for a suitable exhibit was introduced into Congress. This reso-
lution contained a phrase which authorized the Commissioner to employ
the collections of the National Museum, at his discretion, for the pur-
poses of this exhibit, and while the Institution has always been willing
to aid any international exposition, a precedent might have been estab-
lished which would seriously embarrass the Museum and lead to the
temporary dismemberment of its collections. I accordingly took steps
to have the wording of the bill so changed that the Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries might, “‘ with the consent of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, use any portion of the fisheries collection in
the National Museum at said exposition,” and this was readily agreed
to by Congress, and enabled the Institution to be of service to the Fish
Commission in making a proper exhibit without establishing a precedent
dangerous to the Institution.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.

Under the act of incorporation of the American Historical Associa-
tion, approved January 4, 1889, the association reports annually to the
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution concerning its proceedings
and the condition of historical study in America, and the Secretary is
directed to ‘“‘communicate to Congress the whole of such reports, or
such portions thereof as he shall see fit.” Nine volumes of these
reports have so far been printed, and the report for the year 1897 is now
in press. The reports from 1889 to 1893 were not at the disposal of
the Institution, but beginning with the 1894 report a small edition has
been available, which is distributed to State historical societies and
some foreign institutions, the publications received in return being
placed with the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Congress.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Documentary history of the Institution.—In 1879 there was published
a history of the origin and progress of the Smithsonian Institution
from its establishment to the year 1877, including a full account of
legislative proceedings from the Twenty-fourth to the Forty-fourth Con-
gress wherein the Institution itself or any of its bureaus were con-
cerned. There has now been prepared a similar history of the period
from 1876 to 1896, which it is proposed to publish shortly.

Gifts and bequests—Among the collections received by the Institu-
tion during the year and deposited in the National Museum may be
mentioned a very interesting series of carbides and borides, presented
by M. Henri Moissan, the products of his investigations with the elec-
tric furnace, and a large collection of archeological objects pertaining
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

to the District of Columbia, bequeathed to the Institution by the late

Mr. W. Hallett Phillips.

An ancient bronze ewer was received as a gift from Chang Yen Hoon,
special ambassador from China to the United States.

Stereotype plates.—In the basement of the Institution building are
stored the stereotype plates of most of the Smithsonian publications.
These plates and engravers’ blocks of illustrations are cheerfully placed
at the disposal of publishers for supplementing or illustrating scientific
works privately issued. The series of Miscellaneous Collections and
Contributions to Knowledge are no longer stereotyped, but the regular
edition has been increased, and in the case of works that are likely to
be in more than ordinary demand extra copies are printed.

Smithson tablet—A duplicate of the Smithson tablet was sent to
Pembroke College, Oxford, the college from which Smithson was grad-
uated. The two tablets sent to Genoa have been set in position, one

‘of them at Smithson’s tomb and the other in the English Church.

During the last few years I have succeeded in getting some new infor-

~ mation concerning the personal history of Mr. Smithson, and I have

recently secured for the archives of the Institution a photographic
copy of his will.

Tropical botanical laboratory.—The botanists of the United States in
1897 determined to establish a botanical laboratory in the American
tropics, and a commission having been appointed to select a suitable
site, the Institution extended all possible courtesies to the commission
by presenting the plans of the project to the Department of State,
through which necessary international arrangements were made to
insure proper reception of the commission by the Governments of
Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. The commission con-
sisted of Prof. Douglas Campbell, of Leland Stanford University;
Prof. J. M. Coulton, of the University of Chicago; Prof. W. G. Farlow,
of Harvard University, and Prof. D. T. MacDougall, of the University
of Minnesota.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

~The temporary appointment of Mr. Charles D. Walcott as acting
assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the
National Museum, following the death of Dr. Goode, was ratified by
the Board of Regents on January 27,1897. Mr. Walcott has continued
to act in this capacity through the fiscal year covered by this report,
and I take special pleasure in repeating my acknowledgment of the
value and efficiency of the services rendered by him. With a corre-
sponding regret I am obliged to announce that, owing to his exacting
duties as director of the United States Geological Survey, he has found
it necessary to terminate his official charge of the Museum with the
close of the fiscal year 1897-98, thus closing a relationship equally
Satisfactory on its official and on its personal side. The Museum
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

will continue to have the benefit of his association with it as honorary
curator of the division of stratigraphic paleontology.

The Regents are aware that the Secretary, with Mr. Walcott’s aid,
arranged a modification in the administration of the Museum, intended
to make it less dependent on the Secretary’s immediate oversight of
detaiis. This consisted in gathering the different departments under
- three heads and placing three scientific men, who were believed to have
shown a capacity as administrative officers, in their charge as head
curators. The arrangement has worked well, but it should be given a
longer trial before deciding that it is a suitable plan for the permanent
administration of the Museum.

Under the present method the Secretary will not be required to give
so much of his time to details of Museum administration as would
have becn demanded under the old system in the absence of a single
head, and this result he is largely able to accomplish through the aid
of the Assistant Secretary, who, without being designated to the exclu-
sive charge of the Museum, will make its oversight a portion of his
duties, in which he will be assisted by the head curators.

For the preservation and increase of the collections Congress appro-
priated $160,000 for the fiscal year now ended. From this appropria-
tion are paid all expenses incident to the preservation, exhibition, and
increase of the collections, except such as are referred to below. It
covers the compensation of the scientific and clerical staff, and of the
preparators, watchmen, and laborers; the cost of supplies required in
the conduct of the Museum, such as preservatives, stationery, and
other incidentals; the cost of transportation, the acquisition of speci-
mens, ete.

This sum still left me unable to provide for additional permanent —
curators for the care of collections now without adequate supervision,
and, for what is even a more urgent necessity, the means to pay for
proper administrative aid in carrying on the Museum’s work. Most of
the scientific assistants are required to give much of their time to the
performance of administrative duties in connection with the collections.
A large number of divisions, moreover, are dependent for their adminis-
tration entirely upon honorary officers, whose services have in the past
been cheerfully rendered; yet the fact that their primary obligations
are to other departments or bureaus of the Government has made it
impossible for them to give such attention to their work in the Museum
as the interest of the service really demanded, and has also prevented
the secretary from calling upon them in such a way as he might were
they paid officers of the Museum. Thus, while most fully recognizing
the value of the services which these gentlemen have rendered, and the
generous spirit in which they have been given, it yet does not seem
possible to permanently administer so large an interest with the assist-
ance of persons whose time can not be controlled by the chief officer
in charge.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. vad 8

I repeat, to make my meaning quite clear, that the most urgent need
of the Museum is the provision of an adequate fund for the adininis.
trative work, both in the handling of affairs and in the arranging of
collections.

The appropriation for cases and other fixtures was $30,000 and for
- heating and lighting the Museum building $14,000. The purchase of
books required for the technical library and the use of visitors in the
exhibition halls, which has up to the present time been made from the
appropriation for the preservation of collections, will hereafter be pro-
vided for specifically by a separate item, under which Congress has
allotted the sum of $2,000 for the ensuing year.

The sum of $4,000 was allowed for repairs to buildings, shops, and
sheds, and an item of $2,500 for the removal and rebuilding of the two
sheds adjacent to the south side of the Smithsonian building. The
latter, which have been a source of menace to the main building, were
torn down and reconstructed in other and more suitable locations.

The Museum. building not being provided with a basement, it has

been necessary to rent temporary quarters elsewhere for workshops and
for the storage of surplus specimens, and the furniture used for exposi-
tion purposes. These structures are not fireproof, and in the interest
of the safety of the Government property I therefore included in my
estimates for 1898-99 an item of $50,000 for the construction of a suit-
able building, 50 feet by 150 feet, and provided with a basement, which
should take the place of the various buildings and sheds already alluded
to. I suggested a site between the National Museum and the Army
Medical Museum buildings. I regret to say that this item was not
allowed, but in place thereof the amount appropriated for renting pur-
poses was increased from $2,000 (allowed for 1897-98) to $4,500 for the
year 1898-99. This will enable me to secure additional quarters for
immediate needs.
_ In 1897 and again in 1898 Congress appropriated $8,000 for erecting
galleries in the Museum building. This amount was sufficient for the
erection of seven galleries. An additional allowance of $10,000 has
also been granted by Congress for furnishing railings, painting the
galleries, connecting them with those in adjoining hall, placing a sky-
light in each court, and providing a ventilator in one of the ranges.

IT am pleased to report that the full amount asked for printing and
binding ($17,000) has been allotted, which will enable me to push for-
ward the publication of several important manuscripts, the printing of
which has long been withheld for lack of funds.

The expenditure of a sum not exceeding $5,500 from the ‘“ Preserva-
tion of collections” appropriation was authorized for the preparation
of drawings for the illustration of Museum publications.

For the purchase of the private library of the late Dr. Goode the sum
of $5,000 was appropriated by Congress. This library is a very valu-
able one, formed with rare discrimination and intelligence, and com-
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

prising the best treatises, chiefly on natural history and methods of
museum administration. It comprises 2,900 volumes, 18,000 pamphlets, -
and 1,800 portraits, autographs, and engravings.

The total number of lots of specimens received during the year was
1,441, some of these containing several hundred each. These acces-
sions include more than 450,000 objects, and I would call special atten- _
tion to this extraordinary increase, perhaps the largest during the last
fifteen years. This fact seems to establish in a marked degree the
popularity of the Museum and the general desire on the part of the.
public to aid in building up its collections. The conditions existing
during the year have been peculiarly unfavorable for making special
effort to increase the collections, and this large addition to them must
be regarded as the result of a very earnest desire of persons interested
in the Museum to assist in promoting its objects. The number of speci-
mens now recorded in all the departments of the Museum is consider-
ably more than four millions.

The Museum has continued its practice of carrying on exchanges of
Specimens with museums and individuals in foreign countries. Among
the most important ones initiated or completed during the year 1898
may be mentioned those with the Imperial Royal Natural History
Museum, of Vienna; the Paleontological Museum of the Royal Acad-
emy, Munich, Bavaria; the Natural History Society of New Brunswick,
St. John; the Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia; the Zoological
Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg; the
Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, and the
Museum of Natural History, Geneva, Switzerland.

A more detailed reference to these transactions may be found in the ~
Appendix.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Researches relating to the American Indians, conducted under the
Smithsonian Institution in accordance with the act of Congress, have
been continued by Maj. J. W. Powell, the Director of the Bureau,
assisted by Mr. W J McGee, Mr. F’. W. Hodge, and other scientific col-
laborators, whose respective services will be found more fully detailed in
the director’s report. The field operations have been extended into a
large number of States and Territories; and also incidentally into dis-
tricts of neighboring countries occupied by tribes affiliated with the
aborigines of the region now comprised in the United States. In the
office studies have been carried on of the field material, with a view to
defining those characteristics of primitive culture affecting relations
among the tribes.

The work of exploration has been conducted in several parts of the
United States. An examination was made into the shell mounds on the
coast of Maine, resulting, in the opinion of the director, in the identi-
fication of the Mound Builders with the tribes found on that coast at
the settlement of the country. From excavations in Mexico and Arizona

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

a large collection of interesting objects were obtained and much arche-

ological and ethnological data acquired. The difficult ascent of the
summit of the Mesa Encantada, near Acoma, was accomplished, and
from relics found there the essential features of the Acoma tradition
have been substantiated. Explorations were also extended across the
frontier into Mexico, resulting in the acquirement of information tending
to throw much light on the little-known customs of the border tribes.
The objects collected during these various explorations have been
placed in the National Museum and the new information acquired has
been added to the archives of the Bureau and incorporated in memoirs
now in preparation or completed for publication.

The study and arrangement of the collections of aboriginal handi-
work obtained in Florida has been continued and progress made in the
preparation of a report on the prehistoric key dwellers on the eastern
shore of the Gulf of Mexico.

The study of decorations and researches into their symbolic uses
have been continued.

Interesting observations on the development of institutions among
the Papago and other American tribes and satisfactory progress in
the researches in linguistics, particularly in the preparation of a com-
parative vocabulary of Algonquian dialects, as well as in studies of
the Iroquoian languages, the dialects of the Mescalero and Jicarilla
Apaches, and of the Cherokee myths, have been made. Researches in
Indian sign language have been resumed. The director has continued
the development of a system of classification designed to indicate the
place of the the American Indians among the peoples of the earth.

Satisfactory progress has been made in the revision of the proofs of
the seventeenth and eighteenth annual reports and in editorial work
on the manuscript of the nineteenth annual report. The demand for
these reports in advance of their publication is great, while the supply
of those of previous years is practically exhausted.

Further details concerning the operations of the Bureau may be
found in Director Powell’s report, forming Appendix II.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

I need hardly repeat what I have already said in previous reports—
that the growth of the operations of the exchange service testifies to
its good management and general acceptability, even with the disad-
vantages under which its labors are carried on. In 1887 it sent out 71
tons of documents and had 2,165 correspondents in this country and
7,396 correspondents abroad; during the past year it transmitted 151
tons and had 6,915 correspondents at home and 22,543 abroad. ‘There
is no part of the Smithsonian Institution which more efficiently carries
out the large purpose of its founder, to diffuse knowledge among men,

and it is through this, as much as through any other branch, that its

hame is known throughout the world.
24 ‘REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Fifty years ago, when this work was first commenced, entirely at
the charge of the Institution, an arrangement was made through the
generosity of certain steamship lines by which transport could be had
gratuitously. This arrangement has been, to a great extent, necessarily
continued, and, although conditions have entirely changed, the Institu-
tion is still compelled to carry matters of international interest and
importance by slow steamers because where the service is gratuitously
given no choice can be exercised. It is a mistaken economy to think
it for the advantage of the Government, which now spends so many
thousands of dollars on this work, to yet fail to meet the vital con-
ditions of business success—reasonable dispatch— because it would
involve the expenditure of some $3,000 additional annually.

At the present time it is unhappily true that different bureaus of the
Government which have the right to make use of this method prefer to
spend more money and to send their publications at their own costand
trouble, usually through the mails, only because they can deliver them
more promptly than those who would gladly make it a special boast
that they were the promptest and most expeditious, as well as the
cheapest, of Government dispatches.

Where ocean freight is charged it is computed by the cubic foot, and
the average rate that is demanded by the fast steamers from New York
to European ports may be placed at 20 cents; but while the above esti-
mate is made upon the calculation that all shipments could be made at
the ton-measurement rate, quite two-thirds of them would measure
under a ton, and would come under the rate of what is known as
“minimum bill of lading charge,” which is never less than $5 for each
Shipment. This makes a total of about $2,000 from Washington to
various ports of debarkation throughout the world; and this, be it dis-
tinctly observed, is without ordinarily using the express either from
Washington to the port of shipment on this side or from the foreign
port of destination to the final address on the other.

It would doubtless be somewhat quicker if the express were used,
but the gain between Washington and New York in time would be less
than a day, and the cost on this part of the transit would be multiplied
nearly fourfold, so that if I look at the matter as though the interests
of an ordinary business were in question I do not feel that the expendi-
ture under these conditions for an express freight between Washington
and New York would be justified; and since it is as a business invest-
ment that I am asking Congress to consider this small appropriation, I
do not advise that it shall include the cost of the land express to be
used as an ordinary means.

It is to be understood, then, that under this estimate land transpor-
tation is still supposed to be, as a rule, by freight trains, both in this
country and in Europe. As the Institution has little to do with for-
warding exchanges from European ports to their ultimate destinations,
it is impossible to state definitely what the cost would be of improve-
ments which would bring in all desirable expedition to this part of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

“service, and it is not included here. It is, however, necessary that a
reasonable provision for the special transmission by express of belated
packages from Washington to New York and for the payment of post-
age on a certain limited number, mostly small and far remote destina-
tions, which can be forwarded more advantageously by the mail, with
some minor but needed matters, should be made, and this will add not
over $1,000, making the $3,000 estimated for.

With a view to improving the service and establishing more inti-
mate relations with the correspondents of the Institution, who have so
generously cooperated in its advancement, the chief clerk was instructed
_ to personally visit, in the autumn of 1897, the exchange agencies at
Brussels, Leipzig, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, and London. The work
accomplished was highly satisfactory, and resulted not only in making
many useful changes, but also in bringing about a closer relationship,
especially with those bureaus abroad which are conducted and sup-
ported by Government.

The exchange territory represented for many years by the agent of
the Institution at Leipzig has included not only Germany, but Austria-
Hungary and the Balkan countries as well. The constantly increasing
demands upon this agency has made it necessary to readjust its fune-
tions, and as a consequence new agents have been appointed at Vienna
and Budapest. While the necessary additional expenditure on account
of the new agencies will be considerable, the advantage to the service
will more than compensate for the increase.

The service provides for the forwarding of United States official
. publications to distributing centers abroad and for their systematic
delivery to specific addresses; for transmitting the reports and memoirs
of institutions and individuals of this country to their correspondents
in other parts of the world, and for the transmission to and delivery
in the United States of similar publications in exchange, even from
remote parts of civilization.

For defraying the expense of this service during the past year there
were available resources aggregating $25,193.53, of which amount
$19,000 were appropriated by Congress and $6,193.53 were derived
from repayments at the rate of 5 cents per pound on the exchanges of
Government bureaus and State institutions, this being a partial reim-
bursement of the expense incurred for packing, transportation, and
clerical work.

In my last report I stated that exchange relations were suspended
with Turkey, Greece, and Cuba, and I regret to say that even now the
Institution is awaiting the consummation of arrangements with the first
two countries named. An agency had been established in Havana just
prior to the blockading of that port by the United States fleet, and
it will doubtless be reestablished at an early date. Owing to restric-
tions placed upon all intercourse with Spain and her colonies during
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the recent war, no exchanges have of late been forwarded by either
country.

Comparison with the report for the year ending June 30, 1897, shows
a marked increase in the number of correspondents and the amount
of publications transmitted. The number of correspondents now aggre-
gates 29,458, and the weight of transmissions during the year exceeded
150 tons, distributed among 93 countries.

Since my last report a revised edition of the International Exchange
List has been published, containing the names of 9,414 institutions in
other countries which are in communication with institutions in the
United States through the Smithsonian Institution. The last edition
was published in 1885. Appended to this report is a map of the world
showing the distribution of the correspondents of the exchange service.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK. .

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, the following appropriation
was made for the National Zoological Park by the sundry civil act
approved June 4, 1897:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwiseimproving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and transporta-
tion of animals, including salaries or compensation of all necessary
employees and general incidental expenses not otherwise provided for,
fifty-five thousand dollars; one-half of which sum shall be paid from
the revenues of the District of Columbia and the other half from the .
Treasury of the United States; and of the sum hereby appropriated
five thousand dollars shall be used for continuing the entrance into the
Zoological Park from Woodley lane and opening driveway into Zoolog-
ical Park, from said entrance along the bank of Rock Creek.

The sum thus appropriated was less by $10,000 than that for the
preceding fiscal year. This has necessarily occasioned some embar-
rassment in the administration, and retarded development, especially
in the construction of buildings. It will be remembered that no grant
has ever béen provided for any permanent structure for animals in the
park, other than the small ‘animal house,” so called, and the log cabin
where the elks are sheltered, so that nearly all of the animals are
after eight years still sheltered in the temporary sheds run up to
receive them at the time of the first appropriation. It had been hoped
that something would have been done this year, but it has not been
possible to erect the constructions mentioned in the last annual report
as desirable.

Through the courtesy of the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries the
park was able to secure the tanks and other apparatus used for the
exhibition of fish and aquatic animals at Atlanta, Ga. These tanks
have been temporarily installed in a shed formerly occupied as a work-
shop and constitute the nucleus of an aquarium which it is hoped may
become an attractive feature of the park. At present the exhibit com-

prises only fresh water species, but a series of tanks for sea water will
also be established. No part of the park attracts more attention or
interest than this, and I could wish that Congress would provide the
means for making a better exhibit. This is only one out of many
instances, however, of the need of buildings. The temporary sheds
already alluded to were put up at first in that form at the instance of
the Appropriation Committee, which desired to await the result of
experience before erecting permanent quarters. These sheds are rot-
ting and all but ready to fall, and some appropriation for buildings
must be made.

The births in the collection continue to be more frequent than was
anticipated. As wild animals do not ordinarily breed in captivity, this
increase is gratifying as bearing testimony to the care which has been
bestowed by their keepers to preserve them in proper conditions of
health and activity.

The roads of the park have received the usual attention during the
year. The appropriation bill provided for the continuation of the Rock
Creek drive along the creek. This work has been done, the amount
appropriated being sufficient to construct an excellent road from the
new bridge built last year to the bridge near the Quarry road entrance.
As funds become available this driveway will be continued toward the
upper end of the park. The completion of the portion of this roadway
connecting with Woodley road has been deferred for the present on
account of the probable addition of land to the area of the park in that
vicinity. A bill has been presented to Congress providing for such
addition, and the road can be much more advantageously constructed
should this increase of the park reserve be provided.

Itis hoped that the probable extension of the jurisdiction of the
United States over foreign territory may lead to increased collections
for the park. There are many animals and birds in Cuba, Porto Rico,
and the Philippines which are not represented here. It seems highly
desirable that the fauna of these regions should be more widely known,
and it is therefore intended, if funds are provided for the purpose, to
make a special exhibit of specimens collected in these countries. In
order to do this a new building especially constructed for tropical birds
is indispensable.

The collection has suffered somewhat during the year from the casu-
alties that are a necessary consequence of keeping wild animals in
confinement. The “cattle and game disease,” an epidemic disorder
that has proved very fatal in European collections, appeared suddenly
and carried off several animals. Its progress was soon arrested by
promptly disinfecting the pens, isolating the sick, and removing the
unaffected animals to other paddocks.

Several measures were introduced into Congress during the last ses-
sion which had for their object the readjustment of the boundary of
the park. Since the establishment of a permanent plan for the road-
ways of the District of Columbia it has been made evident that the
28 . REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

existing boundaries are not in all respects satisfactory, as they do not
always coincide with the regular highways, and therefore permit of build-
ings being placed in close proximity to the park, a condition obviously
unsuitable both for the seclusion of the animals and because of the
probability of disorderly conditions arising upon such properties.

The most notable of the efforts made to secure a better arrangement
was the bill on the subject introduced by Senator Gallinger, which was
favorably reported by the Committee on the District of Columbia of
the Senate, finally passed by the Senate on July 7, 1898, and is now
before the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds of the House
of Representatives.

The text of the bill as it passed the Senate is as follows:

S. 4191.

AN ACT To readjust the boundary of the National Zoological Park and preserve its
seclusion between Park road on the east and Cincinnati street and Connecticut
avenue on the west.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That a commission, to consist
of the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the president of the
Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and the Engineer
Commissioner of said board, is hereby authorized and empowered to
acquire, by purchase or condemnation, in the same manner as was
adopted for the acquirement of property already embraced in the
National. Zoological Park under the provision of the Act of March
second, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, the tract of land lying south
of the National Zoological Park owned by the Union Benevolent Asso-
ciation of the District of Columbia (colored) and now occupied as a
cemetery, and.such parcels of ground adjoining the said park and
between its present boundaries ‘and Connecticut avenue extended on
the west and the nearest road shown on the recorded highway exten-
sion plans of the first section on the east and south (inclusive of such .
road in case the same is not yet dedicated to public use) as they shall
deem necessary for preserving its safety and perpetuating its seclusion;
these properties, along with Joliet street, already purchased, to be made a
part of the said park, for which purpose the sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars is hereby appropriated, to be paid half out of the District funds
and half out of the United States funds. The Union Benevolent Asso-
ciation of the District of Columbia (colored) is hereby authorized to
sell and convey any portion or all of the tract of land owned by them
on the southern side of the Zoological Park now occupied as a cemetery.

It would seem that the passage of this bill is very desirable, and I
take occasion to refer in this connection to the letter which I quoted
from an eminent landscape artist, Mr. Olmsted, in my report for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The work of the past year has been successful beyond expectation,
and, as is stated in the report of the Aid acting in charge, it has
resulted in the discovery and determination of position of over 500
new absorption lines, so that we have now over 700 new lines of well-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. s 29

determined positions, and we may be said now to know, by the aid of
the bolometer and the labors of the observatory, more lines in this
invisible spectrum than were known in the visible one up to the great
research of Kirchoff and Bunsen, which opened the era of modern
spectrum analysis. Moreover, these lines, the exactness of whose
determination has now reached a surprising degree of perfection
through the recent improvements in the delicacy as well as the pre-
cision of both bolometer and galvanometer, and through other improve-
ments in the apparatus (improvements due principally to the present
Aid acting in charge), depend not only on the instruments, but on the
labors of those who have used them, the comparator measurements
alone having included, as stated in the body of the report, about 44,000
separate observations.

A great deal of other work has been done at the observatory, but
nothing which in importance and present and prospective interest com.
pares with this main research in the infra-red spectrum, which is now
known throughout nearly the whole of the invisible portion of the solar
energy, and extends through a range of wave lengths considerably over
twelve times that known to Sir Isaac Newton, the present exact knowl-
edge of this region being due not exclusively, but it may properly be
said principally, to the labors of this observatory.

I call attention in this connection to the interesting remarks made in
the report to the effect that very marked changes of absorption have
been observed at various parts of the infra-red spectrum. In one part
of the invisible region a decrease in absorption, amounting to nearly
half the total, took place in February, and this abnormal state con-
tinued until May, when the usual condition gradually returned. As
this change is found to occur yearly at about the same period, the
idea presents itself that the growth of vegetation, so rapid in these
months, may abstract from the air large quantities of vapor active in
absorption at this point in the spectrum, but this interesting possibility
has not yet, it will be understood, been fully verified.

In this, however, and other discoveries of a similar nature we have
the earnest of the fulfillment of long cherished hopes, already alluded
to by me, for the ultimate benefit of these researches, not only to science,
but to concerns of practical moment and even of national utility.

NECROLOGY.

Gardiner Greene Hubbard was born in Boston August 25, 1822, and
died in Washington on December 11, 1897. After preparation in the
Boston schools he entered Dartmouth College, being graduated bache-
lor of arts in 1841. He studied law in Cambridge, and was admitted
to the bar of Boston, where he practiced his profession for twenty
years, and later at the national capital.

His first interest in educational and scientific matters appears to
have been connected with the improved education of the deaf, and he

was the founder, in 1846, of the first school established in the United
_ States for teaching the deaf to speak. He was for ten years a member
of the State board of education of Massachusetts, and served as a
commissioner for that State to the Centennial Exhibition at Philadel-
phia in 1876. He was also connected with the department of awards
of the Atlanta Exposition, 1595, and the Nashville Exposition, 1897.
In'1876 he was appointed by President Grant chairman of a special
commission to investigate the question of railway mail transportation.
He was a doctor of laws of his-own college (Dartmouth), and of Colum-
bian University, at Washington, of which he was also a trustee.
During the last ten years of his life he evinced a very great interest
in the scientific work at the national capital. He was president of the
National Geographic Society, and labored unceasingly for the advance-
ment and popularization of its work. He was president of the Joint
Commission of the Scientific Societies of Washington, and was con-
nected with a number of the hereditary and patriotic organizations.
He was elected a regent February 27, 1895, and was made a member
of the executive committee, and gave much time and thought to all
his duties as regent. The Board of Regents unanimously adopted the
following minute by a rising vote in recognition of his services to the
Institution :

Whereas the Hon. Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a citizen regent and
a member of the executive committee of the Smithsonian Institution,
died at his residence in this city on the 11th day of December, 1897,

Resolved, That the Regents of the Institution place upon their
records this testimonial of their respect and admiration for Mr. Hub-
bard as a singularly public-spirited citizen, an ever-generous promoter
of education, and active patron of scientific work; and this expression
of their sincere regret for the loss of a colleague and friend, whose life
was adorned by so many personal virtues, and whose association with
them has left so many endearing memories.

Resolved, That a copy of this minute be engrossed and transmitted
to the family of Mr. Hubbard.

Miss Fannie R. Schaeffer, for more than twenty years an Sue
clerk in the Institution, died September 18, 1897.

Respectfully annie

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the report of the National Museum for the year
ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Museum;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by

_ the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4, The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes,

I have the honor to report that the fixed property of the National Museum cou-
sists (in addition to its building, heating plant, and other equipments) of collections,
cases and other receptacles, office furniture, and books.

The collections include objects in every branch of natural history, geology, and
anthropology, and comprise more than 4,000,000 specimens.

The cases in the exhibition halls number about 2,000. Besides these, 130 cases
contain exhibits at the Omaha Exposition, and 1,300 are in use in the workrooms and
storage quarters.

The office furniture comprises about 900 pieces, such as tables, desks, chairs, file-
cases, typewriters, and book-cases, besides minor articles. The Museum also owns
485 lecture-room chairs of an inferior quality that should be replaced at an early day.

The library contains about 11,000 volumes and about 7,500 pamphlets.

During the fiscal year covered by this statement the Museum acquired more than
450,000 specimens and 441 books, 797 pamphlets, and 4,929 parts of periodicals, and
added to its permanent stock cases and other furniture and fixtures to the amount
of $30,000, of which $15,000 was used for furnishing the new galleries provided by
Congress.

During the year the sheds adjoining the Smithsonian building on the south side
were torn down and reconstructed at a safe distance from the building. The work
cost in round numbers, $2,000.

The galleries provided by Congress for the Museum building were erected during
the year. These were three in number, and cost $8,000, the amount appropriated.

The losses of property during the year were of trifling extent, and were only such
as naturally occur where very large numbers of receptacles, as cases, boxes, trays,
bottles, etc., are in use. It should be remarked in this connection that all cases
and other furniture and the like when worn out and no longer of use to the Museum,
are regularly condemned and sold at auction, and the proceeds turned into the
Treasury, as required by law.

In the following condensed statement the more important facts connected with
the work of the National Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, are
presented :

The Museum staff.—A general reorganization of the scientific departments of the
Museum went into effect July 1, 1897. Under this plan Mr. W. H. Holmes was made
head curator of the newly organized department of anthropology, Dr. F. W. True

31
Sys REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

head curator of the department of biology, and Dr. G. P. Merrill head curator of
the department of geology.

Mr. W. H. Ashmead was appointed assistant curator of the division of insects
on July 1, 1897. On November 12 Dr. W. L. Ralph was appointed honorary custo-
dian of the section of birds’ eggs, and Dr. H. G. Dyar was made honorary custodian of
the section of lepidoptera. Mr. W. T. Swingle was appointed honorary custodian
of the section of alge, and Dr. D. G. Fairchild was appointed to a similar position
in the section of lower fungi. Both of these appointments took effect December 7.

Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., was given a temporary appointment as assistant curator
of the division of mammals on February 15, 1898. On April 30, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes
was appointed a collaborator in the division of ethnology.

Accessions.—The accessions of the year number 1,442. While this record shows a
slight falling off when compared with that for the preceding year, it should he noted
that many of the accessions embraced a large quantity of material, so that the total
number of specimens acquired represents a very large increase over the acquisitions
of recent years. Altogether, more than 450,000 specimens, as already stated, were
added to the collections, raising the grand total on June 30, 1898, to above 4,000,000.

In calling your attention to the accessions of greatest importance, I will divide
my remarks under the three headings, anthropology, biology, and geology—these
being the designations of the three scientific departments of the Museum (under
which all divisions and sections are embraced) in accordance with the revised
scheme of classification now in effect.

Anthropology.—Considering first the department of anthropology, attention is
called to a large collection of antiquities and ethnological material, embracing more
than 12,000 specimens, bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution by the late W.
Hallett Phillips, by whom the material was largely collected. The specimens are
accompanied by notes prepared by Mr. Phillips, and the collection, as a whole, is of
exceptional value. It consists mainly of stone implements from the Potomac region,
but includes also 106 ethnological specimens from Polynesia. From the Bureau of
American Ethnology has been received a valuable series of ancient stone and earth-
enware utensils from graves and mounds in Arkansas, and a collection of antiquities
from the mounds of the Etowah group of Georgia. The last-named collection,
together with the material previously received from the same locality, constitutes
an exceedingly valuable assemblage of archeological material. Through the cour-
tesy of Surg. Gen. G. M. Sternberg, a series of over 2,000 human crania, mainly of
the Indian tribes of North America, has been transferred to the National Museum
from the Army Medical Museum. Dr. Roland Steiner, of Grovetown, Ga., deposited
an extensive series of stone implements from various parts of Georgia, and M. Emile
Granier, Paris, France, deposited a collection of ethnological material from the
Indian tribes of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain region. Other loan col-
lections worthy of note are a series of personal mementos of the late Gen. W. S.
Hancock, deposited by G. R. Hancock, of the West Point Military Academy, a num-
ber of Jewish religious ceremonial objects, deposited by Mr. H. E. Benguiat, San
Francisco, Cal., and a valuable collection of Japanese porcelains from Miss E. R.
Scidmore. ji

Prof. Alexander Graham Bell deposited a large number of pieces of apparatus
made and used by himself in his experiments and researches, including a series
illustrating the invention and development of the Bell telephone. The General
Electric Company deposited several dynamos and other pieces of apparatus of great
historical value. The Coe Brass Manufacturing Company, of Ansonia, Conn., pre-
sented ten dynamos made between the years 1873 and 1879 by William Wallace.
Some of these machines were in practical operation during the Centennial Exhibi-
tion at Philadelphia. An electric generator made in 1867 by Mr. Charles A. Seeley
and an electric motor devised in 1834 by Thomas Davenport were received on deposit
from the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Altogether, the pieces of elec-
trical apparatus received represent nearly the entire range of American invention,

forming the basis of the practical methods of electric arc and incandescent lighting.
Duplicates of few, if any, of these machines exist.

- Biology.—Among the additions to the collections in the department of pioloey the
largest and one of the most important is a collection of about 200,000 specimens of
Coleoptera, presented by Messrs. H. G. Hubbard and E. A. Schwarz, of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. The addition of this material places the collection of insects
in the National Museum ahead of all others as regards North American Coleoptera.
Dr. W. L. Abbott has presented during the year large collections of birds, mammals,
reptiles, and insects from Lower Siam and Kashmir. The material which Dr. Abbott
has collected and donated to the National Museum during a period of several years
past now constitutes the most valuable portion of the Old World collections in its
custody. Valuable specimens of birds’ eggs have been received from Dr, W. L.
Ralph, of Utica, N. Y., another generous contributor to the national collections.
Prof. Dean C. Nionccetor, of Ann Arbor, Mich., presented 600 bird skins, 900 eggs,
and 250 nests, all from the Philippine Islands. Large additions to the collection of
fresh-water mussels have been made through the cooperation of Dr. L. T. Chamber-
lain, of New York City. A collection of more than 86,000 specimens of land and
fresh-water shells was presented by Dr. R. Ellsworth Call, of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Mr. Outram Bangs, Boston, Mass., presented an interesting series of bird skins from
Santa Marta, Colombia. Valuable accessions from the United States Fish Commis-
sion, the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, and other Government
bureaus, have been received. A collection of invertebrates obtained by the natu-
ralists of the steamer Albatross in 1896 from the coasts of California, Japan, Kam-
chatka, and in the Bering Sea, and a quantity of material, comprising more than
600 lots, collected by the assistants of the Commission during the past thirteen
years, deserve special notice. A number of valuable types and cotypes of fishes
have also been transmitted by the commission. A large lot of land shells collected
by the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, was received during the
year. This collection is regarded as the most intrinsically valuable acquisition of
the year in the division of mollusks, comprising as it does an unusual number of
undescribed species and others not before represented in the collection. A series
of about 240 specimens of rodents from Patagonia was obtained by purchase.

Geology.—The department of geology has been enriched by the addition of a con-
siderable quantity of important and interesting material. Through the bequest of
the late I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio, a valuable collection, consisting of more
than 20,000 specimens of fossils, has been received. This is one of the finest collec-
tions of fossils of the Cincinnati group in existence. It is particularly rich in
starfishes, crinoids, and trilobites. Mr. R. D. Lacoe, Pittston, Pa., has added to his
previous magnificent contributions by the donation of his collection of fossil insects,
comprising over 4,600 specimens, of which more than 200 are types. Six hundred
specimens of Kinderhook crinoids, corals, and mollusca were received from the
United States Geological Survey. A large amount of vertebrate paleontological
material, collected under the direction of Prof. 0. C. Marsh during his connection
with the United States Geological Survey, has been turned over to the Museum
during the year. A valuable collection of Mosasaurs from the Cretaceous of western
Kansas, two collections of Elasmobranch teeth and spines from the Carboniferous of
Iowa, and an unusually fine skull and some bones of Claosaurus were obtained by
Bee risc.

Specimens of many new minerals were received during the year and added to the
collections. The division of physical and chemical geology has been enriched by
the acquisition of a large cluster of basaltic columns from near Bonn, Prussia, some
large masses of beautiful orbicular granite from Sweden, fulgurites on Andesite
from Little Ararat in Armenia, and a large amount of petrographic material from

_the United States Geological Survey and other sources. The head curator of the

department of geology collected some beautiful, clear masses of rock salt at Heil-

sm 98 3

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

bronn, Prussia. Specimens of kaolin and clays from Germany and an excellent
series of telluride ores from Cripple Creek, Colo., have also been received.

Foreign exchanges.—A few of the more important exchanges with foreign establish-
ments and individuals are here referred to: From the Imperial Royal Natural History
Museum, Vienna, Austria, 66 specimens of Tertiary corals were received in exchange
for Lower Cretaceous fossils. The Paleontological Museum of the Royal Academy,

-Munich, Bavaria, received from the United States National Museum 16 specimens of
Cambrian fossils in exchange for material sent some time ago. Thirty-three speci-
mens of fossil plants, representing 20 species, were received from the Natural History
Society of New Brunswick, St. John, and 90 specimens of fossil plants have been
sent inreturn. The Branicki Museum, Warsaw, Russia, has received 170 bird skins
from the National Museum, in continuation of exchanges. Land shells from Trans-
caspia and the Caucasus and marine shells from the coast of Russia have been
received from the Zoological Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St.
Petersburg, in exchange for about 2,000 specimens of shells from the National
Museum. Mons. M. Cossman, Paris, France, sent a collection of shells in exchange
for publications. Sixty-two specimens of Actinians have been transmitted to the
Royal Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, Sweden, in exchange for material yet
to be received. Crustaceans have been sent to the Museum of Natural History,
Geneva, Switzerland, in return for specimens already received and in continuation
of further exchanges.

Distribution of specimens.—There were sent out as gifts or in exchange during the
year about 32,000 specimens, a considerable increase compared with the number for
the preceding year. About one-half of the distributions consisted of marine inverte-
brates, a large number of these specimens having been prepared and transmitted to
schools and colleges throughout the country. Nearly 7,500 specimens were lent to
specialists for study.

Specimens received for determination.—There has been a decrease in the number
of specimens received for determination, the total having been 576 lots, or 140 lots
less than for the preceding year. Since very little material of value is acquired
in this way, this decrease is not to be regretted, although the work of identification
is not unwillingly undertaken, since it has long been the policy of the Museum to
render such assistance to collectors and others as may be practicable.

Explorations.—Material of great scientific value has been received as the result of
explorations conducted by the Bureau of American Ethnology. About 1,300 speci-
mens of pottery and other relics from Arizona have been added to the collections
through the efforts of Dr. J. Walker Fewkes, who has been particularly successful
in his archeological explorations in the southwest during the past few years. A
number of unique ethnological specimens from Patagonia were received from Mr.
J. B. Hatcher. Explorations undertaken by Mr. Gerard Fowke, of the Bureau of
Ethnology, in Brown County, Ohio, yielded a small collection of Mound Builders’
relics.

Mr. R. P. Currie, of the National Museum, visited Liberia with Prof. O. F..Cook,
for the purpose of collecting natural history material, and succeeded in gathering a
large number of insects, spiders, and myriapods. Valuable specimens of mammals,
birds, and reptiles were also secured, A number of rare birds from the vicinity of
Lake Okechobee, Florida, were collected by Mr. Robert Ridgway. Interesting
specimens of fishes and mollusks were obtained by Mr. Charles Schuchert near Disko
Island, Greenland. Some very rare insects from the Commander Islands were secured
by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger while serving as a member of the Fur-seal Investigation
Commission. Mr. J. N. Rose visited Mexico during the summer of 1897, and spent
about four months in making collections of botanical material. A large number of
valuable specimens were obtained, including representations of more than 100 species
new to science.

A large number of plants from the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of northern
Greenland were obtained by Messrs. David White and Charles Schuchert. Mr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

Schuchert also made collecting trips to Missouri and northern New York. Dr. George

P. Merrill brought home some interesting geological material collected during his
visit to Russia in 1897.

Visitors.—During the year 177,254 persons visited the Museum building and 99,273
were admitted to the Smithsonian building, making a total of 276,527.

Publications.—The Annual Report of the National Museum for 1895 has been pub-
lished, the Report for 1896 was nearly all in type at the close of the fiscal year, and
the proof reading of the administrative portion of the volume for 1897 has been fin-
ished. The papers in the appendix of the volume for 1895 have been issued in separate
form. The nineteenth volume of Proceedings appeared during the year, and papers
1124 to 1139, inclusive, constituting Volume XX, have beon distributed. Part L
of Bulletin 39, containing instructions for the collection of scale insects, by Prof.
T. D. A. Cockerell, and Circular 48, relating to the collection and preservation of
the bones and teeth of the mastodon and mammoth, have been printed.

By your direction 5,800 copies of the Report of the National Museum are now dis-
tributed direct from the Museum, out of a total of 7,000 copies allotted by Congress
to the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum.

Tennessee Centennial Exposition.—As stated in the last Annual Report, the Museum
participated in the exposition held at Nashville from May 1 to October 31, 1897, for
the purpose of celebrating the one hundredth anniversary of the admission of the
State of Tennessee into the Union. Highteen of the divisions and sections of the
Museum prepared exhibits for this occasion. A description of these exhibits will be
given in detail in the full report of the National Museum for the present year.

Trans-Mississippi and International Hxposition.—An exhibit was prepared by the
Museum for the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition which opened at
Cmaha on June 1, 1898. For this exposition Congress appropriated $62,500 for the
erection of Government buildings and $137,500 for the exhibits of the various Execu-
tive Departments and Bureaus. Of the latter amount the sum of $19,491.71 was
allotted to the Smithsonian Institution and its dependencies. Dr. F. W. True repre-
sents the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum on the Government
board of management, and Mr. W. V. Cox acts as special agent in charge of the
exhibit. The report for the coming fiscal year will contain a complete description
of the collections which have been sent to Omaha by the Museum.

It was with no little regret that I advised you of the necessity of my relinquishing
the charge of the National Museum at the close of the present fiscal year. The tem-
porary appointment which you tendered me early in 1897 was accepted with mingled
feelings of satisfaction and hesitation. My admiration for the late Dr. Goode and
my long and pleasant acquaintance with him and his associates rendered the diffi-
cult task lighter than I anticipated, and now, in resigning the charge of the Museum—
although I gladly retain the honorary curatorship of the collections in stratigraphic
paleontology—I desire to express my sense of indebtedness for the honor which you
have conferred upon me and my wish for the ever-increasing prosperity of the
National Museum.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

S1tr: I have the honor to submit the report of the Bureau of Bihnoleea for the
year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments :—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Bureau;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes—

I have the honor to say that the property of the Bureau is, with the exception of
one or two items, small in amount and value. By far the most important and valu-
able property in the custody of the Bureau is the collection of manuscript records,
representing a considerable part of the work of the collaborators and the contribu-
tions of correspondents during the last twenty years, as well as the collection
originally acquired from the Smithsonian Institution. The greater part of the manu-
scripts are linguistic, and these are not in condition for publication, though invalu-
able for purposes of study and comparison. The entire collection, embracing more
than 2,000 titles, is catalogued and arranged in fireproof vaults in the offices of the
Bureau. A strict custody is maintained, under the immediate supervision of the
Director.

A related class of property comprises photographs of Indian subjects. So far as
practicable, these are represented by the original negatives with a systematic series
of prints. The collection comprises about 5,000 negatives, with about 3,000 prints,
including 800 prints from negatives which are not in the possession of the Bureau.
The collection is in constant use in connection with the preparation of illustrations
for the reports; its custody is vested in the illustrator of the Bureau.

Among the minor items the most important is the library of 7,900 volumes and
over 5,000 pamphlets, with plain wooden cases sufficient to accommodate them. The
greater part of the library represents the product of exchange, and in addition
there is a fair collection of books of reference and standard works on ethnologic
subjects obtained by purchase. The library is in immediate charge of Mr. F. W.
Hodge.

A class of property of some importance is the accumulated residue of publications.
The greater part of the edition of the reports available for distribution by the
Bureau is sent to exchanges and correspondents immediately on issue, but a limited
number of copies of each edition remains for distribution in accordance with subse-
quent demands. The residue of the several editions not completely exhausted is kept
under the supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge. The editions of most of the reports are -
exhausted; the undistributed residue numbers about 4,300 volumes.

A somewhat important class of property, though of limited value, is office furni-
ture, with the requisite stationery for current use, as well as photographic apparatus
and material. The aggregate value of the furniture and apparatus is less than
aes The custody and use of furniture, apparatus, stationery, and other materials
o_o

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. one

“are regulated by a custodial system devised for the purpose, which has been found to

work satisfactorily.

A considerable number of original engravings used for the illustration of reports
are catalogued and arranged in cases in the office of the Bureau, while the original
copy for illustrations is also preserved, so far as practicable, in charge of the illus-
trator. The stereotyped plates from which the reports are printed are from time to
time turned over to the Bureau by the Public Printer. These are stored partly in
the Smithsonian building, partly in the basement of the building in which the office
is located.

Experience has shown that, under existing conditions, it is inexpedient to acquire
field property in any considerable amount, since the cost of purchase and mainte-
nance of animals, vehicles, and camp equipage exceeds the charges for hire; accord-
ingly, there is practically no field property in the possession of the Bureau.

The collaborators engaged in field operations collect ethnological material, in
greater or less quantities, for purposes of study. All such material is transferred
to the National Museum, and commonly the requisite studies are conducted within
that building.

During the last fiscal year satisfactory progress was made in enriching the manu-
script collections, the series of photographs, and the collections of material objects
for the Museum, as indicated in other paragraphs. The aggregate expenditures for
stationery and laboratory supplies were $1,900; for furniture, $750, and for the pur-
chase of necessary books of reference and standard works, $850.

The Bureau is domiciled in rented quarters, i. e., the sixth floor of the Adams
Building, 1333-1335 F street, Washington. These quarters are limited, hardly meet-
ing the requirements of the work. During the winter, when office work is in active
progress, it is sometimes necessary for as many as two or three collaborators to work
in private quarters, while some of the permanent property (stereotype plates, etc.)
of the Bureau is stored in the Smithsonian and National Museum buildings, and the
publications are stored in and distributed from the basement of the building occu-
pied by the United States Geological Survey, through the courtesy of the Director,
Hon. Charles D. Walcott.

Ethnologic researches have been conducted during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, in accordance with the act of Congress making provision “for continuing
researches relating to the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution,” approved June 4, 1897.

The work has been carried forward in accordance with a plan of operations sub-
mitted on June 14, 1897. The field operations of the Director and the collaborators
have extended into Arizona, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Indian Territory, Maine, New
Brunswick, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Ontario, and Texas, while special
agents have conducted operations in Alaska, Argentina, British Columbia, Califor-
nia, Chile, Greenland, Oregon, and Washington State. The office work has included
the collection of material from Indian tribes in Arizona, Idaho, Indian Territory,
Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New York, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas. The researches in the office have dealt
with material from nearly all of the States and from other portions of the American
continent.

The organization of the work has grown out of a classification of ethnic science
based on the researches of the Bureau. It is worthy of note that, while the science
of man has advanced rapidly during the last twenty years through the efforts of
able investigators in different countries, the advance has been particularly rapid in
the United States. No small part of this advance must be ascribed to the farsighted
governmental policy of maintaining researches among the aboriginal tribes of the
American continents, yet a part of the progress would seem to be due to the wide
range in ethnic phenomena with which American students are favored. The inves-
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tigator in this country may easily come in contact with representatives of every
-race—of every important strain of blood. At the same time he may study every
important grade in culture, from the savagery of some of the Indian tribes, through
the barbarism of others, up to the civilization and enlightenment represented by
the better part of our population. One of the consequences of this favorable con-
dition for study has been the stimulation of observation and the encouragement of
strictly scientific methods of research. Another result is found in the amassing of
trustworthy data in unequaled amount for comparative study. The general result
is expressed in extension and refinement of ethnic science, and to some extent in the
application of ethnology to practical affairs.

The systemization of the science which results from a consideration of its subject-
matter as exhibited in the operations of the Bureau was set forth somewhat fully in
the last report, and it is followed in the present report. The science for which the
Bureau was organized under the act of Congress treats but slightly of the somatic
characteristics of the native tribes of America. Its researches extend rather over
those characteristics exhibited by men in the tribal state as they are portrayed in
cultural elements. These elements of character arise in the methods pursued by
the tribesmen for the purpose of securing pleasure, welfare, justice, expression, and
opinion. The pursuits involve activities which are esthetic, industrial, govern-
mental, linguistic, and educational, and these give rise to the sciences of esthetology,
technology, sociology, philology, and sophiology.

FIELD RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the Director was engaged in an examination
of certain shell mounds on the coast of Maine reconnoitered during the preceding
season. Limited collections were made, but the associations were noted with care
and compared with those characteristic of the Indians still living in the vicinity.
The work resulted in the complete identification of the mound builders with the
tribes found on the same coast by white men early in the settlement of this country.

During July Mr. F. W. Hodge repaired to Arizona, joining Dr. Fewkes during the
excavation of the ruins near Snowflake, south of Holbrook, and later accompanying
him to Tusayan for the purpose of gaining further insight into the summer ceremo-
nies of the Hopi Indians and additional knowledge of the ruins of their former
villages. Leaving Dr. Fewkes and his party late in August, he visited the remark-
able, but little-known, ruins on the mesas surrounding Cebollita Valley, about 35
miles south of Grant, N. Mex., making photographs of noteworthy features and
ground plans of some of the more interesting structures. After spending several
days in this work Mr. Hodge visited the pueblos of Laguna and Acoma, witnessing,
at the latter village, the interesting Fiesta de San Estevan, and, on September 3,
proceeded with his party to the widely known Mesa Encantada, some 3 miles from
Acoma, the traditional home of these Indians during prehistoric times. The pre-
cipitous height was climbed, the night was spent on the summit, and after carefully
examining its entire surface Mr. Hodge was successful in finding ample traces of
Indian occupancy at aremote period. He also found traces of an ancient pathway
leading toward the summit, and quantities of prehistoric ware in the talus, to
which it had evidently been washed from the summit of the mesa; accordingly he
was able to substantiate the essential features of an Acoma tradition.

The beginning of the year found Dr. J. Walter Fewkes occupied in collecting
aboriginal material from a prehistoric ruin known as Kintiel, or Pueblo Grande,
located on an upper wash of the Colorado Chiquito, between Navaho station and
Ganado, in eastern central Arizona. Situated midway between the Tusayan and
Zuni groups of pueblos, the origin of this ruin has for a number of years been
a problem to investigators in this field; but the researches of Dr. Fewkes show
quite conclusively that the art remains unearthed resemble more closely those of
Halona, Heshotauthla, and other ancient Zuni villages tham those of the prehistoric
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

pueblos of Tusayan. Excavations were conducted in the cemeteries, as well as in

the ruin of the village, in each of which an interesting collection of pottery and
bone and stove implements was unearthed.

Fully satisfied with the results at this point, Dr. Fewkes returned to the rail-
road, and from Holbrook proceeded to the vicinity of Pinedale, near the northern bor-
der of the White Mountain Apache Reservation, where another interesting collection
of objects was made. Although the ruins from which they were recovered are more
remote from the present Tusayan villages than are those of Kintiel, they are more
closely similar in form and in symbolic decoration to ancient Tusayan art products
than are the specimens obtained from the latter place.

Excavations were next conducted in an interesting ruin about 4 miles west of
Snowflake, which, like those of Pinedale, were hitherto unknown to archeologists.
Researches at this point extended over a period of a fortnight, being conducted both
in the house ruins and in the cemeteries northward and southwestward thereof. An
unusually large collection of fictile ware, as well as a very interesting but smaller
collection of bone, stone, and shell objects, were here recovered. By the middle of

_August Dr. Fewkes returned with his party to Holbrook, and proceeded thence to

the Tusayan villages, where he made observations supplementary to those conducted
in previous years in connection with the Snake Dance and related ceremonies.

During September Dr. Fewkes visited that part of the upper Gila Valley called
Pueblo Viejo, and examined the exterior ruins in that region discovered and described
by Emory and Johnston in 1846. He conducted archeological work in mounds near
Solomonville and San Jose de Pueblo Viejo, and collected several hundred objects
from these localities. These ruins were found to bear close architectural resemblance
to those near Phenix and Tempe, and to indicate adobe houses with walls supported
by logs and stones, clustered about a central building which served for protection or
for ceremonial purposes. Pottery and other objects from these ruins were found to
be identical with those from near Casa Grande. It was discovered that the ancient
people of this valley sometimes buried their dead in their houses, but that the larger
number were cremated. The calcined houses and ashes of the latter were placed in
decorated jars and buried in pyral mounds. Remains of extensive prehistoric irri-
gating ditches, reservoirs, and terraced gardens show that the valley was extensively
farmed in ancient times, and the large number of ruined houses indicate an extensive
population. An instructive collection of pottery, beads, shells, and sacrificial objects
was obtained from a cave in the mountains north of Pueblo Viejo.

During a part of his field season Dr. Fewkes had the aid of Mr. F. W. Hodge, and
during the entire summer the assistance of Dr. Walter Hough, of the United States
National Museum. The researches of Dr. Fewkes conducted during this summer
were remarkably successful both in the extent and value of the collections acquired
and in the archeologic and ethnologic data recorded.

Toward the end of September Mr. James Mooney took the field in New Mexico,
Texas, and contiguous Mexican States for the purpose of collecting, among various

. tribes, information additional to that obtained among the Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache

of Oklahoma concerning the primitive rites in which peyote, more popularly known
as “‘mescal,” is used as a narcotic and stimulant. Incidentally to this work, Mr.
Mooney made a brief visit to a series of interesting pueblo ruins, attributed to the
neighboring Tewa Indians, on a mesa 12 miles westward from Espanola, above
Santa Fé, on the Rio Grande, in New Mexico. These remains are of considerable
local repute, bnt thus far they have not been seriously excavated.

_ The Jicarilla Apache, numbering 850 on a reservation in northern New Mexico,
were the next object of Mr. Mooney’s attention. This tribe formerly roamed over
the section eastward of the mountains of New Mexico, on the head waters of Arkansas
and Canadian rivers, but affiliated with the Ute rather than with the plains tribes.

It was found that they knew of the peyote only through temporary association with

the Mescalero a few years ago when the two tribes were for a time on one reserva-
tion. The Mescalero Apache, numbering 450 on a reservation in southeastern New
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

' Mexico, were next visited. These Indians, whose popular name is derived from
their use of the ‘‘mescal” or peyote, are regarded by the plains tribes as masters
in all that concerns the plant, but from information received through their best
informants, as well as from actually witnessing the ceremony, Mr. Mooney found
the rite to be declining among them, largely through the difficulty of procuring the
plant in their isolated condition, as it requires five days’ journey on horseback to
obtain anecessary supply. Living with the Mescalero, Mr. Mooney discovered a num-
ber of Lipan and a few Kiowa-Apache Indians. ‘The Lipan were a predatory tribe of
eastern Texas and were practically exterminated some thirty years ago on account
of their raiding propensities against both Texas and Mexico. Ofthe remnant a few
are incorporated with the Tonkawa, a few joined the Mescalero and Kiowa-Apache,
while others, probably the larger number, fled to the Santa Rosa Mountains, in
northern Mexico, where they still live. Mr. Mooney obtained through the Lipan
further information in regard to several Texan tribes, including the Karankawa
and Tonkawa, of whom little has been known, and from them also definite infor-
mation was obtained in regard to the use of peyote among the Tarahumari of Mexico.

Having completed his investigations among the tribes of New Mexico in the early
part of December, Mr. Mooney devoted attention to the remnants of the Piro, Tiwa,
Suma, and Manso tribes on the Rio Grande, below El Paso, in Texas and Chihuahua.
These Indians, now practically Mexicanized, are the descendants of a large number
of natives who were taken by Governor Otermin on his retreat from Santa Fé to El
Paso and settled at their present location during the Pueblo rebellion in 1680. He
obtained valuable information in regard tothe former status of these people, and
conducted also some linguistic researches to which reference will later be made.

Mr. Mooney next proceeded to the mountain country of Texas, southeastward
from E] Paso, for the purpose of locating the peyote from information given by the
Mescaleros. ‘Two or more varieties of the plant were found in this section, on both
sides of the Rio Grande. In January Mr. Mooney continued southward to the Tara-
humari country in quest of additional information concerring the rites and customs
of that tribe of which peyote forms the feature. The Tarahumari is one of the most
populous tribes in North America, their number being variously estimated at from
50,000 to 80,000; they occupy nearly the whole mountain region of the State of Chi-
huahua. They perform a number of interesting ceremonies in which the peyote
plays an important role; indeed, the plant is a prominent part of the medicine
man’s stock in trade, rather than something used by the tribe at large, as among the
Kiowa and associated tribes to the northward. Several varieties of the peyote are
recognized by the Tarahumari, who procure the plant chiefly about Santa Rosalia,
in southeastern Chihuahua. Information concerning the ceremonial use of the
peyote by the neighboring Tepehuan tribes was likewise gained, and the-southern-
most limit of its use in Mexico was also determined.

Aside from his researches in this interesting subject, Mr. Mooney made an exami-
nation of some large burial caves near Aguas Calientes, about 200 miles southwest-
ward from Chihuahua city. Although the principal one of these caves had been
excavated by residents in the hope of finding buried treasure, and their contents
thereby disturbed, Mr. Mooney succeeded in recovering a well-preserved mummy
with its original wrappings of matting and native cloth and the accompanying food
and water vessels, which have been deposited in the National Museum. These and
kindred observations throw much light on the little-known mortuary customs of the
region.

During August and September Dr. Albert S. Gatschet was occupied in linguistic
researches begun during the preceding year among the Algonquian tribes in Maine
and contiguous parts of New Brunswick. His work resulted in the enrichment of
his vocabularies and in the preparation of numerous texts, valuable not only as
indices of linguistic structure, but as records of tribal history, customs, social
organization, and beliefs.

Mr. J.N. B. Hewitt spent the autumn in the field in northern New York and neigh-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

boring parts of Ontario, collecting linguistic and sociologic data required for the
full comparative study of the Iroquoian tribes. He was also able to obtain new and
valuable additions to the series of creation myths for which these Indians are nota-
ble, and through which their names have become entensively incorporated in the
literature of the world.

On November 4, 1897, Mr. J. B. Hatcher, of Princeton University, who was about
to sail for Argentina, was specially commissioned to make collections among the
Indian tribes of South America; and toward the end of the fiscal year he sent his
first shipment of material, representing the natives of Patagonia, whose character-
istics have attracted attention for centuries.

On January 11, 1898, Mr. Gerard Fowke was employed temporarily to make archzo-
logical surveys and excavations in an interesting locality in Kentucky. These exca-
vations were particularly successful, yielding a considerable quantity of valuable
archeologic material, which has been placed in the National Museum.

Shortly before the opening of the fiscal year Dr. Robert Stein, attached to Lieut.
R. E. Peary’s Arctic expedition for the purpose of exploring a little-known stretch
of the coast of western Greenland, was commissioned to make archcological
researches and collections. He was landed on August 10, 1897, and remained until
September 1, when he was taken up by Lieutenant Peary on his return trip. During
Dr. Stein’s stay on a part of the coast not now inhabited, he discovered abundant
traces of ancient habitation by the Eskimo, and collected a quantity of somatologic
and other material.

The objective material collected during these explorations has been placed in the
National Museum; the new data have been added to the archives and incorporated
in memoirs now in preparation or completed for publication, as indicated in other
paragraphs. The scientific results of the work are summarized in the following
pages.

OFFICE RESEARCH.

WORK IN ESTHETOLOGY.

Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing has continued the study and arrangement of his
collections of aboriginal handiwork from western Florida, and has made progress in
the preparation of a report on the prehistoric key-dwellers of the eastern shore of
the Gulf of Mexico. During the greater part of the year the collections were kept
in the Museum of Archeology of the University of Pennsylvania, where they were
shipped on account of the inadequate space then afforded by the National Museum
for unpacking and assembling; toward the end of the fiscal year, as the capacity of
the Museum was increased by the introduction of galleries, the greater part of the
collection was brought to Washington and arranged in cases and on tables for pur-
poses of comparison and study. In the course of his work Mr. Cushing has made
extensive comparisons between his specimens and those obtained by other archeolo-
gists from different portions of the United States, and the comparative studies are
highly significant. The Florida collections are rendered exceptionally valuable by
reason of the large number of specimens made from and decorated with animal and
vegetal substances, which are ordinarily perishable, though preserved in high per-
fection in the muck-beds associated with the Florida Keys. Accordingly, the material
serves better than any other collection thus far made to connect the records of the
early explorers with the observations of later times; at the same time it serves to _
round out knowledge concerning the pre-Columbian handiwork of the Indians in all
of the softer, more flexible, and more easily destructible substances, and accordingly
permits comparison of designs wrought in a wide range of materials.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes has continued the preparation of reports on his archzo-
logic researches in Arizona and New Mexico. These researches were undertaken
primarily for the purpose of enriching the collections of aboriginal art products for
the National Museum. The large collections embrace a remarkably complete series
4? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of primitive designs and motives in fictile ware, including the adaptation of myth-
ologic, animal, bird and feather, insect, and reptilian figures. Many of these are so
highly conventionalized that they would have been practically uninterpretable
without the knowledge of Tusayan mythologic and sociologic concepts which Dr.
Fewkes fortunately possesses; consequently he has been enabled to make sub-
stantial contributions to knowledge of the development of artistic concepts, the
results of which are incorporated in two memoirs for publication, respectively, in
the seventeenth and nineteenth annual reports.

In connection with other researches, Mr. W J McGee has made inquiries from dele-
gations of Indians visiting Washington concerning the symbolic use of feathers,
especially in connection with headdresses. It is well known to students that the
use of feathers, which, at first sight, would seem to be decorative merely, is essen-
tially symbolic; but the meanings of the symbols have not been ascertained hitherto,
save casually and among a few tribes. During the year, the feather symbolism of
the Ponka and Ojibwa tribes has been discovered and recorded with tolerable com-
pleteness.

WORK IN TECHNOLOGY.

Arts and industries are correlated factors in human progress, and the lines of con-
ceptual development traced through the study of art motives elucidate the growth
of industrial devices. Accordingly, the work of the collaborators in connection
with art motives has contributed both directly and indirectly to aboriginal technol-
ogy. During the year special attention was given to lines of technical development,
as indicated in previous reports and in the acquisition of material for study and
preservation in the Museum. Especially valuable is the Steiner collection, from the
mounds of Etowah Valley, Georgia. It comprises 3,215 specimens of stone imple-
ments, earthenware, and symbolic and decorative objects of copper, shell, and stone.
The Indians of this district, builders of the great Etowah mound and other monu-
ments, were peculiarly fertile in artistic and industrial devices. In this region the
progressive tribes of the Siouan stock, the vigorous Cherokee, one or more of the wide- —
ranging Algonquian tribes, the little-known Yuchi, and some of the Muskhogean
tribes came in frequent contact, while the influence of the arts and industries of the
key-dwellers of Florida was constantly felt. Here, as elsewhere, ideas and ideals were
stimulated by contact, whether peaceful or not, and the devices representing the
rapidly growing concepts are especially significant and useful in tracing the course
of industrial development among the aboriginal tribes. Another noteworthy acqui-
sition is the Morris collection from Arkansas, comprising 181 pieces of pottery,
together with a number of stone implements and other objects. ‘The collection is
especially valuable as an illustration of types of pottery hitherto rare or unknown.
But the most important acquisition of archeologic objects procured during the year
is comprised in the collections made by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes from the ruins of Kin-
tiel, Pinedale, Four-mile, Solomonville, and others in eastern and southern Arizona
and southwestern New Mexico, an elaborate report on which is now being prepared.
Like the collections obtained at Sikyatki, Awatobi, and other Tusayan ruins, these
include fictile and textile products, stone, bone, and wooden implements, and objects
of shell and stone used for personal adornment. In symbolic decorative features
the mortuary food and water vessels, as well as many of the utensils recovered from
the houses, are exceedingly rich. The collections have been deposited in the
National Museum.

The process of culture in all the five departments is by invention and accultura-
tion. The invention is at first individual, but when invention is accepted and used
by others it is accultural, and the invention of the individual may be added to the
invention of others, so that it may be the invention of many men. Objects may be
used without designed modification, or they may be designedly modified for a purpose.
The use of objects without the designed modification of them has been appplied
to Seri stone implements by Mr, McGee, when he calls such modified implements
Pri

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

protolithic, while the modified stone implements he calls technolithic. The two
phases are widely distinct, not only in type of object, but even more in the mental
operations exemplified by the objects; for the protolithic objects represent unde-
signed adaptation and modification of cobbles picked up at random, while the others

. represent designed shaping in accordance with preconceived ideals. The coexist-

ence of the incongruous types seemed puzzling at the outset, but was provisionally
ascribed to the difference in occupation between the sexes, the women using the
protolithic implements and the warriors making and using the technolithic weapons.
Further study showed that the objects of chipped stone imitate in every essential
respect the aboriginal weapons of the hereditary enemies of the Seri, including the
Papago and Yaki; and this fact, coupled with the mysticism thrown around the
stone arrowpoints by the Seri shamans, indicated that the idea of the technolithic
weapon was acquired through warfare. Examination of other characteristics of the
Seri in the light of this interpretation served to explain various puzzling features
and at the same time established the validity of the interpretation. The Seri
have been at war with alien tribes almost constantly since the time of Columbus,
and indeed long before, as indicated by archwologic evidence. Most of their arts
and industries are exceedingly primitive; yet here and there features imitating
those characteristic of neighboring tribes, or even of white men, are found. Thus
they use ollas for carrying water which are fairly distinctive in type, though appar-
ently based on alien models, yet make no other use of baked clay. They substitute
cast-off rags and fabrics obtained by plunder for their own fabrics, wrought with
great labor from inferior fibers. Since the adjacent waters have been navigated
they have learned to collect flotsam, using tattered sailcloth in lieu of pelican-skin
blankets, cask staves in lieu of shells as paddles for their balsas, hoop-iron in lieu
of charred hardwood as arrowpoints for hunting, and iron spikes in lieu of bone
harpoons for taking turtles; and almost without exception these modifications in
custom have arisen without amicable relation and despite—indeed largely by
reason of—deep-seated enmity against the alien peoples.

SOCIOLOGY.

In soziology Mr. McGee has observed some interesting facts which give light on
the development of institutions among the tribes of America, especially in the
acculturation that spreads from one unfriendly tribe to another, which he calls
piratical acculturation. The Apache and Papago tribes have been bitterly inimical
from time immemorial, the oldest creation legends of the Papago describing the
separation of the peoples in the beginning; yet there is hardly a custom among them
which has not been shaped partially or completely by the inimical tribe. The
habitat of the Papago in the hard desert is that to which they have been forced by
the predatory Apache; the industries of the Papago are shaped by the conditions of
the habitat and by the perpetual anticipation of attack; the traditions recounted by
the old men are chiefly of battle against the Apache; even the ceremonies and beliefs

_are connected with that eternal vigilance which they have found the price of safety,

and with the wiles and devices of the ever-present enemy. Perhaps the most
important element in the acculturation is that connected with belief, for to the
primitive mind the efficiency of a weapon is not mechanical but mystical, an expres-
sion of superphysical potency, and each enemy strives constantly to coax or suborn
the beast-gods and potencies of the other; so the Papago warrior went confidently
to battle against the Apache when protected by a charm, or fetish, including an
Apache arrowpoint taken in conflict, and felt assured of victory if his warclub was
made in imitation of that of the enemy and potentialized by a plume or inscription
appealing to the Apache deity. Even later in the scale of development, after the
piratical acculturation is measurably amicable, this factor remains strong, as among
the clans of the Kwakiutl and some other tribes in which the aim of marriage set-
tlement is the acquisition, not of property or kindred per se, but of gods and tradi-
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tions concerning them. The general law of piratical acculturation finds innumera-
ble examples among the more primitive peoples of the world, and phases of it have
been recognized in the proposition that conquering tribes take the language of the
conquered. Other phases have been perceived, e. g., in the hypothesis of primitive
‘marriage by capture.” Various earlier students have noted that actual or cere-.
monial capture of the bride is a part of marriage among certain tribes, and have
assumed that this was the initial form of mating among primitive peoples; later
researches have shown that, in the lowest of the four great culture stages, mating
is regulated by the females and their male consanguineal kindred, so that mar-
riage by capture of brides can not occur; yet there is a step early in the stage of
paternal organization in which a certain form of marriage by capture has arisen in
America, and may easily have become prominent on other continents. When tribes
are in that unstable condition of amity resulting in peaceful interludes between
periods of strife—a stage characteristic of savagery and much of barbarism—the
intertribal association frequently results in irregular matches between members of
the alien tribes; commonly such mating is punished by one or both tribes, though
among many peoples there are special regulations under which the offense may be
condoned—e. g., the groom may be subjected to fine, to running the gantlet, to
ostracism until children are born, etc. Yet while both bride and groom incur dis-
pleasure and even risk of life through such matches, there is a chance of attendant
advantage which may counterbalance the risk; for it frequently happens that the
groom, especially if of the weaker tribe, eventually gains the amity and support of
his wife’s kinsmen, while in some cases the elder men and elder women of one or
both tribes recognize the desirability of a coalition which can tend only to unite
the deities of both, and so benefit each in greater or lesser measure. Researches
among the American aborigines have already shown that, so far as this continent is
concerned, exogamy and endogamy are correlative, the former referring to the clan
and the latter to the tribe or other group; they have also shown that the limitations
of exogamy and the extension of endogamy are ingenious devices for promoting
peace; and it is now becoming clearer that intertribal marriage, whether by
mutually arranged elopement or by capture of the bride, may be a means of extend-
ing endogamy and uniting aliens, and thereby of raising acculturation from the
piratical plane to that of amicable interchange. The applications of the law of
piratical acculturation are innumerable. In the light of the law, it becomes easy to
understand how inimical tribes are gradually brought to use similar weapons and
implements, to adopt similar modes of thinking and working, to worship similar
ceities, and thus to be brought from complete dissonance to potential harmony when-
soever the exigency of primitive life may serve; and thus the course of that con-
vergent development, which is the most important lesson the American aborigines
have given to the world, is made clear. Some idea may be formed, also, of the his-
tory of piratical acculturation.

WORK IN PHILOLOGY,

Dr. Albert S. Gatschet has continued the preparation of a comparative vocabulary
of Algonquian dialects, making satisfactory progress. The Algonquian linguistic
stock was the most extensive of North America, both in the number of dialects
and in the area occupied by the tribes using them. For this and other reasons
the stock has been a source of much labor among philologists, and there has
been considerable diversity of opinion as to its classification. One of the tasks
undertaken by the Bureau early in its history was the review of Algonquian
linguistic material for the purpose of formulating a definite and satisfactory classi-
fication. Many vocabularies have been collected and compared; to aid in the
determination of affinities, grammatic material has also been obtained in consider-
able volume; and still further to elucidate relations, a body of records of myths and
ceremonies has been accumulated. ‘The lexic, grammatic, and mythologic records of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AD

the Algonquian stock collected by collaborators of the Bureau and obtained from
correspondents form several hundred manuscripts; and it is from this voluminous
material that the comparative vocabulary is compiled. In addition to this routine
work on the vocabulary, Dr. Gatschet has from time to time prepared linguistic
material for use in answering inquiries of numerous correspondents.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt has continued the study of the Iroquoian language during the
year. As noted in former reports, he has also carried forward a general study of the
pronoun as used in primitive tongues, with a view to the preparation of a memoir on
linguistic development. Partly as a means to this end, partly because of the inhe-
rent interest of the subject, he has undertaken a comparative study of the creation
myths of the Iroquoian and some other tribes. During the latter portion of the year
the greater part of his time has been devoted to this study, with highly satisfactory
results.

During his operations among the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache tribes of New
Mexico, mainly for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the ceremonial use
of the peyote among those people, as recorded in previous paragraphs, Mr. James
Mooney accepted the opportunity of obtaining vocabularies for comparison with cog-
nate dialects together with their genesismyths. The Mescalero and Jicarilla dialects
are practically the same, and the cosmogony of the two tribes is also nearly identical,
although they were generally at war with each other, the Mescalero cooperating
with the plain tribes while the Jicarilla were allies of the Ute. Owing to the fact
that the Lipan were exterminated nearly a generation ago, and by reason of the
isolation of the surviving remnants, doubt has been expressed as to their true affinity,
but from a vocabulary obtained by Mr. Mooney from members of this tribe associated
with the Mescalero on their reservation, it is now known that they speak % well-
defined Athapascan dialect. Such iinguistic researches as the present meager
knowledge of their language would permit were also conducted by Mr. Mooney
among the modified Tiwa and Piro Indians on the Rio Grande below El Paso.

Returning from the field for the purpose of revising proofs of a memoir on the Cal-
endar History of the Kiowa Indians, in course of composition as a part of the seven-
teenth annual report, Mr. James Mooney remained in the office during the last quarter
of the year, occupied, in the intervals of proof reading, in the translation and arrange-
ment of a large collection of Cherokee myths recorded in the original syllabary as
well as inthe English. Satisfactory progress was made in preparing the material
for publication.

During the later part of the year the researches in Indian sign language, which
were brought to a close by the death of Colonel Mallery in 1894, were resumed
through the collaboration of Capt. Hugh L. Scott, U. S. A. Captain Scott was sta-
tioned for some years on the frontier, where he was in constant contact with various
Indian tribes, including the plains Indians, among whom the sign language was
highly developed. Early in his stay he became interested in the signs and began
acquiring this interesting art of expression, and his studies continued until he became
proficient and able to use the sign language habitually in communicating with
various tribes. His knowledge of the system is undoubtedly superior to that of
any other white man, and his acquaintance with individual signs exceeds that of any
Indian with whom he has come in contact. During the winter Captain Scott was
transferred to Washington, and through the courtesy of the Secretary of War and
the Commanding General of the Army he was authorized to take up the record and
discussion of sign language under the direction of the Bureau. Considerable progress
had been made in the work when it was interrupted by conditions connected with
the war with Spain.

WORK IN SOPHIOLOGY.

The Director continued the development of a system of classification designed to
indicate the place of the American Indians among the peoples of the earth; during
the latter part of the year he took up the voluminous material in the Bureau

46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

archives relating to aboriginal mythology. While in charge of the United States
Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain region, before the Bureau
was instituted, the Director began the collection of myths among the Indians of the
Territories, and when the Bureau was created this material, in connection with a
body of linguistic manuscripts obtained by the Smithsonian Institution, formed the
original archives. Additional material was collected from time to time by the
Director and by several of the collaborators, and there are now some hundreds of
manuscript records ready for study. Satisfactory progress has been made in the
preliminary arrangement of the manuscripts and in the extraction and classification
of salient features in the primitive mythology prevailing among all of the native
tribes before the advent of the white man. ;

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson has continued the final revision of her manuscript
for a memoir on the Zuni Indians, designed for incorporation in the nineteenth
annual report. Most of the chapters are now complete, and nearly all of the illus-
trations are ready for reproduction. The Pueblo Indians well illustrate certain
results of environment in the development of belief and ceremony. A harsh envi-
ronment begets profound faith; this is illustrated by the history of many cults.
The Pueblo region was a gathering ground of primitive faiths, each fertilizing the
others in accordance with the law already set forth and each intensified by hard
local conditions. The northern tribes, who furnished much of the blood of the Pueblo
peoples, were pressed down from more humid regions and brought into conflict with
alien warriors and with an arid habitat in which the specters of thirst and famine
were ever present; the southern tribes, who furnished most of the culture of the
Pueblos, were in part at least forced up toward the plateaus from the still more arid
district$ about the present national boundary into which they had fled, as the excess
of population from the more fertile districts of pre-Columbian Mexico. Ali of the
peoples were shadowed by the dangers of drought and by the hard labor required for
the maintenance of existence; all were accustomed to invocations for rain; all were
accustomed to ceremonies connected with the growth of corn; all were accustomed
to reverence of beast-gods, and all ascribed their preservation from ever-present
danger to their success in propitiating the maleficent mysteries by which they were
surrounded—for that which is simply a hard natural condition to the advanced
thinker is always a maleficent potency to the primitive thinker. All of the circum-
stances were such as to develop a profoundly devotional cast of mind among the
Pueblo peoples; and their myths and ceremonies became so striking as to attract
the attention of students throughout the world, as white men came in contact with
them. Mrs. Stevenson’s researches concerning the myths and ceremonies have been
exceptionally thorough, and the results now nearly ready for publication will form
a substantial contribution to the knowledge of aboriginal mythology.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

During the year the important work of compiling a Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes
of North America was continued by Mr. F. W. Hodge, with the assistance of Dr.
Cyrus Thomas, the former carrying forward the work in connection with other
duties. Dr.Thomas completed the preliminary arrangement of the material relating
to the tribes of the Algonquian stock, submitting the material for editorial revision.
He afterward took up the manuscript and literature relating to the tribes of the
Siouan stock, and has made satisfactory progress in the arrangement of the material.

COLLECTIONS.

A number of collections have been acquired during the year under the more imme-
diate direction of the Secretary. Some of these are noted above; in addition there
have been acquired (1) a collection of Jamaican antiquities by MacCormack, includ-
ing 160 specimens of ancient stone implements, earthenware, etc., and 20 petaloid
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ; AT

implements; (2) the Palmer collection of 98 ethnologic specimens from Mexico, and
(3) the Gane collection of cliff-house relics, comprising fictile ware, bone imple-
ments, etc., from San Juan Valley, Utah. In addition, the Muniz collection of
trephined skulls, illustrated and described in the sixteenth annual report, was
finally transferred to the Museum. A considerable number of separate objects and
minor collections obtained by exchange for reports and by gift has also been turned
over to the Museum during the year; among these was a Muskwaki hand-loom
obtained by Mr. McGee for the express purpose of filling an hiatus in the national
collection.
PUBLICATION.

Satisfactory progress has been made by Mr. Hodge in the revision of the proofs of
the seventeenth and eighteenth annual reports and in the editorial work on the
manuscript of the nineteenth annual report. The seventeenth report was trans-
mitted to the Public Printer by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution on
July 6, 1897, the first proofs being received on September 20, and by the end of
June, 1898, the two volumes comprising the work were practically all in type. In
addition to the usual account of the operations of the Bureau the seventeenth annual
report will contain four memoirs, bearing the titles, ‘‘The Seri Indians,” by W J
McGee; ‘Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians,” by James Mooney; ‘‘Navaho
Houses,” by Cosmos Mindeleff, and ‘‘Archzeological Expedition to Arizona in 1895,”
by J. Walter Fewkes.

The eighteenth annual report was transmitted to the Public Printer by the Secre-
tary on March 11, 1898. It comprises, in addition to the report of operations for the
fiscal year 1896-97, two papers entitled, respectively, ‘‘The Eskimo About Bering
Strait,” by E. W. Nelson, and ‘Indian Land Cessions in the United States,” by
-C. C. Royce. Like the seventeenth annual report, this also will appear in two
volumes. The first galley proofs were received from the Public Printer in the latter
part of June.

While all the material for the nineteenth annual report is not yet in hand, satis-
factory progress has been made in its preparation, and it is believed that a sufficient
number of memoirs have already been received from the collaborators of the Bureau
to warrant the publication of the report in at least two volumes. These memoirs
are: “Cathlamet Texts,” by Franz Boas; ‘‘Archzological Researches in 1896 and
1897,” by J. Walter Fewkes; ‘‘Tusayan Snake and Flute Ceremonies,” also by Dr.
Fewkes; ‘‘ Localization of Gentes,” by Cosmos Mindeleff; and ‘‘Aboriginal American
Architecture,” also by Mr. Mindeletf. It is expected that several other noteworthy
papers will be received from their authors in ample time for incorporation as a part
of this report.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

As set forth in a previous report, the bibliography of the aboriginal languages of
Mexico, which was left uncompleted at the time of Mr. Pilling’s death, has been con-
tinued through the generous services of Mr. George Parker Winship, librarian of
the John Carter Brown library at Providence, with the courteous permission of Mr.

_John Nicholas Brown. The unusual facilities afforded by the excellent library under
Mr. Winship’s care has enabled him to make marked progress with this work during
the fiscal year; much, however, yet remains to be done ere the work will be ready
for publication.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Tibrary.—The maintenance of the library has continued under the supervision of
Mr. Hodge, and the distribution of the publications of the Bureau has also been
conducted under his direction. At the close of the last fiscal year, as mentioned in
the report covering that period, the volumes in the library numbered 7,138; to these
756 volumes have been added, making a total of 7,894 volumes at the close of the
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

year. In addition several thousand pamphlets and scientific periodicals have been
received.

Illustrations.—The preparation of the illustrations, including the photographic
work, was continued under the direction of Mr. Wells M. Sawyer until March 17,
1898, when he resigned to accept another Federal appointment. From that time
until the close of the year the preparation of illustrations was conducted under the
able supervision of Mr. De Lancey Gill, of the United States Geological Survey,
through the courtesy of Hon. Charles D. Walcott, director of that Bureau. During
the year about 75 negatives and 610 photographic prints were made for purposes of
illustration and exchange. The preservation and cataloguing of the Bureau’s
negatives have continued with the aid of Mr. Henry Walther.

Respectfully submitted. J. W. POWELL,

APPENDIX III.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the International Exchange Service
for the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Exchanges;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes;

I have the honor to say that the property belonging to the International Exchanges
is contained in six rooms in the basement of the Smithsonian building. The furni-
ture and fixtures consist of desks, sorting tables, racks, and bins for the assembling
and classification of exchanges, the usual appliances of a well-equipped office, a type-
writer, shelves for directories and reference books, and several filing cases for sys-
tematically arranging all invoices, letters, and the card record of exchange corre-
spondents. This record contains a complete debit and credit exchange account with
all persons or institutions corresponding with the service wherever located, and at
present embraces the names, addresses, and records of all packages sent to or received
from 30,000 correspondents.

Aside from the office equipment above mentioned, it is necessary to constantly
carry in stock from 100 to 300 packing boxes, used for the shipment of exchanges
abroad, wrapping paper, twine of various sizes, nails and screws in quantity, from
40,000 to 60,000 manila envelopes of various sizes and weights for inclosing books
and pamphlets, a large supply of printed cards for indexing, cataloguing, and for
the acknowledgments of exchanges, both foreign and domestic.

The office furniture and fixtures represent an original expenditure of about $1,800,
and, taking into account the depreciation resultant from use, are at present valued
at $1,200. The cost of stationery and supplies on hand averages about $500.

During the twelve months ending June 30, 1898, the cost of materials purchased
from the Congressional appropriation for that year aggregated $938.48 and from
repayments $1,177.79.

The premises occupied by the exchange service are the property of the Smithsonian
Institution and are assigned gratuitously to the exclusive use of the International
Exchange Service, together with repairs, which are made by the Institution as they
become necessary.

I am pleased to report that during the past year there have been no losses of .
property and no damages beyond those due to the results of constant use.

Concerning the operation of the service during the year, I have the honor to report
that the total number of packages from all sources handled was 84,208, representing
an increase of 3,046 in number and nearly 22 per cent in weight over the exchange
shipments of the previous year. Of this number, 58,640 packages originated in the
United States and were forwarded to 93 foreign countries, while the remainder were
received from 40 different countries abroad for distribution in the United States.

There has also been an increase of 1,450 in the number of correspondents, foreign and
domestic, which now aggregate nearly 30,000 addresses, representing practically
every civilized part of the world.

The work of the service is succinctly given in the following table:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by
Congress to the Smithsonian Institution for that purpose and in part by appropria-
tions to different bureaus of the Government for repayment to the Institution of a
portion of the cost of transportation, the rate of which repayment was fixed by the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

Board of Regents in 1878 at 5 cents a pound. A similar charge is also made in the
case of State institutions. During the past year the total amount available for
the support of the service aggregated $25,195.33, of which sum $19,000 was appro-
priated by Congress and $6,193.33 was derived from repayments.

The appropriation by Congress, being for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, and
forming an item in the sundry civil act approved June 4, 1897, was made in the fol-
lowing terms:

‘“‘Wor expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, nineteen thousand dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements for the year to July 1, 1888, were as follows:

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

So far as the appropriations permitted, the facilities for rapid transportation of
exchanges have been improved, but until more ample funds shall be made available
it will be necessary to continue to rely largely upon the liberality of the several
trans-oceanic steamship lines which have for so long a time been giving free trans-
portation.

Through the courtesy of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Mis-
sions and the Board of Foreign Missions ef the Presbyterian Church in the United
States, packages of miscellaneous publications are forwarded to Turkey, but the
transmission of United States Government documents has not been revived since its
discontinuance in 1896, as explained in my last report. The extensive demand for
scientific publications from this country is expected to result in the near future in
the establishment of an exchange bureau in Japan. Until that is done, or at least
until some responsible institution is prepared to undertake the distributiom of
exchanges intended for that country, the forwarding of all miscellaneous exchanges

must remain in abeyance. Negotiations are now pending, through the intervention

of the United States minister to Greece, for the reopening of exchange relations with

the National Library at Athens, which have now been suspended for several years,

and it is anticipated that satisfactory arrangements will soon be completed.

With the exceptions mentioned above and the interruption of intercourse with

Spain and her colonies on account of the war, exchange relations throughout the
world are more completely established than ever before, and it is believed that
the few connections still remaining to perfect the system will be made at no distant
time.

For many years all exchanges for Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, and the Balkan
countries have been forwarded, in conjunction with German exchanges, through the
agency of the Institution at Leipzig. This indirect system of transmission was
inaugurated at a time when the total amount of the shipments to those countries

_ was relatively small and the practice has been allowed to continue in view of the
zealous and efficient manner in which Dr. Felix Fliigel has performed his duties
as agent. The rapid increase in recent years in the amount of work at this agency
has made the burden too heavy, however, especially when taking into considera-
tion the formalities necessary for clearing and transporting packages between Ger-
many and the other countries that participate in this arrangement, and rendered it
necessary to provide for more direct means of communication. Thus it was found
desirable, as suggested in my last report, to establish agencies in Austria and Hun-
gary, to which shipments could be made direct. With this end in view the chief
clerk of the international exchanges was instructed to visit those countries late
in the summer of 1897, and upon his return to recommend the designation of suit-
able agents. As aresult Dr. Joseph von Korésy, director of the Statistical Bureau
of Budapest, and the Imperial Royal Central Statistical Commission of Vienna
were appointed agents of the service, thus eliminating the entire territory of
Austria-Hungary from the jurisdiction of the overburdened agency at Leipzig. In
addition to securing these new agents, the representatives of the exchange service
at Leipzig, Brussels, Paris, and London were visited and much valuable information
obtained, which has already been productive of many improvements in the service.

Messrs. William Wesley & Son and Dr. Felix Fliigel, the agents of the exchange
service at London and Leipzig, respectively, have been so long identified with the
Institution that no comment as to their efficiency or faithful service is necessary.
Great credit is due the clerical force of the exchange service. While the work is at
times burdensome and requires extraordinary effort, the force has always been found
equal to any emergency.

The following list represents the names of companies and other mediums of trans-
portation that have aided the Institution during the past year in the transmission
and distribution of exchanges, either without compensation or at minimum rates,
some of which have extended equal courtesies to the Institution for many years:

APPENDIX IV.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the National Zoological Park for
the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments—

1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Park;

2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report;

3. Theextent and kind of improvements made in the buildings and grounds during
the past year and the estimated cost;

4. The extent and character of the losses of property and the origin and causes—
I have the honor to say that at the end of this period there were in the park thir-
teen buildings for animals, which have cost about $50,000; six buildings for admin-
istrative purposes, costing about $9,000; fences and outdoor inclosures, costing
about $20,000; machinery, tools, and implements, valued at $2,000; horses, valued
at $885; office furniture, fixtures, and books, worth about $950; and nurseries of
trees and shrubs, estimated at $1,000. The value of the roadways constructed in the
park since its occupation by the Government is about $35,000.

The collection of living animals used for purposes of exhibition comprised 549
specimens, embracing 124 species, most of which were the property of the Govern-
ment. The estimated value of the animals owned by the Government is $25,000.

There was acquired during the twelve months covered by this report property
amounting to about $11,000, about $6,200 being for buildings and $2,500 for animals,
including their transportation. A considerable number of animals were presented,
the most valuable of these being a Virginia deer, a capuchin monkey, 2 coyotes,
some cockatoos and macaws, the white and the wood ibis. The herd of bison now
comprises 10 specimens, and as they seem to thrive in captivity, it is hoped that
they may be indefinitely perpetuated. It will, no doubt, often be desirable to cross
this herd with others in order to prevent the evil effects of too close breeding.

Twelve animals have bred in the park, producing an aggregate of 35 births. A
few animals were received from the Yellowstone Park, among which were 8 speci-
mens of the American white pelican.

A considerable improvement has been effected in the buildings by removing the
group of shops and the property yard from the prominent place which they occupied
to the northward of the main building. It was never intended that this should be
adopted as the permanent situation of these buildings, and as the development of
the park proceeded their intrusion became more and more irksome. Some consider-
able difficulty was experienced in properly locating the shops. It is necessary that
they should be conveniently accessible, and at the same time where they do not
markedly attract public attention. After carefully weighing all practicable loca-
tions, it was finally decided that the best place was one originally proposed by Mr.
Olmsted, which is on the banks of Rock Creek, a few hundred yards above the
Quarry Road bridge, not far from the paddocks for deer and llamas. Their situa-
tion is not very suitable for animals, and is not in public view from the main road.
A long, low building was here erected to serve as a carpenter and blacksmith shop.
Its cost was about $1,000.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

~ The ground vacated upon the hill, which is one of the most desirable sites in the
park for buildings, was used for the erection of a large shed suitable for herbivorous
animals requiring a moderate degree of heat. This house is about 40 by 100 feet
with a wing 30 by 40 feet. The small sum available made it necessary to limit the
construction to bare necessities. It was therefore impossible to lay a floor or to
finish the interior in any but the roughest manner. Eventually this house will be
used mainly for such animals as antelopes and tropical deer. It is therefore known
as the antelope house. Its cost was about $3,500.

The aquarium received from the Atlanta Exposition was partly set up in one of
the abandoned sheds. About $200 was expended on this during the vear. In order
to obtain a suitable person for keeping this aquarium a competitive examination was
held by the Civil Service Commission and the successful competitor was finally
appointed. The first tanks to be established were those for fresh water. These
have been fed by water from the city mains, but as this is frequently very turbid it
became necessary to use an alum filter for the purpose of clearing it. This is dis-
advantageous, as it requires constant care and watchfulness to prevent an excess of
the salt impregnating the water and injuring the fish. It is thought that a more
satisfactory water supply can be obtained by sinking wells near the creek and fore-
ing the water to the aquarium by a pump.

A new deer paddeck was established during the year upon the high ground near
the western entrance at a cost of $800. The cold damp exposure near the creek,
where the paddocks have been situated, is found to affect the health of the animals,

Small shelters and alterations amounting to $700 were made during the year.

There was expended upon the continuation of the road along the meadow and its
slopes $4,800. Repairs to existing roads amounted to about $1,000. Upon walks
there was spent $650.

The seeding, planting, sodding, and improving of grounds cost in the neighborhood
of $1,200.

Considerable deterioration in the buildings and inclosures of the park has occurred
during the year, due in great measure to the temporary character of these structures.
The elephant barn is still in a very serious condition, the floor in the principal ani-
mal house greatly needs to be wholly replaced, and the smaller buildings and cages
must, many of them, soon be entirely rebuilt. The bridge over Rock Creek near the
Quarry road shows signs of decay in some of its principal timbers, and will soon
have to be replaced by a more permanent structure. It is estimated that this will
cost about $8,500.

The losses of animals were no greater than is usual among animals kept in con-
finement, although several of the buildings are by no means suitable for the animals
confined in them. Tropical birds and monkeys necessarily suffer when placed in
buildings that are not kept at a constant temperature of at least 70°. It is hoped
that houses specially adapted to these classes of animals may be erected in the park
at no distant day.

I append herewith a list of the animals in the park at the close of the year; also
the accessions from various sources during the year.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the Astrophysical Observatory for

the year ending June 30, 1898.

In response to your request that the report shall begin with the following state-
ments:
1. The amount, kinds, and classes of property belonging to the Observatory.
2. The amount of such property acquired during the twelve months covered by
the report.
3. The extent and kind of improvements made in the building and grounds during
the past year, and the estimated cost.
4, The extent and character of the losses of property, and the origin and causes.
I have the honor to report:

The most important features of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory during
the past year have been as follows:

1. The instrumental equipment has received valuable accessions, including a highly
sensitive galvanometer, designed and constructed at the Observatory; two cylindric
mirrors by Brashear (which, as used for collimation of the spectroscope, are equiva-
lent to a lens of 64 meters focal length), and, finally and most important of all, a
system of cooling by the expansion of ammonia, which has made possible an exten-
sion of constant temperature conditions to cover the five months of March, April,

69
TO REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

May, September, and October, otherwise frequently too warm. At present the
change of temperature of the inner room between these warmer and the coldest win-
ter months is only a fraction of a degree centigrade, and during an hour’s observa-
tion it is generally less than one-tenth degree, the control being automatic.

2. Many bolographs of the infra-red solar spectrum have been taken, which, in
consequence of these improvements, have yielded results threefold richer in ‘‘real”
detail corresponding to solar and telluric absorption lines than any hitherto obtained.

3. About 40 of these bolographs have been compared, as described in the Appen-
dix to the Secretary’s Report for 1896, and 21 of the most perfect have been measured
upon the comparator to determine the positions of the deflections found to be ‘‘real,”
or, in other words, corresponding to either solar or telluric absorption lines. These
comparator measurements included about 44,000 separate observations.

There have thus been found over 700 absorption lines in the infra-red solar spec-
trum between wave lengths 0.76 sc and 6.0 4, an increase of about 500 over last years’
results.

4, With the purpose of making a more accurate determination of the wave lengths
corresponding to the well-determined positions of the absorption lines discovered
in the rock-salt prismatic spectrum, a very exact comparison of the dispersion of
rock salt and fluorite has been made. This comparison will allow the indirect
employment of certain recent and apparently very accurate determinations of the
wave lengths in the fluorite prismatic spectrum. Apparatus has been made ready
and certain preliminary observations have been taken to directly measure the dis-
persion of rock salt. It is hoped that these steps will result in furnishing the wave
lengths of the infra-red absorption lines to a degree of accuracy corresponding to
che exactness of the determination of their prismatic deviations.

5. Many interesting instances of local variations in the absorption have been
noticed. Among these by far the most striking is a great decrease in the absorption
at the longer wave-length side of the great band wat about 1.4 ~. This change
occurred about February 15, 1898, and caused the bolographs to take on quite a dif-
ferent form at the place in question. This new form continued through the months
of March and April, but in the month of May the usual form was gradually restored.
It is found, by reference to former bolographs, that this marked decrease in absorp-
tion at this point takes place annually at about the same period, which coincides
(fortuitously or otherwise) very nearly with that at which there is the greatest
activity of growth in the vegetable kingdom. This raises the question whether the
growth of vegetation does not abstract from the air great quantities of some select-
ively absorbing vapor active in absorption at this wave length.

Whether such be the case or not future investigation must determine, but enough
variations in the absorption have been observed to indicate that the Observatory
is now in condition to make advances along the line indicated in the Secretary’s
report for 1892, in which is pointed out the important relations of astrophysics to
meteorology.

FULLER DETAILS OF THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

The best design for a sensitive galvanometer of the Thomson reflecting type was
investigated, with the following results: ‘The most suitable electrical resistance of
a galvanometer for the bolographic work proposed was determined. Expressions
were deduced from which the size and relative efficiency of coils of the best form
and of a given resistance, but differently wound, could be computed. Computations
were made which determined the best sizes of wire and the best apportionment of
resistance for a coil of the most suitable total resistance wound in three sections.
Four such coils were wound. Several experiments were made to determine the best
construction of galyanometer needle, and two needles were made which are found
to be very satisfactory. The coils were mounted in a galvanometer case constructed
at the Observatory shop, and the needle was suspended by a quartz fiber of exceeding
fineness.

Notwithstanding the greater sensitiveness of the first needle, the second has been
employed in taking bolographs for two reasons: First, because its mirror (of 2 mil-
ligrams weight, by Brashear) gave better definition; and second, because the needle
was steadier on account of its greater weight. It is probable that means could be
devised, though not without considerable time and expense, to use the first needle
with as much satisfaction as the second, and thus to gain four times in sensitiveness.

The achievement of this very considerable advance in sensitiveness made the use
of both a narrower bolometer and a narrower slit to the spectrobolometer possible.
The former was already at hand. To reduce the linear width of the slit would have
resulted in a waste of radiations because of diffraction, a danger to which some
reference was made in last year’s report. ‘To reduce the angular width of the slit
by a collimating system of spherical mirrors of longer equivalent focus would have
resulted in a waste of radiations, because of the vertical spreading out of the beam.
In these circumstances an arrangement of cylindrical collimating mirrors was
designed, with the aim to avoid both horns of this dilemma. These mirrors, one
convex of 57 centimeters focus and one concave of 544 centimeters focus, were exe-
cuted by Brashear and give equally as good definition as the spherical concave mir-
rors before employed, while reducing the angular width corresponding to a given
linear aperture of the slit to about one-seventh of its former magnitude. The
angular widths of slit and bolometer strip have now each been reduced to about 1.3
seconds of arc.

In the use of the new arrangements much trouble was at first experienced from
“drift” and accidental disturbances of the galvanometer. The ‘‘drift” was reduced
to nearly its former harmless magnitude by added precautions to avoid temperature
changes. But the accidental disturbauces, especially with the very narrow bolom-
eter (0.03 millimeter), were very serious, and on days when there was the slightest
breeze absolutely prohibitive to observation. It was found at length that by mak-
ing the chamber occupied by the bolometer air-tight to a difference of pressure of
one-third of an atmosphere all prejudicial effects of the wind, except such slight
ones as were due to mechanical jarring, were avoided. Bolographs may now be
taken with good results on the very windiest days.

Mechanical jarring of the galvanometer has been reduced by floating it in a pan
of mercury, which is itself supported upon the table of the Julius suspension intro-
duced here in 1895.

Bearing in mind the advantage derived from inclosing the bolometer in an air-
tight compartment, an air-tight galvanometer case was designed, and having been
constructed was made use of for some of the latest bolographs. The advantage
derived from its use, however, proved slight.
a2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Some decrease in the accidental defiections of the ‘‘ battery record” was effected
by the substitution of a ‘‘Cupron” battery of 10 cells for the great storage battery
of 60 cells.

A new design for a bolometer has been prepared, in which the sensitive threads,
balancing coils, and adjusting slide wire are all contained in one compact water-
jacketed case with air-tight chamber. This instrument is under construction, and
will, it is believed, do away wth certain sources of accidental disturbance, and will
be far more easy to use satisfactorily than the present form.

With the improvements above described all or in part installed, there were taken
135 bolographs between December 1, 1897, and July 1,1898. Of these 68 were with
the great rock-salt prism, 41 with the great glass prism, and 26 with a small prism
of fluorite. Fifteen of those taken with the rock-salt and 8 taken with the glass
prism were measured upon the comparator to establish the discovery and positions of
the 700 absorption lines in the infra-red already mentioned. Fifteen taken with the
fluorite prism were measured upon the comparator to determine the position of about
50 absorption lines identifiable on both the rock-salt-prism and the fluorite-prism
bolographs, with the design of thus deducing the dispersion of rock-salt indirectly
from the wave-length determinations of Paschen in the fluorite spectrum.

Apparatus, including a concave grating, has been arranged for the purpose of
directly measuring the dispersion of rock salt, but the actual observations were
not begun at the close of the period covered by this report. It is hoped that this
research will make it possible to give the wave lengths of the absorption lines dis-
covered to the degree of accuracy corresponding with that of the prismatic devia-
tions. The Observatory is peculiarly fitted to obtain results of great accuracy, in
that, first, it is in possession of such an extraordinary equipment of rock-salt prisms
that one great one is provided with a thermometer at its center and used solely to
determine the temperature of the optical one; second, a constant temperature may
be maintained, and hence the temperature of the salt can be certainly known;
third, the great sensitiveness of the bolometric apparatus allows of the employment
of narrow slit widths; fourth, the bolographic method can be employed, which,
being independent of circle readings, and involving instead a clock work of extreme
accuracy, gives differences of deviation with extraordinary precision, reaching, as
we said in last year’s report, to within a second of arc.

Several energy curves, extending from the violet through the visible and infra-red
spectrum as far as 5 yw, were taken with a sheet of bright copper in place of the sil-
vered glass mirror at the siderostat. It was found that there was no appreciable
difference in quality or amount of reflecting power between the copper and silver
surfaces, except in the violet. Here the copper gradually deteriorated as a reflector,
which accounts for its red color.

Observations have been made with the ‘‘hot box,” a device similar to the garden-
er’s hot bed intended to obtain a very high temperature from the sun’s rays without
the use of lenses or mirrors. A temperature of 120° C. was obtained, which is, to
be sure, considerably above boiling water, but not in excess of that obtained by
Herschel with the same device in South Africa many years ago. The results of the
observations are merely tentative.

A considerable number of observations have been made to determine the accuracy
of the bolometer as a heat-measuring device; that is, its capacity for repeating the
same measure of radiations under like conditions. For this purpose successive first
throws of the galvanometer were observed when the radiations from a student lamp
burning good-kerosene oil were alternately allowed to fall on the bolometer and cut
off by a water screen at constant temperature. The variations in the deflection
were very slight, and indicated rather a variation of the burning of the lamp than
any inaccuracy of the bolometer. Thus for ten successive measures the average
probable error.of the separate observations was only 0.035 of 1 per cent, or 1 part in
3,000; but, as has just been intimated, this is a maximum value, since no absolutely
-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

constant source of heat has been found, and all the variations of the source employed
are included in this 0.035 of 1 per cent. In the earlier use of the bolometer such
precision would have been unattainable, owing to the nonstability of the zero point
of the galvanometer, but the ‘‘drift” and tremor have now been so far eliminated
as to make such results quite possible.

ACCESSIONS OF APPARATUS.

There have been added to the equipment of the Observatory during the year the
following considerable pieces of apparatus:

One Richard barograph.

One Crova actinometer.

' One Fuess spectrometer, with 17 centimeter circle reading to 10 seconds. Acces-
-sories consisting of reading and collimating telescopes, micrometer slit, and one
liquid prism.

Company.

One “ hot box” provided with equatorial mounting.

Two cylindric collimating mirrors by Brashear, already referred to.

Ten cells ‘‘Cupron” battery, Type I, from Umbreit & Matthes, of Leipzig, for use

_ ou the bolometer circuit.

SUMMARY.

In conclusion I may say that the investigations of the absorption bands in the
infra-red solar spectrum, reopened by the securing of more highly sensitive bolo-
graphic apparatus during the unavoidable delay in publication of the results
attained Jast year, has been attended this year with a degree of success exceeding
anything which could be hoped for. The result now reached, which will undoubtedly
be ready for the press early in the coming calendar year, includes the discovery and

es REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

determination of position of over 700 such absorption lines, and is one with which
the research, so far as it concerns only the discovery of new absorption lines, may
suitably close.

The results we have already indicate the complete fulfillment of your expectation
that this great region is the chief seat of the telluric absorption, and confirm your
hopes that these researches may soon lead to knowledge of a character of perma-
nent utility to mankind. The gradual collection and improvement of apparatus
attending the prosecution of this investigation has placed the Observatory in a
condition to enter under highly favorable circumstances upon other researches
connected with radiant heat.

APPENDIX VI.
HPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to present herewith the report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898.

The work of the library consists of various activities. Greatest in bulk is the
reception, cataloguing, acknowledgment, and the conducting of necessary corre-

“spondence for that portion of the collection of books which is known as the Smith-
sonian deposit of the Library of Congress.

Next in quantity is the work connected with the books belonging to the National
Museum. Small collections of reference books are being made for the Zoological
Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, and the Exchange Service. A special section
of law reference for the use of the Institution is also being established, and a section
relating to erodromics is maintained. A small library has been purchased for the
use of the employees of the Institution. The Museum library has itself 21 sections.
In addition to the care of these branches of the library work, the library has been
frequently referred to for information, bibliographical and otherwise.

SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Con-
eress extend from 364973 to 390914.

The following table gives an analysis in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and
charts, of the accessions during the year:

This exhibits an increase over 1897 of more than 4,500 entries for this branch alone.
One-fourth of this matter has been temporarily retained in the library of the United
States National Museum for use.

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
employees library, and library of the Astrophysical Observatory, 701 volumes and
pamphlets and 2,080 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,781, and a grand total of
40,715 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts of accessions for the year.

The Library of Congress was removed from the old quarters in the Capitol to the
new Library building, in the months of August and September and was reopened for
use in November, 1897. The east stack, the smaller of the three stacks in the Library,
was set apart for the Smithsonian deposit, and a commodious room directly adjoin-
ing this stack on the main floor was assigned as an office and work room. Into this
a large part of the accumulation of the last ten years was placed, and these have
been to a certain extent arranged and catalogued. It is the desire and intent of the

75
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Librarian of Congress that all the Smithsonian books shall be placed together in this
stack and steps are being taken toward that end. The bill passed by Congress pro-
viding for the arrangement and organization of the Library in its new building,
however, made no provision, either for this work or for the care of the Smithsonian
stack, and it has resulted that all work in connection with this collection of books
must be done in the spare time of persons who already had other duties. While,
therefore, a great deal has been accomplished in a comparatively short space of
time, the Sinithsonian deposit is as yet by no means in a satisfactory condition.

SECRETARY’S LIBRARY.

The Secretary’s library, a special collection of reference books for the use of the
Secretary, which may be, under certain restrictions, consulted by other persons, now
numbers about 600 volumes. These books are kept in the Secretary’s office and in
rooms in close proximity to it. A new bookcase was assigned, thus rendering pos-
sible a better disposition of the books than heretofore. The increase of this collec-
tion was 42 volumes and 182 parts of periodicals.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

With the establishment of the Observatory in 1891 it was found necessary to pro-
vide a small collection of books for its use. In view of the crowded condition of the
Observatory and of the fact that its building was not fireproof, the Secretary desired
that as few books as possible be kept in the Observatory. A room was accordingly
assigned for this purpose on the third floor of the Smithsonian building, only a few
books and pamphlets being kept in the Observatory itself. The increase of this
library during the past year has been 30 volumes and 357 parts of periodicals.

LIBRARY OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

A small collection of books relating principally to parks and zoological gardens
and other matiters intimately associated with the work of the Park, are kept in a
room in the Holt House. In accordance with the Secretary’s instructions, and with
the advice of the Superintendent of the Park, I shall endeavor in the course of next
year to enlarge this collection, more especially in books relating to parks, park
architecture, etc. It is only with great difficulty that sets of guides to zoological
gardens are obtained, as these publications are fleeting in their nature and not usu-
ally preserved. ‘The Secretary, in connection with the repairs in the Holt House,
the office of the Zoological Park, has sanctioned improved facilities for the mainte-
nance of this collection of books.

EMPLOYEES’ LIBRARY.

There has been purchased a collection of about 400 books of literature, good fiction,
history, biography, and popular science, which together with the bound volumes of
popular periodicals and the current numbers form a circulating library for the
employees of the institution. The library is open to all employees of the institution
under the following regulations :

1. All persons desiring to withdraw books must first file with the librarian a cer-
tificate of identity from the chief clerk of the Bureau or office in which they are
employed.

2. The library will be open for the withdrawal and return of books from 12 m. to
1p. m., and from 4 to 4.30 p. m.

3. Books may be taken for the period of one week, with the privilege of one
renewal. z

4, The popular magazines on the table may be taken out at 4 o’clock p. m., to be
returned at Y a. m. the following morning.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77

_ 5, Any book or periodical injured, defaced, or lost, while in the possession of the
borrower, must be replaced by a new copy.

6. Before a book is borrowed it must first be submitted to the librarian for

‘registry.

7. No person will be permitted to take more than one book and magazine at a
time.
8. The librarian is authorized to suspend or refuse the issue of books to persons

_ violating any of the above rules.

The members of the staff and the employees of the institution have already begun

_ to use this library, and I feel sure that it will be a source of instruction and pleasure
_ to many.

EXCHANGE SERVICE.

For the Exchanges the attempt has been made to secure as good a collection of
directories and books containing addresses as possible. The greater part of such
publications are received in exchange, but some few have been purchased.

LAW REFERENCE LIBRARY.

The work of the Institution and its bureaus requires the reference to so many
public documents and law books, that the necessity has been found for the establish-
ment of a small collection of works on this subject. These are provided by the Insti-
tution and are for the present deposited in the office of the chief clerk of the National
Museum.

LIBRARY OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Museum library has received during the year 441 books, 797 pamphlets, and 4,926
parts of periodicals. Four hundred and seven volumes, 1,148 pamphlets, and 11,817
parts of periodicals belonging to the Smithsonian deposit have been temporarily
retained for the National Museum. The late Dr.G. Brown Goode had formed a col
lection of scientific works relating more especially to museum work and natural
history, which, during his lifetime, had always been at the disposal of his associates
in the Museum. The work of the Museum would have been seriously hampered had
this collection gone elsewhere. By an arrangement with his executor, an offer of
the collection was made to the Institution, and its value having been appraised by
Dr. Theodore Gill and myself, the Secretary applied to Congress for a special appro-
priation for the purchase of this collection. This has been duly authorized by Con-
gress, and in the coming year this valuable library, consisting of 2,900 volumes, 18,000
pamphlets, and 1,800 autographs and engravings, will become the property of the
National Museum.

Over 3,000 volumes were placed in the sectional libraries during the past year,
3,500 books were borrowed and returned, and 17,127 books were consulted in the
library itself. This indicates a greater use of the library than at any time heretofore.
A more detailed account of the operations of the Museum library, together with a
list of accessions by gift, will be found in the report of the National Museum.

PURCHASE OF BOOKS.

In the legislative, executive, and judicial act approved by the President on March
15, 1898, the following proviso was contained:

That hereafter law books, books of reference, and periodicals for use of any
executive department, or other Government establishment not under an executive
department, at the seat of Government, shall not be purchased or paid for from any
appropriation made for contingent expenses or for any specific or general purpose
unless such purpose is authorized and payment therefor specifically provided in the
law granting the appropriation.

As this portion of the act became effective immediately upon its passage no books
could be purchased during the remainder of the fiscal year. It has therefore been
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

found necessary in the estimates under the Smithsonian Institution for the coming
year to provide in some way for the purchase of books absolutely indispensable for
the bureaus of the Institution. An appropriation of $2,000 fer the purchase of
books for the National Museum was authorized by Congress, and for other bureaus
special clauses permitting ‘‘the purchase of necessary books and periodicals” were
introduced in the sundry civil act passed July 1, 1898.

The correspondence carried on was largely in accordance with the general instruc-
tion for the increase of the library or for completing imperfect series. One thousand
and eighteen letters were written, with the result that 427 new exchanges have been
added to the list and 329 defective series either completed or filled out as far as the
publishers were able to make good missing parts. The lists. collected under the
Secretary’s direction have been exhausted, but so many new periodicals and socie-
ties have sprung up that the year has been fully occupied in undertaking to secure
these new publications. I beg to recommend that this work be continued in the
future on two lines—first, by a methodical attempt to secure the publications of
the new learned societies which have been established all over the world, and sec-
ondly, to secure, where possible, the newer scientific and technical periodicals. The
care of correspondence and the revision of lists in connection with this work has
grown in magnitude, and more could be done if more aid could be had. Only
trained assistants with a knowledge of foreign languages could do this work, as the
correspondence received is in all modern languages, even including modern Greek.

The Secretary of State nominated the Secretary of the Institution and myself dele-
gates to the second conference on an international catalogue of scientific literature,
to be held in London during the coming autumn.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX VII.
REPORT OF THE EDITOR FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1898.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the publications of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30, 1898:

The publications of the Institution itself are in three series, the Contributions
to Knowledge in quarto form, and the Miscellaneous Collections and Smithsonian
Report in octavo. Under the direction of the Institution are also published the
Proceedings and Bulletins of the National Museum, the Annual Report of the Bureau
of Ethnology, and the Annual Report of the American Historical Association.

The libraries and institutions to which the ‘“‘Contributions” and ‘ Collections”
could be sent has always been very limited in number, though scattered widely
throughout the world, and in extending the number of libraries it has not been pos-
sible to furnish complete sets, but merely future volumes. Fifteen hundred copies
of these series are now printed, but this number, though all that the limited income
of the Institution can furnish, has not been found sufficient to meet the demand.

The general distribution is made, first, to those learned societies of the first elass
which give to the Institution in return complete sets of their own publications;
secondly, to colleges of the first class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and
students and publications relative to their organization and history; thirdly, to
public libraries in this country having 25,000 volumes; fourthly, they are pre-
sented in some cases to still smaller libraries, especially if no other copies of the
Smithsonian publications are given in the same place, and a large district would be
otherwise unsupplied; lastly, to institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion
of particular branches of knowledge such of its publications are given as relate to
their special objects. These rules apply chiefly to distribution in the United States.
The number sent to foreign countries, under somewhat different conditions, is about
the same as that distributed in this country.

The edition of the annual report at the disposal of the Institution is 7,000 copies,
which is sufficiently large to permit of a comparatively wide distribution, though
the number printed is less than in former years.

Requests from individuals: are complied with when possible, but, as a rule, it is
found necessary to restrict the distribution of all publications to libraries and insti-
tutions of learning.

In the original ‘‘programme of organization” approved by the Regents in 1847
there was specified among the details of the plan for diffusing knowledge ‘‘ the publi-
cation of a series of reports giving an account of new discoveries in science, and of
the changes made from year to year in all branches of knowledge not strictly pro-
fessional.” Andit was added that ‘‘The reports are to be prepared by collaborators
eminent in the different branches of knowledge.”

In the report for 1854 appeared for the first time an “appendix,” containing an
account of American explorations for the years 1853 and 1854, by Prof. S. F. Baird;
a full report of lectures delivered before the Institution by Marsh, Brainard, Loomis,
Channing, Reed, and Russell; extracts from the scientific correspondence of the
Institution, and miscellaneous papers relating to American archeology, geology, ete.

The general appendix to the annual report has been regularly continued to the
present time, and has served to bring the Smithsonian report into great popular
demand. It has long been the custom to enrich the report with memoirs illustrating

79
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the more remarkable and important developments in physical and biological dis-
covery, as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Institution;
and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history, been carried out largely
by the publication of such papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by
scientific progress.

In 1880 Secretary Baird, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for thirty years previous had been issued by well-known pri-
vate publishing firms, had prepared by competent collaborators a series of abstracts,
showing concisely the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and anthro-
pology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satisfactorily, down
to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of presenting a
miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original) embracing a considerable
range of scientific investigation and discussion.

So much trouble has been experienced in securing papers of the character desired
for the general appendix of the report that the Secretary has stated his ideas defi-
nitely in the following printed rules for the guidance of those who cooperate in
selecting the articles:

RULES FOR THE SELECTION OF PAPERS FOR THE GENERAL APPENDIX TO THE ANNUAL
REPORT.

So much difficulty has been found in obtaining the class of papers desired by the
Secretary for the appendix to his annual report that he takes this method of express-
ing his wishes to those gentlemen who are good enough to favor him with their
cooperation in making a selection.

He asks that it may be remembered:

1. That these papers have a purpose distinct from any others published by the
Institution. They are only occasionally original contributions to science. They are
not for the professional reader only, or even chiefly, but they are addressed to that
large body of the public which has a general interest in scientific matters without
special knowledge.

2. That while it is always a recommendation that they should have been written
by recognized authorities, yet this is of minor importance if the articles are sound
expositions of the subject. The essential thing is that they should be not only
sound and instructive, but timely and interesting to the nonprofessional reader, and
in that good sense popular. If they are accompanied by illustrations all the better.

3. As they are wanted to serve as a kind of survey of the whole field of the
sciences, both physical and biological, for the past year, it is as a rule impracticable
to print more than one on any particular subject. While the Secretary will be ver
glad, then, to have any number suggested in English, French or German which will
meet these requirements, he will not expect as a rule to make use of more than one.

4. The papers may be, in exceptional cases, as brief as 1,000 words. ‘They should
rarely exceed 10,000 or 12 ,000.

5. At the risk of needless iteration it is repeated that what is wanted is not for
the specialist, but interesting and popular expositions of what the specialist knows
to be sound and opportune.

II. MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS.

Of the Miscellaneous Collections five new works have been published since the
editor’s last report, and the Smithsonian Meteorological, Geographical, and Physical
Tables have been reprinted.

At the close of the year much progress had been made in printing a Supplement to
Bolton’s Bibliography of Chemistry, which will include about 4,000 additional titles
of chemical publications.

Volumes XXXVIi, XX XVIII and XL of the Collections were also completed and the
covers, titles, and other preliminary pages distributed. Parts of Volume XXXIX
have been issued and the whole volume will soon be completed.

The new works are as follows: Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals;
Catalogue of Pacific Coast Earthquakes; Review and Bibliography of Metallic
Carbides; Bibliography of Metals of the Platinum Group; and a report on the
effects of impure air on the vital resistance of animals to disease.

No. 1076. A Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 1665-1895. By
Henry Carrington Bolton. Second edition. City of Washington. Published by
the Smithsonian Institution, 1897. 8. VII+ 1247 pp. (From Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, Vol. XL.)

In the preface the author says:

“As was stated in the first edition of this catalogue, issued in 1885, it is intended
to contain the principal independent periodicals of every branch of pure and applied
science published in all countries from the rise of this literature to the present time.
The compiler has endeavored to give full titles, names of editors, sequence of series,
and other bibliographical details, and to arrange the whole on a simple plan con-
venient for reference. The range of topics is shownin the Index of Subjects; while
medicine has been excluded, anatomy, physiology, and veterinary science, being
related to zoology, have been admitted. With a few exceptions serials constituting
transactions of learned societies have been omitted; those admitted either form part
of a series begun or ending in an independent periodical, or are presumably not
exclusively devoted to the proceedings of the societies by which they are edited.

“Some of the journals included in this catalogue are of doubtful scientific value,
and the right of some to be classed as periodicals is questionable. In these and other
debatable cases many titles have been admitted on the ground that ‘in a biblio-
graphy it is much better that a book should be found which is not sought, than
that one should be sought for and not found.’ (Zuchold.)

“The plan of the catalogue is as follows: The titles are arranged alphabetically
by the first word, the articles and the adjective ‘new’ (with its equivalents in dif-
ferent languages) alone excepted. The various titles borne by a periodical at differ-
ent times are arranged in chronological order under the first or earliest titles of the
series. Cross-references have been freely introduced, and are of four kinds: (1) from
the later to the first title of a periodical which has suffered changes in title; (2)
from short titles in common use to the correct designations; (3) from the names of
the principal editors to the journals conducted by them; (4) in the case of astro-
nomical publications, from the places in which the observatories are situated to the
titles of the periodicals issued therefrom.

“Part I of the alphabetical catalogue is a reprint from the plates of the first edi-
tion after having made the changes necessary to bring the titles down to date.
Part II contains additions to the titles of Part I that could not be inserted in the
plates, together with about 3,600 new titles. The letter ‘s’ following a title in »
Part I refers to additional information in Part II. Numbers inclosed in brackets in
Part II denote that earlier data will be found in Part I.

“The chronological tables are designed to give the date of the publication of each
volume of the periodicals entered, asexplained on pages1018 and 1019. By these tables
the date of a given volume in a given series of a given work may be found, or the
number of a volume may be ascertained when the date only is known. Librarians
will find the tables of service in determining bibliographical data of series not in
their collections. The alphabetical list of periodicals should always be consulted
in connection with the chronological tables. An index to the periodicals contained
in the tables will be found at their close.

“The library check list, showing in what American libraries the periodicals may
be found, is an attempt to carry out on a continental scale that which has been done
by librarians in several localities. The data were gathered by means of circulars
and forms distributed by the Smithsonian Institution to about 200 libraries. The
returns from 133 libraries were codified by the institution. It is believed that the

new check list to the second edition is far more complete and accurate than the former,
and justifies the delay of nearly twelve months in the publication of the volume.
The number of periodicals noted is about 3,160 out of the 8,600 in the catalogue.

““The material for this work has been gathered from all available bibliographies
and by personal examination of the shelves and of the printed and manuscript cata-
logues of many libraries in the United States, England, France, Belgium, Germany,
and Italy. As a last resort circulars were sent out through the Smithsonian Insti-
tution to publishers in several countries asking for specimen numbers of their jour-
nals; the titles were then transcribed from the numbers received.”

This paper is an exhaustive list of earthquakes recorded on the Pacific coast from
1769 to 1897 and includes a complete acceunt of the earthquake observations at
Mount Hamilton during the years 1887 to 1897, together with an abstract of infor-
mation which has been collected regarding Pacific coast earthquakes during that
period.

No. 1090. Review and Bibliography of the Metallic Carbides. By J. A. Mathews,
M.S., M.A., F.C. 8. City of Washington. Published by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. 1898. 32 pp. (Forms part of Vol. XXXVIII, Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections. )

In general plan the work gives a condensed account of the methods of prepara-
tion, and the physical and chemical properties of the carbides, arranged in alpha-
betical order, following each descriptive portion with references to the literature
bearing thereon. The author says:

““Within the last five years the renewed attention of chemists has been turned
toward this class of compounds, and new carbides have been produced in rapid suc-
cession. Experiments upon the reduction of metallic oxides by means of carbon in
an electric furnace have resulted in the production of many of the newly discovered
carbides. In studying the literature of these compounds the work of one man is
especially noticeable. More than to all other chemists together is praise due M.
Henri Moissan for the untiring energy with which he has investigated the carbo-
metallic compounds. So often has he astonished chemists with the results of his
electro-chemical experiments that new discoveries by him are likely to be considered
as a matter of course. M. Moissan’s work upon artificial diamonds is one of the
greatest achievements of science in imitating nature’s methods.

“Tn conducting his experiments Moissan makes use of an electric furnace of very
simple construction. It consists of a limestone block, in the upper surface of which
is chiseled a rectangular cavity, which is lined with a coating of magnesia and of
carbon. Through opposite sides of the block are inserted stout carbon electrodes,
and through one of the other sides is an opening through which a carbon tube is
inserted. In this tube the materials to be heated are placed and thus inserted into
the arc. It is estimated that a temperature of 4,000° is obtained in this furnace.
Before using the furnace it is covered with another piece of limestone, on the lower
side of which are layers of magnesia and carbon, which fit into or cover the cavity
of the lower block. So poorly do these materials conduct heat that the hand may
be kept on the outside of the furnace for several minutes after the current is started.”

No. 1125. An investigation on the Influence upon the Vital Resistance of Animals
to the Micro-organisms of Disease brought about by Prolonged Sojourn in Impure
Atmosphere. By D. H. Bergey, M. D. City of Washington. Published by the
Smithsonian Institution, 1898. 8°. 10 pp. (Forms part of Smithsonian Miscella-
neous Collections, Vol. XX XIX.)

This is a report of an investigation outlined by and conducted under the super-
vision of Drs. John S. Billings and S. Weir Mitchell, in which an attempt has been
made to determine whether impure atmosphere produces detrimental influence upon
the animal organism, as shown in greater susceptibility to certain diseases, The
yi

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

impurities tested were carbonic-acid gas and respiratory impurities, and the micro-
organisms were staphylococcus, diphtheria, and bacillus tuberculosis. Dr. Bergey
summarizes the results of his investigation as follows:

“Tn the staphylococcus and diphtheria inoculations the cultures used appear to
have been insufficiently attenuated to show any difference in the effect produced
upon the animals under experiment and the control animals. It is, however, very
doubtful whether cultures of these organisms could be attenuated to such a degree
as to still kill a weakened animal and not kill a control, healthy animal.

“The anthrax vaccines used do not kill a healthy guinea pig, but it was expected
that the animals might present sufficient lowering of the vitality to become attected
by the vaccines. This, however, was not the case. The animals having failed todie
from the effects of the anthrax vaccines, they were then inoculated with an atten-
uated culture of tuberculosis. All the animals under experiment died much earlier
than the control animals. These results indicate a lowered vitality. Whether
this lowered vitality was brought about by the atmospheric conditions under which
they had lived, or whether it was brought about solely through changes in their
diet while under experiment, or whether both these causes were active in producing
the result, if is impossible to say. The animals lost flesh and decreased in weight
while under experiment. It is not improbable that the loss in weight and the
decrease in vitality are both traceable to the same causes.”

APPENDIX VIII.

REPORT ON THE TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION, NASHVILLE,
TENN., 1897.

S1r: I have the honor to submit the following report on the exhibit of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the National Museum, and other bureaus under the direction of
the Institution, at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition.

In an act of Congress approved December 22, 1896, provision was made for partici-
pation in the exposition by the Executive Departments of the Government, the
Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, and the United States Fish Com-
mission. ! :

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution was intended to illustrate as fully as
possible the character and scope of the work accomplished by the Institution and
the several bureaus under its direction. For obvious reasons the activities of the
National Museum could be represented in a more complete manner than was possible
in the case of the Institution proper, or of any of the other bureaus under its
direction. Almost every department of the National Museum furnished an exhibit,
although some of the latter were much fuller than others.

The space assigned to the Institution was in the northeast corner of the Govern-
ment building and comprised about 5,000 square feet. There was a frontage of 101
feet on the main aisle running east and west, with a width of 48 feet. At the west
end of the space there was a series of alcoves, but otherwise the cases were placed
in rows. Two short aisles led from the main aisle, at right angles with it, their
inner ends joining an aisle which ran parallel to the main thoroughfare.

Against the east wall were installed the exhibits of the Institution proper, the
Bureau of International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astro-
Physical Observatory.

In the center of the north hall was the exhibit of the Bureau of Ethnology. The
remainder of the space was devoted to the collections of the National Museum.

In the windows were transparencies showing the seal of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion; the Smithsonian and National Museum buildings, with interior views of each;
four views of the National Zoological Park; four geological subjects—an Australian
coral reef, the Yosemite Valley, the Devil’s Tower in Wyoming, and the Mammoth
Hot Springs; four zoological subjects—a deep-sea fish, a cuttlefish, a hydroid, and
sea-lilies: and eight ethnological subjects.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

A complete set of tke publications of the Institution, including those of the
Bureau of Ethnology and the National Museum, formed one of the principal features
of the exhibit. Adjoining this was an exhibit of title-pages and some of the more
important illustrations in these publications.

Portraits of James Smithson, the founder of the Institution; of Secretaries Joseph
Henry, Spencer Fullerton Baird, and Samuel Pierpont Langley, and of the late
George Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary, were hung upon the wall.

In a separate case was displayed a photographic portrait of Thomas G. Hodgkins,

1 The act referred to is given in full in the Report of the Smithsonian Institution
for 1897, Pages XLY-XLVII. e

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 91

together with examples of the medals awarded in 1895 to writers of essays compet-
ing for the Hodgkins fund prizes, and copies of the prize memoirs which had been
published.

On the wall adjacent was a cast of the memorial tablet which had recently been
placed, by order of the Board of Regents, on the tomb of Smithson, in Genoa, Italy.

Two enlarged photographs of Secretary Langley’s aerodrome (flying machine),
which twice flew over one-half mile on May 6, 1896, near Quantico, Va., were also
exhibited. The photographs were of different views of the machine, and two-fifths
its actual size. :

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The exhibit of this Bureau consisted of one-half of a Kiowa camping circle in
miniature, the material for which was collected by Mr. James Mooney, of the
Bureau.

The entire exhibit was the work of Kiowa Indians, the insignia emblazoned on the
tepees and shields being executed, almost without exception, by those having an
inherited right to bear them. This aboriginal tribe is now the only representative
of a distinct stock or linguistic family of priscan people.

Owing to the restricted space available, the skin tents were reduced from 16 or 18
feet in height to about 2+ feet, while their number was reduced from about 150 (half
of the 300 or more tents forming the entire circle) to 25, exclusive of the ceremonial
lodges within the circle.

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Mr. James Mooney, under the direction
of Mr. W J McGee.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The extent and topography of the National Zoological Park were well shown in
the model exhibited, on which the buildings, roadways, and bridges, and the woods,
ereek, and other natural features were faithfully represented.

In the windows along the Smithsonian section were several transparencies, includ-
ing one of the carnivora house, one of the bridge, and one of a buffalo. There
were also exhibited three water-color paintings and one drawing, the work of Mr.
Glenn Brown, illustrating other attractive features of the park.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

A’ principal exhibit of this bureau was a complete set of the publications of the
United States Government for one year, being one of the fifty sets, such as are dis-
tributed annually by the bureau to libraries throughout the world.

On the wall was a large map showing the geographical distribution of the corre-
spondents of the Institution, 24,000 in number, as entered on the registers of the
Bureau. =

Near the map was a diagram illustrating the number of publications, including
books and pamphlets interchanged between each State and Territory in the United
States and fureign countries during the ten years preceding January 1, 1896.

The exhibit was prepared by Mr. W. I. Adams.

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The exhibit of the observatory consisted of photographs of the exterior and inte-
rior of the building located on the Smithsonian grounds, and of the principal
instruments, such as the siderostat, galvanometer, spectrometer, and water-jacketed
bolometer and rheostat. Enlarged photographs of portions of the spectrum of the
sun were also exhibited. With these objects was a bolometer, or electrical thermom-
eter, of extreme delicacy, the invention of Mr. S. P. Langley.
92 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

As already stated, the exhibit of the National Museum was of much greater
extent than that of any of the other Smithsonian bureaus.

Two objects were kept in mind in its organization:

(1) To show as far as possible the extensive scope of the Museum.

(2) To indicate the manner in which the collections are arranged, labeled, and
displayed in the Museum building in Washington.

In carrying out the first idea it was necessary to exhibit a small number of objects
from many different kinds of collections, which had a certain disadvantage in a
space so comparatively small, as the bringing into close proximity of objects not
nearly related could not be avoided. It wasimpracticable, on account of the limited
space, to show all the different classes of objects in the Museum. Z ;

The greater portion of the labels, cases, stands, bases, backgrounds, and other
fittings and furniture were from the regular stock of the Museum, although a few
methods of installation entirely novel were introduced for the first time in connec-
tion with the exhibit.

Department of mammals.—This department exhibited in two cases a representation
of the interesting order of mammals known as the lemurs—monkey-like animals—
especially characteristic of the island of Madagascar, but having representatives
on the continents of Africa and Asia. The group comprises about 35 species, of which
18 were shown, among them the especially remarkable aye-aye, so long a puzzle to
zoologists on account of peculiarities of its structure, and one of the Tarsiers ( Tarsius
spectrum) which are notable for the great size of their eyes.

On the walls were casts of heads of two genera of tke so-called Ziphioid whales,
Mesoplodon and Ziphius; of the Pygmy Sperm Whale, Kogia, and of the New Zealand
Whale, Neobalena, the smallest and rarest of the true whalebone whales.

The exhibit was prepared and installed, under the direction of the curator of
mammals, by Mr. William Palmer. ;

Department of birds.—The birds were exhibited in four cases on the main aisle, one
of which contained a representation of the parrots, and the other a faunal collection
from British Guiana, South America.

Parrots.—This collection comprised 124 specimens, representing about 100 species,
or about one-fifth of those that are known. All the subfamilies were represented
and the more important genera, so that the collection was a fair exhibit of the
group. ;

Birds of Guiana.—This exhibit represented a tropical bird fauna notable for
bright colors and peculiar forms. It was, of course, very incomplete, as it was
impracticable to show all of the eight hundred or nine hundred species which are
found in Guiana.

The exhibit was prepared by Mr. Robert Ridgway, assisted by Mr. C. W. Richmond.

Department of reptiles and batrachians.—The exhibit of this department consisted
of a group of the poisonous snakes of the United States, cast in plaster, and a similar
group of the fresh-water and land tortoises of North America. <A cast of the head
of a logger-head turtle was also included. The specimens were brought together
from widely separated localities.

The following species were represented :

Poisonous Snakes of the United States.—Diamond rattlesnake, Crotalus adamanteus,
Southeastern States.

Banded rattlesnake, Crotalus horridus, Kastern States, south to Florida and the
the Mexican Gulf, v est to Kansas.

Prairie rattlesnake, Crotalus confluentus, Great Plains.

Western diamond rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox, Southern United States, from Texas
to the Gulf of California.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

Southern ground rattlesnake, Sistrurus miliarius, Southeastern States.

Copperhead, Agkistrodon contortrix, Eastern and Southern States.

The group of tortoises included the following species:

Gopher, Gopherus polyphemus, Florida.

Agassiz’s gopher, Gopherus agassizii, Arizona and Southern California.

Berlandier’s gopher, Gopherus berlandieri, western Texas.

Box tortoise, Terrapene carolina, Eastern States.

Western Box tortoise, Terrapene ornata, Central States.

Blanding’s tortoise, Emydoidea blandingii, Massachusetts to northern Illinois.

Wood tortoise, Clenmys marmorata, California.

Elegant terrapin, Trachemys elegans, Central and Southern States.

Yellow-bellied terrapin, Trachemys scripta, Southeastern States.

Florida terrapin, Pseudemys floridana, Florida.

Neat terrapin, Pseudemys concinna, North Carolina to Texas.

Red-bellied terrapin, Pseudemys rubriventris, Middle Atlantic States.

Painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, Eastern States.

Diamond-back terrapin, Malaclemys centrata, Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

Baur’s terrapin, Graptemys pulchra, Southeastern States.

Snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, North America, east of the Rocky Moun-
tains.

Mud turtle, Kinosternon pensilvanicum, east of the Rocky Mountains.

Soft-shelied turtle, Platypeltis ferox, Florida.

Department of fishes.—This department showed a selected series of fishes of the
deep sea, which formed the basis of the comprehensive work on ‘Oceanic Ichthy-
ology,” by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode and Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, published a few
months previous to the Exposition as a special bulletin of the Museum.

The exhibit was supplemented by a small number of casts of North Ameri-
can fishes painted in life colors and forming part of an extensive series in the
Museum.

The following fishes were represented by casts:

Calico bass, Pomoxys sparoides.

Sunfish, Lepomis pallidus.

Dolphin, Coryphena hippurus.

Mangrove snapper, Lutjanus stearnsi.

Sea robin, Prionotus evolans.

Red-mouth grunt, Hamulon arcuatum.

Cagon de lo Alto, Rhomboplites aurorubens.

Grouper, Mpinephelus drummond-hayi.

Scup, Stenotomus chrysops.

Hogfish, Lachnolemus maximus.

Parrot fish, Pseudoscarus guacamaia.

Rosy rockfish, Helicolenus maderensis.

Brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis.

Cavalla, Caranx hippos.

Sucking fish, Wcheneis naucrates.

Kelpout, Zoarces anguillaris.

Four-spotted flounder, Paralichthys oblongus.

Cowfish, Ostracion quadricorne.

The exhibit was arranged by Mr. Barton A. Bean.

Department of moliusks.—This exhibit was in two table cases and represented, as
far as space permitted, the families of mollusks and brachiopods. It also contained
illustrations of the utilization of materials derived from mollusks. Each family
was represented by one or more species, excepting those in which there is no solid
shell and which therefore could not be exhibited in a dry condition.
94 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The classification used was that adopted in the national collection.

Utilization of mollusks.—This series included pearls, cameo shells of various sorts,
specimens illustrating the formation of pearl in the shell, both fresh-water and
marine pearl mussels deprived of their outer coating so as to show the pearly
substratum, and manufactured articles, such as buttons and other objects, made
from pearl-bearing shells, of which specimens both in the natural condition and
decorticated—so as to show the shelly layer—and in the manufactured state, were
exhibited.

Byssus of the ‘‘wing-shell.”—A somewhat rare object was a glove resembling silk
woven by the nuns of Naples from the silky byssus of the pinna, or ‘‘ wing-shell,”
of the Mediterranean. :

In one of the windows was a transparency of a cuttle fish, Octopus verrucosus, and
suspended from the ceiling were life-size models of an octopus and of the giant squid,
Architeuthis harveyi.

The selections for the exhibit were made by Mr. C. T. Simpson under the direction
of Mr. W. H. Dall.

Department of insects.—This display occupied one side of two cases, and was
included in sixteen trays. _It was, of course, very far from complete, either as an
exhibit of insects or as an illustration of the wealth of material in the entomological
collections of the Museum. ‘Two different series were, however, shown—a systematic
series, and a series illustrating protective and aggressive resemblance and mimicry,
(the imitation, by insects, in form and color, or both, of objects met with in their
surroundings, and the imitation of the form and color of other insects).

Systematic series.—This series was included in twelve trays, and represented the
more conspicuous insects of Tennessee and neighboring States, arranged according
to their scientific classification. The Lepidoptera was more fully represented than
any other order, since the species are generally large and showy, and well adapted
for exhibition purposes. Six trays were devoted to this order. The modern orders
corresponding to the older order Neuroptera were exhibited in one tray, and the
remaining five trays were taken up with the orders Hymenoptera, Coleoptera,
Hemiptera, Diptera, and Orthoptera. All of the smaller species were omitted, as
they could be represented adequately only by means of enlarged drawings or models
for the preparation of which funds could not be provided.

Protective and aggressive resemblance and mimicry.—This series occupied four trays
and was divided into seven groups. It consisted of specimens illustrating the
following phases of resemblance and mimicry:

(1) General protective resemblance (insects having a general resemblance in color
to their surroundings).

(2) Special protective resemblance (insects resembling objects in their surround-
ings, both in form and color).

(3) General aggressive resemblance (carnivorous insects having a general resem-
blance to their surroundings in color, thereby enabling them to more easily approach
their prey).

(4) Special aggressive resemblance (carnivorous insects resembling in form and
color some special object in their surroundings).

(5) Protective mimicry (insects which for their own protection mimic other insects
having some special means of defense, such as a sting or noxious odor, and which
for that reason are avoided by birds, lizards, etc.).

(6) Aggressive mimicry (insects which resembie ether insects in order to approach
or cohabit with them, either preying directly upon them or as parasites upon their
larve).

(7) Warning colors (insects which are already protected by a sting or in some
other way, but which have, in addition, some bright or conspicuous color, in order
to warn insectivorous animals from attacking them).

The collections were arranged by the late Mr. Martin L. Linell, under the direc-
tion of Dr. L. O. Howard.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 95

Department of marine invertebrates.—This department has to do chiefly with the
many groups of invertebrate animals that inhabit seas and rivers, with the excep-
tion of mollusks, which on account of their great variety are placed in a separate
department. The groups selected for exhibition were the echinoderms (or sea
urchins and their allies), the corals, and the sponges. A representative series of
each class was shown.

The sponges or Porifera were principally from the East Indian region, and exhib-
ited in a wide range those species which, although graceful in form, are not used for
commercial purposes.

The corals were also chiefly from the Indo-Pacific. The diversity of form was the
prominent feature.

The echinoderms were arranged more systematically than was found practicable
with the other invertebrates of this department.

Among the transparencies in the windows were those of a sea-lily, Pentacrinus
decorus, hydroid, Acanthocladium huxleyi, and an enlargement of a specimen of Globi-
gerina bulloides (a species of foraminifer).

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Mr. James E. Benedict.

Department of comparative anatomy.—From this department two series were
selected, one showing the modification of the limbs of animals for different modes
of life, and another representing the structure of the human brain.

Modification of limbs.—A considerable series of specimens was exhibited, showing
the general plan of the limbs in vertebrates and the special modifications by which
they are adapted for walking, climbing, swimming, and flying.

The structure and development of the human brain.—'The structure, proportions, and
development of the human brain were illustrated by series of models showing vari-
ous stages in the growth of the brain in the embryo, and, on a large scale, details
of its structure in the adult. A number of diagrammatic models showed the com-
parative bulk of the brain of the male and female, the least amount of brain com-
patible with life, the proportionate amounts of gray and white matter, etc. These
models were supplemented by a small series of skulls, illustrating the diversity of
form found in various races of man.

Crocodiles.—Above the cases were placed a skeleton of the gavial or narrow-
beaked crocodile of the Ganges, erroneously supposed to be a ‘‘man-eater,” and a
very large skull of the true man-eating crocodile, Crocodilus porosus.

The exhibit was prepared and arranged by Mr. F.. A. Lucas.

Department of paleontology.—This exhibit occupied one side of three cases, and was
intended to show the character of the collections in the department and the manner
in which they are arranged, mounted, and labeled. Only the best-preserved speci-
mens, from which the adhering rock had been removed by careful working with
tools and chemicals, were exhibited. The trilobites and crinoids were mounted on
encaustic tiles, in preference to wood, paper, or slate tablets.

The groups of the fossils represented were—

(1) A collection of fossil fishes from the very ancient Bothriolepis to modern bony
fishes, like the shad.

(2) A synoptic collection of trilobites—a group of crab-like animals—of singh
all forms became extinct subsequent to the ceal period. This collection was prepared
to show the structure, geological development, and grouping cf the various forms
into families and orders.

(3) A synoptic collection of fossil crinoids or ‘‘sea-lilies.”

The specimens were selected and grouped by Mr. Charles Schuchert.

Department of geology.—In two cases there was exhibited a collection illustrating
the occurrence and association of gold and silver in nature, thus described by Prof.
George P. Merrill.

“The exhibition begins with specimens showing both the native metals and their
compounds in the condition of greatest natural purity. This is followed by a series

of the same compounds with their characteristic associations, but in which the
metal-bearing portions are still plainly evident, and this in turn by a third series
96 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

showing selected types of ores as mined, but in which, as a rule, the metal or its
compounds are scarcely discernible.

‘<Tn the series as exhibited attention is called, first, to the native gold—that is, the
gold found in the metallic state in nature, as displayed in the form of nuggets, leaf
gold, wire gold, and gold dust from various localities; second, to the compounds of
gold with silver, tellurium, antimony, and sulphur, as shown in the minerals pet-
zite, sylvanite, krennerite, and nagyagite; third, to the occurrence of the native
metal with its associates, either as dust or nuggets, in sand and gravel, or impreg-
nating quartz, slate, calcite, and other minerals forming the characteristic gangue,
and lastly, to the series of gold ores, representing the metal-bearing rocks as usually
mined and which, while, as above noted, show no trace, on casual ‘inspection, of the
precious metal, nevertheless contain it in sufficient amount to render its extraction
by chemical or ‘mechanical means a profitable industry.

‘The silver-bearing series is arranged in a similar manner. It is to be noted that
while gold is common in deposit of sand and gravel as placer gold, silver very
rarely occurs in this form, and is represented here only by the silver-bearing sand-
stone from Washington County, Utah. Native silver in the form of wire or moss
silver is, however, comparatively common, as shown in the specimens from Mexico
and Saxony. Some of the silver-bearing compounds are of great beauty, as illus-
trated in the ruby silvers proustite and pyrargyrite.”

In addition to the general series, a number of casts of exceptionally large and
interesting nuggets of gold and silver was arrayed in a separate case. Each cast
was accompanied by a descriptive label. ;

In the windows were transparencies, showing an Australian coral reef and views
from the Mammoth Hot Springs, the Yosemite Valley, and the Devil’s Tower, in
Wyoming.

The specimens were selected and prepared by Prof. G. P. Merrill and installed by
Mr. W. H. Newhall.

Department of minerals.—The exhibit of this department consisted of a series of
about five hundred specimens, selected and labeled to illustrate the several proper-
ties or characters of minerals. The general plan of arrangement will be understood
from the synopsis here presented.

(1) Chemical mineralogy: Types of minerals. Variation in composition. Rela-
tion of water to composition. Relation of composition to physical properties.

(2) Physical mineralogy: The crystal. The crystallographic axes. Crystal sys-
tems. Compound crystals. Imperfections of crystals. Crystalline aggregates.
Pleomorphs. Isomorphs. Pseudomorphs, (a) by substitution; (b) by deposition;
(c) by alteration. Cleavage. Fracture. Tenacity. Hardness. Color, (a) essential
color; (b) nonessential color; (c) varieties of color. Luster. Diaphaneity.
Fusibility.

Special attention was paid to the order of arrangement. The several specimens
illustrating the chemical and physical properties of minerals were arranged to be
studied from left to right, beginning with the upper left-hand corner and regarding
each quadrant of the case as a unit.

Chemical mineralogy, which treats of those properties relating to chemical com-
position or atomic structure of a mineral and the chemical relations of the several
kinds of minerals, was illustrated by 184 specimens. Physical mineralogy, which
treats of those properties relating to form or molecular structure of a mineral and
the action of the various physical forces aio the several kinds of minerals, was
illustrated by 315 specimens.

Department of ethnology.—The ethnological exhibit consisted of two parts:

(1) An exhibit of the home life and industries of the Eskimo.

(2) An exhibition of the domestic life and arts of the Pueblo region.

In the first group the most conspicuous object was a house similar in construction
to those occupied by the natives of Norton Sound.

This exhibit was prepared under the direction of Mr. E. W. Nelson, and was built
of logs set on end, the corner posts being the larger. Above these were placed
series of logs growing shorter with each layer, a square smoke hole being left at the
peak of the roof. The furniture of the house consisted of a bed made of driftwood,
of a fireplace on the floor with a curious device for directing the draft and smoke
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 97

out of the smoke hole, and a clay lamp for lighting the pipe and other like domestic
purposes. In the house were the lay figures of a man and of a woman, in full native
costume, the latter tending the fire, the former watching her movements and lighting
his pipe. Around the different parts of the room were such furniture as would be
found inanativehut. As the plan of this structure was given by one who had spent
along time in the country, the details were quite accurate.

Associated with this group and mounted in separate sliding-screen cases were
shown a large number of objects connected with the life of the Eskimo.

Case No. 1, fronting the group, contained masks, carved from driftwood and orna-
mented with feathers, such as are used in the dramas of the Eskimo during the long
winter season, when the sun has left the Arctic region. On the back of this same
case were shown examples of the needlework of the Arctic tribes, including beaded
work from Greenland, exhibiting the Scandinavian influence—a complete suit fora
man, made of different furs cut in strips, which were inserted to produce various
pleasing patterns; a full suit of man’s clothing from Ungava, north of Labrador,
made of reindeer skin, the hair being removed; a deerskin suit for winter wear,
made from the skin of the caribou with the hair on.

Case No. 2 contained an exhibit of the various types of basketry in Alaska and
on the Pacific coast of America southward to the borders of the United States.

Case No. 3 was devoted to the work of the Eskimo and their neighbors, in skins
and other animal products, such as workbags for women, tobacco pouches, tool bags,
belts, made from the skins of seals and other animals, with or without the fur, and
also from the intestines of the seal, sewed with sinew and decorated with feathers
and worsteds.

Case No. 4 illustrated the traveling devices of the Eskimo. Snowshoes of coarse
texture used by the tribes farthest north and in out-of-the-way places, and those
with footing of sinew, finely twisted and woven, similar to those in use by the
Athapascan tribes in the neighborhood, were shown; also models of boats in two
types, the kaiak, or hunting canoe, and the umiak, or woman’s boat. There were
also to be seen in this case the tools used by the Eskimo in digging in the ice and
removing snow and broken ice.

On the opposite side to that in which the Eskimo material was installed was the
Pueblo collection. The chief exhibit in this area was a group showing several
Moki females grinding corn and making bread. (Case No.5.) In association with
this group of breadmakers were examples of the objects used in the industrial and
social life of the Tusayan and other Pueblo people.

Case No.6 was devoted to the display of the various kinds of weaving employed
in the Pueblo region.

Case No.7 contained examples of pottery from Pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona,
and showed a variety of shapes, colors, and decorations in cups, bowls, vases, and
animal forms.

Case No.8. On one side was exhibited (in comparison and contrast with the tex-
tile art of the Pueblo tribes) the bead work and substitutes for textile work among
tribes on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, including work on soft buckskin,
on the surface of hard leather, on flannel and other cloths of European manufacture,
and finally beadwork forming part of the textile art; that is, in which the beads are
not laid on the surface of another substance, but form a part of the fabric, so that
the same figure is shown on both sides, as in a piece of stained glass. -

In front of this case was arranged a collection of Moki gods and dolls and head-
dresses connected with their religious services; also sacred blankets and wrappings,
wands and shields, associated with the intricate and dramatic worship of these
Pueblo tribes.

On the wall above these exhibits were to be seen ornamental shields of wood on
which were set large collections of Eskimo and African weapons, ornamental paddles
of the North Pacific coast Indians, and other decorative objects.

98 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition, an ethnological exhibit installed in thirty-two unit boxes, was dis-
played in the annex to the woman’s building. Each contained a typical example of
woman’s work in America, Africa, Polynesia, and a few from other regions.

These examples of woman's work related to the arts of food gathering, preparing,
and serving; to clothing in its various forms derived from the vegetable and animal
kingdoms, and of the furniture of the habitation. In addition to these there were
exhibited the primitive ideas of women connected with form and color in decoration.

In front of these cases, were three cases in which were three American Indian
women in costume: (1) An Eskimo woman of Bathurst, the whole costume being
made of reindeer skin, trimmed with the fur of small animals; (2) A Kiowa woman
in native costume of buckskin, colored green, and carrying on her back a cradle or
papoose frame, in which was shown a child securely wrapped; (3) A Piute woman
from the great interior basin, gathering seeds from the wild grasses, to be subsequently
ground and made into bread.

In addition to the specimens and lay-figures shown, there was, in connection with
the ethnological exhibit, a collection of ethnographic transparencies, which aided
in the understanding of the specimens in relation to their environments.

The exhibit was prepared by Prof. O. T. Mason, and installed by Mr. T. W.
Sweeny.

Department of prehistoric anthropology.—The exhibit of this department was con-
fined to a display of prehistoric objects from foreign countries. This restriction in
the scope of the exhibit was made in the belief that the weapons, implements, and
ornaments found in the Tennessee Valley and other sections of the United States,
would be amply illustrated in the various local exhibits of prehistoric objects.

The Paleolithic period was represented by specimens from a large portion of the
Eastern Hemisphere—England, France, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Hindustan, and other
countries.

The Neolithic period was represented by different implements, principally of pol-
ished stone, from great areas. They were classified chiefly according to function.

The distribution of nucleii (or cores), flakes, and hammerstones, polished stone
hatchets, scrapers, arrowheads and spearheads, and similar implements was shown to
be world-wide. Special attention was called to the similarity of the polished stone
hatchets from distant and widely separated countries throughout the world.

An entire case was devoted to a display of objects belonging to the bronze age.
These began with the most primitive implements, as the plain hatchet, and ulti-
mately included many other weapons, implements, utensils, and ornaments of later
date. Among these were hatchets, swords, daggers, knives, sickles, fishhooks,
household utensils, mirrors, combs, thimbles, bracelets, fibulas, rings, pins, objects
and ornaments of dress and for the boudoir.

The collection was selected and arranged by Dr. Thomas Wilson.

Department of oriental antiquities and religious ceremonials.—The exhibit of this
department consisted of objects intended to illustrate Brahmanism and Buddhism
(the principal religions of Eastern Asia), Mohammedanism, the literary history of
the Bible, and the religious ceremonials of the Jews.

Brahmanism was represented by a collection of images of the principal divinities
and by various implements and paraphernalia illustrative of the religious worship,
the ascetic life of devotees, and the institution of caste, which plays such an impor-
tant part in the religious and social life of India.

Buddhism was represented by several images of Buddha and of Buddhist saints,
and by a collection of musical instruments and other objects used by the Buddhists
in their religious worship.

The history of the Bible as a book was illustrated by a collection of Bibles, which
included manuscripts and old and rare editions of the original texts, as well as of
the most important ancient and modern translations of the Scriptures. The collec-
tion thus afforded an interest not only to biblical knowledge, but also to the study
of paleography and literary history.

The Jewish religious ceremonials were represented by a collection of modern
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oa

objects used by the Jews in their religious rites, which have their origin in and are
based upon biblical ordinances.

The exhibit was prepared and installed by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, under the direc-
tion of Dr. Cyrus Adler.

Section of technological collections.—Owing to the geographical location of Nash-
ville, it was thought that a presentation of some of the early methods of transpor-
tation in the Southern States might be of special interest.

A small series of models was selected to show the development in transportation
from its beginning in colonial days, when the sledge was almost the only method of
locomotion, to the introduction of the first railroad train in the Southern United
States, which ran on the South Carolina Railroad in 1851.

A rigged model of the Savannah, the first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean,
was also included in this exhibit. The Savannah sailed from the city of that name,
one of the most important ports in the Southern States, in the year 1819.

From the section of naval architecture was selected a model of a full-rigged ship.
In order to make plain to the visitors the nomenclature of the ropes, spars, sails,
etc., over four hundred labels were attached to as many different parts of the model.

From the electrical collection was sent a series representing the early instruments
of Franklin, Henry, Morse, Vail, and Page, and illustrating the development of the
motor and telegraph from the beginning of knowledge concerning static electricity
to the more recent discoveries in electro-magnetism. A full-sized model of the large
electro-magnet which was constructed by Joseph Henry in 1851 for Yale College
was placed on the case containing the electrical collection.

The selections for the exhibit were made by Mr. J. EK. Watkins.

- Section of historical relics, coins, and medals.—The collection of coins and medals
was exhibited in two table cases, and included—

(1) The principal coins in use in the North American colonies from 1652 to the
establishment of the United States Mint in 1793, and types of the later coinage of
the country.

(2) Medals commemorative of events in the colonial history of the country during
the war of the Revolution and the war of 1812.

(3) Medallic portraits of the Presidents of the United States.

Among the most interesting coins shown were the ‘‘ pine and oak tree” shillings
of 1652, the ‘‘Mark Newby” penny, the ‘‘ Rosa Americana” penny, the Continental
dollar of 1776, and the copper coins of Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New
Jersey, and other colonies, prior to coinage by the Mint.

There were also shown specimens of the North Carolina and Georgia private gold
coinage of 1830 to 1840, of the Mormon gold coins of 1849, and some shell money,
or ‘‘wampum,” which was given a legal value in New England in 1637.

A spinning wheel and distaff which was used during the period of the war of the
Revolution was exhibited in the History building.

The collection was selected and arranged by Mr. A. Howard Clark.

Section of materia medica.—Two series of specimens were sent from the extensive
collection in the section of materia medica, the first consisting of samples of natural
and cultivated cinchona barks and their products, and the second showing the com-
mercial varieties and the alkaloids of opium.

The exhibit was prepared by Dr. J. M. Flint, U. S.N.

Department of arts and industries.—This department exhibited an attractive collec-
tion representing animal form in pottery, including the principal wares of Japan,
and selections from Prussia, Saxony, Copenhagen, Denmark, and France.

Exhibit of laces.—A collection of specimens of network and embroidery, illustra-
ting the various epochs of lace making, was exhibited in the annex to the Woman’s
building, by Dr. Thomas Wilson. The collection comprised about 1,000 specimens
and may be classified under the following general divisions:

(1) Prehistoric: Implements for, and specimens of, sewing, weaving, embroidering,
and tapestry making.
100 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

(2) Prior to 1550 A. D., anterior to lace making: Knotted net, darned work,
drawn work, cut work.

(3) From 1550 A. D.: Reticella, point coupe, point lace, and bobbin lace of Venice,
Milan, Genoa, Flanders, France, and England.

(4) Modern laces.

(5) Series showing process of manufacture of point and bobbin lace, needles, thread,
cushions, bobbins, etc.

Mr. W. V. Cox, chief clerk of the National Museum, was in immediate charge of
the entire exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum.

Credit is due to Mr. J. S. Goldsmith and Mr. C. A. Steuart for their efficient super-
vision of the mechanical operations connected with the preparation and installation
of the collections.

The amount appropriated by Congress for the Government exhibit was $100,000, -
and for the Government building $30,000. The sum allotted to the Institution and
Museum was $16,200, the actual cost being $16,073.61, as shown in the following

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
_ orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on

special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-

sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1898.

RECENT PROGRESS ACCOMPLISHED BY AID OF PHOTOG-
RAPHY IN THE STUDY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE)!

By MM. LoEwy and PUISEUX.

(With three plates. )

I.—RESUME OF THE PRINCIPAL QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTED BY LUNAR OBSERVATIONS.

Next to the sun, which furnishes us with heat and light, the moon,
of the remaining celestial bodies, excites the greatest curiosity and
suggests the greatest number of problems to investigators. The suc-
cession of its phases has furnished a unit of time, intermediate between
that of the day and the year, which has been universally adopted.
The eclipses which our satellite undergoes or occasions when it aligns
itself with the earth and the sun have excited even the most undevel-
oped imaginations since antiquity. They still serve chronologists in
verifying historical dates. Representing a source of important progress
in physical astronomy, they give rise, several times in a century, to
reunions and to the combined efforts of many astronomers. The rapid-
ity of the apparent motion of the moon among the stars makes it very
valuable for the determination of geographical coordinates; its ephem-
eris 1S an indispensable manual to travelers and to mariners. The
researches of mathematicians have shown that the attraction of our
satellite is the principal cause of the tides, and of precession and nuta-
tion, that is, changes in the direction of the earth’s axis in space. The
perturbations which the moon undergoes in its orbit teach us much in
regard to the interior structure of our globe, of its ellipticity and of the
fundamental constants of astronomy, such as the mass of the earth and
the solar parallax. Its influence on the meteorological phenomena,
strongly fixed in popular opinion, is still the object of persevering and
impartial researches. Finally, by its relative proximity, the moon pre-
sents itself as an obliging stepping-stone when we wish to extend our
investigations beyond the limits of the globe which has been assigned
to us aS our abode. Deprived of the vaporous envelopes which appear
to obscure the surfaces of Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, it reveals even in
the smallest telescopes numerous sharp and persistent details. No

planet, therefore, seems capable of giving us greater information in
regard to the question whether the physical forces (the effect of which
we observe on our globe) act similarly ‘on othr celestial bodies. It lends
itself, perhaps, better than the earth, on account of exposing to view a
whole hemisphere at once, to the study of certain captivating and diffi-
cult problems, those for instance concerning the origin and the evolu-
tion of satellites in general. Indeed, one can not examine the moon
without being led to ask if conditions favorable to the development of
vegetation and of life can be found on other celestial bodies beside the
earth, a question too often agitated, although always attracting philo-
sophical interest.

The first serious attempts made to attack this problem date to the
invention of the telescope. But, although skillful observers have
devoted themselves to a study of the moon, it ts remarkable that until
recently no powerful telescope had ever been applied to a study of our
satellite as a whole. Under these conditions the multitude of visible
details is so great that an isolated investigator can not undertake to
deseribe or to delineate them. On the other hand, if the task be
divided among a number of astronomers, or if the attention be fixed on
some particular region, there is the risk in either case of losing the char-
acter of unity of the undertaking, and in addition the physiological or
accidental errors of observation would impart a provoking uncertainty
to any conclusions which might be thus deduced.

II1.—ADVANTAGES OFFERED IN THIS RESPECT BY PHOTOGRAPHY.

The invention of photography opened an avenue of escape from these
difficulties. However, many years have been necessary for astronomers
to put to application all the advantages offered to them by the new
process. Their first attempts indeed met with three principal difficul-
ties which, for a long time, were regarded as insurmountable or at
least as certainly placing photography at a disadvantage with respect
to visual observation.

The first difficulty was due to the imperfect achromatism of the
objectives, until recently always designed for direct vision so as to
bring to the same focus the brightest rays of a star without taking into
account the rays which have the greatest chemical activity.

The second difficulty was due to the lack of a suitable control mech-
anism which would assure a persistent agreement between the displace-
ment of the telescope and the apparent movement of the focal image of
the object.

Finally, the lack of sensitiveness of photographic plates made it
necessary to have recourse to relatively long exposures, which increased
all the displacement due both to a defective motion of the telescope and
to atmospheric undulations.

The first difficulty was overcome by MM. Paul and Prosper Henry,
who demonstrated the possibility of increasing the photographic efii-
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 107

ciency of large objectives by causing those rays which have the strong-
est reducing action on the silver salts to be brought to a common
focus. By means of this improvement, photography, compared with
direct vision, found itself in possession of an advantage which might
have been theoretically predicted.

For a given diameter of the objective, the chemical rays emitted by
a star will naturally produce an image richer in detail than that pro-
duced by the visible rays capable of affecting the retina. As is well
known, the image of a Juminous point is a small circular spot, the
diameter of which is proportional to the wave length emitted. Actinic
rays, more refrangible than the visible rays of the spectrum, correspond
to a shorter wave length, and consequently give rise to a sharper and
more detailed image if these rays are made to converge by a suitable
choice of lenses.

The second difficulty has been eliminated, at least in ordinary cases,
by the employment of an auxiliary telescope mounted coaxially with
the photographic telescope. It therefore becomes easy to observe a
star directly during the whole duration of the exposure, and to maintain
the image precisely at the intersection of two fine cross hairs, by adjust-
ing, as often as may be necessary, the mechanism controlling the motion
of the telescope. in this manner the relative immobility of the stars
with respect to the plates may be assured. This method can, how-
ever, only give its best results in the hands of a watchful and skillful
observer. It enables, by means of prolonged exposures, sharp images
of the smaller stars, suitable for the most precise measurements, to be
obtained. This advance, which is also due to MM. Paul and Prosper
Henry, has rendered possible the great international undertaking of
mapping the heavens.

The method we possess of prolonging the exposure, almost without
limit, has in certain cases a great advantage. It gives rise to an indefi-
nite accumulation, so to speak, of luminous impressions at a given
point on the plate, and thus reveals perceptible images of objects too
dim to affect the retina. By this means vast regions of nebulous
matter and numerous small planets have been discovered which no
eye-piece, associated with the same objective, could have been able to
reveal.

An amelioration of this difficulty has also been obtained in another
manner, for chemists have succeeded in increasing the sensitiveness
of photographic plates, especially by the substitution of gelatine for
collodium as a body for the silver salts. In certain cases the duration
of exposure has been reduced to a few hundredths or even thousandths
of a second, and thus photographs of objects in motion, too rapid to be
analyzed by the eye, have been obtained. In astronomy we may cite,
as examples, the photography of sun spots and of granulations of the
photosphere, as well as meteoric trajectories. For such a brief expo-
sure only an approximate coincidence between the movement of the
108 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

telescope and the apparent displacement of the star is necessary, and,
moreover, atmospheric undulations also cease to exert an injurious
influence on the image formed.

IlI.—CHARACTERISTIC DIFFICULTIES IN THE REGISTRATION OF
LUNAR IMAGES.

All these advances have led to a kind of revolution in the methods
of observation. They have also led us to undertake the solution of a
great number of new problems in sidereal and physical astronomy, but
none of the methods we have been discussing give entirely satisfactory
results when applied to the moon. The employment of a finder makes
it possible to obtain regular disks for stellar images if the stars are not
too close to one another, but it does not eliminate the confusion of
adjacent details in an extended object which we seek to reproduce with
every possible refinement. It is necessary to adopt special mechanical
contrivances to follow the moon’s motion, coustantly variable both in
direction and in velocity. Various solutions to establish this concord-
ance have been proposed, and, on the whole, with success. At Paris
this has been accomplished in a very satisfactory manner by making
the telescope immovable. The plate holder being moved by a separate
motor, its orientation is therefore entirely under the control of the
observer. However, as the moon is not sufficiently luminous to pro-
duce a suitable image in a smail fraction of a second, it has been impos-
sible up to the present to eliminate the effects due to the undulations of
atmospheric origin. These are almost completely beyond the control
of astronomy, and it is therefore necessary to select moments when they
make themselves least felt. Very often they render the theoretical
superiority of large objectives illusory. ‘To show how harmful their
influence is, it is sufficient to say that at Paris after four years, during
which every opportunity which has appeared to be favorable for photo-
graphing the moon has been utilized, only a dozen evenings, at most,
have given really satisfactory negatives which would stand strong
magnification.

IV.—ADVANTAGES OF PHOTOGRAPHY OVER DIRECT OBSERVATION.

It seems that in this respect direct observation must claim a distinct
advantage over photography. A very short time, indeed only a few
hundredths of a second, are necessary to affect the retina.

The observer, with his eye at the ocular, can thus, if he is watching
the object which he wishes to examine, take advantage of the rare
intervals of calmness which are lost in photography. The nights
suitable for observing will then, in the former case, be much more
numerous. Notwithstanding this, however, there still remains a great
superiority for photography, for a single negative obtained under
favorable conditions includes an abundance of data and exact details
which it would be impossible for the most patient and skillful observer

to collect during a number of years; moreover, the quantity of data is
of less value than their certainty. Delineations and descriptions of
difficultly visible objects are in a certain measure necessarily a product
of interpretation and memory. Their agreement is even very fre-
quently not a guarantee of the fidelity of the observer, often influenced
by preconceived opinions. The conditions in photography are entirely
different. Instead of being temporary, as is the case with the retinal
image, the chemical impression is permanent and can be rendered
indestructible. A certain control can be assured by making, as is
nearly always done, a number of exposures which no personal prejudice
ean alter. They escape all physiological and mental influences which
might make the hand or the judgment of the artist deviate from the
truth.

Another cause which aggravates the difficulties of direct vision is
due to the presence of a complex tableau which is being continually
transformed. The sensitive plate furnishes a faithful image corre-
sponding to a given epoch.

Lack of time prevents the portrayer not from perceiving the details,
but from reproducing all of them, and the subject even experiences
important modifications before the work of delineating is completed.
Delicate markings might be altered by the inevitable impurities of the
sensitive films, of the developing baths, or of the wash water, but such
alterations are easily recognized, at least as long as they do not affect
details bordering on the limit of visibility. In any case, however,
errors which might be introduced can easily be eliminated by making
a number of exposures at short intervals apart.

It can therefore be truly affirmed that photography, having become
an indispensable auxiliary for stellar astronomy, can also render impor-
tant services in the physical study of the surfaces of our planets.
The moon, much nearer to us than any other celestial body, would,
reasoning in this manner, be a most fertile field for discoveries. Dur-
ing the last few years the most powerful telescopes of the Lick Observ-
atory, in California, and of the Paris Observatory have been utilized
in its study. The collections of negatives of the two observatories,
taken together, inclose the elements of a complete atlas or our satellite
(at present in course of publication). Not only do they reveal a multi-
tude of details outside of those which are enumerated and represented
on lunar maps, but they also furnish a certain basis for the recognition
and analysis of the variations which may be wrought by time on the
surface of our satellite.

V.—SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES WHICH HAVE SUPPOSEDLY
‘BEEN OBSERVED ON OUR SATELLITE.

The importance of a verification of such changes is extreme, and
selenographers appear to have early recognized this. Fearing natu-
rally to get lost in the infinite multitude of details, they have devoted
110 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

themselves to the study of those concerning the existence of which
there can be no doubt. Their efforts have been directed to obtain exact
images of them and to compare their present state with previous
descriptions. In the absence of precise ideas in regard to the physical
constitution of the moon, they flattered themselves to have encountered
traces of an evolution as active as that of which our globe is the seat;
of having seen manifestations of the circulation of water, of vegeta-
tion, and of life. This hope appeared at first justified by the results.
Discrepancies, which were revealed in large numbers, were interpreted
as indications of probable changes. We shall briefly point out those
which appear most worthy of attention.

At the bottom of the gulf, situated between the Caucasus and the
Lunar Alps, we find Cassini, a crater 60 kilometers in diameter, whose
ramparts rise 1,000 meters above the surrounding plain and above the
interior floor. This formation, which the smallest telescope at the
present day clearly reveals, is wanting on the maps of Hevelius and of
Riccioli, who have represented many other objects in its neighborhood
much less visible. It was first mapped in 1680 by Dominique Cassini,
the author justly celebrated for the discovery of the laws of libration.

At the present day we see in the southern part of the ‘‘Sea of Rains,”!
two twin craters very close together nearly equal in every respect,
having a diameter of 20 kilometers and a depth of more than 1,000
meters. These two have been named Helicon and Leverrier. Hevelius
and Riccioli again agree in mapping at this point only a single circle.

Cichus, a crater of a considerable circumference, forming part of the
southern border of the ‘‘Sea of Clouds,”? has a paracitic crater which
interrupts the regularity of its contour. On three different maps of
Schroter, made between 1784 and 1802, this object is represented rela-
tively one-half as large as it now appears.

In the same region all modern photographs show in the neighborhood
of the crater ‘‘ Hell” a very bright spot, in which are assembled several
craters. Cassini assures us that he observed this region covered by a
temporary white cloud, which disappeared to give rise to a new formation.

We actually see in the dark part of the ‘Sea of Clouds” a round
bright spot called Alpetragius d., about 20 kilometers in diameter, with-
out any appreciable relief. Médler represents at this point a crater 8
kilometers in diameter, of which not the least trace can at present be
found.

In the middle of the “‘Sea of Fertility” * there arise a pair of craters
named after Messier. They attract attention by the straight white
bifurcated trail which extends from them in an easterly direction, and
resembles in a most remarkable manner the tail of a comet. These
two circles, so close together, appeared exactly similiar to Beer and
Madler. Their attention having been attracted to this point by a

between 1828 and 1837 without being able to distinguish the two for-
mations from one another except by their coordinates. To-day they
differ from one another both in form and in dimensions, and their dis-
similarity, unanimously recognized, is so pronounced as to strike even
the least attentive observer. !

The phenomenon described above, in the case of Alpetragius d., is
repeated in the case of Linné, a white spot situated in the ‘Sea of
Serenity.”” Rieccioli, Lohrmann, Midler, and Schmidt all agree in rep-
resenting in this place a very deep crater, from 6 to 10 kilometers in
diameter and quite visible. Schmidt himself, in 1866, pointed out the
disappearance of this crater. Since this epoch the spot of Linné only
shows an extremely small opening, bearing no resemblance to the old
descriptions.

It would be easy to extend this list by citing numerous examples
taken principally from Scréter and Gruithuisen. We have only
described those cases which are based on independent and concordant
testimony. Indeed, in such matters the sources of error are very
numerous, and the selenographers of former days do not appear to have
sufficiently guarded against them. The sun, moon, and earth are only
found in the same relative positions at rare intervals. A change of a
few degrees in the position of the circle of illumination, or in the decli-
nation of the earth relative to the lunar equator, modifies in a marked
degree the aspect of the formations which are adjacent either to the
terminator or to the center of illumination. The part due to these
influences being known, it remains well established by photographs,
which are to-day in our possession, that the old drawings are no longer
true. Do the differences correspond to effects really observed? It
seems almost certain that there is no escape from this conclusion in the
case of Messier, and very probably in tbat of Linné. In the latter case,
however, there is some room for doubt, for although several drawings
indicate changes, there are others which might be cited which contra-
dict them, and hence make them open to suspicion. To show how
uncertain conclusions thus established may be, it would be easy to find
drawings of Mars made on the same day and at the same hour by two
different observers in which even the most important markings could

1Since this verification is the most precise we possess, we will quote from the
writings of Beer and Midler, whose authority in selenography is so great and so
well founded: ‘To the east there arises a crater similar to the first in all respects
in form, height, depth, color of the interior and of the rampart, and even in the
position of certain summits on the latter. ‘The entire agreement is so pronounced,
that it must have been due to a singular stroke of chance, unless some unknown law
of nature has thus manifested itself. We are certain that since 1829 we have seen
this region, as we have just described it on more than three hundred occasions; in
other words, as often as it could be observed. In a formation so well characterized
the least changes of size, shape, or luminosity would have made themselves visible,
the observations of Schréter having induced us to keep a sharp watch on this
locality.”

not be identified. If two such drawings were considered as relating to
different epochs, there would have been a great temptation to assume
that there had been a profound transformation, while everything is
explained by errors of interpretation of a physiological origin, which
arise when the attention is concentrated for a long time on objects
which are scarcely visible. The situation would be entirely different
for the moon if we had negatives taken fifty or sixty years ago com-
parable in quality with those obtained at the present time. Under
these circumstances there would be no uncertainty as to surface changes
of any moment.

VI.—INDICATIONS FURNISHED BY RECENT PHOTOGRAPHS IN REGARD
TO THE ORIGIN OF THE LUNAR CORE.

Let us now examine what profit science can hope to reap from the
study of photographs taken in the last few years. They confirm, on
the whole, the correctness of the work of Midler and Schmidt, and
show that no phenomenon which has modified in any permanent man-
ner the general aspect of the moon has taken place in the last half cen-
tury. Concerning local variations, it would be wise not to draw any
absolute conclusions and to consider the recent photographs as bea-
cons erected for the future. The value of lunar photographs can not
fail to increase with time, and they will doubtless permit us to draw
definite conclusions within a few years which the sketches of two cen-
turies ago would not authorize. Moreover, the photographs are even to
furnish us at once with other very important data from another point of
view, for giving, as they do, a homogeneous and simultaneous represen-
tation of the whole visible disc, they lend themselves very well indeed
to a study of the origin of the lunar soil. They possess particular
advantages in the recognition of the general alignments in the struc- -
ture of the soil, the delicate tracings which extend for great distances,
such as the so-called cracks and radiating streaks.

These objects are most difficult to distinguish by direct observations,
the attention of the astronomer being in this case strongly concentrated
on a restricted portion of the image. Another valuable property of
photography is that it brings out in an expressive manner, possibly
slightly exaggerated, the differences in the tint of two neighboring
regions. Such indications have a great value in the study of the actual
physical state of the moon, and, notably, in proving the presence or
absence of air and water on its surface. We are now to take up a con-
- sideration of this question, which is intimately connected with the prob-
lem so often suggested of the habitability of the planets.

VII.—ON THE EXISTENCE OF WATER AND AIR ON THE MOON.

The complete absence of air and of water on the moon would be con-
sidered at first sight as an abnormal condition. It is indeed difficult,
whatever cosmic theory one adopts, not to regard the moon as a depend-

ency or a colony of the earth. To be more precise, and considering the

question from the standpoint of Laplace, the satellites ought to be con-
sidered as fragments of the planet they accompany, these fragments

having been derived from its equatorial and superficial layers. The
materials which predominate in the original body ought to be repre-
sented in the satellite, and especially the fluids and other light sub-

stances which gravity tends ceaselessly to conduct to the surface. This
supposition is confirmed by the low mean density of the moon, hardly
greater than one-half of that of the earth. It might generally be sup-
posed that the division of the original atmosphere would have taken
place in proportion to the masses of the two bodies, and one ought not
to expect to find the air on the surface of our satellite forming a layer
as dense as that on the terrestrial globe. The ratio of the surface to
the volume of the moon is four times as great as that of the earth, and
gravity, reduced to a sixth part of its value, would more or less effi-
ciently counterbalance the expansive force of gases and vapors. The
lunar atmosphere would therefore be expected to extend to a much
greater height than ours, producing a corresponding decrease in its
density. For these two reasons it may be predicted that the air at the
surface of the moon can not possess a refracting power as great as one-
fiftieth of that on the earth’s surface. Observation, however, shows
that it must be very much less than even this.

VItL—INDICATIONS THUS FAR OBTAINED BY DIRECT OBSERVATIONS.

If our satellite possessed a layer of air of appreciable density its
presence would surely be revealed in several different ways: (1) The
diameter of the moon would be increased, its apparent contour being
no longer determined by straight tangents drawn from the observer to
the lunar globe, but byrays which are tangent to its surface, after hav-
ing been curved in its atmosphere. Assuming that refraction is still
sensible at a height of five kilometers above the lunar surface, this would
result in an increase of about five seconds in its apparent diameter,
and in a band of about two seconds width, there would be a superposi-
tion of images, which would detract very much from the sharpness of
the moon’s outline. Bright stars would, before disappearing, seem for a
few seconds to travel on tbe lunar disk. (2) The apparent diameter,
calculated from the duration of the occultation of stars, would, on the
contrary, be smaller than the apparent diameter defined by geometric
tangents. A phenomenon similar to that observed at the rising and
“setting of the stars would result. Refraction transforms the luminous
-Yrays into curvilinear trajectories, with their concavity always turned
toward the center of the earth. Therefore, for example, the time of
sunset is retarded and that of sunrise is hastened by the same amount.
_ In the case of an occultation the effect would be twice as great seen from
the earth as it would be for an observer on the moon at the point of
_tangency of the luminous ray emitted by the star. Theray, to reach us,
ae sm 98——8

114 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

would, in fact, have to traverse the lunar atmosphere twice, being
twice deflected, but always in the same direction. To be concise, the
duration of an occultation would be shortened and the diameter of the
disk, calculated from the time of entry and exit, would be less than the
true diameter, and, a fortiori, less than the diameter, given by micro-
metric measurements or by transit observations. In the case of an
oblique passage of a star behind the disk the trajectory of the star
would be sensibly inflected. (3) On days preceding or following new
moon the narrow horns, which terminate the illuminated portion,
ought to be prolonged beyond their geometric limits—a twilight effect.
(4) In an eclipse of the sun that portion of the lunar disk not projected
on the sun’s surface should appear, partly, at least, surrounded by an
aureole similar to that which has often been observed during the
transits of Venus. The light from the solar corona would be reinforced
in these parts, the refracted rays adding their effects to those which
are directly transmitted. (5) The spectral rays of atmospheric origin,
compared with those of solar origin, should be relatively more pro-
nounced in the light reflected by the moon than in that received
directly by the sun. (6) Finally, if one assumes that the atmosphere
of the moon contains a considerable quantity of water vapor, as does
our own, it would appear improbable that this vapor, submitted to
extreme temperature changes due to days and nights fifteen times
as long aS our own, would not condense to form clouds or deposits of
snow readily visible.

Most of these indications have repeatedly been observed, according
to the statements of astronomers worthy of belief. They can, however,
hardly be considered as established by sufficiently precise and con-.
cordant testimony, depending, as they do, on such data as the prolonga-
tion of the horns by night and the theoretical duration of occultations.
To cite one more fact, the only one on which a numerical evaluation can
be based, and which has only been brought to light quite recently; itis
to-day admitted that the semidiameter of the moon, deduced from
meridian observations should be diminished two to two and a half sec-
onds, to conform to observations of occultations and eclipses. At the
beginning of this century, on account of thelack of sufficiently numerous
and exact measurements, the two values of the diameter were regarded
as identical. Based on this assumption, the illustrious Bessel was of
the opinion that he could affirm that the atmospheric density at the sur-
face of the moon could not be greater than 5}; of its value on the sur-
face of the earth. If the same calculation be repeated on the basis of
the recent discussion of accumulated observational data, it would lead
to the assumption that the moon does possess an atmosphere and that
its density is slightly greater than that assigned by Bessel as a maxi-
mum limit.

It would be wrong, however, to accept this conclusion as absolute.
We do not know the diameter of the moon,as determined by direct
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 115

measurements, with sufficient exactness, and consequently we are not
able to affirm that the discordance pointed out may not be due to other
physical causes. However, it remains established that the principal
reason usually given for denying the existence of an appreciable atmos-
phere around the moon has actually no value, and the probabilities
should rather be considered as in favor of its existence.

From this ensemble of facts the conclusions may be drawn that the
density of the atmosphere on our satellite is certainly very much less
than it ought to be, if its division between the moon and the earth had
originally taken place in proportion to their masses. This result might,
moreover, have been foreseen by theory. Indeed, during the separation
of the earth and moon there must have been a considerable time during
which the two planets were enveloped in a common atmosphere. The
action of masses at a distance being governed by the law of universal
attraction, it would necessarily follow that the atmosphere would be
divided, not in the ratio of 1 to 8, which is that of the two masses, but
in the ratio of 1 to 729, which is that of the volumes of the attracting
spheres.

This remark permits us to consider the small relative density of the
lunar atmosphere, verified by observation, as being perfectly in har-
mony with Laplace’s hypothesis.

Should one conclude from the above that our satellite has always

possessed only an extremely rare atmosphere, incapable of sustaining
life, and of being the seat of meteorological phenomena of importance?
By no means. It may be supposed that at the epoch when the divi-
sion of the atmospheres of the two globes was accomplished, that of
the earth was incomparably more extended than to-day. An eleva-
tion of the the temperature of a few hundred degrees would transform
the water of the ocean into water vapor and would also set free all the
carbonic acid locked up in limestone formations. The small portion
of the common atmosphere with which our satellite was endowed
ought, then, on this principle, to have had a density much greater than
its present value.
The examination of recent photographs furnishes us with numerous
and decisive data even on this important. question, enabling us to
affirm with certainty that the lunar atmosphere was at some previous
time much more dense. This conclusion is almost forced upon us by
intense and manifold volcanic phenomena, of which we discover unde-
niable traces in nearly every region of the moon.

Even if the inferior density of the materials displaced be considered,

explosions and upheavals could not have been produced on such a
large scale without having been accompanied by an abundant disen-
gagement of gases. It must be evident, from our knowledge of active
volcanoes, that no agent could have supplanted water vapor in this
function. The scattering of eruptive products to great distances in
the form of radiating streaks which clear all obstacles can not be com-

prehended except on the assumption that they were emitted in a pow-
dered state and held in suspension in an LIS OU sufficiently dense
to temporarily support them.

IX.—CAUSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF
THE WATER AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

The preceding conclusions, taken together, lead to the result that
the moon is incapable of preserving in a gaseous state the substances
distributed over its surface. Its feeble gravitational attraction would
permit the lighter gases, such as hydrogen, etc., to escape if they be
raised to a high temperature or be endowed with sufficient kinetic
energy. The denser gases, having entered into stable combinations,
would have become incorporated with the core. The liquid portions
would have disappeared by means of mechanical absorption. The
continuity and the efficiency of this tendency are manifested by the
phenomena which are daily taking place about us.

Thus the continually increasing predominance of solid compounds in
a gradually cooling body would result in accordance with the most
general laws of chemistry. Most saline compounds contain water of
combination which they set free on being heated and which they take
up again on cooling in a moist atmosphere. This phenomenon would
be limited, both by the complete saturation of the salts and by the total
disappearance of free water vapor. These two conditions can be
experimentally realized in laboratories. The first is that generally
presented on the surface of the earth, but the second would be found
on a planet less well provided with water. =

It is even probable that the evolution of the earth on which we dwell
will not cease to continue in the same direction. The incessant cycle
of changes which water undergoes under our very eyes, and which
seems a necessary condition for vegetation and life, is not fixed and will
not endure forever. The formation of deposits of rock salt, gypsum,
and nitrates effectively abstracts a very considerable quantity of water
from circulation. The water uniting with the solid salts can then no
longer be separated from them by the ordinary operation of natural
forces. What we have said above in regard to the water applies
equally well to the other components of the atmosphere. Fromit have
been abstracted the carbon contained in limestone formations and in
coal beds, the nitrogen in vegetable soils and in the Peruvian nitrate
beds, and finally the oxygen of siliceous rocks. Nothing indicates that
this transformation has already been completed, and that 1t will not be
continuously manifested by the lowering of the ocean level and of the
barometric column.

There is, moreover, a Special cause operating to abstract water from
circulation apart from chemical action. The major part of the terres-
trial core is formed, as is well known, of permeable rocks. The water
carried down by rain filters through them, saturating them more or —
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. LEZ

_ less completely, according to the season, filling the cavities which there
- avound or circulating in capillary fissures, compressing and expelling
"any gases which are encountered. The same phenomenon must also
_ be going on at the sea bottom, and in addition gravity always tends to
remove the water farther away from the surface. The absorption is,
- however, limited by the internal heat of the globe. At a depth of 3,000
- er 4,000 meters the water would be brought in contact with layers at
- atemperature of 100°. It would therefore be vaporized and the ten-
sion of the vapor formed would be sufficient to partly drive back the
water into the upper layers or even to spurt it out in the form of
thermal springs. This subterranean circulation of the water is prob-
ably the most active cause of the loss of the internal heat of the globe.
In proportion. as the cooling progresses the depth of the layer, in which
water can exist in the liquid state, would increase and its capacity for
‘absorption would thus be still further augmented.

If we give due weight to the difference in the physical conditions on
the earth and on the moon we become, without difficulty, convinced
that all the causes which have tended to diminish the height of the

- atmosphere and the volume of the ocean on our globe must have had a
still greater influence on our satellite. Less well provided with air and
water originally, and with a greater extent of surface in proportion to

_ its volume, the moon would take less time to consume the reserve sup-
plies. The formation of saline compounds, of limestone, gypsum, and
nitrates must have been able to effect a nearly complete absorption of
the water before even the cooling would have permitted its condensation
on the surface. The remainder, having escaped these causes of absorp-
tion or having been again set at liberty by volcanic eruptions, must
have filtered into the innumerable orifices of every size which honeycomb
the lunar core. In addition, the penetration would be more easily
effected than on the earth, for the internal temperature, decreasing
more rapidly with the depth, would not tend to prevent that action to
the same extent. To briefly summarize the above it must be consid-

ered as established by observation that the moon does not at present
contain either bodies of water having a free surface or an appreciable
atmosphere. If it be demonstrated, however, that water in the form

_ of vapor has actively contributed to the formation of the present relief,

_ we can not tell a priori whether water has ever circulated in the liquid

_ form at some intermediate period or whether it had time to be con-

' densed on the surface before being absorbed, before accomplishing

- important mechanical effects, or before finally giving rise to the forma-
tion of great accumulations of ice.

On these different points there is abundant opportunity for interro-
gating unprejudiced observation, and for examining if our satellite

_ Shows any evidences of eroded valleys, sedimentary deposits, and ice
_ fields of considerable extent—phenomena which ought to result from
_ the prolonged action of water. Modern photographs will throw much

valuable light on this subject. 3

118 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

Although it is easy indeed to find on the surface of the moon regions
sinilar in their aspects both to the low plains and the elevated plateaus
of the earth, the differences become accentuated on comparing the
mountainous regions, properly so called; that is to say, those in which
differences in level of several thousand meters appear short distances
apart. Wherever this condition is encountered on our globe it may be
observed that the relief of the surface has been totally transformed by
the action of water, and the inspection of sedimentary deposits shows
that our present mountain chains are but a small residue of the primi-
tive formations. Formations rising boldly above the general level
have undergone a progressive erosion, especially their contour, and the
direction of their greatest elongation is to-day marked by a crest or a
divide the more marked the higher the mountains.

The causes which lead to the appearance of these divides also give
rise to the formation of secondary ridges. Between these ridges the
valleys appear, which deepen and enlarge gradually from their source
to their junction with the plains below. Some of them, deepened by
numerous rivers, conduct to a common destination all the waters
of a vast region, and not infrequently acquire important dimensions.
There is often a distance of 10 to 15 kilometers between the ridges on
either side. Vast basins would also be easily recognized under an
oblique illumination on the present scale of lunar photographs, and
we would be able to verify without any difficulty their general charac-
ter of convergence.

The evidences which we to-day possess cause the lunar mountains
to appear in an entirely different aspect. Rarely is a sharply defined
watershed found, and even in this case it is easily recognized that it
is the edge of a plateau of which only one side shows a marked decliy-
ity extending for a considerable distance and marked differences in
level. From this standpoint, at least, we should have conditions most
favorable for indicating the action of flowing water. We find, however,
that there are no large basins formed such as abound among the high
mountains of our globe. The depressions there encountered are iso-
lated and closed from all sides. They show no progressive extensions,
no tendency to ramify toward the ridges or to converge in descending
toward the plains.

These facts taken together appear to us irreconcilable with the idea
that there was ever an important circulation of water on the moon.
It is hardly necessary to point out that if there were any bodies of
water at present they would be revealed by their aspects and by their
power of reflecting solar light.

X.—THE PRESENCE OF ICE ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.

It might be thought that if water has not accomplished any impor-
tant mechanical changes on our satellite this might be due to the rapid
cooling of the lunar globe, the water having thus passed in a short
PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE. 119

space of time from the gaseous to the solid state. It may be assumed
from this standpomt that the moon is enveloped, even at present, by an
uninterrupted coating of ice. This view has been adopted by various
skillful observers, especially by Raynard. It is my opinion that it can
no longer be defended to-day, and that the modern photographs do not
permit us to assume the presence of any considerable quantity of ice
upon the surface of the moon.

The hypothesis of an ice coating appears seducing on account of the
fact that a general cooling appears to progress more rapidly than the
absorption of the water, at least on the earth’s surface. Accordingly
it may be predicted that at some future time the greater part of the
ocean will have been transformed into the solid condition. The moon,
therefore, would offer us an image of the future state of our globe.

It is also true that the measurements of radiant heat made by various
physicists, especially by Langley, have led to the view that, on the
whole, the lunar disk is at a very low temperature even when in
opposition.

On the other hand, if the lunar disk were covered with ice one ought
to see a luminous spot periodically appear following the motion of the
sun. Ice, indeed, possesses a marked power of reflecting light, although
to a smaller degree than water. Neither photography nor visual obser-
vation indicate anything of this kind, besides the measurements of M.
Landerer give a value for the angle of polarization of the surface of
the moon differing from that of ice and agreeing much better with that
of voleanic rocks.

It seems also very improbable that a bed of ice spread over the
equatorial zones could undergo for two consecutive weeks the direct
action of the solar rays, to be for several times twenty-four hours
beneath the sun near its zenith, without being heated to the melting
point and consequently giving rise to the production of bodies of water
and of clouds. Although the high summits of terrestrial mountains
remain cold in the summer and although the snows which cover them
melt but slightly, this may be attributed to the violent winds which
there abound and which prevent the temperature of the surface from
exceeding that of the air. But the melting of the snow does take
place under the sun’s exposure in localities sheltered from the wind.
On the moon, however, the air is too rare to remove by convection any
considerable quantity of heat from bodies, and hence the action of the
sun is exercised in an extremely energetic and prolonged manner. The
supposition that the glacial coat of the moon is covered by another,
formed of scoriz and cinders, is in better agreement with its superficial
aspect, but the resistance past and present offered by the ice to fusion
must still be regarded as most mysterious. The scorivw indeed should
have an elevated temperature, for they heat up under the action of the
sun even more readily than ice. Water surfaces should therefore
appear periodically at least in the bottoms of great depressions.
120 PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE LUNAR SURFACE.

The hypothesis that the entire surface of the mcon is covered with
ice appears to us inadmissible. It is natural to inquire whether its
accumulation might not take place exclusively in the neighborhood of
the poles as in the case of the earth and probably that of Mars. No
doubt these regions nearly deprived of the action of solar heat ought
to cool down first.

The vapors formed in the low latitudes would condense at the poles
in the form of snow, and would thus be withdrawn from circulation,
since the temperature at the poles must have become too low to melt
or vaporize it. Starting from the moment this temperature is reached,
the ice would not cease to accumulate at the poles until the equatorial
zone itself had permanently cooled to the freezing point. Moreover,
since this general cooling could only have been accomplished extremely
slowly, the poles would have time to accumulate a great quantity of
ice. Their aspect would consequently be more united than that of the
equatorial regions on account of the effacement of the smaller depres-
sions. The lunar photographs, however, reveal just the contrary. The
southern region of the moon is particularly mountainous, bristling with
irregular formations. The craters are very numerous in this locality,
many touching the limit of visibility, and there are, without doubt,
many more which escape our means of observation. On the hypothesis
of two polar ice caps it seems impossible for the intermediate zones not
to be distinguished by too easily distinguished lines of demarcation
undergoing periodic oscillations. Indeed, no known rock taken as a
whole possesses a power equal to that of snow or of ice for reflecting
and diffusing light. The distinction could perhaps be made without
difficulty on terrestrial mountains 200 kilometers off, through the low-
est and most highly refracting layers of the atmosphere, conditions
under which these mountains would appear infinitely less sharply
defined than the craters of the moon. It seems that all we can reason-
ably admit is the possible existence of deposits of ice on the floor of the
craters in the polar regions. There they would be nearly removed
‘from our sight and sheltered from the radiation of the sun. Reduced
to these terms the question can only be answered by an absolute nega-
tive. It may be pointed out, however, that the bottoms of the craters
appear relatively white in the neighborhood of the poles but never
more so than the neighboring crests and plateaus. There can exist,
therefore, only glacial masses of slight thickness and of small extent,
probably covered with cinders. Notwithstanding this, it is to be hoped
that the changes which should accompany their temporary liquefac-
tion ought to be revealed some day by the careful comparison of
photographs. .

XI.— CONCLUSIONS.

The result of this inquiry, as may be seen, is unfavorable to the
actual existence of water, air, and ice in any considerable quantity
on the moon. The climatic conditions must therefore be very severe, —

‘not only in the polar regions, hardly touched by the grazing rays of the

sun, but even in the equatorial regions. Deprived of the protecting
mantle formed by the air and the water vapor, it is subjected to the same
conditions, in a more aggravated form, as the highest terrestrial moun-
tains, the most extreme dryness, intense nocturnal radiation, and a very
low mean temperature. One can hardly imagine an abode more unfa-
vorable for the existence of human life, and as even the most rudimen-
tary forms are absent on the earth at great altitudes, it is impossible to

conceive of any which could adapt themselves to the moon in its present
state.

The same conclusion seems valid, however deeply the question be
considered.

Without doubt the elements of our terrestrial atmosphere have
existed on our satellite. Water in the form of vapor has exerted a
most energetic action, and has formed a relief more marked, on the
whole, than that of the earth. The atmosphere must, however, have
been quite rare when the surface temperature reached the condensation
point, and must have been almost entirely absent when it reached the
freezing point. The conditions of humidity and temperature required
for the development of terrestrial organisms are therefore never found
together on the moon. Its history has many features in common with
the primitive evolution of the earth, though none, it appears, in com-
mon with the contemporaneous period. The moon seems like a planet
of which the development has been prematurely arrested, fixed in its
final form, to become a mute spectator of our own agitations.

Should we for this reason forsake the study of that sterile globe as
being without interest? We should regard the question from a broader
standpoint. The period when life flourishes is but a chapter in the
history of a celestial body, although without doubt the most interesting
one, but we can not consider it only at its best without extending our
researches still further. Physical and chemical laws develop their con-
Sequences within the widest limits of time, and we find in the series of
transformations of a planet a subject having an almost equal philo-
sophical importance. The photographic observation of our satellite is,
from this point of view, full of promise.

Although incapable of sustaining organized life, the moon will never-
theless continue to exert a permanent action in the development of the
human mind. By the study of the important phenomena which are
connected with its attraction for the earth, it has given rise to the
highest efforts of mathematical genius. It aids us in conceiving a
more just and disinterested view of the universe as a whole. It makes
us reach out in thought, not only from ourselves, but from the earth
where we abide, and from the short lifetime in which all our experiences
are embraced.

THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES:!

By GEORGE E. HALE.

The annual exhibitions of the New York Academy of Sciences afford
excellent opportunities for studying the progress of science. The pho-
tographs and specimens gathered here to-night are substantial evi-
dence that in no department of research have investigators been idle
during the last twelvemonth. So true is this, that to sketch the year’s
advances in even a single field would consume more time than is
allotted to the annual lecture. It therefore seemed to me wise, in
responding to the courteous invitation with which I was honored by
the council, to select a subject involving certain details of astronomical
progress, without attempting to undertake the inviting task of portray-

ing the rapid advances which make up the recent history of the science,

I accordingly invite your attention to some considerations regarding
the function of great telescopes.

On the 21st of last October, in the presence of a large company of
guests, the Yerkes Observatory was dedicated to scientific investiga-
tion. The exercises were held under the great dome of the observa-
tory, beneath the 40-inch telescope. Is there reason to suppose that
some in the audience, particularly those having no great familiarity
with astronomical instruments, were inclined, in the course of the reflec-
tions to which the occasion may have given rise, to attribute to the
great mass of steel and optical glass rising far above their heads some
extraordinary and perhaps almost supernatural power of penetrating
the mysteries of the universe? It is not at all unlikely that this was
the case. For there apparently exists in the public mind a tendency
to regard astronomical research with a feeling of awe which is not
accorded to other branches of science. In its power of searching out
mysterious phenomena in the infinite regions of space, a great telescope
seems to stand alone among the appliances of the investigator. Partly
because of this special veneration for its principal instrument, and per-
haps still more on account of the boundless opportunity for speculation
regarding the origin and nature of the universe, astronomy appears to
command the interest of a great portion of the human race. No doubt
there are also historical reasons for the special attraction which the

subject seems to exercise. In the more prosperous days of the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean astrology played an important role,
and medieval history illustrates most clearly the ascendency which
the fancies of the astrologers had acquired over even cultivated minds.
So strong was the tendency of the times that even so able an astrono-
mer as Tycho Brahe was wont to cast horoscopes, in the significance of
which he firmly believed. He concluded that the new star of 1572
prognosticated. great changes in the world. Similarity to the ruddy
planet Mars pointed to wars, pestilence, venomous snakes, and general
destruction, and its resemblance to Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn at other
times foretold temporary pleasant influences, followed by death and
famine.! Thus the heavenly bodies in their courses were supposed to
exercise evil or benign influences upon the human race, and the appari-
tion of a great comet or a new Star gave rise to endless speculations
regarding the fate to which the inhabitants of the earth were shortly to
beexposed. Even in our own day it can not be said that we have alto-
gether escaped from the entangling meshes of the astrological net.
With that strong desire to be humbugged which Dr. Bolton has so well
illustrated in his recent paper in Science on latro-Chemistry, a portion
of the general public seems to devote itself with enthusiasm to the
encouragement of charlatans, whether they deal with alchemy, with
medicine, or with astrology. So it is that astrologers flourish to-day,
and continue to derive profit from their philanthropic desire to reveal
the future to inquiring minds.

The interest of cultivated persons in astronomy and in the possibilities
of great telescopes is by no means to be compared with the blind group-
ing of less-developed intellects after the mysteries of astrology. But
if we must regard the large circulation of certain newspapers as any
index to the popularity of their contents, we are forced to admit that
their readers may comprise a class of persons whose admiration for the
science is ac least distantly related to the love for the sensational
which dominates the followers of modern seers and soothsayers.
Great telescopes are no sooner erected than these papers begin to
demand extraordinary revelations of celestial wonders. The astrono-
mer, quietly pursuing his investigations in the observatory, is from
time to time startled by imperative demands to introduce a waiting and
anxious public to the equally expectant inhabitants of Mars. Minute
particulars as to the appearance, strength, stature, and habits of these
hypothetical beings, whose existence is freely taken for granted, are
expected to be the results of a few moments’ observation with the great
telescope. When the astronomer mildly protests that his observations
are likely to afford little or no material for discussions of such topics,
he is at least supposed to so cultivate his imaginative powers that he
shall be able to supplement his unsatisfactory observations by intui-
tive perception of things which are beyond his telescope’s unaided

appreciation. And it must be admitted that this demand on the part

of some portion of the public press, while in one sense only a certain
phase of the almost universal desire for sensation, has not lacked
encouragement from men who are generally regarded as serious
astronomers, intent on arriving at the truth by the methods of exact

‘science. ‘T’o such is due a widespread belief in the inhabitants of Mars,

who in the popular novels of the day have not even been content with
life upon their own planet, but, in accordance with the astrological sig-

‘nificance of the god of war, have come to bring destruction upon the

inhabitants of the earth. However entertaining we may find the doings
of these strange individuals, whether at home or abroad, we must not
make the mistake of classing the works which describe them with the
literature of science, but rather accord them their proper place among
the pleasant romances which we owe to men of letters.

I can not better illustrate one phase of this pseudoscience than by a
reference to the celebrated ‘‘Moon Hoax,” which caused such a stir at
the time of its appearance. When Sir John Herschel sailed for the
Oape of Good Hope in 1833 he little imagined what marvelous discov-
eries lay before him. It is true that he was provided with a great
reflecting telescope of 20 feet focal length, which was to be used upon
the previously unexplored regions of the southern heavens, and it
could not have been difficult for him to form some conception of the
valuable additions he was certain to make to astronomical knowledge.
But the imagination of others by far outran the more prosaic course of
his own mind, and results were obtained for him which unfortunately
his telescope never served to show. Many who are present are no
doubt familiar with a pamphlet entitled Great Astronomical Discoveries
lately made by Sir John Herschel, LL. D., F. R. 8., ete., at the Cape of
Good Hope, which was ‘first published in the New York Sun, from
the supplement to the Edinburgh Journal of Science.” In the truly
entertaining pages of this ingenious narrative we find an example
which certain reporters of our own day seem to have taken to heart.
Let me quote a paragraph of nonsense which is so amusingly conceived
and proved so effective when published that one is almost ready to
forgive the perpetrator. After a lucid historical discourse on the great
telescopes which had been made by Sir William Herschel and other
previous investigators, followed by an impassioned paragraph which
may well be considered to approach in eloquence the most fervid
astronomical literature of our own day, our author treats us to an
account of a conversational discussion between Sir John Herschel and
Sir David Brewster, which began with a consideration of certain sug-
gested improvements in reflecting telescopes, and soon directed itself

“to that all-invincible enemy, the paucity of light in powerful magni-
' fiers. After afew moments’ silent thought, Sir John diffidently inquired

whether it would not be possible to effect a transfusion of artificial
light through the focal object of vision! Sir David, somewhat startled
126 THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES.

at the originality of the idea, paused a while, and then hesitatingly
referred to the refrangibility of rays and the angle of incidence. Sir
John, grown more confident, adduced the example of the Newtonian
reflector, in which the refrangibility was corrected by the second specu-
lum, and the angle of incidence restored by the third. ‘And,’ continued
he, ‘why can not the illuminated microscope, say the hydro-oxygen, be
applied to render distinct, and, if necessary, even to magnify, the focal
object?’ Sir David sprung from his chair in an eestacy of conviction,
and, leaping half-way to the ceiling, exclaimed, ‘Thou art the man!’
Each philosopher anticipated the other in presenting the prompt illus-
tration that if the rays of the hydro-oxygen microscope, passed through
a drop of water containing the larve of a gnat and other objects invis-
ible to the naked eye, rendered them not only keenly distinct, but
firmly magnified to dimensions of many feet, so could the same artificial
light, passed through the faintest focal object of a telescope, both dis-
tinctify (to coin a new word for an extraordinary occasion) and magnify
its feeblest component members.”

Here, indeed, was a discovery fit to startle the world; and one can
not be punpriced that, after so extraordinary an advance, Sir John
Herschel should have immediately arranged for the construction of an
object glass 24 feet in diameter. Contributions toward this important
work were received from many royal personages, culminating in a gift
by His Majesty the King of some £70,000, which was considered ample
to meet all expenses. Many difficulties were encountered in casting
the great object glass, which was composed of ‘‘an amalgamation of
two parts of the best crown with one of flint glass, the use of which in
separate lenses constituted the great achromatick discovery of Dollond.”
Notwithstanding the prodigious size of this enormous lens, which
weighed 14,826 pounds after being polished, and whose estimated mag-
_ nifying power was 42,000 times, Sir John was not satisfied. Not con-
tent with the mere illuminating power of the hydro-oxygen microscope,
“he calculated largely upon the almost illimitabie applicability of this
instrument as a second magnifier which would supersede the use and
infinitely transcend the powers of the highest magnifiers and reflecting
telescopes.” Indeed, so certain was he of the successful application of
this idea that he counted upon “his ultimate ability to study even the
entomology of the moon in case she contained insects upon her surface.”

It would be interesting, if time permitted, to consider with our
inspired author the various further details in the construction of a tele-
scope which was the first to render visible the inhabitants of the moon.
It may well be imagined with what breathless interest the report of Sir
John’s extraordinary discoveries, which constitutes the body of our
pamphlet, was received by a willing public. “It was about half-past 9
o’clock on the night of the 10th, the moon having then advanced within
four days of her mean libration, that the astronomer adjusted his instru-
ments for the inspection of her eastern limb. The whole immense power

of his telescope was applied, and to its focal image about one-half of the

power of his microscope. On removing the screen of the latter, the
field of view was covered throughout its entire area with a beautiful,
distinct, and even vivid representation of basaltic rock.” For further
details regarding the rock and the lunar flora which covered it, refer-
ence must be made to the original pamphlet. There, too, can be found
descriptions of deep blue oceans, breaking in large billows upon beaches
of brilliant white sand, girt with wild castellated rocks. Passing inland,
wide tracts of country of apparently volcanic character were rapidly
passed over, soon bringing to the observer’s eye lofty chains of slender
pyramids of faint lilac hue, which, when examined with the highest
power of the instrument, were seen to be monstrous amethysts reach-
ing to the height of 60 to 90 feet, and glowing in the intense light of
the sun. It must not be supposed that such delightful regions were
devoid of life. Birds and beasts of strange and uncouth form were
soon brought to view, and, last and greatest marvel of all, the observer
was permitted to behold beings of manlike form. Although not seen
engaged in any work of industry or art, they were evidently of a high
order of intelligence, and to them was doubtless due a magnificent
temple, built of polished sapphire, with roof of yellow gold. The
observer did not at the moment pause to search out the mystery syin-
bolized in the unique architectural details, for he was then “more desir-
ous of collecting the greatest possible number of new facts than of
indulging in speculative theories, however seductive to the imagination.”

But we have already dwelt too long upon this product of enterprising

journalism, which poor Sir John was too far away to be able to contra-

dict. It is enough to remark that the author accomplished his immedi-
ate purpose, and moreover bequeathed to future generations a classic
in this special field of literature.

The astronomer of to-day is unfortunately exposed to similar mis-
representation. On account of the fact that it is a little larger than
any other refractor, the Yerkes telescope is particularly open to attack.
Take, for example, these sentences from a newspaper which would not
ordinarily be considered as one of the sensational class: “After Pro-
fessor Barnard had swept the sky in the region of the nebule he pointed
the instrument toward a region located to the astronomer in Pos. 312
degrees; Dist. 53 minutes. He swung the giant tube toward the region,
and the first discovery at the Yerkes Observatory was registered on the
dial near the dome.” ‘This is merely the newspaper’s own peculiar way
of paraphrasing a simple statement in the Astrophysical Journal regard-
ing the detection of a faint star near Vega. A persistent search by all
the members of the staff has not yet brought to light the mysterious
“‘dial near the dome,” with its precious record of discovery. It seems
probable that the same dial must have treasured up the remarkable
observations of the moon, which the Associated Press thought worthy
of transmission to Europe, though they originated in a reporter’s fertile
128 THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES.

brain, and still remain unknown to the telescope to which they were
ascribed. -An influential newspaper selected these latter observations
as the text of an editorial setting forth the marvelous benefits the
Yerkes telescope is destined to confer upon mankind.

It may be added that the great telescope of the “moon hoax” is
hardly more extravagant in conception than certain schemes which have
been proposed in all seriousness within the past year. One of these
inventors, whose familiarity with the difficulties of telescopic observa-
tion is certainly surpassed by his optimism, remarks: ‘I think the limit
(of magnification) will be due to the shaking of the instrument caused
by the trembling of the earth and of the clockwork mechanism which
moves the telescope. Under these high magnifications extremely mi-
nute vibrations are so much magnified that a small object like that of a
house upon the surface of Mars would dart in and out of the field of
vision so as to prevent its being photographed.” And this he believes
to be the only obstacle (though fortunately it is to be overcome) which
can interfere with his studies of Martian architecture.

So far we have considered only what great telescopes can not accom-
plish, and were I not to pass rapidly on to some positive statements of
another character I might be supposed to believe that they have no
reason for existence, or at best are no better than small ones. But I
shall endeavor to show that exactly the contrary is true; that while
large telescopes do not possess the extraordinary powers conferred upon
them by fertile imaginations, they nevertheless play a most important
part in scientific research, and render possible many investigations
which are altogether beyond the reach of smaller instruments. It seems
the more necessary to dwell upon this point, for only a few years ago
there appeared in print an article entitled ‘‘Do large telescopes pay?”
which was evidently not written by one of those to whom reference has
just been made, but by one of another class, whose known acquaintance
with astronomical work would tend to give his opinion considerable
weight with many intelligent readers. In discussing the subject it was
seriously asked whether the great investments of money which had been
made in the giant instruments of the latter half of the nineteenth cen-
tury had been attended by commensurate advances in astronomical
knowledge. The question is certainly one that deserves serious con-
sideration, for it would surely be poor policy to erect great telescopes
if they are no better than smaller and much cheaper ones. It is desir-
able, therefore, to point out, if I can, some of the elements of superiority
of large instruments which seem to me to make them worth all that
they cost and more.

Leaving aside reflecting telescopes, as most of the very costly instru-
ments in use are refractors, it will be seen that our problem is, for the
most part, a comparison of the proprieties of alarge achromatic lens
with those of a small one. To render the discussion more definite let
us compare a 40-inch lens of 62 feet focus with a 10-inch lens of 153 feet
YHE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES. 129

- focus. The large lens, then, has a diameter four times that of the small
one, which means that its area is sixteen times as great. It will thus
receive upon its surface from a given star sixteen times as much light,
and all of this will be concentrated in the point-like image of the star,
except that portion which is lost in transmission through the lens. On
account of its greater thickness the large lens transmits only about 65
per cent of the visual rays that fall on it, while the small lens trans-
mits about 77 per cent. But after allowance has been made for the loss
due to both absorption and reflection it is found that the image of a
given star produced by the large telescepe will be nearly fourteen times
as bright as that given by the small one. In this instance all of the
light is concentrated in a point, but in the case of a planet or other
extended object, on account of the fact that the focal length of the tele-
scope increases as its aperture increases, the brightness of the image is
no greater with the large glass than with the small one. The image is,
however, four times as large, and this has a most important bearing
upon certain classes of observations, particularly in photographic and
spectroscopic work.

There remains still another peculiarity of the large lens as distin-
guished from the small one. On account of the nature of light, the
power that a lens possesses of separating two luminous points which
are so close together as to be seen as a Single object by the unaided eye
depends directly upon its aperture. Thus, if we consider a double star
the two components of which are separated by a distance of 0.5’ of are,
it will be barely possible with a 10-inch telescope to resolve the star
into two points of light just touching one another. If the members of
the pair are closer than this, they can not be separated with a 10-inch
glass, no matter whatmagnifying power is used. With a 40-inch tele-
scope, on the other hand, it is not only a simple matter to separate
Stars 0.5’ apart, but it is even possible to distinguish as two points of
light the components of a double star of only 0.12” separation.

To sum up, then, we see that the principal advantages of a 40-inch
object glass as compared with one of 10 inches aperture are, first, its
power. of giving much brighter star images, and thus of rendering
visible faint stars which can not be seen with the smaller telescopes;
second, the fact that it gives at its focus an image of any object, other
than a star, four times as large as the image given by a lens of one-
fourth its aperture and focal length; and, third, its capacity of render-
ing visible as separate objects the components of very close double
Stars or minute markings upon the surface of a planet or satellite.
Mention should be made here of the fact that the large glass assuredly
has some disadvantages as compared with the smaller one, particularly
in that it requires better atmospheric conditions to bring out its full
qualities. But [ think it will be seen from what follows that these dis-
advantages are by no means sufficient to offset the great advantages
possessed by the larger instrument, Let us now consider what practi-

sm 98——9

cal benefit the astronomer enjoys from the special properties of large
lenses which have just been enumerated.

Like other scientific men, astronomers who expect to accomplish
much of importance at the present day find it necessary to specialize,
and to devote their attention to certain classes of work in which long
study and experience have given them particular skill. Thus it is that
to some astronomers certain of the advantages of a large telescope
appeal much more strongly than do others. In fact, in order to derive
the best results from the use of the instrument it is necessary to have
observations made with it by men who are capable of bringing out its
best qualities in various kinds of investigation. Thus the first-men-
tioned property of rendering visible faint objects should be utilized by
an astronomer who has gained much experience in searching for and
measuring objects at the very limit of vision. One who has not given
special attention to this class of work would be surprised to see in a
large telescope certain of the faint stars or satellites of whose discov-
ery he may have read. When the fifth satellite of Jupiter was discov-
ered at the Lick Observatory by Professor Barnard, in 1892, claims
were put forward by certain amateur astronomers who possessed small
telescopes that they themselves were entitled to the honor of the dis-
covery, for they had seen the satellite long before. Such claims might
be taken in earnest by one unfamiliar with the instruments employed
by the respective observers. But it is only necessary to examine this
minute object with a 36-inch or a 40-inch telescope in order to appre-
ciate the great merit of the discovery and the absurdity of such claims
as have been mentioned. The tiny satellite is so faint that hitherto it
has been seen with very few telescopes, all of them having large aper-
tures. In its rapid motion close to the surface of the great planet it is
completely invisible to an eye unprotected from the brilliant hght of
Jupiter. ven the close approach of one of the other satellites is suf-
ficient to cause it to disappear. In measuring the satellite Professor
Barnard finds it necessary to reduce the light of Jupiter with a piece
of smoked mica, through which the planet is still clearly visible and
easily measurable, though not annoying to the eye. Without an
instrument like the Lick telescope the fifth satellite of Jupiter would
never have been known. It may be interesting to mention here that
Professor Barnard’s recent measures of this satellite with the Yerkes
telescope have shown that his original determination of the time of its
revolution in its orbit, made five years ago at Mount Hamilton, was not
in error more than 0.03 second. It was found that the time of elonga-
tion differed less than half a minute from the time predicted in the
Nautical Almanac. The period is now known within a few thousandths |
of a second. In this connection, also, it is well to add that Prof. Asaph
Hall’s discovery in 1877 of the two small satellites of Mars was directly
due to the advantage given him by the large aperture of the 26-inch
telescope at the United States Naval Observatory.
4

Such small members of the solar system are by no means the only
feebly luminous objects which great telescopes have brought to light.
Faint stars in the close proximity of bright ones are usually beyond
the reach of small telescopes. Thus the companion of Sirius was not
seen until 1862, when the late Alvan G. Clark encountered it jn his
tests of the 18-inch objective now at the Dearborn Observatory, which
was the largest glass that had been constructed up to that time. The
small companion to Procyon, discovered not long ago by Professor
Schaeberle with the Lick telescope, is another object of the same type.
These are conspicuous examples of that great class of objects known
as double stars, which consist of two stars revolving about their com-
mon center of gravity. From the third advantage of large instruments,
to which reference has already been made, it will be seen that they are
peculiarly adapted for the investigation of these binary systems, not
only because of their power to show faint objects in the neighborhood
of brighter ones, but also on account of their capacity to separate two
closely adjacent stars which in a smaller instrument would be seen as
one. Thanks to this property, many interesting binary systems whose
components are exceedingly close together have been found by Pro-
fessor Burnham with the Lick telescope, and, although he has devoted
no special attention to a search for such objects, Professor Barnard has
already encountered several of them in his work with the Yerkes
refractor. From what the spectroscope has taught us of binary sys-
tems, we have every reason to believe that telescopes may go on
increasing in aperture almost indefinitely without ever arriving at the
possibility of separating into their component parts all existing double
stars. As has been stated, the Yerkes telescope can show as distinct
objects stars which are no farther apart than 0.12” of arc, and on
account of the elongation of the image a double star whose compo-
nents are only 0.1’ apart can be distinguished from a single star. But
there undoubtedly exist stars far closer together than this, some of
which can be separated by an aperture of not less than 40 feet.

There has been much discussion in recent years regarding the rela-
tive advantage of large and small telescopes for observations of the
markings on planets. I do not propose to enter into the details of this
discussion, partly because my own investigations are primarily con-
cerned with observations of another nature, and thus have not espe-
cially qualified me to form an opinion on this point, and partly on
account of the fact that additional arguments in favor of large instru-
ments would serve little purpose. It seems to me only necessary for an
unprejudiced person to examine a planet first with a small telescope of
from 5 to 15 inches aperture, and then to look at the same object with

_ an instrument of 36 or 40 inches aperture, under identical atmospheric
conditions. When the seeing is distinctly bad, that is, when the
_ atmosphere is in so disturbed a state that the images are blurred and
unsteady, the smaller instrument will assuredly show all that can be

seen with the larger one. But with better atmospheric conditions, to
my eye at least, the advantage lies wholly on the side of the larger
instrument, whether the object be the moon, Jupiter, Mars, or Saturn.
In the case of the moon particularly, much fine detail which I have
never been able to see with the 12-inch telescope is clearly and beauti- —
fully visible with the 40-inch. I am certainly inclined to think that
large telescopes are greatly to be preferred to small ones for work of
this character. But I give much less weight to my own opinion on this
subject than to that of Professor Barnard, who for many years has.
observed the planets with instruments varying in size from a 5-inch
telescope to the 36-inch on Mount Hamilton, and the 40-inch of the
Yerkes Observatory. He believes a large aperture to be immeasurably
superior to a small one for these observations. This seems to me quite
sufficient to settle the question, for it would be difficult to name a bet-
ter authority.

One incidental advantage of such an instrument as the 40-inch tele-
scope, which depends to a great degree upon the stability of its mount-
ing, is the ease and certainty with which micrometrical measures can
be effected. Since the telescope was first ready for regular use last
September, Professor Barnard has made with it a long series of micro-
metrical measures, which have included such objects as the satellite of
Neptune, the companion to Procyon, and the fifth satellite of Jupiter.
The precision of these measures is most satisfactory, and lends special
interest to an attempt which he has made to determine the parallax of
the nebula N. G. C. 404, which is in the field with the bright star /
Andromede. This object has a definite condensation, which permits
its position to be accurately determined with reference to a number of
stars in the neighborhood. A long series of measures, covering a period
of five months, have led to the conclusion that the nebula can not pos-
sess a parallax as great as half a second of arc, and, therefore, can not
be nearer the earth than about four hundred thousand times the distance
from the earth to the sun.

Mention should be made of one more interesting observation by Pro-
fessor Barnard, which would have been much more difficult with a small
telescope. It will be remembered that in the valuable work which Pro-
fessor Bailey has been doing at the station of the Harvard College
Observatory in Arequipa, Peru, excellent photographs were obtained
of southern star clusters, which show that these clusters contain an
extraordinary number of variable stars. Not only do scores of stars in
a single cluster vary in their light, but the change is exceedingly rapid,
occupying in some instances only a few hours. So far as I know, none
of these remarkable variations had been seen visually until Professor
Barnard undertook the systematic observation of one of the clusters
with the 40-inch telescope. On account of the large scale of the images,
he is able to distinctly see stars in the cluster without confusing them
with others in their neighborhood, and has thus been enabled to follow
THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES. Las

their changes in brightness. In this way he has confirmed the varia-
bility of many of the stars on Mr. Bailey’s photographs. There are few
more remarkable objects in the heavens than these magnificent star
clusters, so many members of which are subject to fluctuation in their

‘light. Professor Bailey’s discovery is the more noteworthy considering

i;

the fact that such an object as the great cluster in Hercules contains
not more than two or three variable stars, while the Harvard plates
show that the cluster Messier 3 contains 132 variables. This is only
one instance out of many of the striking efficiency of the photographic
work which is being carried on under Professor Pickering’s able
direction.

It may be well to introduce here a few words regarding the magnify-
ing powers employed in actual observations. The optimistic writer
who is planning to photograph houses on Mars believes that his recent
invention will render possible the use of powers as high as a million
diameters, and even greater, so that if men exist upon the planets they
can easily be seen. Astronomers know nothing of such powers in
practice. For double-star observations, with the largest telescope and
under the most perfect conditions, powers as high as 3,700 diameters
have occasionally been used. But in regular work it is not a common
thing to exceed 2,700 diameters. Under very exceptional circuin-
stances the moon might perhaps be well seen when magnified 2,000
diameters, but this would be an extreme case, and in general a much
better view could be had with powers ranging from 500 to 1,000.
Jupiter can rarely be well seen with a power greater than four or five
hundred, though Saturn will stand considerably higher magnification.
Mars is best seen with a power of five or six hundred. With small
telescopes lower powers are generally used. The difficulty is not in
finding optical means to increase the magnification, as some of these
newspaper writers seem to imagine. It is rather a question of being
able to see anything but a confused luminous object after the high eye-
pieces had been applied. The more or less disturbed condition of the
earth’s atmosphere is mainly responsible for this, but it is doubtful
whether, with even perfect conditions, such an object as Jupiter could
be advantageously submitted to great magnification.

During the present century there has grown up side by side with
astronomy, to which it in fact owes its existence, the new science of
astrophysics. Ina broad sense this science may properly be classed
as a department of astronomy, but at the present time its interests are
so manifold, its methods so distinct, and its relationship to pure
physics so pronounced, that it may fairly claim to be considered by
itself as a coordinate branch of science. While astronomy deals more
especially with the positions and motions of the heavenly bodies, it is
the province of astrophysics to inquire into their nature and to search
out the causes for the peculiar celestial phenomena which the special
instruments at the disposal of the astrophysicist bring to light. It
134 THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES.

should be added that no hard and fast line can be drawn between
astronomy and astrophysics, as one of the principal problems of the
latter subject involves just such determinations of motion as are par-
ticularly to be desired for the purposes of the astronomy of position.
The subjects are thus intimately related and closely bound together,
and the bond between astrophysics and physics is hardly less strong.
They should thus be cultivated together, so that they may mutually
assist one another in bringing about the solution of the varied problems
with which they are concerned.

It is particularly in astrophysical research that a great telescope is
advantageous. For the principal instrument of the astrophysicist, the
spectroscope, it is necessary to have as much light as can be gathered
into a single point. With sufficient light the chemical analysis of the
most distant star resolves itself into a comparatively simple problem.
But with smali telescopes, and consequently faint star images, such
analysis, except of a roughly approximate character, is impossible with
the less brilliant stars.

One of the principal problems of the astrophysicist is to determine
the course of celestial evolution. It has been found that the spectra of
stars are susceptible of classification in a few well-defined types, which
seem to correspond with different periods in stellar development.
Starting from the great cloudlike masses of the nebuli, it is supposed
that stars begin to form in regions of condensation, and that the great
masses of gas and vapor continue to contract under the action of gravi-
tation, meanwhile radiating heat into space. It is known from theo- |
retical investigations that such cooling gaseous masses not only con-
tinue to grow smaller; they also rise in temperature with the advance
of time. Tf inally a certain point in their career is reached when the rise
in temperature ceases, though the contraction of the mass is not
arrested. The balls of condensing vapors continue to cool, losing more
and more heat, and becoming smaller and smaller in diameter. It is
perhaps at about this period in their history that they pass through
such a stage as is now exemplified by the sun, which has presumably
cooled from the condition of a white star like Sirius to that of a star of
the second or yellow class. Thé spectra of such hot stars as Sirius con-
tain little more than dark and exceedingly broad lines, grouped in rhyth-
mical order and due to the gas hydrogen. As these bodies continue to
cool, the strong lines of hydrogen become less prominent, and lines due
to metallic substances begin to appear. These become more and more
striking, until finally we reach such a type of spectrum as that of
Procyon, which is intermediate in character between the Sirian and the
solar stars. From this point on we find a continual approach to the
solar type, until at last stars are reached whose spectra agree line for
line with that of the sun. After passing through the condition of
the central body of the solar system, the yellow and orange color of
the stars becomes more pronounced, and subsequently a reddish tinge
F
:

THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES. 135

appears, until finally stars of a deep red color are found, which seem to
mark the last stage of development before complete extinction of light.
Through a part of this line of evolution it is easy to trace the changes
in stellar spectra, the solar lines still continuing to be present, and
Superposed upon them a remarkable series of flutings which are charac-
teristic of these reddish stars of the third class. But between such
stars and those of the class which Vogel has designated as IIIb there
seems to be a break in the evolutionary chain.

Stars of Class IIIb are of an orange or red color, and with the tele-
scope alone some of them can not be distinguished in appearance from

_ the more fully developed stars of Class IIJa. But in the spectroscope

they are entirely different. All of these objects are extremely faint,
the two brightest of them being hardly visible to the naked eye. For

this reason but little has been learned of their spectra, although the

spectra of stars like Vega and Arcturus, which are some scores of-times
more brilliant, have been carefully investigated by both visual and
photographic means. According to Dunér and others, the spectrum of
the star known as 152 Schjellerup consists of certain heavy, dark bands,
which coincide closely in position with bands given by compounds of
carbon, and, in addition to these, a luminous zone in the orange portion
of the spectrum. Three or four of the most intense solar lines have
also been detected in these objects. But beyond this it is impossible to
go with the appliances used in the earlier investigations, although it
may well be that photographic methods would have greatly changed
the character of the results obtained.

During the past winter a photographic study of the red stars has
been rendered possible by the 40-inch Yerkes telescope. Photographs
of the spectra of many objects of this class have now been obtained,
and many lines which were not previously recognized on account of the
faintness of the spectrum in small telescopes have been recorded. In
the case of two stars of Class IIIb, 132 and 152 Schjellerup, the spectra
have been photographed with a powerful spectrograph containing three
prisms, giving high dispersion and considerable precision to the meas-
ures. It has been found that among the most characteristic features of
these spectra are numerous bright lines, some of which seem to have
been glimpsed by Secchi in his pioneer work at the Collegio Romano,
though his drawings do not correctly represent their appearance or posi-
tion. In fact, he recorded bright lines where none exist, and failed to
record others, among which are tlre brightest in the spectra. Both
Dunér and Vogel, who are certainly to be regarded as the best authori-
ties on the subject, altogether deny the presence of bright lines. And
had my own observations been contined to an examination of the spectra
with the instruments used by these observers I wonld unhesitatingly
subscribe to their opinion. But the great light-collecting power of the
40-inch telescope renders the detection of the bright lines a compara-
tively easy matter. Even with this instrument, visual observations with

the low-dispersion spectroscopes used by Dunér and Vogel would hardly
show them, but they are easily seen with a three-prism spectroscope,
and they have been repeatedly photographed with one and with three
prisms. Some of these photographs have been measured and the wave
lengths of the bright and dark lines determined. A comparison of the
results with those obtained for other types of stellar spectra suggests
certain interesting relationships, which, if confirmed by subsequent
work, will be of service in tracing the course of stellar evolution.

This is only a single instance of the advantage for stellar spectro-
scopic work of the great light-collecting power of large telescopes,
but it would be easy to multiply examples. Our knowledge of the
peculiar spectra of the stars of the Wolf-Rayet class, all of which are,
found in the Milky Way or its branches, is due in large part to the
visual and photographic study of these faint objects made by Pro-
fessor Campbell with the Lick telescope. In the able hands of Profes-
sor Keeler, whose recent election to the directorship of the Lick
Observatory is so truly a cause for congratulation, the same powerful
instrument rendered possible the determination of the motion in the
line of sight of the planetary nebulae. We may well be confident that
the future record of the great telescope on Mount Hamilton will be
marked by many similar advances.

Imight profitably go on to speak of the advantages of large tele-
scopes for the study of the sun, for in no field of research can they be
better employed. In photographing the solar faculze with the spectro-
heliograph the large image given by a great telescope is particularly
useful for purposes of measurement, as well as for the study of the form
and distribution of these phenomena. Prominences, too, whether of
the quiescent or eruptive class, are best photographed on a large scale.
With a large image it may also become possible, under good atmos-
pherie conditions, to photograph some of the delicate details in the
chromosphere, which, witha small solar image, would be wholly beyond
the reach of the photographie method. It is probably in the study of
the spectrum of the chromosphere, however, that one best perceives
the advantage of a large instrument as compared with a small one.
Recent experience has made this very clearly evident, for with the
40-inch Yerkes telescope it has been possible to see in the chromospheric
spectrum a great number of faint bright lines which were wholly beyond
the reach of the 12-inch telescope used in my previous investigations.
In this way it has been found that carbon vapor exists in the vaporous
sea which covers the brilliant surface of the photosphere.

Tt will be admitted, I think, from what has been said, that great tel-
escopes really have a mission to perform. While, on the one hand, they
are not endowed with the almost miraculous gifts which imaginative
persons would place to their credit, they do possess properties which
render them much superior to smaller instruments and well worth
all the expenditure their construction has involved. In answering the
THE FUNCTION OF LARGE TELESCOPES. 137

‘question, “Do large telescopes pay?” it is simply a matter of deter-

mining whether the work which can not be done without the aid of such
telescopes is really worth doing. No one who is familiar with this work
is likely to deny that it is worth all the money and time and labor that
can be devoted to it. I therefore confidently believe that the generous
benefactions which during the last quarter century have permitted the
erection of large telescopes in various parts of the world have been
wisely directed, and that further sums might well be expended, partic-
ularly in the Southern Hemisphere, in the establishment of still more
powerful instruments.
THE LE SAGE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

[Translation by C. G. ABBorT, with introductory note by S. P. LANGLEY. ]
INTRODUCTION.

Le Sage’s paper is one much oftener referred to than directly quoted
from or read, and this is partly because the original is very little
known, although it is in no more obscure a place than the Memoirs of
the Berlin Academy, printed in the year 1684.

Le Sage appears to have been one of the academicians who, though
in the capital of Prussia, were bound to write French of any sort rather
than German, and it is only fair to the present translator to say that
certain passages of the original hold the meaning of the author so
securely hidden that it is doubtful if anyone could render them into
English with entire confidence that their whole meaning had been
grasped. Whatever the original obscurity, however, the translation, I
believe, means something definite and, I hope, true.

The reader will recall that at the time when Le Sage wrote, the
corpuscular theory of light was universally accepted, the laws of the
conservation of energy and of matter were as yet unknown, and the
kinetic theory of gases was quite beyond the scientific horizon. Hence
it is a matter for surprise, not that Le Sage introduces in explanation
of the difficulties met with hypotheses now in a form appearing some-
what crude, though doubtless still conceivable, but rather that his
statement requires so little modification to fit it to the thought of the
present day.

Some of the great objections made to Le Sage’s theory, such as the
supposed impossibility of this shower of his atoms acting with equal
effect in the interior of the densest bodies as on the surface, are made
in probable ignorance of how entirely satisfactory the hypothesis of the
author is in this respect; I mean so far as the use of the mathematical
infinity can render it so; while other difficulties have been, if not
cleared up, at least rendered less formidable by the advance of modern
knowledge, which is on the whole clearly making more for the hypoth-
esis than against, if we put it in the form in which Le Sage would
doubtless put it were he living now.

Thus the objection of the hypothesis of countless atoms coming from
and going to infinity, to the dissipation of their kinetic energy into
heat upon impact with solids—this latter class of objections seems to
have been very generally met in recent years. Thus it has been made

139

evident that the particles in question could vibrate in long closed paths
with the same effect as if they came in from outer space and returned
to it in straight lines, as the author originally supposed; and as to their
infinitesimal smallness, our purely physical conceptions of space and
even of time are not only ‘still, as is well known, relative, but have
received a curious extension since Le Sage wrote, so that our limit of
the physically infinitesimal has been pushed farther back by studies
into the nature of the molecule and the atom until we have before
us actual things of an order of magnitude incomparably below anything
known to the physicists of our author’s time.

On the whole, then, the tenor of modern thought goes in the direc-
tion in which we are led by this theory, if by that we understand it,
not in its first crude enunciations, but with the modifications which
can now be legitimately associated with it, and which tend to make it
both more suggestive and to maintain a continued interest in it—an
interest which seems to justify the present publication of a paper with
which so few are familiar at first hand.

THE NEWTONIAN LUCRETIUS.!

By M. LE SAGE.

[Read by M. Prevost at a meeting of the Berlin Academy in 1682. ]

‘Tn all branches of knowledge the earliest systems are too limited, too narrow,
too timid; and it would even seem that the prize of truth is only won by a certain
audacity of reason.”—Fontenelle, in eulogy of Cassini.

THE AIM OF THIS MEMOIR.

I propose to show that if the earliest? Epicureans had possessed as
just ideas on cosmography as those of several of their contemporaries,
which they neglected, and but a portion of the knowledge of geometry
which had then been attained, they would in all probability have easily
discovered the laws of universal gravitation and its mechanical cause.
Laws, whose discovery and demonstration are the greatest glory of the
mightiest genius that has ever lived; and cause, whose comprehension
has long been the object of ambition of the greatest physicists, and is
now the stumbling block of their successors. Such things, for example,
as the famous Kepler’s laws—discovered scarcely two centuries ago, and
founded in part upon gratuitous conjectures and in part upon tedious
gropings—would have been nothing but special inevitable corollaries of
the general knowledge which the ancient philosophers could easily draw
from nature’s own mechanism. This conclusion is entirely applicable
to Galileo’s laws on falling bodies, whose discovery has been still slower
and more contested. Moreover, the experiments by which this discovery
was established were so crude that they left the way open to interpre-
tations which rendered them equally compatible with several other
hypotheses,’? which were in fact urged against him. On the other hand,

*I say only the earliest; for after a system has survived several centuries it leads
men to the one or the other of two extremes. Some reject everything pertaining to
the system disdainfully, while others, on the contrary, embrace reverently all its
traditions, without offering to make the least correction. It is this latter faction
who have adopted the atoms of Epicurus, Lucretius, Gassendi, and all the intervening
picuneaMss.  s~.)*

3One of these hypotheses was that the total time being as the arc of a certain
circle, the total distance fallen through was as the versed sine of this arc. Now if
the magnitude of this circle had been better chosen, I do not see how one would be
able to refute this hypothesis, starting from the simple phenomena.

142 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

the consequences of the theory of atomic collisions would have been
unequivocally in favor of the sole right interpretation (equal accelera-
tions in equal times).

The union of the several branches of this conclusion forms not only
a philosophic truth of extreme interest, but one from which a very
useful consequence may be drawn, which is that in spite of the greater
weight due to a posteriori researches a priori ones are not to be wholly
neglected, since they may greatly accelerate the success of the former.
Already some impartial philosophers are agreed that such conjectures
if lucid and capable of evaluation might be useful to the most rigorous
physicists, were it only in suggesting to them definite points of view
from which to direct experiment, in the place of that indecision in which
the mere vague wish for new investigation has often left them.

Let us clearly understand that such speculation is only permissible
for the sake of occupation when the skill and patience which new
observation and experiment require are lacking. We ought to be
thoroughly informed as to all previous observations and experiments
on the subject and to keep these steadily in view in forming hypotheses,
which are to be tested by them with the aid of every help that mathe-
matics can give in examining as to the exactness of their agreement.

Finally, it is such an agreement rather than any elaboration of method
which brings conviction to most students of any physical theory, and
this whether they are aware of this agreement before their acquaintance
with these methods or whether a study of the method led them i the
agreement.

1b,

If the disciples of Epicurus had been as fully persuaded of the
sphericity of the earth! as they were of its flatness,? then instead of
conceiving their atoms to move in nearly parallel paths, as was suited
to a directive force perpendicular to a plane surface, they would
undoubtedly have attributed to them motion normal to the surface of
a sphere, and consequently directed at all points toward its center.’
An example of such a condition as I have in mind would be furnished
if it hailed simultaneously in all the countries of the earth.

1Plato and Aristotle had discoursed at great length upon the sphericity of the
earth; Archimedes and Aristarchus had assumed it; Thales and Zeno had taught it,
and all the astronomers believed it. (See the Tiaeatle of Plato, the close of the
second book of Aristotle upon the Heavens, the Hour-Glass of Archimedes, and the
tenth chapter of the third book of Plutarch upon the Opinions of the EHecopheca :

2Neither Epicurus nor Lucretius discovered the figure of the earth. But it seems
probable that they conformed to the opinions of Democritus upon all questions where
they did not expressly oppose him. Moreover, Gassendi (in his Commentaries on
Epicurus, p. 213 of the edition of 1649) alleges strong reasons “for believing that
they supposed the earth’s surface to be flat.

The following objection would of course have been raised by some to
this view: Part of these atoms must necessarily encounter the moon
before reaching the earth, and by their pelting would push her toward
us; and on the other hand the force exerted upon those terrestrial
objects which she shields would be less because of her interposition.
Consequently we ought to see the moon descending and a part of the
waters of the ocean rising to meet her, as if rendered lighter by the
interception of the atoms, and consequently yielding their place to the
adjacent waters.! In view of these objections the Epicureans would
have had to see if some phenomenon of this nature did not really exist.
They would have answered their opponents that the moon did not
recede from us on a tangent, but really did approach the earth at each
instant, and that the alternating motions of the ocean, so accordant
with those of the moon, exhibited this very effect in question, due to
the inequality introduced in the stream of atoms by the interposition

of this great body.
ITI.

The example of a pebble projected horizontally, which circulates for
a few moments about the earth before falling, and longer in proportion
as the motion is more rapid, would have made it clear that the moon,
which occupies but a month in such a great journey, might not of
necessity actually approach the earth except in the sense of being
nearer than if she had gone off on a tangent.

TV.

A persistent antagonist, fortified by some theorems of centrifugal
force similar to those of Huygens (which are easily demonstrated by
elementary geometry for polygonal orbits such as would result from
intermittent collisions) might further have objected that the motion of
the moon was still 60 times too slow? to prevent her actual approach
to us, taking into consideration the very considerable force of gravita-
tion found at the surface of the earth. Upon this the Epicureans
would not have been slow to reply that since the distance from the

1 This is not precisely the actual state of affairs, but it is thus that the case would
present itself at first view. As an exact recognition of the laws of this phenomenon
would be more slowly acquired than an exact knowledge of the laws of atomism,
there would never be a time when that theory would have been found at fault in
this respect.

21f the force of gravitation were the same at all distances, the period would be
reciprocally proportional to the square root of the distance (Hugenii Theor. IV.)
instead of to the three halves power as follows from the Newtonian law (Phil. nat.
Prine. Math. Prop. IV. Cor.6). Then the period of the moon, as compared with that of
a body revolving at the surface of the earth, would be expressed by 7/60 instead of

60 Y 60, the value derived from the Newtonian law of gravitation.
144 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

moon to the center of our globe is 60 times as great as our distance
from this same center, the spherical surface having the radius of the
moon’s orbit is 3,600 times as great as that of the earth. So that if
the outer surface were traversed by the same number of atoms as the
inner, their distribution would be 3,600 times rarer, and they would
in consequence cause a gravitation 3,600 times less. This would be
exactly that required by the theorems,! for this gravitating force would
suffice to sustain at a distance 60 times as great a moving body whose
absolute velocity was /60 times less than’ that required by a body
revolving at the surface of the earth.

Ve

The parallelism of path which Epicurus had introduced in the atomic
theory of Leucippus and Democritus was not exact, since had it been
so these atoms, all moving with equal velocity, could never have come in
collision. But Epicurus required that they should collide in order that
he might explain the formation of compound bodies without assuming
the intervention of a superior cause. Hence he supposed the paths of
the atoms to be slightly inclined to each other, and it is well known that
the introduction of the correction subjected him to many pleasantries
and objections from philosophers of other sects.

WAL

If, however, Epicurus had embraced the doctrine of the convergence ~
of the atoms toward a center, undoubtedly his opponents would have
attacked this hypothesis quite as vigorously. The Epicureans in reply-
ing would have been able? to explain this convergence by returning to
the system of Leucippus and Democritus as follows: Imagine the atoms
to move fortuitously in every direction, and let us trace the result in

‘ Combine the second and third theorems of Huygens published in 1673 following
his Horologium oscillatorium.

2It was natural enough to greatly diversify this motion which tended to deflect
the atoms. R

Lucretius, even, despite his devotion to Epicurus, expressed himself several times
conformably to the system of Democritus. His first book with the first 216 lines of
the second ignored the imperfect parallelism that he lent to the paths of the atoms,
for instead of speaking of this parallelism he seems to say three times that they
come from all directions (undique, lines 986, 1041, and 1050), that they waver (voli-
tare, 951), trying several kinds of collisions (multimodis plagis, 1023 and 1024), essay-
ing all kinds of movements (omne genus motztis, 1025), finding room to advance in
whatever direction they move (motis quacumque feruntur, 1075). He adds, in the
second book, that they wander in space (per Inane vagantur, line 82), that they are
agitated by various movements (varioque exercita motu, 96), and that all those
which have not been able to associate themselves together to form great masses are
always agitated in the great void (in magno jactari semper Inani, 121) in the same
way as the dust that one sees in a dark chamber into which the sun’s rays penetrate
is moved about in all directions (nune hie nunc illic, in cunctas denique parties,
130). Finaliy, several of his commentators convey the same idea.
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 145

the case of a body near the earth. All the atoms coming toward the
body from the direction of the earth would be cut off by it, while from
all other directions the body would be subjected to uninterrupted bom-
bardment. Consequently there would be a resultant motion of the
earth, that is in the line of diminished resistance, and this resultant
motion would be exactly the same as if the bombarding atoms all con-
verged toward the earth’s center instead of moving fortuitously.

WEED:

The Epicureans would have even seized with avidity upon this ocea-
sion to give an air of disorder to the primitive movements of the uni-
verse. For this would accord the better with their system of the ori-
gin of things (otherwise sufficiently absurd and impious) that there was
no appearance of parallelism, perfect or imperfect, whereas all tend-
ency to parallelism would appear to be the result of some particular
design, and consequently to indicate the operation of some intelligent
being.

VE:

I speak of disorder in connection with primitive movements only.
The resultant motion of bodies having inertia would be directed toward
the center of our globe with great exactness, in consequence of the
combination of a vast number of impulses in different directions. For
it is a well-known result of the doctrine of chances that minor irregu-
larities, when in great number, mutually compensate each other
exactly, so that each several inequality becomes imperceptible in its

effect upon the resultant.
UXe:

Still another consideration would have led the atomists to make this
same modification of the direction of motion of the gravitational atoms.
All will agree with me that they were certain to have met with one or
other of these two objections or to have themselves raised them. As the
earth revolves without cessation about the sun,! the hypothesis that

1 Democritus was a century and a half later than Pythagoras, who had secretly
taught the revolution of the earth. He might even have seen Philolaus who more
openly proclaimed it, and Timzeus who appears to have had the same belief. He
ought also to have been informed of the opinion of the Pythagoreans upon the sub-
ject, for Heraclides had been of this sect before he listened to Plato and Aristotle,
and he maintained at least that the earth rotated about its center. According to the
report of Diogenes, Laertius, and of Porphyry, Democritus had attended the teach-
ing of the Pythagoreans; and besides, the Eleatic sect (if one may credit Strabo)
was nothing but an offshoot of the Italic. Finally, the atomists, following Demo-
eritus, would have had opportunity to be even better instructed than he in regard
to the earth’s motion. For this doctrine was supported by a multitude of philoso-
phers of all countries, among whom the principal names, in addition to those already
cited, are Archimedes and Nicetas, of Syracuse; Aristarchus and Cleanthus, of Samos;
Architas, of Tarento; Seleucus, Eophantus, and even (according to Theophrastus)
Plato in his later years.

sm 98 10

all the atoms are directed toward the center of the earth would have
required that each new shower of atoms must seek it in a different
direction from that followed by the shower next preceding, a condition
not in accord with the predilection of the sect of the Epicureans for
the operations of chance, nor with their antipathy for occult qualities

Xx.

In order to extricate themselves from this difficulty the atomists
would necessarily have rejoined that there was no place in the heavens,
equal in dimension to the earth, toward which there did not advance
in a given time quite as many atoms as our planet encounters in the
same portion of time, and that these other atoms were in motion exactly
like those encountered by the earth. Not that there was any particular
relation between places and the streams setting toward them, but, since
it was essentially a confused movement, equal areas must naturally
intercept, one equally as much as another, the paths of the atoms
which blindly traverse space; and in consequence they must be equally
exposed to their visits.

XI.

When once the Epicureans were thus come to explain the matter so
neatly, the most thoughtful and curious among them would certainly
have followed out the consequences which could be easily deduced from
this hypothesis, and they would necessarily have arrived at the follow-
ing propositions:

1. The atoms which pass to one side of any central body contribute
nothing to the force of gravitation which it exercises toward other
bodies, for such atoms are exactly counterbalanced by direct antagonists.
Gravitation would be due solely to those atoms which are fortuitously
directed toward the central body. As we have seen, the resultant
action of these atoms is everywhere directed toward the central body,
like the rays of light converging toward a focus when assembled by a
convex lens or a concave mirror. Hence, it is proper to apply to them
what has been proven in Paragraph [V touching the terrestrial gravi-
tation; that is to say, their gravitational effect is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance of the attracted body from the
central body.

2. The gravitational atoms are directed not only toward the centers
of the greater bodies, but toward each of their particles as well, since
they move indiscriminately in all directions in space. The atoms,
moreover, act effectively in those directions in which their antagonists
are intercepted; that is to say, in all directions in which there are
particles of matter. Therefore they tend to move the heavy masses
which they encounter not toward the heavenly bodies in gross, but
toward each of their particles in detail. Hence the gravitation of
masses toward the center of a celestial body is nothing but the result-
s’

THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 147

ant of an imperceptible movement of the masses toward all parts of
the great body (as, from certain passages of Cicero and Plutarch, it
appears had been before supposed by some of the ancients). Conse-
quently this gravitation would be proportional to the number of the
particles; that is to say, to the mass of the central body.

Now from these two propositions alone there might have been deduced
synthetically the entire theory of universal gravitation without further
mention of gravitational atoms.

XII.

This is the place to insert a certain proposition which is commonly
spoken of as if it were distinct from those which teach that gravitation
is universal, but which appears to me to be included in that expression.
I refer to that which affirms that gravitation is mutual or reciprocal;
or, in other words, that it is subject to the ancient law of mechanics,
which states that action and reaction are equal.

I say that this is the place to consider this proposition, because it can
equally well be proved either through the introduction of the agent of
gravitation, as I have done in preceding paragraphs, or by considering
gravitation abstractly, as I shall do in those which follow. This propo-
sition therefore forms, as it were, a gradation between those which I
have established by the first method and those which I shall establish
by the second.

First method: Inasmuch as one body is pushed toward another by
the atoms which the second body has deprived of direct antagonists,
while the latter body is pushed toward the former by these same antag-
onists, the two bodies are necessarily pushed toward each other with
equal force, whatever be the inequality of their masses or the differences
in their forms.

Second method: Since each particle of one of the two bodies tends
toward every particle of the other, the first body is urged toward the
second with a force proportional to the number of particles which the
second contains, or, in other words, with a force proportional to the mass
of the second. Furthermore, since the impetus or momentum of the
first body is the summation of the impetus of its separate particles, it
is proportional to the total mass of the first body. ‘Thus it follows that
the impetus of the first body is proportional to the product of the
masses of the two bodies.

By a similar train of reasoning the impetus of the second body is
also proportional to this product. Therefore the usual bodies are urged
together with equal forces.

XII.
I am now in a position to examine what other consequences the

ancients would probably have drawn from the principle of a mutual
gravitation directly proportional to the masses and varying inversely
148 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

as the square of the distance. For the sake of brevity the mechanical
cause may be left out of consideration in the discussion.

As these philosophers would have foreseen many difficulties in rigor-
ously testing every consequence to see if it coincided exactly with
observation, and would therefore have refrained from embarking upon
so serious a task before perceiving that the deductions accorded in gross
with the results of experience, I presume they would not seriously have
applied geometry and computation to this gravitation without having
first determined by simple reasonings what, approximately, would be
the effects flowing from it, and seeing that these conjectures accorded
roughly with the real constitution of the universe! I believe I do no
violence to probabilities in presuming that the ancient philosophers
would have been acquainted with some such reasonings. Having fewer
matters than we to distract their attention, they were able to make very
exact deductions in subjects requiring nothing but meditation. With
reference to the acquired knowledge which would be needed in such
reasonings, it will be recalled that the theory of conic sections had
been discovered and cultivated before the birth of Epicurus, that
Archimedes had made great advance in the doctrine of centers of
gravity, and that the ancient geometers, and especially the last named,
employed approximations with great ingenuity when they were unable
to attain to rigorous precision.

XIV.

Encouraged by these first successes and animated by the grandeur of
the enterprise it is highly improbable that these ardent and subtile
geometers” would have stopped here. They would doubtless have
invented for the purpose some means for passing from the ratio of sensi-
ble quantities to that of their imperceptible elements, and conversely
from elementary quantities to their summation, at least for the simple
case required when one wishes to avoid the numerical computation of
the small anomalies of the movements of the celestial bodies.

1] had intended to insert here some preliminary observations which the atomists
would probably have made. I had collected them in part from various researches
(or incidental points) made by good geometers who have undertaken to illustrate to
readers but little advanced in mathematics some of the truths of physical astronomy.
The remainder were from notes of lectures which I have myself given upon these
matters. ButI have omitted this digression on account of its length. Perhaps 1
may be permitted to remark that these elementary tests may be rendered very con-
vincing, although some of them presuppose so little knowledge of geometry that
they may even be stated without reference to figures.

2Tt should be borne in mind that we are not here speaking of the Epicureans as
some have really been—that is to say of a nature decidedly lazy and consequently
ignorant of astronomy and physics—but of philosophers simply, Epicureans as
respecting the fundamental propositions of physics only, but resembling rather their
contemporaries of other sects in general enlightenment and taste for research. Such
a supposed character for these philosophers is by no means forced, since the physical
and speculative dogmas of Epicurus did not necessarily entail his moral precepts and
practices.
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 149

Certainly they had sufficient patience and sagacity to succeed in
finding such a method, since they had had enough of these qualities to
discover and advance in considerable degree the admirable doctrine of
incommensurables, and of exhaustions, although these were not ordi-
narily used except in the consideration of the five regular bodies, and
were specially derived, it is said, to examine certain very hazardous and
even fantastic conjectures of the Pythagoreans and Platonists.

XV.

Practically, if one omits from the theory of central forces those curi-
ous propositions and generalizations which can only be regarded as its
luxuries, as well as the delicate evaluations which are required only for
the perfecting of astronomical tables, all the rest may be demonstrated
sufficiently for the uses of the physicist by the aid of lemmas less exact
and universal than those of the calculus.

This has indeed been pointed out in some degree by several geome-
ters, but it may be realized still further if the reader will undertake by
the same or analogous means of simplification to attack other proposi-
tions than those already so treated.

But the probability that the ancients would have been able to accom-
plish such demonstrations is still less necessary to the plan which I
have proposed to myself, as stated at the beginning of this essay, than
the probability that they would have discovered the simple relations
mentioned in the thirteenth paragraph. Consequently the reader may,
if he prefers, ignore the last three paragraphs and give attention only
to matters which I have expressly engaged to establish.

XVI.

I declared that the laws of Kepler were necessary consequences of
the doctrine that gravitation results from the impulsion of atoms movy-
ing In every direction, since Kepler’s laws follow directly from those of
Newton. I ought, however, to show, for the benefit of readers less
versed in the matter, where it may be found proved that the first-men-
tioned laws are the natural consequences of the second.

First. That the law of areas proportional to times is a necessary con-
sequence of gravitation, always directed toward a single point, is dem-
onstrated by elementary geometry in the first proposition of Newton’s
Principia.

Second. That the law of squares of periodic times proportional to the
cubes of the distances, for bodies appearing to describe circles, must
necessarily follow from a gravitation inversely proportional to the square
of the distance constitutes the second part of the sixth corollary to
Proposition IV of the same work, and may be demonstrated by ele-
mentary methods also for regular polygons, which represent more nearly
than exact circles the orbits traversed by bodies diverted slightly from
their paths by intermittent collisions.
150 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

Third. That the ellipticity of an orbit is the necessary consequence
of gravitation directed toward its focus, and reciprocally proportional
to the square of the distance, is the converse of Proposition XI of the
same book. This proposition has been more simply demonstrated as a
consequence of the fiftieth of Book III of the conics of Appolonius.

I may pause here, since in maintaining that the laws of Kepler are
an easy consequence of the system of atoms I have not pretended that
their application to complex cases readily follows from the slight knowl-
edge of geometry possessed by the ancients. Nevertheless, I may add—

Fourth. That the Proposition XI of the Principia once attained it
does not appear to me difficult to establish the fiftieth, which extends
our second consequences to ellipses—that is to say, which proves that
in ellipses as well, the squares of the periodic times about an attracting
body (placed in one of the foci) are proportional to the cubes of the

‘mean distances.
XVII.

Let us now see how the laws of Galileo may be derived from the
hypothesis of the impulsion of the atoms.

The blows of corpuscles, moving with a velocity more rapid than
light, upon a body which has fallen three or four seconds, would be sen-
sibly of the same strength as the preceding blows had been upon the
same body when it had only fallen one or two seconds.' Hence the suc-
cessive accelerations of the body in equal times must be sensibly equal,
and the velocity at any instant must be sensibly proportional to the
time elapsed since the beginning of the fall. From this it follows neces-
sarily that the spaces traversed since the beginning are sensibly pro-
portional to the squares of the total times,? and will be sensibly pro-
portional to the succeesive odd numbers.

' To assign to these corpuscles the velocity of sound even would be sufficient. For
the velocity of sound is more than thirty-four times as rapid as that of a body which
has fallen one second, or more than seventeen times as great as that of one that has
fallen two seconds, etc. Hence with the increasing velocity of the falling body the
accelerating impulses impressed by the corpuscles would be more feeble than at the
beginning of the fall by one thirty-fourth at the end of one second, by two thirty-
fourths at the end of two seconds, etc. This gradual decrease of acceleration would
not be perceived in the longest times of fall which are ordinarily measured. How
much less therefore would they be perceived if we assume for the corpuscles the
velocity of light, which is nine hundred thousand times as great as that of sound.

2 Demonstration: I divide the two times which are to be compared into an equal
number of parts, so small that the body may be conceived as falling with equal
rapidity during the whole duration of one of these parts. And I observe that the
two bodies which are compared will have, at the beginning of each of the corre-
sponding parts of the two times, velocities proportional to the times then elapsed,
and consequently to the entire times. Hence the small spaces traversed at these cor-
responding instants will be traversed with a velocity proportional to the times com-
pared.

But the elementary spaces fallen through will be proportional not only to the
velocities with which they are traversed, but also to the portions of time occupied
in traversing them, and consequently to the whole times. Therefore the small cor-

These synthetic demonstrations of laws of falling bodies by the intro-
duction of mechanism whose existence is only surmised, may perhaps
be less philosophical than analytic demonstrations which are based
entirely upon observed phenomena. Still it must be recalled that in
cases where direct observation has been difficult and inexact, error has
frequently attended deductions of this latter kind. At all events the
former kind of demonstration is much more philosophical than a gra-
tuitous hypothesis, which is, nevertheless, the means of invention
employed by Galileo; and its results are quite as well established as are
the laws of Galileo since they are proved by exactly the same means,
that is by the sensible accord of their consequences with the phenomena.
Nothing eise than this is claimed by Galileo himself and his principal
SUCCeSSOrS.

But the atomists would have encountered one very serious objection,
to which they were necessarily exposed in common with all physicists
who undertake an explanation of gravitation. For by having thickness
a roof receives not a whit more of hail, or a shield of arrows; whereas,
remaining otherwise unchanged, the weight of all bodies is augmented
in direct proportion of their thickness. Conversely when one removes
a heavy body from a shop or dwelling, or reduces it to sheets exposed
without protection to material influences (the rain, for example) it
receives more than when protected or concentrated so as to present a
small surface. But it has never been found by merchants and artisans,
who are continually in the habit of weighing, that bodies appear heavier
in open air than when under cover, and gold-beaters have never per-
ceived that the weight of the metal augments in proportion to the
increase of its surface.

In a word, if the collision of atoms is the cause of heaviness, the
weight of bodies ought to be proportional to their surface (or rather to
their horizontal projection). tow, then, does it happen that the weight
is proportional to the mass?

Do the gravitational atoms then act across the thickest and most
compact envelopes of all substances as fully as through the air? And

responding spaces will be proportional to the squares of the whole times, and the
sums of the (equally numerous) small spaces—that is to say, the whole distance
traversed—will also be proportional to the squares of the whole times.

Remark: The assumption with which I started, and which is tacitly made in the
other demonstrations of this law, is a sort of license equivalent to supposing that
the parts of the times and spaces are infinitely small, and is less conceivable than
one is accustomed to suppose. It is an inevitable inconvenience of the common
hypothesis of the continuity of the action of gravitation. But this inconvenience
is not encountered when we substitute the hypothesis of discontinuity. I mean to
say that there arises no contradiction when the time increments are taken equal to
the intervals between the blows of the gravitational agency.
152 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

does not the very sensible weight which they impart to these envelopes
demonstrate the contrary, that is that all substances arrest the passage
of a great number of corpuscles?

XOX

To this the Epicureans would have been forced to respond that the
atoms doubtless traverse very freely' all heavy bodies; as freely, for
example, as light passes through diamond and magnetic matter through
gold, though one of these bodies is the hardest and the other the
heaviest of all known bodies (which shows that they are less porous
than most substances). Thus the number of atoms which are inter-
cepted by the first layers of a heavy body would be absolutely insensible
relatively to the number of those which pass through the last layers.”
Nevertheless, the relatively small number intercepted would produce a
sensible action upon the body, since they have, in virtue of an immense
velocity,’ the force of impact which they would lack by reason of their
small mass.

1 Several ancient physicists recognized the pores in bodies. It may be seen, for
example, in the eighth chapter of the first book of Aristotle on Generation and Cor-
ruption, that Empedocles, Leucippus, and Democritus had made a great deal of use
of them to explain sensations and mixtures. Galen reports in his works on the
Natural Properties, that Erasistratus (the grandson, it is believed, of Aristotle), a
celebrated corpuscular physician who denied attraction, believed in the existence of
a vacuum and attempted to reduce all natural properties from the size of the pores.
Coelius Aurelianus speaks of them also in connection with Asclepiades, of Bithynia,
a physician of the time of Pompey. And Sextus Empiricus assures us that not only
Asclepiades but also other physicians and physicists of the sect of Epicureans
made many applications of the pores. Finally, in the first book of Lucretius there
are ten or twelve lines upon the great permeability of bodies, concluding as follows:
Usque adeo, in rebus, solidi nil esse videtur.

2 However considerable we assume the number n of horizontal layers going to
compose a body of uniform density, the number (and consequently the effectiveness)
of the gravitational atoms is diminished in passing each one of them, because some
atoms are intercepted by the solid material composing the layer. The number of
atoms transmitted by a layer, and remaining effective to produce weight in the next
lower one, will bear the same ratio to the number reaching the first that the volume

_of the spaces or pores in the layer bears to its total volume. Assuming the body to
be of uniform density, this ratio will be constant, and since the weight of each layer
is proportional to the number of atoms available to collide with its substance, this
ratio represeuts the relative weight of any layer to that next above 1t. However
nearly equal we may suppose the numbers a and b, which express the ratio which is
assumed between the weight of the highest layer of the body and that of the lowest
(the two layers being supposed equal in volume and density ), it is possible to express
in numbers the ratio of the entire volume to that occupied by the pores a8 V/q to Wp.
Such a ratio may be obtained by experiments with several sorts of tissues, as, for
example, by means which Newton indicates in his Optics (Book II, Part III, Prop.
8), the number of the orders of pores being the excess of the logarithm of {/q over
that of Va Wb divided by the logarithm of two.

3The movement of the atoms is so rapid, according to Epicurus (in his letter to
Herodotus), that they traverse the greatest imaginable spaces in a time inconcelvably
short.
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 153

b.O.G 1h

A second difficulty which would have embarrassed the more scrupu-
lous atomists, is that the mutual collision of the atoms would retard
their motions repeatedly, and diminish, consequently, the gravitational
action. Any such effect, nevertheless, has hitherto been imperceptible.

Now, it would be useless to offer in explanation that the sum of the
motions would remain the same, since this is only true when the word
sum is used in the sense of geometers, who comprehend by it the differ-
ence of contraries. Such a definition is readily seen to offer no assist-
ance to the atomist in the case of equality of contrary movements. For
the algebraic sum of the motions of the atoms is zero before as after the
collision; but before the collision they were capable of effects of which
they are incapable afterwards.

XXII.

It is apparent that such mutual encounters would be the more rare
the smaller the atoms were supposed to be compared with the intervals
between them. These intervals can not, however, be assumed very
great since gravitation manifests no sensible interruption even in places

‘and times the most adjacent; so that the only conceivable recourse to
render the encounter of the gravitational atoms sufficiently rare is to
Suppose them extremely small. Happily this device is completely suffi-
cient. Conceive two balls whose centers trace given courses in different
planes. In order that they may never meet it suffices to diminish the
sum of their semidiameters till it becomes less than the least distance
between their paths.

But since, with diminishing size, the atoms would be less efficient to
produce gravitation, the intensity of which is fixed by phenomena,’ it
is necessary to see if their effectiveness may be maintained by some
other properties. I see no recourse of this nature except in the increase
of individual density or of velocity. These two recourses appear very
natural, and are at the same time the more satisfactory because they
were (very probably) in accord with the spirit of the atomists of whom
I speak, and would probably have sufficed to close the mouths of their
adversaries.

XXIII.

Third difficulty: Each celestial body perpetually finds atoms in its
path which it necessarily displaces in passing onward. This can not
occur without the atoms communicating to the body a part of their
motion, and in consequence causing its retardation. Exclusive of all
other elements except the mass displaced, this retardation is propor-

‘A little metaphysical consideration suffices to dispose of this instance; but, as
will be seen in a moment, I am able to supplement it by two separate physical
conceptions.
154 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

tional to the density of the medium made up of these atoms and their
interstices. Now, the gravitation of the body (exclusive of all other
elements than this atomic mass) is proportional to this same mean den-
sity. How, then, can it be that the retardation is imperceptible while
the gravitation is so sensible? The objection is rendered the more
forcible when we consider that the retardation of a revolving body is
brought about by all the atoms which it meets in its orbit, while its
gravitation is produced only by those which at any one position in its
orbit are directed toward the central body.

XOMIDYs

Reply: Other things being equal, the force of gravitation, being pro-
duced by the single stream of atoms deprived of antagonists, is propor- —
tional to the square of the velocity of the atoms (by a proposition demon-
strated generally), while the retardation above spoken of, being caused
by the stream opposing the planet in its motion, is proportional to the
product of this velocity of the atoms by that of the revolving body (as
we shall prove directly). Consequently (things being equal) the gravi-
tation is to the retardation as the velocity of the atoms is to that of
the revolving body.

Now, it is not hard to believe that the velocity of the atoms is greater
than that of the revolving body; and, indeed, all that we have hereto-
fore said would lead to the presumption that it isincomparably greater.
Hence the system of thin-sown atoms moving in every direction agrees
very well with a condition of gravitation incomparably greater than
the retardation, and it agrees still, despite the consideration which for-
tifies the difficulty which we are considering, since a velocity has always
been assigned to the atoms greater than would have been necessary to
obviate this latter difficulty alone.

Remark: I have said that the retardation of a great body caused by
the opposing stream of atoms moving much more rapidly than the
body itself would be proportional to the product of the velocity of the
atoms by that of the great body. I shall first demonstrate this propo-
sition with respect to the couple of opposed streams parallel to the
direction of the great body, and in so doing I shall have proved it for
the case of opposing streams oblique to this direction, since their
motions may be decomposed in two directions, the one parallel and the
other perpendicular to the direction of the body, of which the first is
nearly always much greater than the motion of the body, and of which
the second produces no effect.

Demonstration: The total retardation of the body is the excess of
the simple retardation it experiences from the stream which it encoun-
ters over the simple acceleration which it experiences on the part of
the stream which pursues it. Now, these simple factors are propor-
tional to the squares of velocities, which are respectively the sum and
difference of the absolute velocity of the atoms and the absolute veloc-
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 155

ity of the body. Consequently, the resultant retardation is proportional
to the excess of the square of the sum over the square of the difference,
which (by the eighth proposition of the second book of the Elements of
Euclid) is four times the product of the absolute velocities in question.

XXV.

To the three difficulties above mentioned may be reduced all those
which are plausible, since there can be no other changes in the motions
of a heavy body, or in the motions of the gravitational fluid, or in their
constitution, except those which proceed from some opposition or inter-
position, either on the part of the particles of the heavy body, which
hinder the atoms composing the fluid from reaching their destination, or
from particles of the fluid itself, the one opposing the other, or, finally,
from the effect of the latter on the path of the heavy body. The solu-
tions of all these difficulties depend either on the permeability of the

-heavy body or the subtlety and rapidity of the gravitational atoms—

properties to none of which we are obliged to assign two opposing
limits.

This last expression signifies that while several considerations may
unite to augment the intensity of such or such property, yet no con-
sideration requires a diminution in the intensity of the same property,
and that reciprocally no considerations tend to limit the diminutive-
ness of properties of which certain other considerations limit more and
more the magnitude. There are no conditious which give opposing
indications, and which therefore obstruct the choice of remedies. This
assertion would be tedious to establish, but very few readers will con-

test its correctness.
XOX:

While we speak of alterations and remedies it is for me to conform
to the irregularity of our ordinary progress in research. Truth never
permits us to discover her at first seeking, with all her following train
of verities, but we proceed gradually in discovery by tedious gropings
and corrections. To this procedure a writer ought also in some
measure to conform, in the exposition of truths which he has finally
discovered, when the greatness or smal!ness of the objects discussed
transcends that of the majority of those objects with which we are
familiar, and when he believes that his reader will not at first be dis-
posed to countenance suppositions so excessive, but only in a measure
as he shall have shown him their necessity. For the reader will have
had no perspective to apply to this immensity or that diminutiveness
if it bas been assumed at the start in sufficient measure to satisfy all
phenomena. ;

The author might with equal justice assume at the start a magnitude
or diminutiveness sufficient for the purpose, since in explaining the
phenomena the physicist takes the place (so far as he may) of the
Creator—a being who, having determined precisely in advance all the
156 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

consequences of the different intensities which might be given to such
or such properties, has chosen in each case that intensity most proper
to attain the desired result and has precisely determined the conse-
quences without any preliminary trial.

XX VII.

All other conceivable objections are founded on certain regularities or
irregularities of detail which have not been minutely set forth, but gra-
tuitously assumed, and which, in consequence, ought not seriously to be
taken into account. Or, in the second place, such objections may be
founded on the tenets of some metaphysical sect. Before responding to
such objections I pray these metaphysicists to first agree among them-
selves. Or, finally, they address themselves to the imagination rather
than to the understanding. Thus some may be shocked at what in this
system is extreme, strange, or extraordinary—as if it was after our
gross and limited measures that the subtlety and grandeur of Nature
must be evaluated! As if a confused repugnance sufficed to condemn
a theory which depends neither on taste nor sentiment! Or as if one
ought to follow servilely the beaten track, even in researches where
no success has ever come to those who have followed it!

XXVIII.

If one is satisfied with the exact agreement of this system with
physical astronomy and with terrestrial phenomena, he ought not to
distrust it, as if this apparent conformity were the effect of the artful-
ness with which I have adjusted matters or as if other systems also
might be rectified so as to agree throughout with the phenomena
should a hand more skillful take the same pains to accommodate them
to each-other.

I have not added to the atoms sung by Lucretius any feature
directed solely toward the explanation of the great laws discovered by
the Moderns. But, on the contrary, I have merely divested the motion
of these atoms of an arbitrary feature (the nearly perfect parallelism)
by which Epicurus had disfigured the unrestricted motion assumed by
Democritus. That was a motion so simple that it would appear as if
its inventor had proposed it with no other end but the most absolute
simplicity, unconcerned that it might in no way explain real phenom-
ena, but rather, perhaps, contradict them; so that it is impossible that
any system can equal this in simplicity.

I would even have had no need to advise myself of this correction,
in reading the poem of Lucretius, if I had been instructed beforehand
in the system of Leucippus and Democritus as I was long after this
reading.

Finally, the explanations which I have offered ought not to be
regarded as in any respect modifications of this system of atoms, for it
would be impossible not to fall upon these explanations in seeking to
follow out the necessary consequences of this system.
‘THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION, 157

X XIX.

I did not take undue credit to myself when as a child I rectified the
system taught by Lucretius and drew from it immediately its most
important consequences, for this was extremely easy or rather entirely
natural. Besides, I knew but little more the value and solidity of my
little views than the child ordinarily knows the wit or sense which we
find in its repartees and sallies. Indeed, the extremely simple idea of
trying to explain the principal natural phenomena by the aid of a sub-
tle fluid vigorously agitated in every direction has come to many writers
who have before presented it in a vague and ill-assured fashion, not to
mention that there has been without doubt a still greater number who
have not even deigned to communicate at all. Iam well convinced that
since the law governing the intensity of universal gravitation is similar
to that for light, the thought will have occurred to many physicists
that an ethereal substance moving in rectilinear paths may be the
cause of gravitation, and that they may have applied to it whatever of
skill in the mathematics they have possessed.

XXX.

But we may say, How is it that none of these physicists have pushed
these consequences to their conclusion and communicated the research? °

Doubtless because the most of them having no clear view of this
chaos (of which the first glance is, I admit, frightful) they have not
known how to disentangle it and subject it to their calculations. Or
not having firmly grasped the principles of the theory, they have
allowed themselves to be seduced by specious sophisms, by which men
have pretended to refute in advance all imaginable explanations of
gravitation. Or they will have had the foible of bowing to the author-
ity of great names, when it is alleged (whether justly or falsely) that
they have pronounced upon the impossibility of this or upon the use-
lessness of that branch of knowledge. Or they have lacked sufficient
love of truth or courage of their convictions to abandon easy pleasures
and exterior advantages in order to devote themselves simply to
researches at the time difficult and little welcome. Or, finally, they
have failed to become impressed with the strength and fecundity of
this beautiful system so distinctly as to lead them, in their enthusiasm,
to sacrifice to it their other views and projects. ©

Constitutions which I assign to heavy bodies and to the gravitational
fluid; followed by a mathematical conception and some remarks to fix
the ideas of geometers who desire to follow out for themselves the con-
sequences of this mechanism, and who may desire first to know pre-
cisely what are the hypotheses from which I claim all the phenomena
to follow necessarily.
158 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

CONSTITUTION OF HEAVY BODIES.

First. Their indivisible particles are cages; for example, hollow cubes
or octohedra. (They are,in other words, skeletons of solids of which
there is nothing material except the edges.)

Second. The diameters of the bars of these cages, even if supposed
increased by the diameter of the gravitational corpuscles (as they must
be in order to conveniently evaluate the portion of the atoms inter-
cepted), are so small, relative to the distances between the parallel bars
of the same cage, that all the particles included in the terrestrial globe
intercept not the ten-thousandth part of the corpuscles which present
themselves to traverse it.

Third. These diameters are all equal, or if they are unequal their
inequalities sensibly compensate each other. If, for instance, in the
smallest portions of matter separately ponderable (which, it has been
stated, may weigh one thirty-second part of a grain) the mean diam-
eter of the bars of the one portion does not differ a tenth part from the
mean diameter of the bars of the other, then it would follow that in
the greatest ponderable masses the mean diameters do not differ by a
ten-thousandth part, for every such great ponderable mass is com-
posed of so large a number of indivisible particles that simple chance
suffices to almost perfectly effect a compensation of diameters.

CONSTITUTION OF GRAVITATIONAL CORPUSCLES.

First. Conformably to the second of the preceding suppositions, the
diameter of the gravitational corpuscle added even to that of the bars
of the indivisible particles is so small relatively to the mutual distance
of the parallel bars of a single cage that the weight of celestial bodies
does not sensibly vary from the ratio between their masses.

Second. The gravitational corpuscles are isolated, so that their
progressive movements are necessarily rectilinear.

Third. They are so thinly scattered—that is to say, their diameters are
so small relative to their mutual mean distance—that there are no more
than a few hundreds which encounter one another in the course of a
thousand years. Hence the uniformity of their movements is never
sensibly disturbed.

Fourth. They move in several thousand of thousands of different
directions, even counting as one all those which are parallel to the same
line. The distribution of these directions may be conceived as follows:
First, imagine all the points conceived to lie in different directions
strewn upon a sphere as uniformly as is possible, and consequently
separated from one another by less than a second of arc; then imagine
a corpuscular path radiating from each of these points.

Fifth. Parallel to each of these directions there moves a stream or
torrent of corpuscles. Now, in order to give it no more than the neces-
sary size, the transverse section of this current has the same contour as
THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION. 159

the orthogonal projection of the visible universe upon the plane of this
section.

Sixth. The different parts of a single current are sensibly of equal
density, either where contemporary portions of sensible magnitude or
successive portions occupying sensible times in traversing a given
surface are compared. The densities of different currents are also
equal.

Seventh. The mean velocity determined in the same manner as the
mean density is also sensibly constant.

Highth. This velocity is several thousand times as great, relative to
the velocities of the planets, as is the gravitation of the planets toward
the sun relative to the greatest resistances which secular observations
permit us to suppose they experience. For example, several hundred
times greater relative to the velocity of the earth than the gravitation
of the earth toward the sun multiplied by the number of times the
firmament would contain the dise of the sun is greater than the greatest
resistance which the secular differences in the length of the year permit
us to suppose the earth experiences from celestial matter.

CONCEPT, WHICH. FACILITATES THE APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS
TO DETERMINE THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF THE HEAVY BODIES
AND THE CORPUSCLES.

First. Decompose all heavy bodies into equal masses so small as to
allow them to be treated without sensible error as attractive particles
are treated in those theories of gravitation in which no hypothesis is
made as to its cause. In such a small mass the effects of unequal dis-
tance and position of its particles relative to those of the mass which is
conceived to attract it, and to be attracted by it, may be neglected.
Such masses will have a diameter no more than one one-hundred-
thousandth as great as the mutual distance of the two masses under
examination. Thus the apparent semidiameter of one as viewed from
the other does not exceed one second.

Second. For the surfaces of this mass, accessible but impermeable
to the gravitational fluid, substitute a single spherical surface equal to
their sum.

Third. Decompose these first surfaces into facets sufficiently small
to be treated as planes without sensible error.

Fourth. Transport all these facets to the spherical surface above
mentioned. Hach one of the facets should in this transformation
occupy that point of the spherical surface at which the tangent plane
is parallel to the original position of the facet.

REMARKS.

First. It is not necessary to be very expert to deduce upon these
-Suppositions all the laws of gravitation, both terrestrial and universal
(and consequently those of Kepler and some others), with as much of
160 THE THEORY OF GRAVITATION.

precision and more as the phenomena themselves furnish, for these
laws are the inevitable consequences of the constitutions I have
supposed.

Second. Although I here present these constitutions crudely and
without proof, as if they were gratuitous hypotheses and adventurous
fictions, the fair-minded reader will perfectly comprehend that I have
at hand some presumptions, at least, in their favor (independent of the
perfect accord with all the phenomena), but which I withhold as too
extended for development in this place. These suppositions may then
be regarded as theorems published without demonstration.

Third. Their number is likely to inspire some opposition at first
glance; but the attentive mind will not fail to see that they are but
details into which I have wished to enter because of the novelty of
this doctrine, and that they will be readily understood when it shall
have become sufficiently well known that its students may attend under
favorable circumstances to the details. If the authors who have writ-
ten upon hydrodynamics, aeronautics, or optics had had readers who
doubted the existence of water, air, and light, and who consequently
indulged no tacit supposition upon equalities or compensations of
which no express mention was made, they, too, would be obliged to add
a great number of explanations to their definitions which instructed
or indulgent readers might well dispense with. We do not accept of
hints, and sano sensu, except for propositions which are familiar and in
whose favor there is a predisposition.
THE EXTREME INFRA-RED RADIATIONS.!

By C. E. GUILLAUME.

If we compare our present knowledge of the spectrum with what was

known even as recently as ten years ago, we can but marvel at the
progress that has been made in that brief period. In 1888 the ultra-
violet spectrum had been investigated by M. Cornu, but only as far as
the point at which the air totally absorbs the rays. In the infra-red,
the region actually measured did not extend below 2 or 3 microns,
although Langley had explored for some distance beyond.? Electrical
waves were then making their first appearance and scientists were far
from being in accord as to their true nature, few then admitting them
to be identical in fundamental character with light.
_ To-day the spectrum has been continued a whole octave toward the
shorter wave lengths by means of experiments conducted in vacuo.
The X rays and the uranium rays, or secondary rays derived from X
rays, have still further extended the ultraviolet spectrum through
regions not yet measured. Electrical oscillations, which from their
various properties have been shown to belong in the octaves below
those of light, have now been produced with wave lengths of about 3
millimeters; while the infra-red proper—that is, the direct continuation
of the spectrum beyond the visible ending in the red—has extended
itself more and more, bridging over the unknown region toward the
electrical waves.

Progress in this infra-red region, after having been singularly slow

. for several years, has recently become very rapid. Extremely merito-

rious researches have added largely to the older work, and have led to
results of the highest interest in the knowledge of the vibratory
motions of the ether, which we still continue to call light, although, for
the physicist, those radiations which are visible form but a minute por-
tion of the whole.

Our readers will recall that the infra-red radiations are revealed to
us only through their transformation into heat at the surface of some
suitable receiver. This is often a thin strip of platinum or iron or

nickel, blackened, and introduced as a resistance to form part of an
electric circuit; but sometimes it is a very minute thermopile caused to
affect a highly sensitive galvanometer.

The production of extreme infra-red rays is very simple, as all bodies
whatsoever emit them constantly. If, however, an opaque body is at
the same temperature as the receiver, the radiations which it sends out
are imperceptible, because the two bodies exchange equal quantities of
energy.

The hotter a body, the more it emits radiations of all kinds. But
the difficulty is to isolate separate bundles of these rays from their
neighbors, so as to deal with rays of approximately the same wave
length. Prisms of most substances are useless for these long wave
lengths, as they generally absorb the rays totally, just as lampblack
does in the visible spectrum, while the grating, as is well known, super-
poses many orders of spectra having wave lengths which are multiples
of each other.

A very ingenious device originated by the American physicist, Nich-
ols, has been of very great service here. In studying the nature of the
radiations reflected by quartz, Nichols found that the fraction reflected
was very slight through the greater part of the spectrum, but increased
very greatly at certain regions in the infra-red, where, indeed, this sub-
stance seemed to have a really metallic reflection. These regions of
nearly total reflection were tolerably narrow and well marked. Ateach
successive reflection from quartz surfaces all the radiations become
more and more enfeebled by absorption in the quartz, with the excep-
tion of those whose wave lengths correspond to such regions of metallic
reflection. These bands thus become relatively stronger and stronger
at each reflection till, after four or five reflections, they alone remain
perceptible. i

By interposing a grating in the path of the beam the wave lengths
under investigation may be determined. The apparatus for this pur-
pose is, however, quite different from that employed in the visible spec-
trum. [or example, the grating is composed of metallic wires, each one
or two tenths of a millimeter in diameter, and the slit through which
the radiations pass may be as much as a centimeter wide without making
the spectrum too impure. It is not necessary that the reflecting sur-
faces shall be polished with that degree of accuracy and finish required
in the visible spectrum. For the proportion of radiations diffusely
reflected by a surface depends not only on the size of the grains of the
surface, but on the wave lengths of the radiations reflected. Infra-red
measurements now frequently deal with radiations of a wave length a
hundred times as great as that of green light, and thus the optical sur-
faces may be much inferior to those which would be required for work
in the visible spectrum.

Quartz is not alone in possessing this property of selective reflection
ot which we have been speaking. A great number of other crystalline
THE EXTREME INFRA-RED RADIATIONS. 163

substances have narrow bands of metallic reflection at various points
in the spectrum, and they can be utilized in the same way to produce
pure pencils of rays. With quartz, the principal of these bands are
situated at wave lengths of 8 and 21), while, according to Rubens and
Aschkinass, the rays reflected most completely by rock salt and by
sylvine have wave lengths respectively of 514 and 61. This last wave
length is exactly one hundred times as great as that of the orange in
the visible spectrum.

The diagram (fig. 1) represents the disposition of apparatus in the
investigation of Rubens and Aschkinass. At L is the lamp sending
out its radiations to the mirror M, by which the beam is reflected to
M,. Between these mirrors is placed the grating R. After leaving
M, the beam suffers five reflections at the surfaces S, proceeds then to
the mirror M;, and finally falls upon the receiving surface placed in

the small reflecting chamber P. By this latter device the rays not
absorbed at first contact with the receiving surface are reflected back
upon it by the walls of the chamber, and thus serve more effectively to
warm it. A series of screens is so arranged as to exclude from this
chamber all stray light.

However interesting we may consider the fact of the existence of
these bands of selective reflection, their chief value lies in their appli-
cation to the purposes of investigation. No procedure known prior to
their discovery could be used to separate homogeneous pencils of rays
of these great wave lengths in sufficient intensity for an examination
of their properties.

One of the first studies which have been made with regard to these
rays is the transparency of various substances to them. It has been

quite readily, and still more freely the precipitated chloride of silver.
The radiations peculiar to rock salt are completely untransmissible to
rock salt and chloride of silver, as well as to glass, gypsum, and fluor-
spar. Paraffin in layers of 1 millimeter thickness transmits nearly half
of these radiations of rock salt, and a comparison with the radiation
peculiar to sylvine shows paraffin becoming more and more trans-
parent as we proceed further in the infra-red. The same is true of the
transmitting power of quartz, fluorite, and gutta-percha.

A sheet of isinglass transmits nearly two-thirds of each of these
kinds of radiation. The authors therefore employed this substance to
torm a cell in which to put various liquids whose transparency was to
be examined. Carbon-bisulphide and benzine were found to be very
transparent, petroleum somewhat less so, and toluene and xylene still
more opaque. Thus the fractions of the rays separated by rock salt
which traversed 1 millimeter thickness of carbon-bisulphide and xylene
were 98 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively. The case of olive oil is

layer of it 1 millimeter thick transmits 20 per cent of those at 61.
Water, alcohol, and ether are completely opaque to both these kinds of
radiations, and while carbonic-acid vapor absorbs them but slightly,
water vapor absorbs them almost completely.

These observations show us anew how marked are the differences in
the properties of ether waves of slightly different periods of oscillation,
It appears, according to modern theories, that if a substance is trans-
parent at one region of the spectrum, it is necessarily opaque at some
other. Indeed, if we except the case of the metals, we must search for
substances transparent in the infra-red among those opaque to visible
radiations.

Nothing more clearly indicates the great generalization in the notion
of light that has taken place in the last decade than the simple statis-
tics of comparison between the extent of spectrum as now known and
the narrow visible stretch included between the violet and the red.

This comparison becomes clearer in a graphic representation, which

can be made by either of the two following methods: The wave lengths
may be plotted as abscisse upon a simple arithmetical scale, or for
them may be substituted their logarithms, so as to make a geometrical
scale in which each octave of light occupies an equal space in counter-
part to the keyboard of a piano. The second method is the more
rational, inasmuch as it gives to each part of the spectrum a space more
in proportion to its importance.

The diagram (fig. 2) has been prepared in conformity with the second
scheme.'

tions of more rapid vibration, which may be compared to higher musical pitches, are

radiation.
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.!

By Sir NORMAN LOCKYER.

When, on returning from India, I found that you had during my
absence done ine the honor of unanimously electing me your president,
I began to cast about for a subject on which to address you. Curiously
enough, shortly afterwards an official inquiry compelled me to make
myself acquainted with the early doings of the Royal Commission of
the Exhibition of 1851, on which I have lately been elected to serve,
and in my reading I found a full account of the establishment of your
institute; of thelaying of the foundation stone by the late Prince Consort
in 1855, and of his memorable speech on that oceasion. Here, I thought,
was mny subject; and when I heard that the admirable work done by
this and other local institutions had determined the inhabitants of this
important city and neighborhood to crown the edifice by the foundation
of a university, I thought the matter settled.

This idea, however, was nipped in the bud by a letter which informed
me that the hope had been expressed that I should refer to some branch
of astronomical work. I yielded at once, and because I-felt that I might
thus be able to show cause why the making of knowledge should occupy
a large place in your new university, and thus distinguish it from other
universities more or less decadent.

The importance of practical work, the educational value of the seek-
ing after truth by experiment and observation on the part of even young
students, are now generally recognized. That battle has been fought
and won. But there is a tendency in the official direction of seats of
learning to consider what is known to be useful, because it is used, in
the first place. The fact that the unknown, that is the unstudied, is
the mine from which all scientific knowledge with its million applica-
tions has been won is too often forgotten.

Bacon, who was the first to point out the importance of experiment
in the physical sciences, and who predicted the applications to which I
have referred, warns us that ‘‘lucifera experimenta non fructifera quae-
renda;” and surely we should highly prize those results which enlarge

the domain of human thought and help us to understand the mechanism
of the wonderful universe in which our lot is cast, as well as those
which add to the comfort and the convenience of our lives.

It would be also easy to show by many instances how researches,
considered ideally useless at the time they were made, have been the
origin of the most tremendous applications. One instance suffices.
Faraday’s trifling with wires and magnets has already landed us in one
of the greatest revolutions which civilization has witnessed; and where
the triumphs of electrical science will stop no man can say.

This is a case in which the useless has been rapidly sublimed into
utility so far as our material wants are concerned.

I propose to bring to your notice another ‘‘useless” observation sug-
gesting a line of inquiry which I believe sooner or later is destined
profoundly to influence human thought along many lines.

Fraunhofer at the beginning of this century examined sunlight and
starlight through a prism. He found that the light received from the
sun differed from that of the stars. So useless did his work appear
that we had to wait for half a century till any considerable advance
was made. It was found at last that the strange “lines” seen and
named by Fraunhofer were precious indications of the chemical sub-
stances present in worlds immeasurably remote. We had, after half a
century’s neglect, the foundation of solar and stellar chemistry, an
advance in knowledge equaling any other in its importance.

In dealing with my subject I shall first refer to the work which has
been done in more recent years with regard to this chemical condition-
ing of the atmospheres of stars, and afterwards very briefly show how
this work carries us into still other new and wider fields of thought.

The first important matter which lies on the surface of such a general
inquiry as this is that if we deal with the chemical elements as judged
by the lines in their spectra we know for certain of the existence of
oxygen, of nitrogen, of argon, representing one class of gases, in no
celestial body whatever; whereas, representing other gases, we have a
tremendous demonstration of the existence of all the known lines of
hydrogen and helium.

We see, then, that the celestial sorting out of gases is quite different
from the terrestial one.

Taking the substances classed by the chemist as nonmetals, we find
carbon and silicium—lI prefer, on account of its stellar behavior, to call
it silicium, though it is old fashioned—present in celestial phenomena.
We have evidence of this in the fact that we have a considerable devel-
opment of carbon in some stars and an indication of silicium in others.
But these are the only nonmetals observed. Now, with regard to the
metallic substances which we find, we deal chiefly with calcium, stron-
tium, iron, and magnesium. Others are not absolutely absent, but their
percentage quantity is so small that they are negligible in a general
statement.
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS. 169

Now do these chemical elements exist indiscriminately in all the
celestial bodies, so that practically, from a chemical point of view, the
bodies appear to us of similar chemical constitution? No; it is not so.

From the spectra of those stars which resemble the sun, in that they
consist of an interior nucleus surrounded by an atmosphere which
absorbs the light of the nucleus, and which, therefore, we study by
means of this absorption, it is to be gathered that the atmospheres of
some Stars are chiefly gaseous—i. e., consisting of elements we recog-
nize aS gases here—of others chiefly metallic, of others again mainly
composed of carbon or compounds of carbon.

Here, then, we have spectroscopically revealed the fact that there is
considerable variation in the chemical constituents which build up the
stellar atmospheres.

This, though a general, is still an isolated statement. Can we con-
nect it with another? One of the laws formulated by Kirchhoff in the
infancy of spectroscopic inquiry has to do with the kind of radiation
given out by bodies at different temperatures. A poker placed in a
fire first becomes red and, as it gets hotter, white hot. Examined in
a spectroscope, we find that the red condition comes from the absence
of blue light; that the white condition comes from the gradual addition
of blue as the temperature increases.

The law affirms that the hotter a mass of matter is the farther its
spectrum extends into the ultraviolet.

Hence the hotter a star is the farther does its complete or continuous
spectrum lengthen out toward the ultraviolet and the less is it absorbed
by cooler vapors in its atmosphere.

Now, to deal with three of the main groups of stars, we find the fol-
lowing very general result:

Galseousisbanse sete seis malseeace es sce ec — Longest spectrum.
Metalheystarsiss= 22 Ssiyoceie sete + isso es ee eeresces Medium spectrum.
(rim onls arse sae farce een cemie sa tee cei w ot seein Shortest spectrum.

We have now associated two different series of phenomena, and we
are enabled to make the following statement:

GUBUOUSPRtarsee cathe Ae ae at Highest temperature.
Metalliewstarsseest ase 256.25 sce se Se lees BAe Medium temperature.
@arhonustarse saa sacsisa2/s~ wyelce Semis ai -ae ee ea Lowest temperature.

Hence the differences in apparent chemical constitutions are associ-
ated with differences of temperature.

Can we associate with the two to which I have already called atten-
tion still a third class of facts? Laboratory work enables us to do this.
When I began my inquiries the idea was, one gas or vapor one spec-
trum. We now know that this is not true; the systems of bright lines
given out by radiating substances change with the temperature.

We can get the spectrum of a well-known compound substance—say
carbonic oxide; it is one special to the compound; we increase the
170 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.

temperature so as to break up the compound, and we then get the
spectra of its constituents, carbon and oxygen.

But the important thing in the present connection is that the spectra
of the chemical elements behave exactly in the same way as the spectra
of known compounds do when we employ temperatures far higher than
those which break up the compounds; and indeed in some cases the
changes are more marked. For brevity I will take for purposes of
illustration three substances, aud deal with one increase of temperature
only, a considerable one and obtainable by rendering a substance incan-
descent, first by a direct current of electricity, as happens in the
so-called ‘‘are lamps” employed in electric lighting, and next by the
employment of a powerful induction coil and battery of leyden jars.
In laboratory parlance we pass thus from the are to the jar-spark. In
the case of magnesium, iron, and calcium, the changes observed on
passing from the temperature of the are to that of the spark have
been minutely observed. In each, new lines are added or old ones are
intensified at the higher temperature. Such lines have been termed
“enhanced lines.”

These enhanced lines are not seen alone; outside the region of high
temperature in which they are produced, the cooling vapors give us the
cool lines. Still we can conceive the enhanced lines to be seen alone at
the highest temperature in a space sufficiently shielded from the action
of all lower temperatures, but such a shielding is beyond our laboratory
expedients.

In watching the appearance of these special enhanced lines in stellar
spectra we havea third series of pnenomena available, and we find that
the results are absolutely in harmony with what has gone before. Thus:

Gaseous stars..Highest temperature.. Strong helium and faint enhanced lines.

Feeble helium and strong enhanced lines.
No helium and strong arc lines.

Carbon stars.. Lowest temperature... Faint are lines.

Metallic stars..Medium temperature... }

It is clear now, not only that the spectral changes in stars are associ-
ated with, or produced by, changes of temperature, but that the study
of the enhanced spark and the are lines lands us in the possibility of a
rigorous stellar thermometry, such lines being more easy to observe —
than the relative lengths of spectrum.

Accepting this, we can take a long stride forward and, by carefully
studying the chemical revelations of the spectrum, classify the stars
along a lineof temperature. Butwhichline? Wereallthestarsin popu-
lar phraseology created hot? Ifso, we should simply deal with the run-
ning down of temperature, and because all the hottest stars are chem-
ically alike, all cooler stars would be alike. But there are two very
distinct groups of coolest.stars; and since there are two different kinds
of coolest stars, and only one kind of hottest stars, it can not be merely
a question either of a running up or a running down of temperature.
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS. 171

Many years of very detailed inquiry have convinced me that all stars
save the hottest must be sorted out into two series—those getting hotter
and those, like our sun, getting cooler, and that the hottest stage in the
history of a star is reached near the middle of its life.

The method of inquiry adopted has been to compare large-scale photo-
graphs of the spectra of the different stars taken by my assistants at
South Kensington; the complete harmony of the results obtained along
various lines of other work carries conviction with it.

We find ourselves here in the presence of minute details exhibiting
the workings of a chemical law, associated distinctly with temperature;
and more than this, we are also in the presence of high-temperature fur-
naces, entirely shielded by their vastness from the presence of those dis-
tracting phenomena which we are never free from in the most perfect
conditions of experiment we can get here.

What, then, is the chemical law? It is this: In the very hottest
stars we deal with the gases hydrogen, helium, and doubtless others
still unknown, almost exclusively. At the next lowest temperatures
we find these gases being replaced by metals in the state in which they
are observed in our laboratories when the most powerful jar-spark is
employed. At a lower temperature still the gases almost disappear
entirely, and the metals exist in the state produced by the electric are.
Certain typical stars showing these chemical changes may be arranged
as follows:

Stars getting hotter. Hottest stars. Stars cooling.

This, then, is the result of our first inquiry into the existence of the
various chemical elements in the atmospheres of stars generally. We
get a great diversity, and we know that this diversity accompanies
changes of temperature. We have also found that the sun, which we
independently know to be a cooling star, and Arcturus are identical
chemically.

We have now dealt with the presence of the various chemical ele-
ments generally in the atmospheres of stars. The next point we have
to consider is, whether the absorption which the spectrum indicates for
us takes place from top to bottom of the atmosphere or only in certain
levels.

In many of these stars the atmosphere may be millions of miles high.
In each the chemical substances in the hottest and coldest portions
may be vastly different. The region, therefore, in which this absorp-
tion takes place, which spectroscopically enables us to discriminate
are} THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.

star from star, must be accurately known before we can obtain the
greatest amount of information from our inquiries.

Our next duty then, clearly, is to study the sun—a star so near us
that we can examine the different parts of its atmosphere, which we
can not do in the case of the more distant stars. By doing this we
may secure facts which will enable us to ascertain in what parts of the
atmosphere the absorption takes place which produces the various phe-
nomena on which the chemical classification has been based.

It is obvious that the general spectrum of the sun, like that of stars
generally, is built up of all the absorptions which can make themselves
felt in every layer of its atmosphere from bottom to top; that is, from
the photosphere to the outermost part of the corona. Let me remind
you that this spectrum is changeless from year to year.

Now, sun-spots are disturbances produced in the photosphere; and
the chromosphere, with its disturbances, called prominences, lies directly
above it. Here, then, we are dealing with the lowest part of the sun’s
atmosphere. We find first of all that, in opposition to the changeless
general spectrum, great changes occur with the sun-spot period, both in
the spots and chromosphere.

The spot spectrum is indicated, as was found in 1866, by the widening
of certain lines; the chromospheric spectrum, as was found in 1868, by
the appearance at the sun’s limb of certain bright lines. In both cases
the lines affected, seen at any one time, are relatively few in number.

In the spot spectrum, at a sun-spot minimum, we find iron lines
chiefly affected; at a maximum they are chiefly of unknown or unfa-
miliar origin. At the present moment the affected lines are those
recorded in the spectra of vanadium and scandium, with others never
seen in a laboratory. That we are here far away from terrestrial
chemical conditions is evidenced by the fact that there is not a gram
of scandium available for laboratory use in the world at the present
time.

Then we have the spectrum of the prominences and the chromosphere.
That spectrum we are enabled to observe every day when the sun
shines as conveniently as we can observe that of sun spots. The chro-
mosphere is full of marvels. At first, when our knowledge of spectra
was very much more restricted than now, almost all the lines observed
were unknown. In 1868 I saw a line in the yellow, which I found
behaved very much like hydrogen, though I could prove that it was not
due to hydrogen; for laboratory use the substance which gave rise to
it I called helium. Next year I saw a line in the green at 1474 of
Kirchhoff’s scale. That was an unknown line, but in some subsequent
researches I traced it toiron. From that day to this we have observed
a large number of lines. They have gradually been dragged out from
the region of the unknown, and many are now recognized as enhanced
lines, to which I have already called attention as appearing in the
spectra of metals at a very high temperature.
THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS. E73

But useful as the method of observing the chromosphere without an
eclipse, which enables us

«¢., _. to feel from world to world,”

as Tennyson has put it, has proved, we want an eclipse to see it face to
face.

A tremendous flood of light has been thrown upon it by the use of
large instruments constructed on a plan devised by Respighi and myself
in 1871. ‘These give us an image of the chromosphere painted in each
one of its radiations, so that the exact locus of each chemical layer is
revealed. One of the instruments employed during the Indian eclipse
of this year is that used in photographing the spectra of stars, so that
it is now easy to place photographs of the spectra of the chromosphere
obtained during a total eclipse and of the various stars side by side.

I have already pointed out that the chemical classification indicated
that the stars next above the sun in temperature are represented by y
Cygni and Procyon, one on the ascending, the other on the descending
branch of the temperature curve.

Studying the spectra photographed during the eclipse of this year
we see that practically the lower part of the sun’s atmosphere, if present
by itself, would give us the lines which specialize the spectra of y Cygni
or Procyon.

I recognize in this result a veritable Rosetta stone, which will enable
us to read the celestial hieroglyphics presented to us in stellar spectra,
and help us to study the spectra and to get at results much more dis-
tinctly and certainly than ever before.

One of the most important conclusions we draw from the Indian
eclipse is that, for some reason or other, the lowest, hottest part of the

~sun’s atmosphere does not write its record among the lines which build
up the general spectrum so effectively as does a higher one.

There was another point especially important on which we hoped for
information, and that was this: Up to the employment of the prismatic
camera insufficient attention had been directed to the fact that in obser-
vations made by an ordinary spectroscope no true measure of the height
to which the vapors or gases extended above the sun could be obtained ;
early observations, in fact, showed the existence of glare between the
observer and the dark moon; hence it must exist between us and the
sun’s surroundings.

The prismatic camera gets rid of the effects of this glare, and its
results indicate that the effective absorbing layer—that, namely, which
gives rise to the Fraunhofer lines—is much more restricted in thick-
ness than was to be gathered from the early observations.

We are justified in extending these general conclusions to all the
stars that shine in the heavens.

So much then, in brief, for solar teachings in relation to the record of
the absorption of the lower parts of stellar atmospheres.
174 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.

Let us next turn to the higher portions of the solar surroundings, to
see if we can get any effective help from them.

In this matter we are dependent absolutely upon eclipses, and I shall
fulfill my task very badly if I do not show you that the phenomena then
observable when the so-called corona is visible, full of awe and grandeur
to all, are also full of precious teaching to the student of science. This
also varies like the spots and prominences with the sun-spot period.

It happened that I was the only person that saw both the eclipse of
1871 at the maximum of the sun-spot period and that of 1878 at mini-
mum; the corona of 1871 was as distinct from the corona of 1878 as
anything could be. In 1871 we got nothing but bright lines, indicating
the presence of gases; namely, hydrogen and another, since provision-
ally called coronium. In 1878 we got no bright lines at all, so I stated
that probably the changes in the chemistry and appearance of the
corona would be found to be dependent upon the sun-spot period, and
recent work has borne out that suggestion.

I have now specially to refer to the corona as observed and photo-
graphed this year in India by means of the prismatic camera, remark-
ing that an important point in the use of the prismatic camera is that
it enables us to separate the spectrum of the corona from that of the
prominences.

One of the chief results obtained is the determination of the position
of several lines of probably more than one new gas, which, so far, have
not been recognized as existing on the earth.

Like the lowest hottest layer, for some reason or other, this upper
layer does not write its record among the lines which build up the
general spectrum.

GENERAL RESULTS REGARDING THE LOCUS OF ABSORPTION IN
STELLAR ATMOSPHERES.

We learn from the sun, then, that the absorption which defines the
spectrum of a star is the absorption of a middle region, one shielded
both from the highest temperature of the lowest reaches of the atmos-
phere, where most tremendous changes are continually going on and
the external region where the temperature must be low, and where the
metallic vapors must condense.

If this is true for the sun it must be equally true for Arcturus, which
exactly resembles it. I go further than this, and say that in the pres-
ence of such definite results as those I have brought before you it is
not philosophical to assume that the absorption may take place at the
bottom of the atmosphere of one star or at the top of the atmosphere
of another. The onus probandi rests upon those who hold such views.

So far I have only dealt in detail with the hotter stars, but I have
pointed out that we have two distinct kinds of coolest ones, the evidence
of their much lower temperature being the shortness of their spectra.
er

THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS. 175

In one of these groups we deal with absorption alone, as in those

already considered; we find an important break in the phenomena
observed; helium, hydrogen, and metals have practically disappeared,
and we deal with carbon absorption alone.

But the other group of coolest stars presents us with quite new phe-
nomena. We no longer deal with absorption alone, but accompanying
it we have radiation, so that the spectra contain both dark lines and
bright ones. Now, since such spectra are visible in the case of new
stars, the ephemera of the skies, which may be said to exist only for an
instant relatively, and when the disturbance which gives rise to their
sudden appearance has ceased we find their places occupied by neb-
ule, we cannot be dealing here with stars like the sun, which has
already taken some millions of years to slowly cool, and requires more
millions to complete the process into invisibility.

The bright lines seen in the large number of permanent stars which
resemble these fleeting ones—new stars, as they are called—are those
discerned in the once mysterious nebule which, so far from being stars,
were supposed not many years ago to represent a special order of
created things.

Now the nebule differ from stars generally in the fact that in their

_ spectra we have practically to deal with radiation alone; we study them

by their bright lines; the conditions which produce the absorption by

which we study the chemistry of the hottest stars are absent.

A NEW VIEW OF STARS.

Here, then, we are driven to the perfectly new idea that some of the
cooler bodies in the heavens, the temperature of which is increasing and
which appear to us as Stars, are really disturbed nebule.

What, then, is the chemistry of the nebule? It is mainly gaseous;
the lines of helium and hydrogen and the flutings of carbon, already
studied by their absorption in the groups of stars to which I have
already referred, are present as bright ones.

The presence of the lines of the metals iron, calcium, and probably
magnesium, shows us that we are not dealing with gases merely.

Of the enhanced metallic lines there are none; only the low temper-
ature lines are present, so far as we yet know. The temperature, then,
is low, and lowest of all in those nebulz where carbon flutings are seen
almost alone.

A NEW VIEW OF NEBULZ.

Passing over the old views, among them one that the nebule were
holes in something dark which enabled us to see something bright
beyond, and another that they were composed of a fiery fluid, I may
say that not long ago they were supposed to be masses of gases only,
existing at a very high temperature.

Now, since gases may glow at a low temperature as well as at a high
176 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.

one, the temperature evidence must depend upon the presence of cool
metallic lines and the absence of the enhanced ones.

The nebule, then, are relatively cool collections of some of the per-
manent gases and of some cool metallic vapors, and both gases and
metals are precisely those I have referred to as writing their records
most visibly in stellar atmospheres.

Now, can we get more information concerning this association of cer-
tain gases and metals? In laboratory work it is abundantly recog-
nized that all meteorites (and many minerals) when slightly heated
give out permanent gases, and under certain conditions the spectrum
of the nebulz may in this way be closely approximated to. I have not
time to labor this point, but I may say that a discussion of all the
available observations to my mind demonstrates the truth of the sug-
gestion, made many years ago by Professor Tait before any spectro-
scopic facts were available, that the nebule are masses of meteorites
rendered hot by collisions.

Surely human knowledge is all the richer for this indication of the
connection between the nebule, hitherto the most mysterious bodies
in the skies, and the “stones that fall from heaven.”

CELESTIAL EVOLUTION.

But this is, after all, only a steppingstone, important though it be.
It leads us to a vast generalization. If the nebule are thus composed,
they are bound to condense to centers, however vast their initial pro-
portions, however irregular the first distribution of the cosmic clouds
which compose them. Hach pair of meteorites in collision puts us in
- mental possession of what the final stage must be. We begin with a
feebleabsorption of metallic vapors round each meteorite in collision; the
space between the meteorites is filled with the permanent gases driven
out farther afield and having no power to condense. Hence dark
metallic and bright gas lines. As time goes on the former must pre-
dominate, for the whole swarm of meteorites will then form a gaseous
sphere with a strongly heated center, the light of which will be absorbed
by the exterior vapor.

The temperature order of the group of stars with bright lines as well
as dark ones in their spectra has been traced, and typical stars indi-
cating the chemical changes have been as carefully studied as those in
which absorption phenomena are visible alone, so that now there are
no breaks in the line connecting the nebule with the stars on the verge
of extinction.

Here we are brought to another tremendous outcome—that of the
evolution of all cosmical bodies from meteorites, the various stages
recorded by the spectra being brought about by the various conditions
which follow from the conditions.

These are, shortly, that at first collisions produce luminosity among
the colliding particles of the swarm, and the permanent gases are given

off and fill the interspaces. As condensation goes on, the temperature

at the center of condensation always increasing, all the meteorites in
time are driven into a state of gas. The meteoritic bombardment prac-
tically now ceases for lack of material, and the future history of the
mass of gas is that of a cooling body, the violent motions in the atmos-
phere while condensation was going on now being replaced by a rela-
tive calm.

The absorption phenomena in stellar spectra are not identical at the
Same mean temperature on the ascending and descending sides of
the curve, on account of the tremendous difference in the physical
conditions.

In a condensing swarm, the center of which is undergoing meteoritic
bombardment from all sides, there can not be the equivalent of the
solar chromosphere; the whole mass is made up of heterogeneous vapor

at different temperatures and moving with different velocities in dif-
ferent regions.

In a condensed swarm, of which we can take the sun as a type, all
action produced from without has practically ceased; we get relatively
a quiet atmosphere and an orderly assortment of the vapors from top
to bottom, disturbed only by the fall of condensed metallic vapors.
But stiil, on the view that the differences in the spectra of the heavenly
bodies chiefly represent differences in degree of condensation and tem-
perature, there can be, au fond, no great chemical difference between
bodies of increasing and bodies of decreasing temperature. Hence we
find at equal mean temperatures on opposite sides of the temperature
curve this chemical similarity of the absorbing vapors proved by many
points of resemblance in the spectra, especially the identical behavior
of the enhanced metallic and cleveite lines.

CELESTIAL DISSOCIATION.

The time you were good enough to put at my disposal is now exhausted,
_but I can not conclude without stating that I have not yet exhausted
all the conceptions of a high order to which Fraunhofer’s apparently
useless observation has led us.

The work which to my mind has demonstrated the evolution of the
cosmos as we know it from swarms of meteorites, has also suggested a
chemical evolution equally majestic in its simplicity.

A quarter of a century ago I pointed out that all the facts then avail-
able suggested the hypothesis that in the atmospheres of the sun and
stars various degrees of ‘celestial dissociation ” were at work, a ‘“ disso-
ciation” which prevented the coming together of the finest particles of
matter which at the temperature of the earth and at all artificial tem-
perature yet attained here compose the metals, the metalloids and
compounds.

On this hypothesis the so-called atoms of the chemist represent not
the origins of ae but only early stages of the evolutionary process.

SM

178 THE CHEMISTRY OF THE STARS.

At the present time we have tens of thousands of facts which were
not available twenty-five years ago. All these go to the support of the
hypothesis, and among them I must indicate the results obtained at
the last eclipse, dealing with the atmosphere of the sun in relation to
that of the various stars of higher temperature to which I called your
attention. In this way we can easily explain the enhanced lines of iron
existing practically alone in Alpha Cygni. I have yet to learn any
other explanation.

I have nothing to take back, either from what I then said or what I
have said since on this subject, and although the view is not yet
accepted, I am glad to know that many other lines of work which are
now being prosecuted tend to favor it.

I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that in a not distant
future the inorganic evolution to which we have been finally led by
following up Fraunhofer’s useless experiment will take its natural place
side by side with that organic evolution the demonstration of which has
been one of the glories of the nineteenth century.

And finally now comes the moral of my address. If I have helped to
show that observations having no immediate practical bearing may yet
help on the thought of mankind, and that this is a thing worth the
doing, let me express a hope that such work shall find no small place
in the future University of Birmingham.
THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

By GEORGES LECHALAS

Twenty years ago, while on a railway car, I accidentally made an
observation which strongly attracted my attention. Having held one
eye closed for a certain time, I reopened it during the passage of the
train through a tunnel. The consciousness of a profound inequality in
the vision of my two eyes led me to close them alternately, and | thus
verified not only that the sensitiveness of the eye previously closed was
greater than that of the other, exposed just before to the full light,
but also that there was a profound difference in the coloration of the
images. While in fact the image corresponding to the latter was quite
clearly yellowish, the other was white or even of a violet hue. This
violet tint, if real, could be explained by the phenomenon of contrast
with the yellow ot the other eye; but it nevertheless persisted, not-
withstanding the fact that yellow light, thrown by a lamp on objects,
appeared white to an eye which had ceased to be adapted to solar light.

This observation naturally leads to the hypothesis that color has only
a purely relative value, and that light of every color should appear col-
orless to an eye which has been in repose. To verify this hypothesis I
bandaged both eyes, and at the expiration of ten minutes I opened
them again in a room illuminated through a plate of blue gelatin. The
blue color was found to be much fainter, but quite distinguishable.
Repeating the experiment with a plate of red gelatin, no attenuation of
color was observed, although both eyes had been kept in darkness for
a Still longer time. The hypothesis was thus disproved by experiment.
I did not continue the investigation, for which, besides, I was not prop-
erly equipped with apparatus. If I had better followed the trend of
scientific research I would have known that Dr. Charpentier, professor in
the medical faculty at Nancy, had already devoted himself to extremely
interesting studies of this class of phenomena, in which he was soon
followed by Dr. Parinaud; then the Germans entered the lists, and
to-day there exists an extensive scientific literature on the subject. It
possibly will not, therefore, be uninteresting to give a résumé of the
conclusions thus far deduced from the experimental results obtained.

180 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

Let us begin with a study of the psychic phenomena which have been
observed—that is to say, the sensations and perceptions; next we will
consider the physiological phenomena to which these psychic phe-
nomena appear related, and finally the theories which have been erected
on the framework of this ensemble of facts will be briefly reviewed.

I.—PSYCHIC PHENOMENA.

The phenomena which we are about to describe were first discussed
in M. Charpentier’s publications, as has already been stated, but the
results reached by him are of a more complicated character than those
of M. Parinaud, whose first contribution on the subject was published
in 1881, while that of his rival dates back to i877. Itis asif Regnault’s
work had preceded that of Mariotte. Without pretending to decide
their dispute in regard to priority, let us remark that it is easier to
begin by a study of Mariotte, or in the present case of Parinaud. The
latter, in a recently published treatise, summarizes the results of his
experiments on the adaptation of the retina to obscurity as follows:

1. The increase in the sensitiveness of the retina, which characterizes
adaptation to obscurity, varies according to the wave length of the
light; it is greater the smaller the wavelength. The influence of adap-
tation which is zero for spectral red becomes considerable for the violet
and ultraviolet.

2. This increase of sensitiveness affects only the luminous value of
simple light. The color appears brighter and less saturated. Finally,
after a sufficient time spent in darkness, the purest spectral colors of
feeble intensity are perceived as uncolored light, the red alone excepted.

3. This increase in the sensitiveness is lacking in the fovea.' The
fovea does not participate in retinal adaptation. The sensation of color
not being altered by adaptation in the fovea, luminous impressions are
always perceived in that region as colors.?

On reading these enunciations one is struck by the very characteristic
fact that although white has generally been considered as being essen-
tially a complex color, we see that for luminous excitations received
outside the fovea all light, the red excepted, is perceived first as color-
less and, for a retina adapted to obscurity, remains strongly diluted in
appearance, whatever be its intensity. There are, then, two kinds of
sensibility which, according to M. Charpentier, may be distinguished
by the terms luminous sensibility (properly so called) and chromatic
sensibility *. It may be remarked that, although disregarded in the old
scientific literature, these two kinds of sensibility have been long
familiar to ordinary observation. ‘At night all cats are gray,” says the

spot and on which the image is focused in central vision.

proverb, and how often have we not repeated: “It is too dark to dis-
tinguish colors.” The poet Racan, who had an affection for nature so
rare in his time, tells us furthermore in his Bergeries:

“The shades of night with their own dusky hue
Alike the meadows and the fields imbue.” !

Before taking up the study of Charpentier’s researches we will first
consider the variation of chromatic sensibility in the different parts of
the retina. ‘To quote M. Parinaud: ‘Chromatic sensibility decreases
from the center to the periphery, whether or not the retina be adapted
to obscurity. Besides, it decreases unequally for the different colors.
The radial distance at which a color ceases to be perceived varies
according to the intensity of illumination, the saturation of the color,
and in addition according to the extent of the colored surface. It is
therefore difficult to define the. extent of the field of vision for each
color. The relations which these fields of vision bear to one another
are, on the contrary, quite fixed. The fundamental colors are lost to
perception in passing from the center to the periphery of the retina in
the following order: Green, red, yellow, blue. It may be said with truth
that the peripheral parts of the retina present a normal Daltonism;
indeed, in certain regions one can observe color-blindness for the green
and red, with normal vision for the yellow and blue, as in Daltonism.”?

Mention must also be made of the faculty of visual definition—that
is to say, of the faculty of perceiving forms. ‘This attains its greatest
perfection in the fovea, and decreases rapidly with the distance there-
from; but, as stated above, when the retina is strongly adapted the
fovea is relatively much less sensitive than the exterior parts of the
retina. The latter tend to supplement the central portions, and thus
the definition increases from the center to the periphery.

Let us now study anew the same phenomena under the direction of
Charpentier. There will necessarily be some repetition, but it may not
be without interest to clearly understand in what respects this investi-
gator agrees with the former and in what he differs. A résumé of his
investigations has been given in the treatise already cited, ‘‘ La Lumiére
et les Couleurs,” and also in an article on “‘ The origin and mechanism
of the different varieties of luminous sensations.” *

“Tn exploring, by means of a special photometer and by the method
of minimum perceptibility, the sensitiveness of different parts of the
retina, I have shown,” says Charpentier, “that the acuteness of per-
ception of uncolored light (that is, white light, including the different
shades between white and black) is equally great on every part of
the retina except at the center, where it is least. Color sensibility

review had published M. Parinaud’s article on the functions of the retina (April, 1898).
182 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

varies in an entirely different manner; it diminishes regularly from the
center to the periphery, where it has even appeared to certain experi-
menters to be entirely absent.' * * * The sensation of white, which
according to Helmholtz is the most complex sensation, is, on the con-
trary, the most simple and the one most easily produced. If any
simple spectral color be presented to the eye, the first sensation
produced (that which requires the least light for exciting the retina)
is a purely colorless sensation. To produce the idea of color it is neces-
sary to more strongly excite the retina, to present to it a much stronger
stimulus. * * *

“Then, again, these two functions may vary independently of one
another, not only on account of their different localization, but also
because of the different influences exerted on them by certain physio-
logical conditions. Thus I showed in 1878 that the adaptation of the
eye to obscurity increases the luminous sensibility and hardly affects
the chromatic sensibility; hence the fact, inexplicable in the Helm-
holtz theory, that a simple color seen by an eye that has been kept in
darkness is perceived mixed with white. If this is taken together with
the fact that a pure color that appears saturated at the center of the
retina, appears more and more mixed with white (finally becoming
entirely white or gray) in proportion as it is viewed more indirectly, it
is easily seen with what facility white is produced by a physically
simple excitation. * * *

“On December 27, 1880, I differentiated a new function of the
retina, independent of luminous sensibility and of chromatic sensi-
bility, namely, visual sensibility. i showed that the perception of a
group of small luminous points in central, vision passes through two
phases,’ precisely analogous to the two phases of color perception; the
- one of indistinct vision (gross visual sensibility), the other of distinct
vision (visual sensibility, properly so called). The first requires for its
excitation less light than the second and may vary independently of
the other.”

After having alluded to the researches of M. Parinand of 1891, M.
Charpentier continues as follows: 3

‘““During these two years MM. Macé de Lépinay and Nicati published
their valuable researches on the distribution of brightness and of visual
definition in the spectrum, and discovered the important fact that
luminous intensity and visibility do not vary in the same ratio from
-one color to another, the brightness relatively predominating in the
more refrangible part of the spectrum.”

These statements, which are taken from the article in the Revue
Générale, could be advantageously completed by the details given in —
the treatise on light and color; but, for the sake of brevity, we will
simply give the results of the experiments made for the purpose of
determining the ratio between the intensity required for producing a
luminous sensation and a clearly distinguishable color sensation through-
out the different parts of the spectrum.

1 Charpentier adds that this is erroneous.
2 By direct vision, is understood vision by means of the fovea; and by indirect
vision, that by means of the eccentric parts of the retina.

It should be remarked that these ratios! were determined for an
eye kept for twenty minutes in darkness. If an eye not adapted had
been tested the above ratios would have been reduced, as it is well
known that its luminous sensibility is much less. Itis, however, a very
interesting fact that the quantity of light necessary for the perception of
color remains very nearly constant. Furthermore, if one adds white light
to a mono-chromatic light, the quantity of the latter necessary for the
recognition of its color remains almost invariable. If the results
obtained by M. Charpentier and M. Parinaud are compared, it will be
seen that they differ but slightly. According to M. Parinaud, red cannot
give rise to a luminous sensation without color, even in indirect vision,
and, on the other hand, in the yellow spot all the colors appear at first
sight as colored. Although M. Charpentier denies these propositions,
he nevertheless recognizes that chromatic sensibility is best developed
at the center of the retina. M. Parinaud, on his side, formally recog-
nizes the decrease of chromatic sensibility from the center to the periph-
ery of the retina, and even his denial that red can produce a luminous
sensation without color is not absolute, since he recognizes that certain
parts of the retina can not perceive this color.

As we have stated above, the German physicists and physiologists
took up the study of the same phenomena after the French savants,
and, judging from the excellent reviews published by M. Victor Henri
in successive volumes of ‘“ L’Année Psychologique,” the phenomena
observed across the Rhine are in exact agreement with the enuncia-
tions of M. Parinaud. It is, however, to be regretted that his fre-
quent visits to the German laboratories have prevented M. Henri from
reminding Koenig and Von Kries to respect the rights of priority of
Charpentier and Parinaud.* Professor Nuel, of Ghent, in reviewing the
researches of Von Kries in “ Les Archives d@’Ophtalmologie,” adds to his
analysis the following reflections: ‘It seems to me that the authors
across the Rhine are too neglectful of the preponderating merit which
our French collaborators have had in the elaboration of these new
ideas.” Without wishing to dwell longer than necessary on this detail,
[ have thought that it should not be passed over in silence.

The first publication of Von Kries on this subject appeared in 1894,
and (thanks to the review by M. Victor Henri) we will be able to sum-
marize his results. Hillebrand had shown in 1889 that if the eye be
adapted to obscurity, a spectrum whose brightness is continuously

1La Revue Générale, etc., July 15, 1898, p. 214.
184 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

decreased will finally appear as an illuminated colorless band. Repeat-
ing this experiment, Von Kries showed that this is only true for indirect
vision for the fovea, although less sensitive to the simple luminous
sensation, perceives the colors disappear without becoming white.

In the same year Koenig made similar observations.

In 1895 Hering, in an important paper on the Purkinje phenomenon, of
which we will speak later, established the fact that with dark sur-
roundings colors appear less saturated, a result of great importance,
according to M. Henri, although well known for a number of years, as
we might add.

In 1896 Von Kries established the fact that in the fovea the ratio of
the intensities of the different spectral colors does not vary with the
illumination, as is the case in indirect vision. He also showed that red
is an exception to the law according to which spectral colors appear as
uncolored in indirect vision.

In 1897 the investigations on visual sensations rapidly increased,
especially in the laboratory of Von Kries at Freiburg, in Breisgau.

Von Kries, in collaboration with Dr. Nagel, was engaged particularly
in experimentally testing Hering’s law in regard to the white value of
a mixture of two spectral colors, and they discovered that, even if it
be verified by observations made with the yellow spot, it is no longer
- the same in indirect vision by means of a retina adapted to obscurity.!
They also studied the variations in the brightness of different colors,
according as the eye is adapted to the full daylight or to obscurity.
They showed that in central vision colors never give rise to the sensa-
tion of gray, aS in peripheral vision, and finally they determined the
sensitiveness of the different parts of the retina to various chromatic
excitations.

Interesting comparisons might be made between their numerical re-
sults and those obtained by MM. Charpentier and Parinaud, but taken
as a whole they do not bring to light anything new. Kries and his
collaborators have, however, made curious observations on subjects
totally or partially color-blind, of which we shall have occasion to speak
later. Concerning some of the experiments of Shermann that tend to
prove, in contradiction to Kries and Koenig (and let us add in contra-
diction to Parinaud, but in agreement with Charpentier), that points
very feebly illuminated are seen as uncolored by the yellow spot, M.
Henri objects that the fixation of the images is very difficult under
these circumstances and consequently these images may very easily
wander from the aforesaid spot.

By this brief analysis of the German researches it may be seen
that as a whole they have fully confirmed the results previously
obtained by Charpentier and Parinaud. Before taking up a study of
the physiological conditions which appear to underlie these phenomena

‘Tt is unfortunate that M. Victor Henri, ordinarily so exact, has given in his
analysis a table of figures difficult to interpret.
THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR. 185

it remains to -be shown how they account for certain well-known facts
which have remained isolated and have not appeared to be logically
connected with the rest.

In 1825 Purkinje pointed out the change which a color undergoes
if its intensity be gradually diminished; for example, if we take two
pieces of colored paper, the one red and the other blue, the latter of
which, under a moderate illumination, appears darker than the former,
and gradually decrease the illumination of the chamber in which
they are placed, the blue paper will gradually be seen to become
_relatively lighter than the red. Indeed it is possible, by still further
diminishing the intensity of illumination, to reach a stage when the
blue paper will appear whitish gray and the red paper entirely black.
This is called the Purkinje phenomenon. Parinaud, in a résumé of his
previous studies in his treatise on vision,’ explains the phenomenon in
this manner: “It is not the differences of intensity of the colors that
produces the phenomenon, but differences in the illumination of the.
retina which observes them. The phenomenon is due, not to an objec-
tive, but to a subjective cause, and finds its natural explanation in the
properties of the retina. It results from the unequal influence of the
adaptation of the retina to rays of different refrangibility, and also
from the fact that adaptation only aftects the luminous value of colors
and not the color sensation itself.”

Hering, in an article published in 1895, arrived at analogous conclu-
sions. He discovered, in fact, that the diminution in the intensity of
colors alone is not sufficient to produce the Purkinje phenomenon; this
manifests itself if the room in which the subject is placed be darkened,
and is the more pronounced the more perfectly the eye is adapted to
obscurity. It is more characteristic of indirect than of direct vision.

In 1896 Von Kries showed that the Purkinje phenomenon is absent in
direct vision, and for indirect vision its intensity is proportional to the
degree of adaptation of the eye to darkness.

All these results, according to Parinaud, appear fully esalained by
the fundamental phenomena discovered by himself and Charpentier.
The latter, however, explains the results in an entirely different man-
ner. By observing for each spectral color the additional illumination
which is necessary to enable the eye to distinguish the difference
between the new and the previous illumination, he deduces a curve
showing the relation between the intensity of the sensation and the
intensity of its stimulus, according to Fechner’s principle, without,
however, being able to verify the law which bears the latter’s name.
He has thus established that the less refrangible colors gain much
more in brightness than the more refrangible ones wher the intensity
of the light is continuously increased.” From this observation the Pur-
kinje-phenomenon can be deduced. It will also be remarked that

1Op. cit., p. 67.

186 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

these experiments were made on eyes adapted to obscurity. Under these-
circumstances it might possibly be questioned if, when the luminous
points observed become sufficiently bright, the adaptation of the cor-
responding points of the retina does not diminish. However, if this
were the case, it should result in increasing the smallest perceptible
difference for the more refrangible colors. It is quite evident that Char-
pentier’s explanation only differs in form from that of Parinaud. As
a counterproof it would be interesting to repeat Charpentier’s experi-
ments on eyes adapted to light, the eye being subjected to full daylight
between two consecutive observations. In passing | might call atten-
tion to a complex phenomenon, easily observable, in which the Pur-
kinje phenomenon is greatly exaggerated by the effect of contrast.

In a poorly illuminated church just at daybreak the stained-glass
windows at a certain moment assume an aspect that is at first surpris-
ing; of all the colors, the blue alone appears with any brilliancy.
It would be superfluous to emphasize the fact that the contrast of
the yellowish color of the interior light is added to the Purkinje
phenomenon.

There is another fact to which I have not as yet alluded, but which
I have always observed in myself. When attempting, in a poor
light, to read fine print I instinctively make use of monocular vision.
This appears to result from the fact that under these circumstances one
naturally has recourse to indirect vision, which is alone benefited by
adaptation to obscurity and which is difficult to adjust to binocular
vision. It would be possible to continue the enumeration of phenomena
related to the fundamental observations of Charpentier and Parinaud,
but it is better to turn now to the examination of the anatomical struc-
tures and the chemico-physiological phenomena which appear to be
related to the characteristic perceptions which we have been discussing.

II.— PHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.

It is well known that the optie nerve, after having entered the eye-
ball at the blind spot, designated as the papilla, spreads out in such a
manner as to form what is called the internal layer of the retina, but
which could as well be called its external layer, for while it is internal —
from the geometric standpoint, as being nearer to the center of the
eyeball, it is external with respect to the tissues which envelop the eye.
The nerve fibers thus spread out curve back toward the exterior, and
finally terminate in the layer of rods and cones, or Jacob’s membrane,
about 50 microns thick. This layer is covered with pigmentary cells,
in which the terminal organs of the optic nerve are more or less buried.
It should be pointed out, furthermore, that the nerve fibers, before
reaching the membrane, penetrate, one by one, large cells which are
provided with many prolongations toward the external layers. This
description is quite abbreviated, for not less than 10 different layers
are distinguishable within the thickness of the retina. An examina-
THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR. 187

tion of the different regions of the retina shows that the cones, which

are on the average 20 times less numerous than the rods, alone exist in
the yellow spot, but are more and more outnumbered by the rods as
one approaches the periphery. The cones of the “macula” or yellow
spot are, besides, more elongated and smaller than those of the rest of
the retina. The multipolar cells, referred to above, increase in number
and are only bipolar in the macwa, but they disappear in the fovea
which lies at the center of the spot.

Besides these details in regard to the constitution of the retina, those
concerning visual purple or erythropsine must be given. For many
years certain anatomists had called attention to a red pigment in the
retinas of certain animals, but the credit of emphasizing the importance
of this substance belongs to Boll.’ In 1876 he discovered the existence
ot a red coloring matter in the rods of the frog, which undergoes a change
if subjected to the influence of light. This material, which remains

unchanged in frogs kept in obscurity, becomes paler when the animals
_are exposed to the light, and if they are kept in sunlight the retina

becomes colorless. Retinas removed in darkness may take several
minutes to decolorize in daylight. In mammals the decolorization is
much more rapid. Boll established, furthermore, that the color lost in
frogs exposed to sunlight is reproduced in darkness, but he was not able
to recognize the nature of this coloration, which he was led to attribute
to a lamellar structure of the rods and not to a coloring matter. Kiihne
succeeded, on the other hand, in isolating the coloring matter by means
of a solution of bile or of cholate of sodium. The solution of visual
purple thus obtained changes from red to yellow under the influence of
light, and finally becomes colorless. This decoloration, according to
Kiihne, is, moreover, much more rapid in that region of the spectrum
comprised between the greenish-yellow and the indigo than elsewhere.
Red is the least active color, even less active than the ultraviolet rays.

The yellow material, produced by a partial decomposition of the vis-

nal red, follows a slightly different law of decoloration. The chemical

action of radiations being related to their absorption, the decolorizing
action, nearly absent in the red and yellow, is at a maximum in the
violet and is quite strongly developed in the ultraviolet.

Without wishing to enter into a discussion of the details of these
experiments, we can hardly omit reference to veritable photographs,
known under the name of optograms, which Kiihne has been able to
produce on the retinas of rabbits and frogs. It might be pointed out
that, disregarding certain apparent exceptions, nocturnal animals have
a retina abundantly provided with visual purple, while the purple, as
well as the rods, is wanting in those animals which sleep at night—for
example, poultry.

The visual purple has still another characteristic property. Previous

March 30, 1895, is freely made use of in the résumé of this subject.
188 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

to the discovery of Boll, Helmholtz had discovered the phenomenon of
fluorescence in the retina; Ewald and Kiihne established the fact that
this property belongs only to those parts of the retina which contain
the purple. In order to verify this in a marked manner it is necessary,
however, to experiment with an unbleached retina from the living
subject. <A retina saturated with purple gives rise to a whitish fluor-
escence, which changes to greenish as soon as the retinal yellow
predominates, and finally becomes green for a decolorized retina.
These observations, of a physical character, bring us at once to a con-
sideration of the principal hypotheses which have been suggested to
connect them with the phenomena of sensibility discussed in Part LI.
The theories (properly so called) which attempt to explain in a system-
atic manner the origin of color sensation will be reserved for Part III.

From 1881 to 1885 Parinaud published a series of studies in which he
emphasized the separate and distinct roles played by the rods and the
cones in vision. As stated above, neither rods nor visual purple are
found in the fovea of which the sensitiveness is not at all increased by
darkness; and, moreover, since darkness influences only the luminous
sensation and not the chromatic sensation, we may conclude that the
cones are the organs of color sensation, while the rods and the visual
purple have nothing to do with it. Parinaud finds a confirmation of
this opinion in persons afflicted with hemeralopia; that is to say, inca-
pable of seeing in a dim light. In these the functions of the fovea,
where there is no purple, are intact; and on the other hand, hemeralo-
pia carries with it no deterioration of color vision. Moreover, in Dal-
tonism the luminous value of the colors not perceived is unaffected, at
least if the retina be adapted to obscurity.

Later, in 1894, Parinaud emphasized the role which the fluorescence
of the retina plays in luminous sensation. Helmholtz denied this
explanation, basing his argument on its greenish coloration. This
coloration is, moreover, not essential, as we have seen, and there can,
moreover, be no necessary correlation between the objective properties
of the luminous agent and the sensation which it provokes; however, it
does not seem to us that Parinaud gives any proof of his own hypothe-
Sis, Since, as fluorescence constantly accompanies the purple and never
exists without it, it therefore appears impossible to separate its influ-
ence from that of the other properties of the purple. Nevertheless,
it should be pointed out that the sensation provoked by the blue, violet,
and ultraviolet radiations on a retina previously subjected to darkness
presents the special characteristics of sensations produced by fluo-
rescing bodies, and that the highly refrangible radiations are at the
same time those which affect the purple and produce the phenomena of
fluorescence.

However this may be, Parinaud admits that there is a certain difference
between the action of visual purple and the fluorescence of inorganic
substances. The latter does not appear to be accompanied by any dis-
THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR. 189

engagement of electricity or heat, while several experimenters have
verified that it is otherwise in the case at hand. Since 1874— that is to
say, before the discovery of visual purple—Dewar has recognized that
the action of light on the retina is accompanied by the development of
an electro-motive force, measurable by means of a galvanometer.
Having confirmed this observation, Johannes Chatin established the
effect of obscuration on the intensity of the current and the unequal
action of the different radiations; in addition, he verified that the
greatest electro-motive force is found in those species in which the
purple predominates, as in the lobster. All these circumstances tend
to show that the disengagement of electricity is principally caused by
physico-chemical action that has its seat in the visual purple.

The conceptions of Parinaud, which may indeed be reduced .to the
perception of colors by the cones and of colorless light by the rods
under the action of the purple, have been readopted by Von Kries
since 1894, and, indeed, M. Victor Henri, in referring to them, constantly
calls it the theory of Kries. Parinaud, who claims very properly the
rights of priority, moreover adds that Schultze, as early as 1866,
pointed out the probable difference in the role of the cones and that of
the rods, a difference which he based on their unequal distribution in
the retina and on the diminution in the intensity of color vision at its
periphery, where the cones are rare. Schultze’s opinion, however,
remained unnoticed, but fortunately it has now been completed by the
discovery of the purple and all the investigations that have been made
upon it. Therefore Schultze appears to deserve an eminent place in
the development of the subject near Parinaud. The investigations of
Koenig and of Kiihne appear to be much more original than those of
Kries; for by comparing the absorption curves of visual purple and
yellow, in different parts of the spectrum, with those of the luminous
impression and its variation for the different spectral colors, they
have truly completed the results of Parinaud. In the article of Weiss,
already referred to, I found some very curious curves, showing the
proportionality between the luminous impression and the absorption
of the rays by the visual purple. We shall have occasion to return to
these investigations in Part III.

I1l.— THEORIES OF COLOR PERCEPTION.

In all that precedes we have seen that certain anatomical elements
appear to be involved in color perception and that the different radia-
tions exercise an influence more or less great on the luminous sen-
sation, but nothing has so far been said concerning the mechanism of
differentiation in color perception. Here it must be clearly recognized
that we are on unsafe ground; on account of the lack of sufficient
experimental evidence, the hypotheses become more audacious and are
often too far removed from the possibility of experimental control.
190 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

Nevertheless, a rapid review of the principal hypotheses which have
been advanced by scientists may not be entirely without interest.

The first hypothesis that presents itself to the mind is the assump-
tion that for each wave length of light there corresponds a distinet
kind of excitation of the optic nerve, and consequently a distinct sen-
sation, but this idea, which at first sight appears so simple, is open
to a very grave objection, which has given birth to the trichromatic
theory which the name of the great Helmholtz has endowed with a
remarkable authority, notwithstanding that he is not the author of the
theory; neither does he claim authorship, for he has himself declared
that it was borrowed from Young. It seems, moreover, that it was
developed several years before the publication of his treatise on physio-
logical. optics, with all the accompaniment of general conceptions that
give to it its philosophic scope.

We now turn to the consideration of a treatise that appeared in
1855, entitled, ‘‘ Klectro-dynamisme vital,” under the nom de plume of
Philips, under which the real author, M. Durand (de Gros), then pro-
scribed, hid his identity. The basis of the trichromatic theory is found
in the doctrine of the specific energy of the nerves, according to which
each nerve filament can only act in a single manner, and consequently
can only provoke sensations differentiated by their intensity. Apply-
ing this theory to the whole nervous system, Durand summarizes it as
follows:

“1, The nature of each animal or vegetal function depends essen-
We on the characteristic activity of its corresponding nerve fiber or
fibers.

‘69. The characteristic activity of every nerve fiber is its invariable
attribute.” |

Applying this theory further on he expresses himself thus:

‘Tt would be carrying these principles too far to assume the existence
of a distinet faculty and of a distinct individual nerve fiber for each of
the varieties of sensation that can be experienced. It is conceivable,
indeed, that the same agent might excite the same sensitive faculty
with ai unequal intensity * * *. Thus, although still remaining
invariable in its nature, a sensitive faculty might vary in the degree of
excitation to which it is susceptible, and, moreover, it is very easy to
comprehend that two or more sensitive faculties excited simultaneously
might give rise to a compound sensation, which it would consequently
be improper to attribute to a new elementary faculty or to a particular .
nerve fiber.” ”

In a special consideration of the sense of sight Durand remarks
that, although the advocates of the theory of special nerve fibers are
correct in not admitting that the nerve fibers affected in color sen-
sations are localized in distinct portions of the retina (under these con-
ditions objects would change color if displaced), there would be
no Yufeoua to a different subdivision of the fibers. He states that

ee) 57, 2 Page 154
THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR. 191

we are not obliged to assume that each kind of fibers constitutes a
bundle of which the base forms a continuous portion of the field of
view. To quote Durand: “On the contrary, we may conceive that
these three different kinds of fibers are intercombined in their simple
units in such a way that all parts of the retina present a homogeneous
mixture of these fibers, so that on whatever point of the retina a ray
of a given color should fall it would be sure to encounter there a
corresponding fiber adapted to receive its impression.”

We have just seen that Durand assumes that three kinds of fibers
are sufficient to produce all color sensations, and this is also the num-

ber adopted by Helmholtz, but the latter attributed to them the per-
ception of the red, green, and violet sensations, while Durand considered
the red, yellow, and blue sensations as primary.

As it is hardly possible to assume that the light waves are trans-
mitted as such through the nerve fibers; the velocity of propagation of
nerve excitations being incomparably less than that of ether waves, it
is evident that one must assume that they undergo some transforma-
tion in the retina. This explains why the theory of Helmholtz is in
very good agreement with the hypothesis that there is an intervening
step of a chemical nature between the luminous radiation and the exci-

tation of the optic nerve. Koenig has remained faithful to this theory,

although he includes a fourth sensation, the gray sensation, due to
the decomposition of the visual purple. Experiments seem to him to
indicate that the retinal yellow is involved in the production of the
blue sensation; the red and green sensations he attributes to substances
still unknown. The inclusion of the gray sensation appears to me,
however, to necessitate the assumption of a fourth kind of nerve fiber,
and in addition there would still remain to be discovered two new
visual substances.

Hering assumes that there are only three visual substances, but he
boldly attacks the dogma of specific nerve fibers, for he supposes that
the opposite chemical reactions [anabolic and catabolic changes], which
each of these three substances is capable of undergoing, produce the
complementary sensations (green, blue, and black, corresponding re-
spectively to red, yellow, and white).

‘Ebbinghaus is said to have adopted this theory, completing it by
_ Ineans of some recent discoveries; but it appears to us, on the con-
trary, that he has altered the fundamental idea, for he assumes that
each of the substances is capable of undergoing not two opposite
chemical reactions, but a single reaction in two stages. The absorp-
tion spectrum of visual purple has its maximum between the D and EH
lines of Frauenhofer; the yellow, resulting from the partial decomposi-
tion of the red, has its maximum decomposition between the F and G
lines. But the study of a subject affected with Daltonism, for whom
there are only two colors—yellow and blue—has shown that while the
region of the spectrum in which the blue is for him most brilliant coin-
192 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

cides invariably with the region of maximum absorption for visual
yellow, the region corresponding to a maximum intensity of the yellow
may occupy two different positions, according to the subject selected.
Hence this peculiarity would correspond exactly to the existence of two
different purples, the one red and the other violet, the absorption bands
corresponding to the two varieties of Daltonism.

From these facts Ebbinghaus concludes that the visual purple is
involved in the perception of yellow, and the visual yellow in per-
ception of blue. In addition to these two substances, which are
derived from one another, he assumes the existence of a third, namely,
visual white, which by its transformation gives rise to the perception
of white and gray. In normal eyes he assumes a new substance which,
by transforming itself like visual purple, would give rise to the percep-
tions of red and green. It is quite evident what an important réle
unverified hypotheses play in this theory as in that of Koenig. Never-
theless, it might be remarked that the study of subjects afflicted with
achromatopsia, more or less complete, is susceptible of furnishing many
interesting results. ;

Von Kries and his pupils have for the most part been engaged in
observations of this nature. But if they believe that they have over-
thrown Hering’s theory, others like Kirschmann think that they can
show the insufficiency of every theory admitting only three sources of
luminous sensations. On the basis of a study of color-blindness the
latter believes that he has established that the customary division of
cases of color-blindness into blindness for blue and yellow and blind-
ness for red and green is insufficient to explain the facts.

With such an accumulation of data some are very likely to be in
contradiction to the others, and hence there rises the need of a synthetic
treatise criticising the different theories and combining them to form a
new one which can coordinate all psychological, physiological, patho-
logical, histological, and chemical data appertaining to the subject of
color vision. M. Victor Henri is of the opinion that a publication of
Prof. G. E. Miiller, of G6ttingen, on the ‘ Psycho-physics of visual
sensation” meets this desideratum. A very interesting analysis of his
results is to be found in the fourth volume of L’Année Psychologique,
but we shall have to limit ourselves to a statement of the conclusions
reached. All visual sensations are based on six chemical processes of
the retina, corresponding to the sensations of white, black, red, green,
yellow, blue; the author adopts, moreover, on the whole, the views of
Von Kries and Parinaud in regard to the role of the cones and rods.
He, however, contends that the visual substances are the same in both,

In a separate publication on the visual sensations produced by the
galvanic current, Miiller announces it as a general fact that when the
current passes through the eyes toward the back of the head the sub-
ject experiences a bright blue-red color sensation, while if the current
passes in the opposite direction the sensation produced is that of a
{

dark greenish-yellow. Here is a confirmation of the theory of reversed
chemical reactions on the retina. It would seem to us that this would
be rather an argument in favor of the three substances of Hering than
of the six substances of Miiller, but possibly we have not entirely
comprehended his theory, a disadvantage often unavoidable when one
_ works with a mere résumé, however well made. We are not confronted
by the same difficulty in reviewing the theories of MM. Nicati and
Charpentier, that of the former having been published in L’Annales
@Ophtalmologie, January, 1895. After having pointed out that lumi-
nous sensations of very small dimensions, although corresponding to a
retinal field smaller than the rod itself, are recognized in their proper
colors, and having concluded therefrom that the same rod must be
capable of transmitting different colors, the author assumes that there
should correspond to the different chemical actions, produced by the
different radiations, variations in the quantity and tension of the
electric currents engendered by them. The short radiations having
an intense and rapid action, should develop currents of maximum
quantity and minimum tension. These can only flow through nerve
filaments of small resistance—that is to say, the short and thick ones—
while the currents of high tension are able to follow the long and thin
filaments, which offer a greater resistance. These different currents
are discharged upon the optoblasts, which are differentiated by the
influence of habit and heredity, and hence result the differences in color
sensations.

Much more subtle and more complex in its details is the theory of
Charpentier. As we have already pointed out, he distinguishes, together
with Parinaud, three functions of the retina—luminous sensibility,
chromatic sensibility, and visual sensibility. Up to this time we have
not dwelt much on the latter, but if is to play a preponderating role
in the theory we are about to discuss, and it is therefore necessary to
dwell on this function somewhat before taking up the consideration of
the theory.

If, while in darkness, we determine the minimum illumination neces-
sary for the perception of a luminous surface of considerable extent,
we find there is no sensible difference in the aspect of that surface,
whether it be brightly or dimly illuminated; but if the surface be suf-
ficiently small it is seen under a minimum illumination as a diffused
spot with indistinct outlines always much larger than it really is. A
sharp perception of its form and dimensions requires a stronger
illumination.

The enlargement of a dimly illuminated image is explained by the
diffusion of the luminous impression on the retina or in the nerve centers,
a fact which has been thoroughly verified, but distinct vision evidently
requires an additional stimulus or the excitation of a new physiological
element. |

By means of very small holes, a millimeter apart, in an opaque screen,

sm 98——13
194 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

Charpentier has shown that from two or three times to eighteen or
twenty times more light is needed for distinguishing the luminous
points than for merely apprehending the primitive luminous sensation.
The difference is still greater for an adapted eye, as we might have fore-
seen, since it is known that adaptation does not develop the sensitive-
ness of the yellow spot, where visual perception is at its best. Continu-
ing the study of the phenomenon, if the small points are successively
iUluminated with the different spectral colors, and if the ratios of the
intensity required for the luminous sensation and that permitting a
distinction of the points be determined, it is observed that these ratios
exceed unity in proportion as the color is more refrangible. In this
connection we may recall analogous facts relative to the distinction
between luminous sensibility and color perception. This general agree-
ment, expressed in exact figures, is transformed into an almost rigor-
ous proportionality, for the ratio between the intensities required
for distinct vision of the points and for the perception of their
color only varies between 1.80 and 1.93, accordmg to the spectral color
employed.

From these facts Parinaud concluded that the retinal elements
involved in distinct vision are the same as those involved in color per-
ception, to which conclusion, however, Charpentier takes exception.
The latter points out that the distribution of visual sensibility through-
out the extent of the retina is not the same as that of color perception,
which decreases regularly from the center of the retina to its periphery,
while visual sensibility decreases much more rapidly. On the other
hand, in the fovea itself the perception of colors is almost zero, while
the visual sensibility has there its maximum.’ If it be remarked
that luminous sensibility is also very feeble in the fovea, one is led to
the conclusion that chromatic sensibility exists only in those regions
where both luminous and visual sensibilities exist at the same time,
and moreover that it undergoes variations throughout the extent of
the retina, which correspond sufficiently well to the mean of these two
functions.

One is thus led to the view that color sensation is due to the combined
action of the elements of both the luminous and visual sensibilities. It
is thus induced by a physiological fact, due to the simultaneous exist-
ence of two distinct impressions produced in the organ of sight by
luminous rays. Starting out from this conception, naturally suggested
by the facts, Charpentier formulates a bold theory of which he is the
first to recognize the highly hypothetical character, but which, it
appears to us, deserves a detailed analysis.

In seeking the possible nature of the two fundamental actions we are
led to the view that the former or photowsthetic action (being photo-
chemical) is due to the visual purple. The second or visual action

1 Corresponding with this fact, we find that the nerve cells in relation with the
macula are bipolar and not multipolar, as elsewhere in the retina.

THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR. 195

presents the peculiarity of being approximately proportional to the
absolute energy of the light, the intensity of which has been determined
in the different parts of the spectrum by Langley. From this propor-
tionality we may conclude that the light acts by itself in the visual
function, being without doubt integrally absorbed by a material which
is perhaps the pigment of Jacob’s membrane—a pigment which sur-
rounds and separates from one another the rods and the cones. This
absorption of light would heat the pigment and therefore the visual
elements, and might generate at the same time thermo-electric currents.
Vibrations of an indeterminate nature should thus be produced in the
nerve fibers, and these vibrations should be similar to each other as to
form and wave length, whatever be the nature of the exciting rays,
since it is the pigment which directly produces the excitation; the
visual elements, therefore, can not of themselves provoke a color sensa-
tion. It is quite easy to produce the luminous sensation independently
by means of any spectral ray whose intensity is too feeble to act on
the visual element, and, as is well known, a bluish-white sensation is
- produced by all colors. On the other hand, the visual sensation may
also be isolated by fatiguing the eye by a white light, sufficiently
intense to decrease the excitability of the photozsthetic element
below that of the visual element, under which conditions even the red
does not appear colored. For the same reason all colors, if of sufficient
intensity, giverise to a white sensation, and hence the above conjectures
are found to be verified. :

This granted, the calorific action and the chemical action of light
both give rise to undulations in the nerve fibers, and it is probable
that their wave lengths differ, but it must be assumed that these
lengths bear a simple ratio to one another, since they must give rise
to a complex vibration of a definite nature to produce a definite
color sensation. Recalling that the relative amplitude of the two
kinds of vibrations varies with the different colors, that for a given
amplitude of visual vibration the amplitude of the photochemical
undulation increases rapidly from the red to the violet, it will be
recognized that the form of the undulation should vary with the ratio
of the two amplitudes—that is to say, with the color. ;

Besides, M. Charpentier has demonstrated the existence of a reaction
time in the action of light on the organ of luminous sensibility—a
reaction time which increases from the red to the violet—while the
reaction time relative to visual sensibility does not vary with the
color. From this there results a new cause for variation in the form
of the resulting undulation, since the undulation of photochemical
origin does not coincide in phase with the undulation of pigmentary
origin. On the basis of this double difference of phase and relative
amplitude, and making certain arbitrary assumptions in regard to
the relative length of the two waves, as well as concerning the two
elements varying with the colors, M. Charpentier has constructed a
196 THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT AND COLOR.

number of curves which perfectly explain the laws of color mixture,
especially that of complementary colors.

Aside from its ingenuity, this theory presents a curious peculiarity
in giving an objective basis to the xsthetic affinity of colors and cer--
tain sounds, an affinity so definitely recognized in the German lan-
guage and by the majority of authorities on «esthetics. This affinity is,
however, in direct contradiction with physical phenomena, since colors
depend on the number of vibrations in a unit of time, and therefore
correspond to the pitch of a sound and not to its quality. We have
pointed out in a study on the relations between painting and music!
how we had to recognize that the esthetic imagination struggles against
this purely scientific objection, although we ourselves were disinclined,
for the above reasons, to admit the similarity of col r in light and
timbre in sound. Right or wrong, it is a satisfaction to us to see that
this contradiction can be removed by supposing a transformation to be
effected in our organism, thus permitting the difference in colors to
rest (just as those of quality in sound) on a difference in the form of
the vibrations or undulations. However this may be, M. Charpentier
has endeavored since 1885, when he first formulated his theory of color
vision, to verify it by experiments which, however, only appear to have
had a bearing upon the question of retinal vibrations, on which subject
he has published numerous articles since 1890. A list of these is given
in his article in the Revue Générale des Sciences.

It is to be hoped that he will not remain alone in the exploration of
this field, and that the German school will devote to it a little of the
zeal it fone: to the study of vision.

In bringing this article, which is devoid of any personal pretensions,
to a close, we can but regret its insufficiency in every respect. Our
aim will, however, have been attained if we have succeeded in directing
the attention of the reader unfamiliar with the subject to the great
interest of the researches on the subject we have specially considered,
and on still others tending to modify greatly the science of physio-
logical optics.

SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION:!
By SHELFORD BIDWELL, Esq., M. A., LL. B., F. R.S., M. BR. I.

The function of the eye, regarded as an optical instrument, is limited
to the formation of luminous images upon the retina. From a purely
physical point of view it is a simple enough piece of apparatus, and, as
was forcibly pointed out by Helmholtz, it is subject to a number of
defects which can be demonstrated by the simplest tests, and which
would, in a shop-bought instrument, be considered intolerable.

What takes place in the retina itself under luminous excitation, and
how the sensation of sight is produced, are questions which belong to
the sciences of physiology and psychology; and in the physiological
and psychological departments of the visual machinery we meet with
an additional host of objectionable peculiarities from which any
humanly constructed apparatus is by the nature of the case free.

Yet in spite of all these drawbacks our eyes do us excellent service,
and provided that they are free from actual malformation and have
not suffered from injury or disease, we do not often find fault with
them. This, however, is not because they are as good as they might
be, but because with incessant practice we have acquired a very high
degree of skill in their use. If anything is more remarkable than the
ease and certainty with which we have learned to interpret ocular indi-
cations when they are in some sort of conformity with external objects,
it is the pertinacity with which we refuse to be misled when our eyes
are doing their best to deceive us. In our earliest years we began to
find out that we must not believe all we saw. Experience gradually
taught us that on certain points and under certain circumstances the
indications of our organs of vision were uniformly meaningless or fal-
lacious, and we soon discovered that it would save us trouble and add
to the comfort of life if we cultivated a habit of completely ignoring all
such visual sensations as were of no practical value. In this most of
us have been remarkably successful, so much so that, if from motives
of curiosity or for the sake of scientific experiment, we wish to direct
our attention to the sensations in question and to see things as they

actually appear, we can only do so with the greatest difficulty; some-
times, indeed, not at all, unless with the assistance of some specially
contrived artifice.

I propose to discuss to-night a few of the less familiar vagaries of
the visual organs, and will do my best to assist in the illustration of
them. But it will be my part merely to provide the apparatus for the
experiments; the experiments must themselves be carried out by each
of you individually. Some of them will, I am afraid, be found rather
difficult; success will depend mainly upon your power of laying aside
habit and prejudice and giving close attention to your visual sensations.
I hardly dare to hope that everyone present will observe all the peculi-
arities and defects which it is intended to demonstrate, but in case of
failure I generally find that thereis a comfortable tendency to attribute
it not to any deficiency in the cbserver’s power of concentrating his
attention, but to the fact that his eyes are not as other men’s, and are
free from the particular defect which it is desired to bring into promi-
nence. Of course, anyone is welcome to such an entirely satisfactory _
opinion.

Among the most annoying of the eccentricities which characterize the
sense of vision is that known as the persistence of impressions. The
sensation of sight which is produced by an illuminated object does not
cease at the moment when the exciting cause is removed or changed
in position, but continues for a period which is generally said to be about
one-tenth of a second, but may sometimes be much more or less. It is
for this reason that we can not see the details of anything which is in
rapid motion, but only an indistinet blur, resulting from the confusion
of. successive impressions. When I turn this disk, which is painted in
black and white sectors, you soon lose sight of the divisions, and if
the speed is high enough the whole surface appears to be of a uniformly
gray hue. Ifwe illuminate the rotating disk by a properly timed series
of electric flashes, it looks as if it were at rest, and in spite of the inter-
mittent nature of the light, the black and white sectors are seen quite
continuously, though as a matter of fact the intervals of darkness are
very much longer than those of illumination.

The persistent impressions which we have been discussing are often
spoken of as positive after-images.

There is one very remarkable phenomenon accompanying the forma-
tion of positive after-images, especially those following brief illumina-
tion, which seems, until comparatively recent times, to have entirely
escaped the notice of the most acute observers. It was first observed
-accidentally by Prof. C. A. Young, when he was experimenting with a
large electrical machine which had been newly acquired for his labora-
tory. He noticed that when a powerful Leyden jar discharge took place
in a darkened room, any conspicuous object was seen twice at least,
with an interval of a trifle less than a quarter of a second, the first
time vividly, the second time faintly. Often it was seen a third time,
SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION. 199

and sometimes, but only with very great difficulty, even a fourth time.

_ He gave to this phenomenon the name of recurrent vision; it may

perhaps be more appropriately denominated the Young effect.

We have here a machine presented to the institution by Mr. Wims-
hurst, which is a giant in comparison with that used by Professor
Young, and I hope by its means to be able to show the effect to every-
one present who will give a little attention. Look in the direction of
some object which is exposed to the light of the discharge; the object
will be seen for an instant at the moment when the spark passes and
you hear the crack, and after a dark interval of about one-fifth of a
second it will make another brief appearance. Some of you may per-
haps see even a second recurrent image. Under certain conditions I
myself have observed no less than six reappearances
of an object which was illuminated by a single dis- 5.
charge.

Twelve years ago I called attention to a very different
metbod of exhibiting a recurrent image. The apparatus
used for the purpose consists of a vacuum tube mounted
in the usual way upon a horizontal axis capable of
rotation. When the tube is illuminated by a rapid
succession of discharges from an induction coil, and is
made to rotate very slowly (at the rate of about one
turn in two or three seconds) a very curious phe-
nomenon may be noticed. At a distance of a few
degrees behind the tube, and separated from it by a
clear interval of darkness, comes a ghost. This ghost
is in form an exact reproduction of the tube; it is
very clearly defined, and though its apparent lumi-
nosity is feeble, it can no doubt be easily seen by most
of you. The varied colors of the original are, however,
absent, the whole of the phantom tube being of a uniform bluish or
violet tint. if the rotation is suddenly stopped, the ghost still moves
steadily on until it reaches the luminous tube, with which it coalesces
and so disappears. (See fig. 1, where the recurrent image is indicated
by dotted lines.)

I returned to the subject three or four years ago, with the primary
object of ascertaining whether or not the Young effect was identical
with one which had recently been discovered by Charpentier, and which
will be referred to presently. - A certain phenomenon which I had attrib-
uted to the Young effect was quoted by Charpentier as exemplifying his
own newly observed one. I found, however, that the two effects, though
both of an oscillatory character, were in fact quite distinct from one
another. The results of my experiments in relation to this and other
allied matters were embodied ina communication to the Royal Society.'

In investigating the influence of color upon the Young effect, two

methods of experimenting were employed. In the first, colored light
was obtained by passing white light through colored glasses; in the
second and more perfect series of experiments, the pure colored light
of the spectrum was used. Among other results, it was found that
ceteris paribus the recurrent image was much stronger with green light
than with any other, and that when the excitation was produced by
pure red light, however intense, there was nd recurrent image at all.

I intend to attempt a repetition of my first experiment before you.
A metal disk with a small circular aperture near its edge is placed in
the lantern, and its image projected upon the screen. When the disk
is turned slowly the spot of light upon the screen goes round and round,
and some of you may, perhaps, be able to see at once that the bright
primary spot appears to be followed at a short distance by a much feebler
spot of a violet color, which is the recurrent image of the first. It is
essential to keep the direction of the eyes perfectly steady, which is not
an easy thing to do without practice. (See fig. 2.) If now we place a
green glass before the lens, the ghost will be at its best, and all of you
should be able to see it, provided that you do
not look at it. With an orange glass the
ghost becomes less distinctly visible, and its
color generally appears to be bluish-green
instead of violet as before. When a red glass
is substituted, the ghost completely disap-
pears. If the speed of rotation is sufficiently
high, the red spot is considerably elongated
during its revolution, and its color ceases to
be uniform, the rear portion assuming a light
bluish-pink tinge. But however. great the
speed, no complete separation of the spot into
red and pink portions can be effected, and no recurrent image is ever
formed.

The spectrum method of observation can only be carried out on a
small scale, and can not be exhibited to an audience. It, however,
affords the best means of ascertaining how far the apparent color of the
recurrent image depends upon that of the primary, a matter of some
theoretical interest. I found that white light was followed by a violet
recurrent image; after blue and green, when the image was brightest,
its color was also violet; after yellow and orange, it appeared blue or
greenish-blue. On the other hand, when a complete spectrum was
caused to revolve upon the screen, the whole of its recurrent image
from end to end appeared violet; there was no appearance of blue or
greenish-blue at the less refrangible end. For this and other reasons
it was concluded that the true color was in all cases really violet, the
blue and greenish-blue apparently seen in conjunction with the much
brighter yellow and orange of the primary being merely an illusory
effect of contrast. (This contrast effect was illustrated by a lantern

slide.) It seems likely, then, that the effect which has been spoken of
as recurrent vision is due principally, if not entirely, to an action of
the violet nerve fibers. Itneed hardly be pointed out that it represents
only a transient phase of the well-known positive after-image, and it
had even been observed in a vague and uncertain sort of way long
before the date of Professor Young’s experiment. Helmholtz, for
example, mentions the case of a positive after-image which seemed to
disappear and then to brighten up again;
but he goes on to explain that the seeming
disappearance was illusory.

M. Charpentier, of Nancy, whose name I
have already mentioned, was the first to
notice and record a remarkable phenomenon
which, in some form or other, must present
itself many times daily to every person who
is not blind, but which, until about six years
ago, had been absolutely and universally
ignored. The law which is associated with
Charpentier’s name is this: When darkness
is followed by light, the stimulus which the retina at first receives, and
which causes the sensation of luminosity, is succeeded by a brief period
of insensibility, resulting in the sensation of momentary darkness.
It appears that the dark period begins about one-sixtieth of a second
after the light has first been admitted to the eye, and lasts for about
an equal time. The whole alteration from light to darkness and back
again to light is performed so rapidly that except
under certain conditions, which, however, occur fre-
quently enough, it can not be detected.

The apparatus which Charpentier employed for
demonstrating and measuring the duration of this
effect is very simple. 1t consists of a blackened disk
with a white sector mounted upon an axis. When
the disk is illuminated by sunlight and turned rather
slowly, there appears upon the white sector close
behind its leading edge a narrow but well-defined
dark band. (See fig. 3.) The portion of the retina
: which is apparently occupied at any moment by the

Fig. 4. dark band is that upon which the light reflected
by the leading edge of the white sector has fallen
one-sixtieth of a second previously.

But no special apparatus is required to show the dark reaction; it is,
as I have said, an exceedingly common phenomenon. In figure 4 an
attempt has been made to illustrate what anyone may see if he simply
moves his hands between his eyes and the sky or any strongly illumi-
nated white surface. The hand appears to be followed by a dark out-
line separated from it by a bright interval. The same kind of thing

Fie. a

202 SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION.

happens in a more or less marked degree whenever a dark object moves
across a bright background, or a bright object across a dark background.

In order to see the effect distinctly by Charpentier’s original method
the illumination must be strong. If, however, the arrangement is
slightly varied, so that transmitted instead of reflected light is made
use of, comparatively feeble illumination is sufficient. A very effective |
way is to turn a small metal disk having an open sector of about 60° in
front of a sheet of ground or opal glass, behind whichis a lamp. By an
arrangement of this kind upon a larger seale the effect may easily be
rendered visible to an audience. The eyes should not be allowed to
follow the disk in its rotation, but should be directed steadily upon the
center.

The acute and educated vision of Charpentier enabled him, even
when working with his black and white disk, to detect the existence,
under favorable conditions, of a second and sometimes a third dark
band of greatly diminished intensity, though he remarks that the obser-
vation is a very difficult one. What is probably the same effect can,
however, be shown quite easily in a different
manner. Ifa disk with a very narrow radial
slit, one-fiftieth of an inch or one-half milli-
meter wide, is caused to rotate at the rate of
about one turn per second in front of a bright
background, such as a sheet of ground glass
with a lamp behind it, the moving slit
assumes the appearance of a fan-shaped
luminous patch, the brightness of which
diminishes with the distance from the lead-
ing edge. And if the eyes are steadily fixed
upon the center of the disk it will be noticed

Die that this bright image is streaked with a

number of dark radial bands, suggestive of

the ribs or sticks of the fan. Near the circumference as many as four

or five such dark streaks can be distinguished without difficulty;

toward the center they are less conspicuous, owing to the overlapping

of the successive images of the slit.! (The effect was demonstrated

by means of a rotating disk in the lantern, and is roughly indicated
in fig. 5.)

The dark reactiow known as the Charpentier effect occurs at the
beginning of a period of illumination. There is also a dark reaction
of a very short duration at the end of a period of illumination. I
should explain that, owing to what is called the proper light of the
retina, ordinary darkness does not appear absolutely black. Even ina
dark room ona dark night, with the eyes carefully covered, there is
always some sensation of luminosity which would be sufficient to show
up a really black image, if one could be produced. Now the darkness

Charpentier, Comptes Rendus, January, 1896.
SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION. 203

which is experienced after the extinction of a light is for a small frac-
tion of a second more intense than common darkness.

I believe that the first mention of this dark reaction occurs in the
article which I contributed to Nature in 1885, in which it was stated
that when the current was cut off from an illuminated vacuum tube
“the Iuminous image was almost instantly replaced by a corresponding
image which appeared to be intensely black upon a less dark back-
ground,” and which was estimated to last from one-fourth to one-half
ofasecond. “Abnormal darkness,” it was added, “follows as a reac-
tion after the luminosity.”

In the Royal Society paper, to which I have before referred, the point
is further discussed, and a method is described by which the stage of reac-
tion may be easily exhibited and its duration approximately measured,
If a translucent disk made of stout drawing paper and having an open
sector is caused to rotate slowly in front of a luminous background, a
narrow radial dark band like a streak of black paint appears upon the
paper very near the edge whieh follows the open sector. From the
space covered by this band when the disk
was rotating at a known speed, the duration
of the dark reaction was estimated to be
about one-fiftieth of a second. (The experi-
ment was shown and is illustrated in fig. 6.)

One more interesting point should be
noticed in the train of visual phenomena
which attend a period of illumination. The
sensation of luminosity which is excited when
light first strikes the eye is for about one-
sixtieth of a second much more intense than
it subsequently becomes. This is shown by
the fact that the bright band intervening
between the leading edge of the white sector of a Charpentier disk
and the dark band appears to be much more strongly illuminated than
any other portion of the sector. -

I propose now to say a few words about a curious phenomenon of
vision which occupied my attention toward the end of last year.!

Rather more than two years ago Mr.C. KE. Benham brought out a
pretty little toy which he called the artificial spectrum top. It consists
of a cardboard disk, one half of which is painted black, while on the
other half are drawn four successive groups of concentric black lines
at different distances from the center. When the disk rotates rather
Slowly each group of black lines generally appears to assume a different
color, the nature of which depends upon the speed of the rotation and
the intensity and quality of the light. Under the best conditions the
inner and outer groups of lines become bright red and dark blue; at the
Same time the intermediate groups also appear tinted, but the hues

204 SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION.

which they assume are rather uncertain and difficult to specify. By
far the most striking of the colors exhibited by the top is the red,
and next to that the blue. This latter, however, is sometimes described
as bluish green. (The top was exhibited as a lantern slide.)

My recent experiments seem to indicate pretty clearly the cause of
the remarkably bright red color, and also that of the blue. The more
feeble tints of the two intermediate groups of lines perhaps result from
similar causes in a modified form, but these I have not yet investigated.

In the red color we have another striking example of an exceedingly
common phenomenon which is habitually disregarded; indeed, I can
find no record of its ever having been noticed at all. The fact is, that
whenever a bright image is suddenly formed upon the retina after a
period of comparative darkness, this image appears for a short time to
be surrounded by a narrow colored border, the color under ordinary
conditions of illumination being red. If the light is very strong the
transient border is greenish blue. Sometimes both red and blue
borders appear together, the blue being inside the red.! The color
generally seen is, however, red, and it is most conspicuous with good
lamplight.

This observation was first made in the following manner: A black-
ened zinc plate with a small round hole in it is fixed over a larger hole
in a wooden board; the hole in the zine is covered with a piece of
thin white writing paper. Thus we are furnished with a sharply
defined translucent disk which is surrounded by a perfectly opaque
Substance. An arrangement is made for covering the translucent disk
with a shutter which can be opened very rapidly by means of a strong
spring. If this apparatus is held between the eyes and a lamp, and
the translucent dise is suddenly disclosed by working the shutter, the
disk appears for a short time to be surrounded by a narrow red bor-
der. The width of the border is perhaps one twenty-fifth of an inch,
or 1 millimeter, and the appearance lasts for something like one-tenth
of a second. Most people are at first quite unable to recognize this
effect, the difficulty being not to see it, but to know that one sees it.
Those who have been accustomed to visual observations generally per-
ceive it without any difficulty when they know what to look for, and
no doubt it would be quite evident to a baby a few weeks old, which
had not advanced very far in the education of its eyes.

The observation is made rather less difficult by a further device. If
the disk is divided into two parts by an opaque strip across the mid-
dle, itis clear that each half disk will have its red border, and, if the
strip is made sufficiently narrow, the red borders along its edges will
meet, or perhaps overlap, and the whole strip will, for a moment after
the shutter is opened, appear red. <A disk was prepared by gumming
across the paper a strip of tin foil about one-thirtieth of an inch wide.

1J have recently shown that the greenish-blue border is simply the ‘‘negative
after-image” of the red one. April 24.
SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION. 205

The effect produced when such a disc is exposed is indicated in figure
7, the red color being represented by shading.

A simpler apparatus is, however, quite sufficient for showing the
effect,! and with practice one can even acquire the power of seeing it
without any artificial aid at all. I have many times noticed flashes of
red upon the black letters of a book that I was reading, or upon the
edges of the page. Bright metallic or polished objects often show it
when they pass across the field of vision in consequence of a move-
ment of the eyes, and it was an accidental observation of this kind
which suggested the following easy way of exhibiting the effect exper-
imentally :

An electric lamp was fixed behind a round hole in a sheet of metal
which was attached to a board. The hole was covered with two or
three thicknesses of writing paper, making a bright disk of nearly uni-
form luminosity. When this was moved rather quickly, either back-
ward or forward, or round and round
in a small circle, the edges of the
streaks of light thus formed appeared
to be bordered with red.

Ifthis experiment is performed with
a strong light, the hole becomes bor-
dered with greenish blue instead of
red. With an intermediate degree of
Ulumination both blue and red may
be seen together, the blue being i :
inside the red. Tar

Most of the effects that have so far
been described were produced by transmitted light, but reflected light
will show them equally well. If you place a printed book before you
near a good lamp and interpose a dark screen before your eyes, then,
when the screen is suddenly withdrawn, the printed letters will for a
moment appear red, quickly changing to black. Some practice is
required before this observation can be made satisfactorily, but by a
simple device it is possible to obliterate the image of the letters before
the redness has had time to disappear; the color then becomes quite
easily perceptible. Hold two screens together side by side, a black
one and a white one, in such a manner that there is a triangular open-
ing left between them. Im the first place let the black screen cover the
printing, then quickly move the screens sideways so that the printed
letters may be for a moment exposed to view through the gap, stop-
ping the movement as soon as the page is covered by the white screen.
During the brief glimpse that will be had of the black letters while
they are beneath the gap, they will, if the illumination is suitable,
appear to be bright red.

We may go a step further. Cutout a disk of white cardboard, divide

1 See Nature, Vol. LY, p. 367 (February 18, 1897).
206 SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION.

it into two equal parts by a straight line through the center, and paint
one half black. At the junction of the black and white portions cut
out a gap which may conveniently be of the form of a sector of about
45°, (See fig. 8.) Stick a long pin through the center and hold the
arrangement by the pointed end of the pin a few inches above a printed
page near a good light. Make the disk spin at the rate of about five or
six turns a second by striking the edge with
the finger. As before, the letters, when
seen through the gap, will appear red, and
persistence will render the repeated impres-
sions almost continuous. Care must be
taken that the disk does not cast a shadow
upon the printing, and that the intensity of
the illumination is properly adjusted. I
have here several rather more elaborate
contrivances for making disks rotate.

In none of these experiments does an

acl extended black surface ever appear red, but
only black dots or lines, which may, of
course, have the form of letters. And the lines must not be too thick;
if their thickness is much more than one twenty-fifth of an inch, or 1
millimeter, the lines, as seen by an observer at a distance of 2 or 3 feet,
do not become red throughout, but only along their edges. The red
appearance is, in fact, not due to the black lines themselves at all; these
serve merely as a background for
showing up the red border which
fringes externally the white portions
of the paper, and the width of this
border does not exceed about one-
fifth of a degree.

(By means of a large rotating disk
Some designs in black lines and let-
ters were made to appear red, the
effect being visible in all parts of the
theater.)

When the disk is turned in the
opposite direction, the black lines appear at first sight to become dark
blue. Attentive observation, however, shows that the apparently blue
tint is not formed upon the lines themselves, as the red tint was, but
upon the white ground just outside them. This introduces to our notice
another border phenomenon which seems to present itself when a dark
patch is suddenly formed on a bright ground, for that is essentially what
takes place when the dise is turned the reverse way. I made some
attempts to obtain more direct evidence that such a dark patch
appeared for a moment to have a blue border, and after some trouble
succeeded in doing so.

SOME CURIOSITIES OF VISION. 207

A circular aperture was cut in a wooded board and covered with
white paper; alamp was placed behind the board, and thus a bright
disc was obtained, as in the former experiment. An arrangement was
prepared by means of which one-half of this bright disk could be sud-
denly covered by a metal shutter, and it was found that when this
was done a narrow blue band appeared on the bright ground just
beyond and adjoining the edge of the shutter when it had come to rest.
The blue band lasted for about one-tenth of a second, and it seemed to
disappear by retreating into the black edge of the shutter. An
attempt has been made to illustrate it in figure 9, where the shaded
band indicates the blue border.

We have then to account, if possible, for the two facts that in the
formation of these transient borders the red sensation occurs in a
portion of the retina which has not been exposed to the direct action of
light, while the blue occurs in a portion which is exposed to unchanged
illumination. Accepting the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision,
the effects must, I think, be attributed to a sympathetic affection of
the red nerve fibers. When the various nerve fibers occupying a lim-
ited portion of the retina are suddenly stimulated by white or yellow
light of moderate intensity, the immediately surrounding red nerve
fibers are for a short period excited sympathetically, while the violet
and green fibers are not so excited, or in a much less degree. And
again, when light is suddenly cut off from a patch in a bright field,

_there occurs an insensitive reaction in the red fibers just outside the

darkened patch, in virtue of which they cease for amoment to respond
to the Juminous stimulous; the green and violet fibers, by continuing
to respond uninterruptedly, give rise to the sensation of a blue border.

Whether or not the hypothesis which I have suggested is correct in
all its details, it is, | think, sufficiently obvious that the red and blue
colors of Benham’s top are due to exactly the same causes as the colors
observed in my own experiments, for the essential conditions are the
same in both cases.

I have mentioned only a few among many curious phenomena which
have presented themselves in the course of my investigation. It is not
improbable that a careful study of the subjective effects produced by
intermittent illumination would lead to results tending to clear up
many doubtful points in the theory of color vision.

PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY: !

By G. H. NIEWENGLOWSKI.

Color photography is the order of the day. Within the last year
there have been numerous exhibitions of color photographs, one of the
most notable of which is that recently established on the boulevard des
Italiens by the brothers Lumicre of Lyons. The time is therefore
appropriate to give a brief review and comparison of the various proc
esses of photographic reproduction in colors which have thus far been
proposed.

Methods of color photography may be either direct or indirect. The
first class contains those which give at a single direct operation a proof
in colors.

Many of the direct processes are variations of the method called the
destruction of colors, originated by Charles Cros, and described by him
as follows in the Moniteur de la Photographie (1881, p. 67) under the
title of direct polychromy:

“The fundamental experiment upon which polychromy is founded is
this:

‘‘ A glass plate is coated first with collodion dyed red with cartha-
mine. To this is added a second coat of gelatine dyed blue with
phyllocyanine, and finally a coat of collodion dyed yellow with tumeric.

‘*Upon subjecting this plate to an image tormed in green, yellow,
and orange light the following occurs:

“The green light produces no appreciable effect upon the yellow and
blue coatings, but is absorbed in the red coating and decolorizes the
carthamine. Thus there remains only yellow and blue at this point in
the coatings of the glass plate, and these two colors superposed pro-
duce green. Hence the green light leaves a green trace.

“Similarly, violet light destroys the yellow, and leaving blue and red
superposed gives a violet trace, while the orange light, destroying the
blue, leaves only yellow and red, which superposed give orange.

“Winally white light destroys all these pigments and leaves only the
colorless plate, while in the absence of light none of the pigments are
affected and there remains the neutral tint formed by the superposition
of all three.

“Thus the resulting effect is a direct positive transparency repro-
ducing the original colors. But this positive is not durable, for under
the action of light it disappears.”

210 PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

In June, 1895, Otto Wiener published in the Annalen der Chemie und
Physik a memoir entitled “Color photography and mechanical color
adaptation in nature,” which has been discussed by Bernard Brunhes
in the Revue Générale des Sciences, 1895. In this memoir Wiener
shows that the reproduction of the spectrum as obtained by Seebeck,
and Poitevin’s process of color photography upon paper coated with
the subchloride of silver, were both based upon the same principle as
the direct polychromy of Charles Cros, though Wiener does not cite
Cros and seems to have overlooked his work. Wiener gives the name
of color-sensitive films to coatings capable of taking on the color of the
light incident upon them.

In the process of Poitevin the color-sensitive substance, according to
Wiener, is a mixture of the chloride and subchloride of silver, capable
of appearing in various colors, and given by Carey Lea the name of
‘‘color salt.”

By the aid of researches described in the memoirs of Wiener, he con-
cludes that the ideal color-sensitive substance would be a black absorb-
ent mixture containing at least three different-colored substances, each
of which should absorb all the colors cf the spectrum except one and
be destroyed by the colors which it absorbed. A single-colored light
falling upon such a substance would leave intact only the color the
same as its own. We have already seen, in quoting from Charles Cros, -
what would be the effect of a light of mixed colors on such a substance.

This kind of color adaptation by means of a color-sensitive substance
is not infrequently met with among animals. Certain species take on
the color of their surroundings. Thus Danais chrysippus, green in
nature, becomes white, red, orange, or black when brought up in boxes
constructed of white, red, orange, or black paper.

Immediately after the publication of the interesting research of
Wiener, Emile Vallot devoted himself to the task of obtaining a good
color-sensitive coating. He recommends a mixture in equal parts of

the following three solutions:

Paper floated for several minutes upon this bath and dried in dark-
ness is dyed black. If placed in a colored image cast by full sunlight,
it gives a good photographic reproduction in the proper colors. Unfor-
tunately two or three days’ exposure are necessary, and the yellow is
not altogether satisfactory. For the red, the aniline purple may be
replaced advantageously with safranine.

A.and L. Lumiére have obtained a more sensitive paper by employing
cyanine for the blue and quinoleine for the red.
PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY. PTE

Two principal difficulties are encountered in this process. The first
consists in the discovery of colored substances which not only have
the proper colors (corresponding respectively to the three fundamental
colors), but which have besides the same laws of sensitiveness. A
second difficulty, as yet unsurmounted, is found in fixing the colors
when obtained. The Lumiéres have, however, made some progress in
fixing, by means of metallic salts which form insoluble compounds
with the colors employed. Nevertheless it is very hard to avoid modi-
fying the tint in this way. Commandant Colson has made tentative
experiments in fixing color photographs made by Poitevin’s process,
and utilizes a property of dry ink to desensitize the color-sensitive
substances.

To sum up the matter, it may be said that these processes appear
unlikely to give more than a partial solution of the problem.

Color photographs were obtained in 1848 by Edmond Becquerel by
another species of the direct process, and his researches have been
repeated and completed by Niepce of St. Victor. Asa sensitive surface
Becquerel employed a silver plate superficially chlorinized, either by
means of electrolysis or by some strictly chemical process. Becquerel’s

colored images could not be fixed, and the theory of their formation

was, in his time, little understood.

To Prof. Gabriel Lippmann belongs the honor of showing in 1891
the true theory of the phenomenon, and of finding out why the colors
could not be fixed, and finally of giving an ingenious solution of the
problem of photography in colors, which has come to world-wide fame.
Since it is based on the principle of interference, this discovery forms
a beautiful confirmation of the undulatory theory of light. It will be
recalled that in Lippman’s as in Becquerel’s process the image is formed
by a series of layers of silver separated by distances varying with the
colors. If hyposulphite of soda be used to fix colored images of the
Becquerel type, it dissolves the intervening chloride of silver which
supports this system of layers, so that the whole structure crumbles and
the colors are destroyed.

In Lippmann’s process this difficulty is avoided, because the sensitive
Salt is imprisoned in a transparent mass of albumin, gelatin, or collodion,
upon which the hyposulphite has no action. Only the bromide of silver
not modified by the light is dissolved, and the substratum forms a solid
foundation which maintains invariable the distance separating the
layers of silver from one another.

In reality, as Wiener has shown in the memoir already cited, though
these interference colors predominate in the Becquerel images, yet
there are also present body colors, due, as in the direct processes
already mentioned, to the modification of color-sensitive substances.

Since the communication by Lippmann to the Académie des Sciences
in February, 1891, many photographers have attempted to repeat his
experiments. But, despite numerous researches undertaken to explain
DAE! PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

the want of success, it appears that there are only two or three dozen
good interference color photographs in existence. The delicacy of the
lamellar structure is so great that a very slight variation in the condi-
tions of the experiment suffices to spoil its result. Thus even the
brothers Lumiere, who are certainly the most conscientious students,
from a practica: standpoint, of interferential color photography, have
not been able to obtain identical results even ‘‘when working with
weights of substance as nearly equal as could be determined with the
very best balances, when the successive operations were separated by
the same intervals of time, and when the experiments were carried on
under conditions as nearly identical as possible as nepetdss the temper-
ature, the degree of moisture of the air, etc.” !

Lippmann’s method—although the one giving the most beautiful,
compiete and accurate results—has still another inconvenience. It is
impossible to multiply copies, so that it is necessary to make as many
exposures in the camera as there are pictures desired, just as in the
old daguerreotype. But perhaps this is not wholly an objectionable
feature of this process of Lippmann’s.

For our part we incline to this view of the matter, and quite agree
with Louis Ducos du Hauron.?

“Tf multiplicity has its merits,” he remarks, ‘‘so also does rarity. If
the happy possessor of a painting signed by a great artist were asked
if he would be willing to have numerous copies of his picture sent
abroad throughout the world, his response might be expected in
advance to be vigorous in the negative. To be sure the Almighty
made the rose, called the queen of flowers, abundant, but he has at the
same time set the diamond in an enchanting solitude.”

Indirect processes of color photography, properly so called, are
derived from the method indicated in 1869 by Charles Cros and tenuis
Ducos du Hauron, who independently conceived the same idea. Many
processes noised abroad from time to time are only variations of that
invented by these our two compatriots, whose works seem now to be
ignored, voluntarily or otherwise, by many.’

Indirect photography in colors is based upon the fact that the mix-
ture in variable proportions of three colors suitably chosen, and called
fundamental colors (red, yellow, and blue), enables the reproduction of
all the shades met with in nature.

The principle of the method is thus defined by Ducos du Hauron:

“Tf we decompose into three distinct images—one red, one yellow, and
one blue—the combination images presented by nature, and if each one

of these three pictures is reduced to a separate photograph and repro-
duced in the special color, it only requires to blend again into one the
three colored reproductions thus made in order to obtain an exact repre-
sentation of the original as regards both color and form.”

When the three clichés representing in analysis the colors of the
original have been obtained, their synthesis can be effected by one of
two different methods.

1. By addition of lights.—Ordinary positives of the three clichés are
produced and illuminated, respectively, with blue, yellow, and red light,
each positive being illuminated by the same light which passed the
sereen in producing the corresponding negative. When these three
separately illuminated positives are superposed, either by means of
a projection lantern (thus forming a real image) or by means of chromo-
Scopes (virtual images), there is obtained a very faithful reproduction
of the colors of the original. Prof. G. Lippmann has proposed a very
ingenious device to make both the analysis and synthesis of the colors
with the same apparatus. He employs the principle of reversibility of
path of the rays traversing a lens. Three small objective lenses are
mounted on a support in a camera and provided with three colored
screens. In the foci of the lenses are placed plates sensitive to the
colors transmitted, respectively, by the corresponding screens. From

the three negatives thus obtained are reproduced positives on glass,

which are placed in the positions first occupied by the negatives, and
Uluminated by the beam of a prejection lantern. In this manner a
colored image of the original is projected upon a white screen, This
image can be magnified or diminished at pleasure by placing a fourth
lens of suitable curvature in the path of the beam.

2. By absorption of light.—Procedures for synthesis of this kind are
very numerous. They admit of multiplication of copies. The carbon
process was employed first by Louis Ducos du Hauron. Charles Cros
communicated in 1881 to M. Carpentier, of the Académie des Sciences,
a process of reproduction analogous to hydrotypy, based upon the
employment of coatings of albuminated collodion containing from 2
to 3 per cent of bromide of cadmium sensitized with ammonium bichro-
mate. This process is analogous to that employed by the brothers
Lumiere in producing their beautiful color photographs. A skillful
photographer, George Richard, has also proposed a very ingenious
method. Positives from the three clichés are first produced on glass.
Then by means of a series of chemical reactions the reduced silver which
forms the image is transformed either into a mordant capable of fixing
the analine colors or into a salt capable of reacting upon analine to
produce colors upon the plate. The three positives are then super-
posed to give color photographs.

These polychrome proofs have to be viewed as transparencies. It is,
to be sure, possible to transfer the films to paper, and thus to have
photographs upon paper, but the results thus obtained are far less

satisfactory. ;
214 PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

One of the greatest advantages of the indirect methods is that they
permit of reproductions by photomechanical processes, and thus lend
themselves to illustrative purposes. The colors may be either super-
posed or juxtaposed. Superposition, however, requires at least two
transparent colored inks. Hence, the mixture of colors is generally
produced by juxtaposition of pigments. This is done sometimes in
photocollography by producing grained images; but more frequently by
phototypogravure, which has the great advantage of being suited to the
production of numerous copies.

The three-color process of mechanical polychrome illustration was
for a jong time made use of in England and America. Of late, however,
a number of French firms have had excellent success in the form of
illustration.

A great objection to indirect color photography is that it requires
three negatives, which consume time for their production. The red,
especially, requires a very long exposure. Nevertheless, this process
_ is much employed for landscapes, and not long since M. Montpillard
presented to the French Photographic Society a very excellent colored
typophotograph representing a landscape photographed by him from
nature and engraved by M. Prieur.

There has been much effort to simplify the process. One of the
first methods proposed was to use a camera provided with mirrors, so
that the three exposures could go on simultaneously. But the images
thus obtained are by no means equal to those produced when the
apparatus is used in the ordinary way with three separate exposures.
It has been proposed to use three separate lenses, but this, of course,
accentuates the same defect. It is very difficult to have three objec-
tives which will give three images precisely identical.

Another device, proposed by John Joly, of Dublin, about three
years ago, but really a re-edition of a procedure published in 1869 by
Louis Ducos du Hauron, consists in obtaining the three negatives upon
a single sensitive surface. A glass plate is ruled with fine parallel

lines colored in rotation with the three fundamental colors in trans- ~

parent pigments. This prepared plate is superposed on the sensitive
surface, and thus is produced in close juxtaposition a combination of
the three negatives corresponding to the three primary colors. A
positive transparency of this negative is projected upon a screen
through a color grating exactly like that first used, and the colors of
the original are thereby closely reproduced. Louis Ducos du Hauron
applied this same process to photomechanical reproduction by print-
ing a black image upon a paper ruled like the screen in red, blue, and
yellow. 2

The colors of the original are fairly rendered in this way. However,
it is easy to see that if the original presented a considerable blue
space this would be represented in the picture by a space one-third
PROGRESS IN COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY. 215

blue and two-thirds black. Besides this, the objects appear cut up
into a Sort of grating, and the effect is rather disagreeable.

Of all the processes of color photography that have thus far been
proposed only the elegant interferential method of Lippmann repro-
duces the colors. of the original with absolute fidelity. The indirect
method by three negatives in colors, proposed by Charles Cros and
Ducos du Hauron, seems to give only an approximate solution of the
problem. But the approximation may be practically sufficient, as is
shown by the fine transparencies of the Lumiere brothers. This
method has, moreover, the advantage that it lends itself to industrial
reproductions, as may be seen in the illustrations of M. Prieur.

It seems, then, that from the practical and industrial point of view
a brilliant future is reserved for the ingenius three-color method first
clearly indicated by the Frenchmen, Charles Cros and Louis Ducos du
Hauron.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE!

By THOMAS GRAY.

In a brief discourse on the development of electrical science little
time can be given to the early history of the subject. This part is
more or less familiar to all the members of the academy, and hence it
may be passed over by only such brief reference as may serve to recall
to mind the more important of the early discoveries. The early Greeks
have recorded some elementary phenomena now known to be electric,
and it is probable that such knowledge was not uncommon, though
little noticed. It is only in comparatively recent times that scientific
research has taken the place of superstition and attempts have been
made to classify and find reasons for the existence of all natural phe-
nomena.

Beginning with the seventeenth century, probably the first investi-
gator worthy of notice in this subject was Gilbert, of Colchester, who
published his work entitled De Magnete in 1600. Gilbert made sys-
tematic experiments and showed that the property of attracting light
bodies could be given to a large number of substances by friction. He
also showed that the success of the experiment depended largely upon
the dryness of the body. These experiments gave rise to the classifi-
cation of substances as electrics and nonelectrics. The true signifi-
cance of Gilbert’s observations as to the effect of moisture was not
appreciated for a long time. Gilbert’s list of electrics was added to by
a number of other observers, prominent among whom were Boyle and
Newton. The fact that light and sound accompany electric excitation
was called attention to by Otto von Guericke, who also showed that a
light body after being brought into contact with an electrified body was
repelled by it.

Coming now to the eighteenth century, we find Hawkesbee in 1707
and Wallin 1708 speculating on the similarity of the electric spark
and lightning. Then comes one of the most prominent experimenters
of this century—Stephen Gray—who began to publish in 1720, and
who in 1729 found that certain substances would not convey the charge

218 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

of an electrified body to a distance. These experiments were the first
to introduce the distinction between conductors and non conductors,
and, of course, very soon served to explain the reason why certain
substances could not be electrified by friction when held in the hand.
Gray also made the important discovery that the charge of an electri-
fied body is proportional to its surface, and this was afterwards con-
firmed by the experiments of Le Monnier. Many of Gray’s experi-
ments were repeated and extended by Du Fay, who found that all
bodies could be electrified by friction if they were held by an insulating
substance. Then came the improvements of the electric machine by
Boze and Winckler; the firing of inflammatory substances, such as
alcohol, by means of the electric spark by Ludolph, Gordon, Miles,
Franklin, and others. About this time (1745) the properties of the
Leyden jar were discovered by Kleist, Cuneus, and Muschenbroeck,
and a few years later it was given practically its present form by Sir
William Watson. Then follows one of the periods of exceptional activity
in electrical research. A party of the Royal Society, with Watson as
chief operator, made a series of experiments having for their object
the determination of the distance to which electrical excitation could
be conveyed and the time it takes in transit. They found, among other
things, that several persons at a distance apart might feel the electric
shock if they formed part of a circuit between the electrified body and
a conductor, such as the earth; also, that the earth could be used to
complete the circuit in Leyden jar discharges. They concluded that
when two observers connected by a conductor, and at, say, 2 miles
apart, obtained a shock by one touching the inside coating of a Leyden
jar and the other the earth, the electric circuit was 4 miles long; that
is, the earth acted as a return conductor. They also concluded that
the transmission was practically instantaneous. Watson had ideas as
to electric fluids similar to those which were afterwards systematically
worked out by Franklin. A great many curious and interesting
experiments were made about this time, as, for example, the influence
of electrification on the flow of water through capillary tubes as dis-
covered by Boyle, the experiments of Mowbray on the effect of electri-
fication on vegetation, and those of the Abbe Menon on the loss of
weight of animals when they were kept electrified for a considerable
time. :

The effect of electrification on the flow of water has received consid-
erable attention from eminent authorities in recent years, and the effect
of electrification on the growth and composition of vegetables is at
present attracting attention in the form of systematic investigation.

The contributions of Franklin are by far the most important which
mark the middle portion of the eighteenth century. Franklin’s experi-
ments were begun about the middle of the year 1747, and seem to have
been inspired by the receipt of a Leyden jar from a friend, William
Collinson, of London. He propounded the theory of positive and nega-

tive fluids, which has lately, in a modified form, been brought so
prominently into notice again by the writings of Lodge, and he made
an investigation of the principle of the Leyden jar; but the most
important of his researches relate to the identification of electricity
and lightning. The probable identity of the two phenomena had been
hinted at, as we have seen, by several observers, but Franklin went
systematically to work totestthe hypothesis. Under date of November
7, 1749, the following passage is found in his notebook: ‘Electric fluid
agrees with lightning in these particulars: (1) Giving light; (2) color
of the light; (3) crooked direction; (4) swift motion; (5) being conducted
by metals; (6) crack or noise in exploding; (7) subsisting in water or
ice; (8) rending bodies in passing through; (9) destroying animals; (10)
melting metals; (11) firing inflammable substances; (12) sulphurous
smell. The electric fluid is attracted by points; we do not know
whether this property is in lightning. But since they agree in all the
particulars wherein we can already compare them, is it not probable
that they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment be made.” The
hypothesis was elaborated and sent to his friend Collinson, who com-
municated it to the Royal Society. This society rather ridiculed
Franklin’s ideas at first, but his paper was published in London and
also in France, and attracted considerable attention.

The experiment was first made in France by M. d’Alibard, at Marli,
on May 10, 1752, and it was repeated shortly afterwards by M. de Lor
in Paris. Theresults of what were called the Philadelphia experiments
were communicated to the Royal Society and caused quite a stir in
scientific circles. It is right to say with regard to the Royal Society
that Franklin’s claims to scientific recognition were championed by Sir
William Watson and were fully indorsed by the society by his election
to a fellowship and the award of the Copley medal, together with the
free donation of the society’s ''ransactions during his life.

Franklin’s own experiments with kites are well known, as is also the
method of protecting buildings from lightning which was introduced
by him, and is still very widely used, although it has been greatly
abused by the lightning-rod man.

During the next decade Canton discovered the now commonly known
difference between vitreous and resinous electricity. Beccaria experi-
mented on the conducting power of water. Symmer made a number of
interesting experiments on the electrification of different kinds of
fabrics by friction and propounded a theory of two electric fluids.
Contemporaneous with these were a number of other experimenters
who added to the stock of knowledge of this class of phenomena.

The experiments of A\pinus and others on the pyroelectric proper-
ties of tourmaline now began to attract attention. The experiments
of the Abbé Haiiy are perhaps the most important in this connection
at this stage of the subject. He found the polar properties of the
crystal and showed that similar properties were possessed by a number
220 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

of other crystals. Apinus made experiments in other branches of
electricity, but he is chiefly noted for his ingenious single-fluid theory
of electricity.

Between the years 1770 and 1780 the electrical organs of the torpedo
were one of the principal topics of discussion. The experiments of
Waish and Ingenhousz were the first to definitely settle the character
of the peculiar power of the fish.

The experiments of Cavendish belong to this period and were remark-

able as being quantitative in their character. Considering the means
at his command, the measurements made by this experimenter of the
relative conducting powers of various substances must always excite
admiration. Cavendish also proved the composition of water by caus-
ing different proportions of oxygen and hydrogen to unite by means of
the electric spark.
- We now come to the classical experiments of Coulomb, who estab-
lished the law of the variation of the electric force with distance to be
that of the inverse square, a law which had previously been inferred
from experiments on spheres by Dr. Robinson, who, however, did not
publish his results. Coulomb made an elaborate series of experiments
on the distribution of electricity over charged conductors as influenced
by shape and the proximity of other charged bodies. His theoretical
and experimental work formed the basis of the mathematical theory as
developed shortly afterwards by Laplace, Biot, and Poisson, the work
of the latter being particularly important.

Toward the end of the eighteenth century were made the important
researches of Laplace, Lavoisier, and Volta, and of Sausure on the
electricity produced by evaporation and combustion. This is a subject
destined to figure prominently again in the future, and in its rise there
is in all probability involved the rapid decline in the importance of the
steam engine. I should not be surprised if many of those present
should live to see the steam enyine practically a thing of the past.

To the eighteenth century, also, we must assign the discovery of
galv:nic electricity, as the famous frog experiments were made ip
1790. Practically no development was made, however, until Volta’s
work attracted the attention of the scientific world.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, then, we find the
subjects of greatest interest were the discoveries of Volta and the
invention of the voltaic pile. There followed almost immediately the
discovery by Nicholson and Carlisle of the decomposition of water by
the voltaic current. ‘Chis discovery was followed a few years later by
those of Sir Humphry Davy on the decomposition of the alkalies and
the separation of metallic sodium and potassium. Thus the subject of
electrolysis was fairlv lannched, and what it has grown tu be we will
see later.

Can there be some interrelation between electricity and magnetism?
was now the query. The first positive answer seems to have been
' THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE. 221

given by Romagnesi in a work published in 1805, but little or no notice
appears to have been taken of this. Certainly no progress was -made
in the subject till 1820, when Oersted made his famous experiment
before his class. By that experiment he proved that a wire carrying
an electric current will, when properly placed, deflect a magnetic
needle. The subject was almost immediately taken up by Ampére, and
in a few months many of the important consequences which Oersted’s
discovery involved were developed. Ampere’s work on the action of
currents on currents and on magnets is classical and is still treated as
part of the fundamental basis for the theory of electrodynamics. An
account of his work may therefore be found in almost any of the nu-
merous text-books on electricity. The conclusions reached by Ampére
were confirmed by Weber by a series of much more refined experiments.
To Weber also we owe improvements in galvanometers. The same
year marks the discovery by Arago that a current can not only deflect
a magnet, but that it is capable of producing one by magnetizing steel
needles.

The further discovery was made four years later by Sturgeon that
soft iron, although incapable of making a strong permanent magnet, is
yet much more susceptible than steel to temporary magnetization by
the electric current. Arago also made about this time the important
discovery that if a needle be suspended above a copper dise andthe
dise rotated the needle will be dragged round with the disc. This was
not explained for some years, but seems to be the first discovery of
induced currents.

These experiments mark the discovery of electro-magnetism, and
began one of the most important eras in electrical discovery, the work
which has been participated in by many eminent authorities. Among
the many advances may be mentioned the experiments of Henry on the
relative effects of different windings on the strength of an electro-
magnet. He deduced the fact that the magnetizing action might be
increased either by increasing the number of windings, the current
remaining the same, or by increasing the current, the winding remain-
ing the same. He pointed out the application of this to intensity and
quantity arrangements of the battery, and also the importance of the
intensity winding for the transmission of magnetizing power to a dis-
tance, as in telegraphy. The increased effect due to increasing the
number of windings on the coil of a galvanoscope bad been previously
pointed out by Schweigger, and the discovery is embodied in Schweig-
ger’s galvanoscope.

In 1821 Faraday began his researches and many inportant discov-
eries were made by him. The main guiding idea in Faraday’s work
was the possibility of obtaining electricity from magnetism and in gen-
eral the discovery of the interrelation between the two. In this con-
nection Arago’s discovery of the rotation of a copper dise by the rota-
tion of a magnet above it is of great importance, because, among other
222 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

things, Faraday set himself to explain this. The result was the dis-
covery of the commutatorless dynamo, or Faraday disk. In view of
modern developments, probably the most important of Faraday’s dis-
coveries was that of the production of a current in a circuit when a
current is either established or varied in strength in an adjacent cir-
cuit. This was followed by the discovery that relative motion of two
circuits, one of which carried a current, produced a current in the other,
and that the motion of a magnet in the neighborhood of a circuit pro-
duced a current in the circuit. Another important discovery by Fara-:
day was that of the quantitative laws which govern electrolytic decom-
position, thus giving us our electro-chemical equivalents.

At this time Lenz was led by experiment to the discovery of his
celebrated law of induction, namely, that the current produced always
in turn produces forces tending to oppose the change. For example,
if a current be induced in a coil by bringing a magnet toward it the
mutual action between the magnet and the current is to oppose the
magnet’s approach. This is important when looked at from the point
of view of the conservation of energy or aS an argument against per-
petual motion. Lenz’s law is, of course, when the actions are properly
understood, a consequence of Newton’s third law of motion.

Discoveries similar to those of Faraday as to induced currents were
made almost simultaneously by Henry in this country. We have in
the discoveries of Faraday and Henry the fundamental information
required for nearly the whole of our recent developments in dynamo-
electric generators and electric motors, but it was reserved for the next
generation to develop them. This development we owe in no small
degree to the splendid exposition of Faraday’s discoveries and their
consequences contained in Maxwell’s book on electricity and magnetism.

Going back for a moment to 1822, we have to notice another important
discovery, namely, the thermoelectric couple by Seebeck. There fol-
lowed almost immediately the important experiment of Cumming, who
showed that the thermoelectric order of the metals is not the same at
all temperatures.

The next important discovery in thermoelectricity was that of Peltier,
of the heat generated at the junction of two metals when a current is
forced across it against the electro-motive force of the junction. In
later years we have the classic researches of Thomson (Kelvin), who
added thermoelectric convection and the specific heat of electricity
and gave the thermoelectric diagram method of representing results.
This method was afterwards used and extended by Tait, who added a
good deal to our knowledge of thermoelectric data. Among the large
number of others who have worked in this field we may mention
Becquerel, Magnus, Matthieson, Leroux, and Avenarius. Thermo-
electric batteries of considerable power have been made by Clamond
and others.

In 1827 the celebrated law giving the relation between electro-motive
~

force resistance and current was published by Ohm in a paper on the

mathematical theory of the galvanic circuit. The theory has been
sometimes criticised, but there seems to be absolute certainty that the
law is almost exact, and it has proved of the greatest importance in the
further development of the subject of electric measurements.

The subject had about the middle of the century reached a stage in
which it was possible to develop almost completely the mathematical
theory as we now have it. Most of the work since Faraday’s time has
been directed toward quantitative measurements and the furnishing of
exact data to answer questions as to how much in various cases. F. E.
Neumann discovered what he called the potential function (now called
the coefficient of self and mutual induction) of one current on another
and on itself, and succeeded in giving a theory of induction which was
in accordance with the experimental laws. The laws were afterwards
experimentally verified by Weber. In 1849 the experiments of Kir-
choff on the absolute value of the current induced in one circuit by
another, and in the same year Edlund’s experiments on self and mutual
induction are important. In 1851 Helmholtz gave a mathematical
theory of this part of the subject, which he supplemented with an
experimental verification.

One of the most important of the series of experiments made by
Henry was on the oscillatory character of the discharge from a Leyden
jar. This ke discovered from the effect of the discharge on a steel
needle surrounded by a coil, through which the current was made to
pass. The results of these experiments were communicated to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1850, but he
knew of the effect much earlier, certainly in 1841. Previously the
anamolous behavior of the discharge of a jar when used to magnetize
steel needles had been noticed, but was attributed, as I believe, to
some peculiarity of the steel. Henry was the first to appreciate the
true reason, although he could hardly at that time be expected to see
the great importance of his discovery.

Helmholtz, in 1847, suggests that the discharge of Leyden jars may
be of the nature of a backward and forward movement. There is a
curious parallelism in the work of several investigators about this time,
and particularly in that of Helmholtz and Thomson. In the Philosoph-
ical Magazine for 1855 there is a paper by Prof. W. Thomson (Kelvin)
in which the theory of the discharge of a Leyden jar is discussed and
the prediction made that under certain specified conditions the dis-
charge must be oscillatory. A number of similar papers, going back
to 1848, treat of similar subjects. Henry’s results do not appear to
have become generally known, and we find the verification of Thom-
son’s prediction in 1857 by Feddersen. A number of other physicists
have investigated the subject, the work of Schiller being of particular
value. The recent applications will be referred to later.

The mathematical theory of electrostatics and magnetism was greatly
294 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

extended about this time by Thomson and others, and received its
most complete statement at the hands of Maxwell in his papers read
before the Royal Society and in his book, published in 1873 but still
the standard of reference. Very little has since been discovered which
was not foreshadowed by Maxwell’s theory or contained in his equa-
tions, which have been found general enough to cover almost every-
thing, although experiment has generally been necessary to suggest
the consequences of the theory.

The practical applications of electricity have played a most impor-
tant partin the development of the subject during the last sixty years.
Indeed, a great part of the work of these years has had some practical
applicationin view. One of the first of these practical applications was
that of telegraphy.

The telegraph, being one of the earliest of the practical developments,
naturally had a great effect in stimulating the advance in knowledge
of electricity, and hence I give a somewhat fuller sketch of its early
history than space will permit for the later applications.

The discovery of Stephen Gray, in 1729, that the electrical influence
could be conveyed to a distance by means of an insulated wire is
probably the first of direct influence in connection with telegraphy.
As a result of this discovery and the investigations which followed it,
a considerable number of proposals were made as to the use of the
electrical force for the transmission of intelligence. The first of these
of which I have found any record was made in 1753 by Charles Mor-
rison, a Scotchman, and then followed other proposals for electrostatic
telegraphs by Bozolus in 1767, by Le Sage in 1774, by Lomond in 1787,
by Betancourt in the same year, by Reizen in 1794, by Cavalla in 1795,
and by Ronalds in 1816.

The discovery of voltaic electricity, and most directly the discovery
of Nicholson and Carlisle of electrolysis, gave rise to another group of
proposals for the application of this discovery to the production of
telegraphy. Among those may be mentioned that of Sdmmering in
1809, of Coxe in 1810, and of Sharpe in 1813. In more recent years,
of course, the same application appears in the chemical telegraphs,
some of which are capable of giving very satisfactory results and great
speed.

The discovery which had the greatest influence on the development
of telegraphy was that of Oersted, supplemented by the work ot
Schweigger and Ampere. Ampere proposed a multiple-wire telegraph
with galvanoscope indicators in 1820, and a modification was con-
structed by Ritchie. A single-circuit telegraph of this character was
invented by Tribaoillet, but did not come into use. In 1832 Schilling’s
five-needle telegraph appeared, and he also used a single-needle instru-
ment, but his early death stopped further progress. In 1833 Schilling’s
telegraph was developed, to some extent, by Gauss and Weber, who
used it for experimental purposes. The following quotation, referring
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE. 225

to Gauss and Weber’s telegraph, from Poggendorf’s Annalen, is of con-
siderable historical interest:

‘““There is, in connection with these arrangements, a great and until
now in its way novel project, for which we are indebted to Professor
Weber. This gentleman erected, during the past year, a double-wire
line over the houses of the town (G6ttingen), from the Physical
Cabinet to the Observatory, and lately a continuation from the latter
building to the Magnetic Observatory. Thus an immense galvanic
chain is formed, in which the galvanic current, the two multipliers
at the ends being included, has to travel a distance of nearly 9,000
(Prussian) feet. The line wire is mostly of copper, of that known as
‘No. 3,’ of which 1 meter weighs 8 grams. The wire of the multipliers
in the Magnetic Observatory is of copper, ‘No. 14,’ silvered, and of which
1 meter weighs 2.6 grams. This arrangement promises to offer oppor-
tunities for a number of interesting experiments. We regard, not
without admiration, how a single pair of plates, brought into con-
tact at the farther end, instantaneously communicate a movement
to the magnetic bar, which is deflected at once for over a thousand
divisions of the scale.”

Further on in the same paper:

“The ease with which the manipulator has the magnetic needle
in his command, by means of the communicator, had a year ago
suggested experiments of an application to telegraphic signaling,
which, with whole words and even short sentences, completely suc-
ceeded. There is no doubt that it would be possible to arrange an
uninterrupted telegraph communication in the same way between
two places at a considerable number of miles distance from each
other.”

The method of producing the currents in Gauss and Weber’s experi-
ments was an application of the important discoveries of Faraday and
Henry, above referred to, in the induction of current by currents and
by magnets.

On the recommendation of Gauss, this telegraph was taken up by
Steinheil, who, following their example, also used induced currents.
The important contributions of Steinheil were the discovery of the
earth return circuit, the invention of a telegraphic alphabet, and a
recording telegraph. Steinheil contributes an account of his telegraph
to Sturgeon’s Annals of Electricity, in which the relative merits of
scopic, recording, and acoustic telegraphs are discussed, and the
advantages, which experience has since brought into prominence, of
the acoustic form are pointed out.

Schiller’s telegraph was exhibited at a meeting of German natural-
ists held at Bonn in 1835, and was there seen by Professor Muncke, of
Heidelberg, who, after his return to Heidelberg, made models of the
telegraph and exhibited them in his class room. These models were
seen by Cooke in the early part of 1836, and gave him the idea of intro-
ducing the electric telegraph in England. Cooke afterwards became
associated with Wheatstone, and a large number of ingenious arrange-

sm 98——15
226 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

ments for telegraphing was the result. Many of the later developments
by Wheatstone are still in use and are hard to beat.

Steinhei! appears to have been anticipated in the idea of making the
telegraph self-recording by Morse, who, according to evidence brought
forward by himself, thought out some arrangements as early as 1832.
Exactly what Morse’s first ideas were seems somewhat doubtful, and
he did nothing till 1835, when he made a rough model of an electro-
magnetic recording telegraph. Morse’s mechanical arrangements were
of little merit, and his alphabet and method of interpretation by a dic-
tionary were clumsy and inconvenient. The chief point of interest in
connection with the early history of the Morse telegraph was the pro-
posal to make use of Sturgeon’s discovery of electro-magnetism of soft
iron. Morse, however, seems to have known practically nothing of the
subject except that iron could be magnetized by a current, and in con-
sulting his colleague, Dr. Gale, he was unwittingly led to use the
discoveries of Henry, who had previously practically solved the whole
problem. Much of the subsequent improvement in the mechanical
arrangements were due to Vail, who became associated with Morse, and
the Morse code as we now know it was almost, if not entirely, worked
out by Vail. Considerable dispute and some litigation arose over
Morse’s claims, but that is outside our present subject. There is no
doubt that the electric telegraph was a slow growth, inventors, with a
view to pecuniary and other advantage, being ever ready to lay hold
of each scientific discovery and try to turn it toaccount. The question
who first conceived the idea can never be satisfactorily answered.

After 1840 there is little to record of a purely electrical character
bearing only on telegraphy, but there have been many very ingenious
mechanical contrivances introduced for recording signals, for repro-
ducing pictures and handwriting, and for printing, for duplexing, quad-
ruplexing, and multiplexing telegraph lines, for increasing the rate of
signaling, and in many ways increasing the expedition with which
messages can be sent. Of course the success of many of these con-
trivances, and even their invention, depended upon an increased knowl-
edge of the laws of electricity and magnetism. For example, effective
duplexing, quadruplexing, etc., depends on a proper understanding of
the electrostatic capacity of the line, and this was not understood prop-
erly until the mathematical investigations of Thomson and others
cleared the matter. For the impetus toward discovery in this direction
again we are largely indebted to telegraphy, for much of that class of
work was suggested by the difficulties encountered in signaling through
long submarine cables.

The invention of the telephone is fast becoming ancient history, and
yet it will always mark one of the greatest of the useful applications
of electricity. It does not call for more than a passing remark here,
because electro-inagnetically it is all in Faraday’s and Henry’s papers.

The radiophone should be mentioned becauseit marks the application

of the discovery, by May and Smith, of the effect of light on the resist-
ance of selenium. This effect has since been found in the case of a
large number of other substances, but it is still an interesting field for
research. A number of experiments on this subject have been associ-
ated with attempts to make things visible at a distance. No doubt it
will ultimately be possible not only to talk to a distant party, but also
to see the party talked to, and thus, as it were, look the party with
whom you are conversing in the eye.

The subject of telegraphy is closely associated with the present excel-
lent system of electrical measurements and with the invention of many
of our most delicate measuring instruments. As the applications of
electricity increased there gradually grew up a new branch of engineer-
ing, a branch, however, in which the foot rule, pound weight, chro-
nometer, and thermometer were not sufficient. Other standards of meas-
urement were required, in order that quantities could be gauged and
consistent work done. The way to connect the measurements of the
new quantities with the units already in use in dynamics had been
pointed out by Gauss and others, and at the suggestion of Thomson
the British Association appointed a committee in 1861 to determine the
best standard of electrical resistance. This led to an unexpected
amount of work, not only on a standard of resistance, but also on the
general subject of electrical measurement. The committee regretted,
at the end of the first year, that it could not give a final report, but
hoped that the inherent difficulty and importance of the subject would
sufficiently account for the delay. It can hardly be said that the final
report has yet been forthcoming, as a committee with some of the origi-
nal members in it still exists and reports regularly every year on valu-
able work done byit. The committee worked energetically for a number
of years, not only on the standard of resistance, but on those of cur-
rent, electro-motive force and capacity. It incidentally supplied a great
deal of quantitative data on a number of subjects, and particularly as
to the permanence of alloys, the variation of their resistance with tem-
perature as depending on their composition, and so forth. In looking
over the results of the early work of the British Association committee
one is apt to indulge in adverse criticism. It is hard for many of the
younger workers to appreciate the difficulties which are met in a first
attempt. It would be equally just to congratulate ourselves that we
have better marksmen to-day than there were fifty years ago, with-
out making allowance for the modern rifle.

The first absolute determination of resistance was probably that
made by Kirchhoff about fifty yearsago. Weber published his method in
1352, and then came the British Association determination by Maxwell,
Stewart, and Jenkin in 1863. Neither of these was very exact, but they
paved the way for the splendid exhibitions of experimental skill which
followed. Among those to whom we are most indebted for this later
work may be mentioned Kohlrausch, Rayleigh, Glazebrook, Rowland,
228 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

Wiedemann, Mascart, etc. The greatest step in advance in recent
years has been the invention of the revolving-disk method by Lorenz,
of Copenhagen, and its subsequent improvement and application by
himself and by J. V. Jones. The determinations made by the latter by
this method are probably almost absolutely correct.

A subject which has attracted much attention comes in incidentally
here, namely, the electro-magnetic theory of light propagation suggested
by Maxwell. According to this theory the ratio of the electro-magnetic
unit of quantity of electricity to the electro-static unit ought to be the
same as the velocity of light. In 1868 a determination of this ratio was
made by McKichan under Lord Kelvin’s direction, and gave close agree-
ment with the theory. Since that time determinations have been made
by various methods by Maxwell, Shida, Ayrtin and Perry, J. J.
Thomson, Rosa, Lodge, Glazebrook, and others, with the result that
the ratio of the two units does not differ from the velocity of light by
more than the probable error of observation. The work here referred
to may not appear to be very directly associated with the determination
of standards of measurements. It is, however, one of the investigations
which has been made possible by the work of the British Association
committee in the production of instruments of precision. Prominent
among these instruments stands the Kelvin electrometers, and particu-
larly the absolute electrometer which was described in the report of the
British Association committee for 1867.

Another subject of great interest in itself and in connection with
Maxwell’s theory is that of the specific inductive capacity of dielectries.
Experiments on this subject were made by Faraday, but comparatively
little was done before 1870, in which year an excellent paper was com-
municated to the Royal Society by Gibson and Barclay on the specific
inductive capacity of paraffin. Since that time much good work has
been done by Boltzman, Hopkinson, Quincke, Silow, Klemencic, Negre-
ano, and others. The theoretical importance of these experiments is
due to the fact that, according to Maxwell’s theory, the specific induct-
ive capacity of nonmagnetic dielectrics should be proportional to the
squares of their indices of refraction. A wonderful verification of Max-
well’s theory was carried out only some ten years ago by Hertz, who
showed not only that electrical waves exist, but also how to measure
their wave length and period. We have in these experiments splendid
illustrations of the oscillatory discharge referred to above, as discovered
by Henry and predicted by Thomson, and as a result several new ways of
determining electrical quantities have been developed. It is now pos-
sible, for example, to compare the capacity of condensers by means of
oscillatory currents of exceedingly short periods, and thus to determine
the dielectric constants of many materials to which the older methods
were not easily applicable.

It is somewhat difficult to decide where to place a reference to the
recent discovery of Kéntgen and its development in photography, but
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE. 229

probably it comes in well here. Just how to apply Maxwell’s equation
to the Rontgen rays is not yet quite clear, but there is no doubt as to
the great importance of the discovery.

As an outcome of all this activity in the determination of standards
and in the absolute measurements of the electrical properties of mate-
rials, combined with the great commercial demand produced by the
introduction of dynamo machinery, we have now many excellent instru-
ments at our disposal for absolute measurement and suitable either for
practical applications or for the most refined laboratory work. For the
production of these we are indebted to a host of inventors, prominent
among whom may be mentioned Lord Kelvin, Lord Rayleigh, Ayrton
and Perry, Mather, Swinburne, Cardew, and Weston.

Magneto-electric and dynamo-electrie generators and motors have
now become so common that we are apt to forget that their introduc-
tion on an extensive scale has only taken a few years. Faraday’s disk
dynamo was, as has already been stated, produced in 1831, and a
machine for generating electricity was made by Pixii in the following
year. Pixii’s machine consisted of a horseshoe permanent magnet
which was rotated in such a way that its poles passed alternately in
front of the poles of a similar electro-magnet. An alternating current
was thus induced in the circuit which included the coils of the electro-
magnet.

This machine was improved by Clarke, who rotated the coils and put
a commutator on the axis. Other machines were made or suggested
by various physicists, and an important observation, which has since
been frequently overlooked, was made at this time by Jacobi, who
pointed out the importance of making the cores of the coils short.
Sturgeon, in 1835, made a dynamo with a shuttle-shaped armature; a
similar form has long been identified with the name of Siemens. Wool-
rich made a multipolar-magneto machine in 184i for electroplating, and
Wheatstone about this time produced his small multipolar magneto,
long used for telegraph purposes. In 1845 Wheatstone and Cooke
patented the use of electro-magnets in place of the permanent magnets,
and Brett suggested, in 1848, that the current from the machine might
be made to pass round a coil surrounding the magnet and thus increase
its strength. A similar suggestion was independently made in 1851
by Sinsteden. In 1849 Pulvermacher proposed the use of thin lamin
of iron for the cores of the magnet, a proposition which has since, but
probably for a different reason, been almost universally adopted. Sin-
steden used iron wire cores and made a number of experiments on the
effect of varying the pole face. About this time another class of
machines were proposed by Ritchie, Page, and Dujardin. In these
machines both the magnets and the coils were to be stationary, but
the magnetism was to be varied by revolving soft iron pieces in front
of the poles. Modern representatives of these machines are to be found
in the dynamos of Kingdon, Stanley, and others. All the machines up
230 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

to this time had been of very small dimensions. In 1849 Nollet began
the construction of an alternating machine on a larger scale, but died
before it was completed. Machines of Nollet’s type were afterwards
meade by Holmes and by the Compagnie |’Alliance, of Paris, the latter
being called the Alliance machine. These machines were used for
light-house purposes. Holmes’s earlier machines were continuous eur-
rent, but later he left out the commutator, and still later again intro-
duced it on part of the coils for the purpose of obtaining current to
excite his field magnets. This latter plan was introduced after the
self-exciting principle had been introduced by Siemens and Wheat-
stone. A remarkable machine, historically, was patented in 1848 by
Hjorth. In this machine a combination of the permanent and electro
magnet was used, the first to give mechanism enough to produce a
current with which to excite the other. A similar idea was developed
fifteen years later by Wilde, with the difference that the permanent-
magnet part was a separate machine. The idea of using part of the
current from the armature to excite, or partially excite, the field mag-
nets was at this time in the minds of a number of workers, and some
remarkable machines were patented by the brothers Varley, one of
which, containing both a shunt and a series winding, has been held by
some to anticipate the compound winding now in use. In 1867 it seems
to have occurred independently to Wheatstone and HE. Werner Siemens
that the permanent-magnet part of the Hjorth and Wilde machines
might be dispensed with, the residual magnetism being used to start
the action. Siemens gave the name dynamo-electric machine to this
type, and it has stuck. In order to diminish the fluctuations in the
strength of the current during one revolution of the armature Pacinotti
devised his multigrooved armature in 1864. This machine did not
receive the notice it deserved for a number of years, and in the mean-
time Gramme produced his smooth-ring armature, in 1870. Gramme’s
machine was soon recognized as being of great merit, and its gradual
introduction gave rise to increased activity. In 1873 the Hefner-
Alteneck improvements on the Siemens armature were introduced and
in the remaining seventies quite a number of forms of dynamo were
invented, the Lontin type, introduced in 1875 with improvement in
subsequent years, being one of the best. The early eighties saw
tremendous activity; the patent offices in Europe and America were
flooded with inventions of various types of dynamos and motors, of
lamps for electric lighting, etc. Itis curious how few of those machines
have stood the test of time and how well the old types of Pacinotti,
Gramme, Siemens-Alteneck, and Lontin in some one of their modifica-
tions hold the field. Great progress has been made in the last fifteen
years. Machines have assumed enormous proportions and the number
of branches of industry to which they have been applied is now very
large. Much has been learned during this time, particularly with
regard to alternating currents and their application to the transmission
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE. Zab

of power, the introduction of Multiphase systems being of considerable
importance in this connection. In the direction of high potential and
great frequency the work of E. Thomson and Tesla is of great interest.

Of the application of electricity to the production of light and heat
little need be said in this connection. The difficulties to be overcome
were largely mechanical, and with the progress made we are all familiar.

As regards primary batteries there has been, of course, as we all
know, considerable progress since the time of Volta. The number of
forms brought into use has been enormous and they have been impor-
tant in increasing our knowledge of the relative electro-motive force of
various combinations and in their bearing on chemical knowledge. It
ean hardly be said that an ideal primary battery has yet been obtained,
when we look at the subject from a commercial point of view. Although
the subject is not very much to the front at present, however, it is des-
tined to come again, and will, I have no doubt, be in a comparatively
short time one of our leading industries.

The work of Planté and of Faure and others on secondary batteries
has been of great value commercially. They gave rise to several chem-
ical problems, but the main difficulty here also has been of a mechan-
ical kind, and they have not added much to the knowledge of electrical
laws. .

The transformation of alternating currents from high to low potential
and vice versa, by means of what are commonly called transformers,
has shown another remarkable development of Faraday’s discovery of
induced currents. [The application of transformers has made it possi-
ble to distribute electrical energy over large areas in a moderately
economical manner, and incidentally has led to considerable increase
in the knowledge of the magnetic properties of iron.

One of the most important of the applications of electricity is that of
electro-chemistry. The chemical action of the electric spark was noticed
by Van Groest and Dieman in1739 in the decomposition of water.
Beceari, about the middle of the eighteenth century, obtained metals
from oxides through which the spark had passed, and in 1778 Priestly
noted the production of an acid gas when the electric spark was passed
through air. Similar experiments were made by Cavendish and Van
Marum on decomposed ammonia. It is not, however, until after the
discovery of the voltaic cell that the subject of electrolysis really begins.
‘I have already referred to the discovery of Nicholson and Carlisle in
1800, and the subsequent work of Davy andof Faraday. The peculiar
phenomenon of the appearance of separated elements only at the end
plates in the electrolytic cell led to considerable speculation, and was
explained by Grothuss on the supposition that the molecules separated
into two parts, one positively and the other negatively electrified, and
that these parts formed a chain between the plates along which chem-
ical action traveled by a continual interchange of mates, the end parts
going to the plates. This theory was held for many years, and is still
Pon THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

to be found in some text-books. Faraday’s work is by far the most
valuable of the early contributions to the subject. He gave the fol-
lowing laws:

The amount of chemical decomposition in electrolysis is proportional
to the current and the time of its action.

The mass of an ion liberated by a definite quantity of electricity is
directly proportional to its chemical equivalent weight.

The quantity of electricity which is required to decompose a certain
amount of an electrolyte is equal to the quantity which would be pro-
duced by recombining the separated ions in a battery.

These laws are all of the greatest importance, and the last one clearly
points out the reversibility of the electrical process. By forcing a current
through an electrolyte it is decomposed and the mutual potential energy
of the components consequently increased. By allowing the compo-
nents to recombine in a battery the mutual potential energy is reduced
and a current of electricity is the result. An excellent illustration of
this action is exhibited by the secondary battery.

In 1857 Clausius gave a theory of electrolysis and at the same time
reviewed the weaknesses of the hypotheses of Grothuss and others.
Clausius assumes that the molecules of the liquid are in continual
motion; that impacts frequently occur which produce temporary disso-
ciation, leaving atomic groups charged with opposite electricities, and
that during these separations any directive agency, such as an electro-
inotive force, is able to cause a motion of these atoms in opposite
directions. This is probably the first indication of the idea of the
purely directive character of the applied electro-motive force taking
advantage of dissociation to produce chemical separation.

The energy side of the problem now began to attract attention, and
the development of what may be called the thermodynamics of electro-
chemistry began. Among the most prominent workers in this field
have been Joule, Helmholtz, Gibbs, Kelvin, Boscha, and Favre.

In 1853 Hittorf made quantitative determination of the change of
concentration near the electrodes when a current is passed through a
solution. This work is of historical interest, because it formed practi-
cally the starting point for what may be called the modern view of
electrolysis. Hittorf’s experiments extended over several years and
served practically to establish the theory of the migration of the ions
in the solution. Hittorf communicated the following laws:

The change in concentration due to current is determined by the
motion which the ions have in the unchanged solution.

The unlike ions must have different velocities to produce such change
of concentration.

The numbers which express ionic velocities mean the relative distance
through which the ions move between the salt molecules, or express
their relative velocities in reference to the solution, the change in con-
centration being a function of the relative ionic velocities.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE. 2a0

Hittorf’s analyses enabled him to give numerical values to these
relative velocities. The experiments of Nernst, Loeb, and others have
extended Hittorf’s results, and have shown that in dilute solutions the
relative velocities of the ions are independent of the difference of poten-
tial between the electrodes, and are only slightly, if at all, influenced
by temperature. Hittorf pointed out that a knowledge of the conduc-
tivity of electrolytes should give valuable information in reference to
the nature of electrolytic action. A great deal of work has been done
in this direction by Horsford, Wiedemann, Beetz, the Kohlrauschs, and
others. The most notable, perhaps, was the work ot P. Kohlrausch,
who devised a method of measurement using alternating current, by
which results of high accuracy were obtained. Kohlrausch’s results
give the sum of the ionic velocities, and thus, combined with the results
of Hittorf on change of concentration, which gave the ratios, the abso
lute velocity can be obtained. It appears from these results that the
velocity of the ion in very dilute solutions depends only on its own
nature and not upon the nature of the other ions with which it may be
associated. For example, the velocity of the chlorine ion is the same
when determined from solutions of KCl, NaCl, or HCl. The impor-
tant general law has also been found that the conductivities of neu-
tral salts are additively made up of two values, one dependent on the
positive, the other upon the negative ion. If, then, the velocities of the
ions themselves be known, the conductivity of a salt may be calculated.
The results of Kohlrausch received strong confirmation from some very
ingenious experiments by Lodge and Whetham, in which the migration
of the ions was made to produce a change of color in the solution, and
could thus be directly observed.

In 1887 the theory was advanced by Arrhenius and Ostwald that
dissociation is directly effected by solution or fusion and that in very
dilute solutions the dissociation is practically complete. Arrhenius
holds that the ions carry charges of electricity, positive or negative,
dependent upon their nature, but of equal quantity in every ion. The
remaining part of the theory is similar to that of Clausius and others.
According to this theory the ratio of electric conductivities for different
densities of solution gives a measure of the relative dissociation or
ionization. If the act of solution effects the dissociation necessary to
admit of electrolysis, chemically pure substances ought not to be decom-
posed by the electric current, and this is found to be the case. It is
curious that two substances like hydrochloric acid and water, which
separately are insulators, should, when mixed, conduct readily, and
that practically only one of them should be decomposed. This, how-
ever, is only one of the many problems still to be solved. Another
question is how do the ions obtain their electric charge? Still another,
what is the nature of the force which causes ionization? There are
many more.

When we turn to the commercial application of electro-chemistry we
234 THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.

are met with astonishing evidence of activity. Only twenty years ago
there was comparatively little evidence of the importance of this
branch of applied electricity. At the electrical exhibition in London
in 1881 electro-chemistry was apparently of comparatively little promi-
nence. A factory which could annually produce a few hundreds of
tons of copper electrolytically was considered a wonder. The produc-
tion of thousands of tons a month is beginning to be looked upon as
commonplace. There is scarcely a metal which can not be deposited
electrolytically with comparative ease, and the prices of some of the
rarer metals is going down rapidly. Zine used to be considered a
difficult metal to deposit successfully. It is now produced in some of
the Australian mines in almost a pure state from refractory ores at the
rate of thousands of tons per annum. Similarly the old method of
galvanizing is rapidly disappearing and electro-deposition is taking its
place, and this metal is now so deposited on the hulls of ships, on anchors,
and other smaller articles, cheaply and perfectly. A new industry has
practically sprung up, and there is every indication that the technical
chemist of the near future will have to take an inferior place unless he
be also well versed in electricity and electrical appliances. This branch
of applied science is revolutionizing many things. It has within a
few years produced an enormous improvement in our magazine illustra-
tions, and has at the same time reduced the cost of this kind of litera-—
ture and of atlases and charts enormously. Electro-chemistry is now
used on a large scale for the production of chlorate of potash, bleaching
materials, alkalies, coloring matters, antiseptics (like iodoform), anzs-
thetics (like chloroform), etc. In fact, it is getting to be difficult even
to enumerate the manufactures in which it is used. It has revolution-
ized the extraction of gold, and plants of enormous capacity are now in
use in some of the gold fields, the poorest ores and tailings being made
to yield up almost the last trace of the precious metal. The production
of ozone by the ton, the purification of sewage, and the sterilization of
water are all accomplished facts.

Some progress has even been made in the introduction of chemicals
through animal tissue by electrolysis or cataphoresis, and Rontgen has
shown us how to see through the body. .

Then, again, we have got the electric furnace, and with it the power
to fuse almost the most refractory substances. In this way aluminum
is now produced at a few cents a pound, whereas most of us remember
when its price had to be reckoned in hundreds of dollars. In a similar
way phosphorus is now produced on a large scale, as are also various
carbides, carborundum, acetylene, ete.

It.is impossible to look back over the history of electricity and its
applications and notice the apparent geometric ratio in which advances
are being made, and not to speculate on what a giant this science is
going to become in another quarter of a century. Undoubtedly no one
can study this one branch of science without being persuaded of the
great value of scientific work for the advancement of human enterprise.
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE!

By SILvanus P. THompson, F. R.S.

There is no such thing as wireless telegraphy. True, one can send
signals for a distance of a yard or two without any wires, but in all the
recent successful attempts to telegraph across space, whether by elec-
tric waves or by other means, wires are used. They do not indeed run
from the sending station to the receiving station, but are used as base
lines. For example, in the case of the longest distance yet reached in
telegraphing by electric waves—15 miles over open country—the maxi-
mum distance obtained in the recent experiments of Professor Slaby,
the length of the wires used as base lines at each end was nearly 1,000
feet. As will be seen, in every case, wires or their equivalent are used
to serve either as base lines or as base areas in the transmission.

Setting aside the medieval myth of a sympathetic magnetic tele-
graph with two mere compass needles to point to letters ranged
around a dial, there are three generic methods by which it has been
found possible to signal across space without any directly communicat-
ing wire or cable. These may be conveniently classified as follows:

I. Conduction methods.
II. Induction methods.
III. Wave methods.

I.—CONDUCTION METHODS.

These methods depend upon the use of water or earth as a means of
conducting a fraction of the electric current from the base line at the
sending end to the base line at the receiving end.

From the earliest days of telegraphy it has been a familiar fact that
either earth or water might serve as a return circuit for an electric
current; and, under certain circumstances, that signals could be sent
even with an absolute gap in the metallic line, if there were provided,
by means of earth or water, a sufficiently good path to enable current
in adequate amount to be received beyond. the gap in the line. This
method has sometimes been called the leakage method, since it depends.
upon the circumstance that electric currents flowing in a conducting

235
236 TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE.

medium, such as water or moist earth, do not flow exclusively or even
mainly along the path of least resistance, but spread out, some flowing
along paths of greater resistance. If current enters a conducting
stratum at any point by a single electrode, A, and leaves it at some
other point by another suitable electrode, B, some of the current will
certainly flow straight from A to B; yet the greater part will not so flow,
but will stream around from A to B in long curving paths. If then,
two other electrodes, C and D, are inserted in one of these stream paths
at a distance from A to B, some of the current, perhaps only a small
percentage of it, may be picked up by a metallic line joining C to D.
Hence it is possible, using A B as a sending base line, to signal to C
D as a receiving base line at a distant place. The only limits to this
method of telegraphy across space are (1) the strength of the original
currents used in the sending base line A B; (2) the sensitiveness of the
apparatus used in the receiving base line C D; (3) the ratio between
the space distance from A B to C D and the lengths of the two base
lines. This system of telegraphing across space has been proposed at
various times. It has been used by Mr. Preece in several of those
many experiments which he has made from time to time, and which
will entitle him to be regarded as one of the foremost pioneectss in this
entire branch of telegraphic enterprise.

Morse himself, as recorded in Vail’s early work on telegraphy,
worked at this subject and made experiments in 1842 on the Susque-
hanna River, about a mile wide. He engaged Professor Gale to
investigate the best conditions, and came to the conclusion that the
base lines should be three times as long as the distance to be crossed.
Mr. Dering, an English telegraph engineer, and Mr. Lindsay, of
Dundee, have also worked in this direction.

After the introduction, in 1877-78, of the Bell telephone, it was found
that the extraordinary sensitiveness of that instrument furnished a
new means of picking up currents that would otherwise be too feeble
to produce intelligible signals. The importance of this circumstance
in extending the possibilities of distance telegraphy was not lost upon
Mr. Preece. In 1882 he conducted a series of researches upon the
establishment of telegraphic communication between the Isle of Wight
and the Hampshire coast without any connecting cable across the
Solent. An account of these experiments will be found in the report
of the British Association for that year. Large metal plates, to serve
as electrodes, were immersed in the sea at the ends of the two base
lines. On the Hampshire coast the base line extended from Ports-
mouth through Southampton to Hurst Castle,a length of 20 miles.
On the island the base line extended from Ryde through Newport to
Sconce Point, and was about 16 miles long. From Portsmouth to
Ryde the breadth of the sea is 6 miles, while Hurst Castle is only
about a mile from Sconce Point. Hence, in this case, the length of the
base lines considerably exceeded the average distance to be crossed.
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. Pat

With this arrangement signals were passed in dot and dash which
could be read on the Morse system with ease, but telephonic speech
was not feasible. After many other experiments to be mentioned under
the next heading, Mr. Preece established communication, in the winter
of 1893-94, across the Kilbrannen Sound between the Isle of Arran and
Kintyre, a distance of over 4 miles. He also maintained telephonic
speech across Loch Ness, a distance of 14 miles.

In the experiments from Arran to Kintyre, parallel wires about 3
miles long were used as base lines along the coast, while in some of
the experiments two other base lines were used, being insulated wires
laid along each coast at a height about 500 feet above the sea level.
A detailed account of these experiments will be found in the report of
the British Association for 1894, and is also given in The Electrician,
Vol. XX XIII, August 17, 189+.

A year earlier Mr. Preece had made some striking experiments in the
Bristol Channel between Lavernock Point on the South Wales coast
and the islands of the Flat Holm and the Steep Holm, the distances of
which are respectively 3.1 and 5.35 miles. His base line on the shore
at Lavernock Point was a pair of copper wires, weighing 400 pounds
per mile, suspended on poles for a length of 1,267 yards, their circuit
being completed through earth. An alternating current was sent into
this base line by an alternator worked by a 2-horse power steam engine,
the voltage being 150 volts, the frequency 192 periods per second, and
the current (maximum) 15 amperes. ‘These alternations were broken
up into dots and dashes by use of a Morse key. The signals were read
on a pair of receiving telephones inserted in the distant base line,
which, in each case, ran across the island and dipped into the sea.
The length of theseis not stated. Mr. Preece received messages easily
over the 3 miles separating the mainland from the Flat Holm, but with
Steep Holm 5. 35 miles away, though the signals were feebly perceptible,
telegraphic conversation was impracticable, as the sound could not be
differentiated into dots and dashes. Mr. Preece came to the conclusion
that with two base lines, each LO miles long, he could with ease signal
across a distance of 10 miles.

Professor Trowbridge, of Harvard, has also investigated the possibility
of transmitting signals through the earth by conduction, using a rapidly
interrupted primary current and a telephonic receiving apparatus.

Many experiments have been made under accidental circumstances,
all tending to prove the possibility of this mode of transmitting signals
through the earth itself. The instruments in Greenwich Observatory
are affected by the stray currents that escape into the earth from the
badly insulated return circuit of the City and South London Electric
Railway, 44 miles away. Another example is afforded by an accident
which occurred some ten years since at the Ferranti electric lighting

telegraphs in the signal boxes of the railways in South London were
temporarily put out of order and rendered inoperative, while the
currents flowing in the earth were perceived in the telegraph instru-
ments so far northward as Leicester and so far south as in Paris. If
this could occur as a mere accident, it is obvious that, with properly
thought out arrangements, signals could easily be sent from one part
of the globe to another by conduction through earth or water.

Most striking of all the cases of distance signaling by conductive
methods is that presented by the transmission of signals over nearly 3
miles, which was carried out in 1894 by Dr. W. Rathenau, Mr. E.
Rathenau, and Professor Rubens. They selected as.a suitable place for
operations the open water of the Wannsee, which opens into the Havel,
near Potsdam. Here at the south end, near the Iriedrich-Wilhelms-
briicke, they immersed two metal electrodes, each having about 15
Square meters of surface, at the two ends of a base line about 550 feet
long. With 75 accumulators and a rotating interrupter, giving about
150 currents per second, and a Morse key they iniected signals into
the base line. At a distance of 44 kilometers, or nearly 3 miles
across the water, near the shore at Neu Cladow, they set up the
secondary base line, having electrodes of about 4 square meters each.
These were hung in the water from two boats between which the
connecting line, about 330 feet long, was stretched. In this line was
inserted a telephone receiver of usual pattern. The current used was
about 3 amperes, and there was not the slightest difficulty in hearing
the dot-and-dash messages. Several situations for the receiving base
line were tried; it appeared that the interposition of a large sand bank
between the two stations made very little difference.

I1.—INDUCTION METHODS.

Induction methods are of two varieties. An electric charge upon a
couductor may induce another electric charge at a distance by influence,
or electrostatic induction. An electric current in a wire, during such
time as it is increasing or diminishing, may induce another electric
current in another wire in its neighborhood by electro-magnetic
induction.

So far as I am aware, the only case in which electrostatic induction
has been used in electric signaling is that of telegraphing (or telephoning)
to trains in motion, aS suggested about thirteen years ago by Mr.
Wiley Smith, of Kansas City. If a wire suspended over a train is
electrified, either positively or negatively, charges are induced upon
the metallic roofs of the cars, and if these are suitably connected to
instruments on board the train, signals may be exchanged between
train and wire without any metallic connection between the two. This
suggestion was further developed about the year 1886 by Mr. Phelps
and by Messrs. Gilliland and Edison. Descriptions of their methods
will be found in the American electrical journals of that date. The
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. 239

system was successful both for telegraphing and telephoning, and was
indeed adopted for a time by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company.
But it has been abandoned for a very simple reason. One of the
consolations of railway traveling is that one is free from being disturbed
by telegraph or telephone. No one on board an express wants to
telegraph or to be telegraphed to.

Electro-magnetic induction has played so an important a part in dis-
tance telegraphy that it must receive a more extended notice. Very
early after the introduction of the commercial telephone, troubles arose
from the exceeding sensitiveness of the instrument. Conversations in
one line were overheard in another; while the ear was disturbed by an
incessant buzz, or rattle, from the interference of stray currents from
neighboring telegraph lines. AIl these were at first attributed to in-
duction; that is to say, to the electro-magnetic influence of the currents
in one line upon the neighboring line. No doubt, in some cases, this is
a cause; but unquestionably, in many of the cases, the disturbance
was due not to induction at all, but either to leakage of currents across
the surfaces of the insulating supports, over films of dirt or moisture, or
else to leakage of currents from one line into the other through the
earth plates or earth connections. Unless circuits with metallic returns
are used, it is certain that the earth return will afford a means for
stray currents to find their way into the telephone lines. Mr. Preece
has narrated many cases in which telegraph or telephone messages
that are being transmitted along some line have been heard, or rather
overheard, in telephonic instruments in some totally disconnected and
distant line. Many of these are due doubtless to stray currents
through earth; but some are unquestionably due to true induction.
A line or circuit absolutely insulated from any earth contact or earth
return may yet act inductively. During the brief instant while the
current in it is growing, that current is setting up a magnetic field in
the surrounding region, extending indefinitely, but feebly, into space.
As the current dies away again, this magnetic field also dies away. If
in its growth or decrease, this magnetic field encounters other wires,
it sets up electro-motive forces in them, and thus originates disturb-
ances. For the propagation of this effect from wire to wire no contact
is needed. It is an effect that is dependent upon the properties of the

intervening medium, and is proportional to its magnetic permeability.

The ether of space itself, air, water, soil, and rock, all are of about
equal permeability. Hence this kind of induction may be propagated
from circuit to circuit, whatever natural material intervenes. Mr.
Preece has made repeated researches with the view of utilizing this
effect for the purpose of distance telegraphy. He has erected parallel
base lines, sometimes in South Wales, sometimes near the mouth of
the Dee, sometimes in Scotland. He has laid out, flat on the ground,
great squares of insulated wire, to test the inductive transmission from
one area to another. On Newcastle town moor, and on the sands at
240 TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE.

Penarth, he has thus operated. It is not always easy in his experi-
ments, particularly in those where earth connections were used, to be
certain how much of the effect was due to true induction, and how
much to earth induction. But in some of the cases there can .be no
doubt whatever. An excellent résumé of this work was given by him
at the Chicago congress in 1893. In this he describes how, in one
series of experiments, he laid out on a level plain two one-fourth-mile
squares of copper wire insulated with gutta-percha, the distance between
the two nearest sides of the two squares being also a quarter of a mile.
In this case, using rapidly interrupted or vibratory currents, and a
Morse key to break them up into Morse signals, and applying in the
other circuit a receiving telephone, conversation in the Morse code
could be held readily between the two operators. This arrangement
precluded all idea of earth induction. In effect, Mr. Preece was work-
ing with a strange species of transformer, of which his two squares
constituted respectively the “‘primary” and the “secondary,” the
“core” of the transformer being in this case partly of earth and partly
of air. Mr. A. W. Heaviside has described an analogous case in which,
wishing to establish telephonic communication to the bottom of a
colliery in the north of England, he arranged a circuit in a triangular
form along galleries about 24 miles in total length, at a depth of 60
fathoms. On the surface of the colliery another circuit was laid out in
triangular lines of equal size, over and parallel to the underground
line. Here, again, telephonic speech was perfectly clear by induction
from line to line, or rather, in this case, from area to area. Hach area
inclosed something like 700,000 square yards, an ample base area when
the distance to be penetrated was but 120 yards.

Earlier than the date of either of these experiments, the late Mr.
Willoughby Smith had shown how, using two coiled circuits of wire at
a distance of some yards apart, telephonic messages could be sent
across air, or even through walls and floors.

The greatest distance to which Mr. Preece’s experiments upon tele-
graph lines have been carried is 40 miles, namely, between the tele-
graphic lines that run across the Scottish border by the east and west
coasts respectively. Sounds produced in the Neweastle and Jedburg
line were distinctly heard on the parallel line at Gretna, though there
was no line connecting the two places. Here, however, since both
lines used earth returns, it is probable that most of the effect was due
to conduction, not to true induction.

Instruments which operate by means of alternating currents of high
frequency, like Mr. Langdon-Davies’s phonophore, are peculiarly liable
to set up disturbance in other circuits. A single phonophore circuit
can be heard in lines a hundred miles away. When this first came to
my notice it impressed me greatly; and, coupled in my mind with the
Ferranti incident, mentioned above, caused me to offer to one of my
financial friends in the city, some eight years ago, to undertake seri-
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. 241

ously to establish telegraphic communication with the Cape, provided
£10,000 were forthcoming to establish the necessary basal circuits in
the two countries, and the instruments for creating the currents. My
offer was deemed too visionary for acceptance. The thing, however,
is quite feasible. The one thing necessary is the adequate base lines
or areas. All the rest is detail.

One must not close this section without reverting to a most pregnant
point of advance made about 1888 or 1889 by Dr. Oliver Lodge. When
experimenting upon the oscillatory discharge he conceived the happy
idea of turning two circuits into resonance; or,as he termed it, ‘ syn-
tony ” with one another, in such a way that when an oscillating electric
spark occurred in one of the circuits the inductive effect on the
other immediately set up in it electric oscillations which manifested
themselves by an overflow spark. I call this experiment pregnant,
because it affords a hint of another possibility, namely, that of sig-
naling inductively from one area to another, and using around those
areas not merely circuits of wires, but syntonic cireuits, which, there-
fore, are necessarily much more sensitive in their response one to the
other. Some of Tesla’s high-frequency experiments also have an
obvious bearing on this point.

Ill. ELECTRIC WAVE METHODS.

After Clerk-Maxwell had predicted the existence of electro-magnetic
waves, and had shown that their speed of propagation is identical with
that of light, it required in reality very little to demonstrate by experi-
ment the existence of such waves. But that very little was not actually
achieved until the year 1888, when the lamented Prof. Heinrich Hertz
showed simple methods of producing, detecting, and measuring these
waves. It had been known for many years from the predictions of
Kelvin and von Helmholtz, and confirmed by the experiments of Fed-
derssen, that in many cases an electric discharge is of an oscillatory
character. In the years 1887-88 Lodge, Fitzgerald, and others were
investigating the nature of these oscillations and the manner in which
they are guided by conducting wires, when Hertz conceived the idea of
investigating the disturbances which such oscillatory discharges set
up in the surrounding space. He showed that, given a simple appa-
ratus, which he called an ‘ oscillator,” consisting of two metal plates
or conductors, connected by a conductor interrupted at one interme-
diate point by a “spark-gap,” the oscillator on the appearance of each
spark emitted a train of electric waves into the surrounding space.
He further showed that if a mere circuit or ring of wire of suitable
size, the continuity of which is interrupted at one point by a minute
gap, is placed in the path of these traveling waves in a suitable posi-
tion, the waves as they reach it set up electric surgings in this wire;
and, if sufficiently energetic, cause it to show a small spark in the gap.
This simple detecting device he termed a “resonator.” Armed with

sm 98——16
242 TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE,

these apparently primitive pieces of apparatus, he then devoted himself
to the task of exploring the propagation of the waves. He found that,
like waves of light, they could be deflected by metallic surfaces, could
be refracted by prisms, concentrated by lenses, and even could be
polarized. He measured their wave length and velocity of propaga-
tion. He found that they could pass readily through walls of wood,
stone, or brick, which are opaque to ordinary light waves. Metals
and other conductors of electricity, on the contrary, absorbed them,
and were consequently opaque.

In these researches of Hertz we meet, for the first time, ! with the rec-
ognition of a true traveling wave. With this immense discovery, there
was opened out an entirely new field of possibilities. Hitherto, there
had been inductive actions known which might reach out from wire to
wire only to fall back again when their excitant cause dies away. But
now the electric wave, once started on its path, did not collapse back
into the wires when the spark ceased. On the contrary, it went trav-
eling on. And just as the javelin, which can travel on after the
impulse has ceased, can act at greater range than the sword, whose
thrust is limited by the length of arm and blade, so the true electric
wave, by the very fact that it is a true traveling wave, can carry sig-
nals to greater distances than the mere inductive influence that simply
extends outwards from a wire or from a coil. Sse

The work which Hertz had begun, was, after his death, carried on
by a whole army of investigators. Of these, and of their achievements,
the best account that has yet appeared is Professor Lodge’s little book
on The Work of Hertz and his Successors. To that book imquiries
must be recommended for details. Suffice it here to say that much has
been done in perfecting both the oscillator and the detector. Notable
among these matters have been the forms of oscillator designed by
Lodge and by Righi; the latter having the spark gap immersed in oil
or vaseline between two metal balls. Many forms of detector have
been proposed. Very early Lodge produced one under the name of
“coherer,” consisting of a metallic point very lightly pressed against a
metal plate, and connected in circuit with a galvanometer and a local
cell. The light contact constitutes an imperfect joint, which is prac-
tically nonconductive until caused to cohere and conduct by the
impact of an electric wave; or, perhaps more accurately, by the stimu-
lus of the minute surging electric current which results from the impact
of an electric wave. Subsequently, taking a hint from M. Branly,
Lodge substituted as a detector a new kind of coherer, consisting of a

1 Many years before, Prof. Joseph Henry had transmitted induced electric sparks
from one circuit to another in different floors of a building. Doubtless these were
oscillatory; but it is impossible, at this time, to determine whether the arrange-
ments were such as to produce true traveling waves, or whether the action was (like
Lodge’s later experiment of the two syntonic circuits) merely one of electro-magnetic
induction.
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. 243

_ small glass tube partly filled with loose metallic filings—iron or nickel
by preference—joined in the circuit. Such a coherer acts as a species
of relay, by means of which an electric wave, incapable in itself of
affecting a galvanometer or other instrument, is enabled to do so indi-
rectly by setting into operation a local current. After the coherer has
thus operated, it usually remains in the conductive state until subjected
to some mechanical jar or shock. Lodge proposed to apply for this
purpose a mechanical taper worked either by clockwork or by a tremb-
ling electric mechanism. On several occasions, and notably at Oxford,
in 1894, he showed how such coherers could be used in transmitting
telegraphic signals to a distance. He showed that they would work
through solid walls. Lodge’s greatest distance at that time had not
exceeded some 100 or 150 yards. Communication was thus made
between the University Museum and the adjacent building of the Clar-
endon Laboratory. For more than eighteen months the Rey. F.
Jervis Smith, of Oxford, using a carbon-powder coherer, has maintained
communication between his house and the Millard Engineering Labora-
tory, over a mile away. :

Even before this Mr. Nikola Tesla, in a lecture delivered at St. Louis
in 1893, had made a further suggestion of great importance. He
proposed to transmit electric energy by oscillations to any distance,
without communicating wires, by erecting at each end of the stretch a
vertical conductor joined at its lower part to the earth, and at its upper
to a conducting body of a large surface. This constitutes a vertical
base line from which to disseminate the oscillating disturbances.

About two years ago a young Italian, Mr. Marconi, came to this
country and succeeded in inducing the British telegraph department
to give him facilities for experimenting upon wave-method of trans-
mission. First upon Salisbury Plain, and then across the Bristol
Channel, he succeeded in transmitting Morse signals to a greater
distance than anyone had previously attained. He sent signals from
Lavernock Point to Bream Down—about 9 miles, as the crow flies, over
the open channel. To accomplish this he used as base lines two ver-
tical conductors earthed at their lower ends and carrying at the top
extended surfaces. He used a Righi transmitter. As receiver he
employed the special form of Lodge—Branly coherer, presently to be
described. This was connected in the manner Lodge had recommended
in a local circuit, and was tapped by a mechanical tapper operated by
a vibrating electric mechanism. The local circuit operated a post-office
relay connected to a Morse instrument signaling the dots and dashes.
The coherer was itself included in the vertical base line. So far all is
old. The special coherer used in these experiments by Marconi has
very fine metallic powder, chiefly of nickel and silver, in a small glass
tube exhausted of air. He also applied shunting resistances to the
relay contacts, and interposed a fine iron wire, closely coiled, as an
impedance in the local circuit on each side of the coherer.
244 TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE.

In 1897, some further experiments were carried on by Professor
Slaby, of Charlottenburg, on an even larger scale. He abandoned
everv one of the novelties introduced by Marconi, and fell back upon
the methods previously known. He used a simple Lodge—Branly
coherer, employed elevated conductors as base lines, discarded the
useless little iron wire impedance coils in the local circuit, and substi-
tuted for the post-office polarized relay one made out of a Weston
galvanometer. His success shows that all that is essential can be thus
attained. He chose as the scene of his operations the Havel, and set
up elevated conductors upon the castle of the Pfaueninsel and on the
campanile of the churvh at Sacrow. Thus equipped, he transmitted
signals, at first about three-quarters of a mile, then 3 miles across the
water. He found trees and masts to interfere with the signals in some
degree. He then proceeded, with the aid of the military authorities,
to experiment over an open stretch of country—from Rangsdorf to
Schénenberg. The elevated conductors were wires raised by means of
hydrogen balloons to heights of nearly 1,000 feet. Signals were
obtained at a distance of 21 kilometers, or over 15 miles. Neither in
Marcon’’s nor in Slaby’s successful operations were syntonic devices
employed.

The following table summarizes the results of Marconi’s and Slaby’s
work:

Commenting on these results, Slaby notes how over an open sea a
much greater distance appears to be attained from a base line of given
length. Assuming Marconi’s best proportion, he calculates the vertical
length of a base line needed for communicating across the English
Channel at Dover to be 265 feet, while from London to Paris, over land
and sea, would require 4,700 feet. He even estimates base’ lines of
6,600 feet as sufficient, were it not for the curvature of the globe, to
serve for communication across the.A tlantic.

The most recent improvements made toward perfecting this method
of transmission are those of Dr. Oliver Lodge, whose labors, continued
during the past few months, are still in progress. He has first
reorganized the transmitter apparatus so as to make it a more
persistent radiator. It emits longer trains of waves. This has been
accomplished by introducing in the path of the oscillations, between
the spark-gap and the wings, a few turns of stout wire to act as an
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. 245

impedance coil. By this means the oscillations can be accurately
tuned. The receiving apparatus is also tuned; in fact, each apparatus
is made to operate both as emitter and as receiver in turn, as required.
Lodge has also modified the arrangements of the coherer circuits, to
render them more certain of operation, no local current being allowed
to pass through the coherer until after it had been affected by the
waves. He has, in fact, thoroughly redesigned the sending and
receiving instruments upon a rational basis, so that they shall be both
less sensitive to stray impulses and more sensitive to properly attuned
waves. The results obtained with these have not yet been made public;
but employing a siphon recorder as the receiving instrument,remarkable
precision of signaling has been attained. Further developments in this
direction will doubtless be awaited with much interest. Meantime, in
other countries, the United States, Russia, and France, other experi-
menters are at work. Any account given at the present time will
therefore be necessarily incomplete.

In passing finally from a review of that which has already been
attained to that which may reasonably be contemplated as within
reach of attainment in the near future, I have no wish to assume the
role of the prophet. Still less would I desire to emulate the example
of the imaginative litterateur who, whether his name be Jules Verne
or H.G. Wells, stimulates the public curiosity by amazing speculations,
and in doing so renders the disservice that the public so stimulated is
made less capable than before of distinguishing between that which is
and that which is not within the bounds of reasonable possibility.

It has been shown that there are three general methods of trans-
mitting electric signals across space. All of them require base lines
or base areas. The first, conduction, requires moist earth or water as
a medium, and is for distances of less than 3 miles the most effective
of the three. The second, induction, is not dependent upon earth or
water, but will equally well cross air or dry rock. The third, electric-
wave propagation, requires no medium beyond that of the ether of
Space, and is, indeed, interfered with by interposing things, such as
masts and trees. Given proper base lines or base areas, given adequate
methods of throwing electric energy into the transmitting system and
sufficiently sensitive instruments to pick up and translate the signals,
it is possible, in my opinion, to so develop each of the three methods
that by any one of them it will be possible to establish electric
communication between England and America across the intervening
space. It is certainly possible either by conduction or by induction;
whether by waves I am somewhat less certain. Conduction might
very seriously interfere with other electric agencies, since the waste
currents in the neighborhood of the primary base line would be very
great. It is certainly possible either by conduction or mduction to
establish direct communication across space with either the Cape or
India or Australia (under the same assumptions as before) and at a far
246 TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE.

less cost than that of a connecting submarine cable. I doubt very
greatly whether the wave method can be made applicable at all to
these so distant parts of the globe. But whether by conduction, by
induction, or by waves, I am firmly convinced that the immediate road
to commercial suceess lies in two things. Firstly, we must frankly
recognize that there is no such thing as telegraphing without wires;
that the base line or the base area surrounded by wires is a
fundamental necessity. Secondly, we must look to establishing real
syntony between the sending and the receiving parts of the apparatus
to render it, as far as possible, sensitive and independent, without
which conditions such systems will become too costly and too unman- -
ageable for commercial ends.

(The paper was illustrated by numerous slides illustrating the
methods and instruments used by Hertz, Lodge, Righi, Marconi, and
Slaby in their investigations, and the newest syntonic apparatus of
Lodge. Experiments were also shown illustrating the transmission of
electric waves and their reception and detection. A small Lodge
apparatus, constructed by Mr. Miller, was also exhibited in operation.)

The chairman said no doubt all present had come with great expecta-
tions, anticipating much pleasure in hearing of the latest developments
of one of the most interesting and valuable applications of modern —
science to useful purposes—electric telegraphy. But whatever their
expectations, they must have been more than realized by the exceed-
ingly lucid exposition by Professor Thompson of a most intricate and
difficult subject; so lucid in fact had it been that probably few realized
how intricate it was. He felt with Professor Thompson that perhaps
in the immediate future the application of wireless telegraphy to prac-
tical purposes was not quite so wide as some might have anticipated
and hoped; but at the same time there were purposes to which they
might reasonably hope it might be applied, such, for example, as com-
munication between the shore and lightships, and possibly between ship
and ship. It was satisfactory to learn that means were being sought for,
and had been to some extent found, of differentiating one telegraphic
signal sent through space by another tuning. That was to him a practi-
cally interesting point, and the explanations which had been given of the
methods adopted by Prof. Oliver Lodge for obtaining the transmission
of a particular message, and the receipt of that message by a particular
person intended to receive it, were especially valuable. Obviously it
would be very inconvenientif messages sent through space were indiffer-
ently receivable by everyone who chose to play the part of an eaves
dropper. That condition of things would somewhat resemble that
described in one of Hans Christian Andersen’s stories, where the fumes
coming from a pipkin revealed to everyone who chose to smell them
what each particular person was having for dinner. It was not very
desirable that that kind of curiosity should be gratified in connection ~
TELEGRAPHY ACROSS SPACE. QAT

with telegraphy, and it seemed to him that the uses of telegraphy
through space would be very much limited if this sort of thing could
not be prevented. Professor Lodge’s line of experiment, however,
seemed to tend in that direction, and to show the means of confining a
message to the person intended to receive it. He was sure Professor
Thompson would be pleased to answer any questions on any point that
had not been made clear, if there were any such, any questions which
could arise having been already answered in anticipation. If no one
had any such query to put, he would conclude by proposing a hearty
vote of thanks to Professor Thompson for his paper.

The vote of thanks was carried unanimously, and the meeting
adjourned.

SIGNALING THROUGH SPACE WITHOUT WIRES.!
By W. H. Preece, Bsq., 0. B., F. R. S., M. Inst. ©. E.

Science has conferred one great benefit on mankind. It has supplied
us with a new sense. Wecan now see the invisible, hear the inaudible,
and feel the intangible. We know that the universe is filled with a
homogeneous continuous elastic medium which transmits heat, light,
electricity and other forms of energy from one point of space to another
without loss. The discovery of the real existence of this “ether” is
one of the great scientific events of the Victorian era. Its character
and mechanism are not yet known by us. All attempts to “invent” a
perfect ether have proved beyond the mental powers of the highest
intellects.’ We can only say with Lord Salisbury that the ether is the
nominative case of the verb ‘‘to undulate.” We must be content with
a knowledge of the fact that it was created in the beginning for the
transmission of energy in all its forms, that it transmits these energies
in definite waves and with a known velocity, that it is perfect of its
kind, but that it still remains as inscrutable as gravity or light itself.

Any disturbance of the ether must originate with some disturbance
of matter. An explosion, cyclone, or vibratory motion may occur in the
photosphere of the sun. A disturbance or wave is impressed on the
ether. It is propagated in straight lines through space. It falls on
Jupiter, Venus, the Earth, and every other planet met with in its
course, and any machine, human or mechanical, capable of responding
to its undulations indicates its presence. Thus the eye supplies the
sensation of light, the skin is sensitive to heat, the galvanometer indi-
cates electricity, the magnetometer indicates disturbances in the earth’s
magnetic field. One of the greatest scientific achievements of our
generation is the magnificent generalization of Clerk-Maxwell that all
these disturbances are of precisely the same kind, and that they differ
only in degree. Light is an electromagnetic phenomenon, and elec-
tricity in its progress through space follows the laws of optics. Hertz
proved this experimentally, and few of us who heard it will forget the

250 SIGNALING THROUGH SPACE WITHOUT WIRES.

admirable lecture on “The work of Hertz” eae in this hall by Prof.
Oliver Lodge three years ago.!

By the kindness of Prof. Silvanus Thompson I am able to illustrate
wave transmission by a very beautiful apparatus devised by him. At
one end we have the transmitter or oscillator, which is a heavy sus-
pended mass to which a blow or impulse is given, and which, in conse-
quence, vibrates a given number of times per minute. At the other
end is the receiver or resonator, timed to vibrate to the same period.
Connecting the two together is a row of leaden balls suspended so that
each ball gives a portion of its energy at each oscillation to the next in
the series. Each ball vibrates at right angles to or athwart the line of
propogation of the wave, and as they vibrate in different phases you
will see that a wave is transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver.

The receiver takes up these vibrations and responds in sympathy with ~

the transmitter. Here we have a visible illustration of that which is
absolutely invisible. The wave you see differs from a wave of light or
of electricity only in its length or in its frequency. Electric waves
vary from units per second in long submarine cables to millions per
second when excited by Hertz’s method. Light waves vary per second
between 400 billions in the red to 800 billions in the violet, and electric
waves differ from them in no other respect. They are reflected,
refracted and polarized, they are subject to interference, and they move
through the ether in straight lines with the same velocity, viz, 186,400
miles per second—a number easily recalled when we remember that it
was in the year 1864 that Maxwell made his famous discovery of the
identity of light and electric waves.

Electric waves, however, differ from light waves in this, that we have
also to regard the direction at right angles to the line of propagation
of the wave. The model gives an illustration of that which happens
along a line of electric force; the other line of motion I speak of is a
circle around the point of disturbance, and these lines are called lines
of magnetic force.' The animal eye is tuned toone series of wave; the
‘electric eye,” as Lord Kelvin called Hertz’s resonator, to another. If
electric waves could be reduced in length to the forty-thousandth of an
inch we should see them as colors.

One more definition, and our ground is cleared. When electricity is
found stored up in a potential state in the molecules of a dielectric like
air, glass, or gutta-percha the molecules are strained, it is called a
charge, and it establishes in its neighborhood an electric field. When
it is active, or in its kinetic state in a circuit, it is called a current. It
is found in both states—kinetic and potential—when a current is main-
tained in a conductor. The surrounding neighborhood is then found
in a State of stress, forming what is called a magnetic field.

In the first case the charges can be made to rise and fall, and to
surge to and fro with rhythmic regularity, exciting electric waves along
each line of electric force at very high frequencies, and in the second
case the currents can rise or alternate in direction with the same regu-
larity, but with very different frequencies, and originate electromag-
netic waves whose wave fronts are propagated in the same direction.

The first is the method of Hertz, which has recently been turned to
practical account by Mr. Marconi, and the second is the method which
I have been applying, and which, for historical reasons, I will describe
to you first.

In 1884 messages sent through insulated wires buried in iron pipes
in the streets of London were read upon telephone circuits erected on
poles above the house tops, 80 feet away. Ordinary telegraph circuits
were found in 1885 to produce disturbances 2,000 feet away. Distinct
speech by telephone was carried on through one-quarter of a mile, a

distance that was increased to 14 miles at a later date. Careful experi-
ments were made in 1886 and 1887-to prove that these effects were due
to pure electromagnetic waves, and were entirely free from any- earth-
conduction. In 1892 distinct messages were sent across a portion of
the Bristol Channel, between Penarth and Flat Holm, a distance of 3.3
miles.

Early in 1895 the cable between Oban and the Isle of Mull broke
down, and as no ship was available for repairing and restoring com-
munication, communication was established by utilizing parallel wires
on each side of the channel and transmitting signals across the space
by these electromagnetic waves.

The apparatus (fig. 1) connected to each wire consists of—

(a) A rheotome or make and break wheel, causing about 260 undula-
tions per second in the primary wire. .
252 SIGNALING THROUGH SPACE WITHOUT WIRES.

(b) An ordinary battery of about 100 Leclanché cells, of the so-called
dry and portable form.

(c) A Morse telegraph key.

(da) A telephone to act as receiver.

(e) A switch to start and stop the rheotome.

Good signals depend more on the rapid rise and fall of the primary
current than on the amount of energy thrown into vibration.
Leclanché cells give as good signals at 3.3 miles distant as 24 horse-
power transformed into alternating currents by an alternator, owing to
the smooth sinusoidal curves of the latter. Two hundred and sixty
vibrations per second give a pleasant note to the ear, easily read when
broken up by the key into dots and dashes.

In my electromagnetic system two parallel circuits are established,
one on each side of a channel or bank of a river, each circuit becoming
successively the primary and secondary of an induction system, accord-
ing to the direction in which the signals are being sent. Strong alter-
nating or vibrating currents of electricity are transmitted in the first
circuit so as to form signals, letters, and words in Morse character.
The effects of the rise and fall of these currents are transmitted as
electromagnetic waves through the intervening space, and if the sec-
ondary circuit is so situated as to be washed by these ethereal waves,
their energy is transformed into secondary currents in the second cir-
cuit, which can be made to affect.a telephone and thus to reproduce the
signals. Of course their intensity is much reduced, but still their pres-
ence has been detected, though five miles of clear space have separated
the two circuits.

Such effects have been known scientifically in the laboratory since
the days of Faraday and of Henry, but it is only within the last few
years that I have been able to utilize them practically through consid-
erable distances. This has been rendered possible through the intro-
duction of the telephone.

Last year (August, 1896) an effort was made to establish communi-
cation with the North Sandhead (Goodwin) Lightship. The apparatus
used was designed and manufactured by Messrs. Evershed and
Vignoles, and a most ingenious relay to establish a call invented by Mr.
Evershed. One extremity of the cable was coiled in a ring on the
bottom of the sea, embracing the whole area over which the lightship
swept while swinging to the tide, and the other end was connected
with the shore. The ship was surrounded above the water line with
another coil. The two coils were separated by a mean distance of about
200 fathoms, but communication was found to be impracticable. The
screening effect of the sea water and the effect of the iron hull of the
ship absorbed practically all the energy of the currents in the coiled
cable, and the effects on board, though perceptible, were very trifing—
too minute for signaling. Previous experiments had failed to show
the extremely rapid rate at which energy is absorbed with the depth
SIGNALING THROUGH SPACE WITHOUT WIRES. 253

or thickness of sea water. The energy is absorbed in forming eddy
currents. There is no difficulty whatever in signaling through 15
fathoms. Speech by telephone has been maintained through 6
fathoms. Although this experiment has failed through water, it is
thoroughly practical through air to considerable distances where it is
possible to erect wires of similar length to the distance to be crossed on
each side of the channel. It is not always possible, however, to do
this, nor to get the requisite height to secure the best effect. It is
impossible on a lightship and on rock light-houses. There are many
small islands—Sark, for example—where it can not be done.

In July last Mr. Marconi brought to England a new plan. My plan
is based entirely on utilizing electromagnetic waves of very low fre-

quency. It depends essentially on the

rise and fall of cwrrents in the primary
wire. Mr. Marconi utilizes electric or
Hertzian waves of very high frequency,
and they depend upon the rise and fall
of electric force in a sphere or spheres.
He has invented a new relay which, for
sensitiveness and delicacy, exceeds all
known electric apparatus.

The peculiarity of Mr. Marconi’s
system is that, apart from the ordinary
connecting wires of the apparatus, con-
ductors of very moderate length only
are needed, and even these can be dis-
pensed with if reflectors are used.

The transmitter.—His transmitter is
Professor Righi’s form of Hertz’s radi.
ator (fig. 2).

Two spheres of solid brass, 4 inches
in diameter (A and B), are fixed in an
oil-tight case D of insulating material,
so that a hemisphere of each is exposed, JAE LULA ulate LA etc
the other hemisphere being immersed Sasa os
in a bath of vaseline oil. The use of oil has several advantages. It
maintains the surfaces of the spheres electrically clean, avoiding the
frequent polishing required by Hertz’s exposed balls. It impresses on
the waves excited by these spheres a uniform and constant form. It
tends to reduce the wave lengths—Righi’s waves are measured in cen-
timeters, while Hertz’s were measured in meters. For these reasons the
distance at which effects are produced is increased. Mr. Marconi uses
generally waves of about 120 centimeters long. Two small spheres, a
and b, are fixed close to the large spheres, and connected each to one

end of the secondary circuit of the “induction coil” C, the primary cir-
cuit of which is excited by a battery E, thrown in and out of circuit by

254 SIGNALING THROUGH SPACE WITHOUT WIRES.

the Morse key K. Now, whenever the key K is depressed sparks pass
between 1, 2, and 3, and since the system A B contains capacity and
electric inertia, oscillations are set up in it of extreme rapidity. The
line of propagation is D d, and the frequency of oscillation is probably
about 250 millions per second.

The distance at which effects are produced with such rapid oscilla-
tions depends chiefly on the energy in the discharge that passes. A
’ 6-inch spark coil has sufficed through 1, 2,3, up to 4 miles, but for
ereater distances we have used a more powerful coil—one emitting
sparks 20 inches long. It may also be pointed out that this distance
increases with the diameter of the spheres A and B, and it is nearly
doubled by making the spheres solid instead of hollow.

The receiver.—Marconi’s relay (fig. 2) consists of a small glass tube
4 centimeters long, into which two silver pole pieces are tightly fitted,
separated from each other by about half a millimeter—a thin space
which is filled up by a mixture of fine nickel and silver filings, mixed
with a trace of mercury. The tube is exhausted toa vacuum of 4 milli-
meters, and sealed. It forms part of a cireuit containing a local cell
and a sensitive telegraph relay. In its normal condition the metallic
powder is virtually an insulator. The particles lie higgledy-piggledy,
anyhow, in disorder. They lightly touch each other in an irregular
method, but when electric waves fall upon them they are ‘ polarised,”
order is installed. They are marshaled in serried ranks, they are sub-
ject to pressure—in fact, as Prof. Oliver Lodge expresses it, they
“ cohere”—electrical contact ensues and a current passes. The resist-
ance of such a space falls from infinity to about 5 ohms. The electric
resistance of Marconi’s relay—that is, the resistance of the thin disc of
loose powder—is practically infinite when it is in its normal or dis-
ordered condition. It is then, in fact, an insulator. This resistance
drops sometimes to 5 ohms, when the absorption of the electric waves
by it is intense. It therefore becomes a conductor. It may be, as
suggested by Professor Lodge, that we have in the measurement of the
variable resistance of this instrument a means of determining the inten-
sity of the energy falling upon it. This variation is being investigated
both as regards the magnitude of the energy and the frequency of the
incident waves. Now such electrical effects are well known. In 1866
Mr. 8. A. Varley introduced a lightning protector constructed like the
above tube, but made of boxwood and containing powdered carbon. It
was fixed as a shunt to the instrument to be protected. It acted well,
but it was stbject to this coherence, which rendered the cure more
troublesome than the disease, and its use had to be abandoned. The
same action is very common in granulated carbon microphones like
Hunning’s, and shaking has to be resorted to to decohere the carbon
particles to their normal state. M. E. Branly (1890) showed the effect
with copper, aluminum, and iron filings. Prof. Oliver Lodge, who
has done more than anyone else in England to illustrate and pop-

+

ularize the work of Hertz and his followers, has given the name.
““coherer” to this form of apparatus. Marconi ‘‘decoheres” by making
the local current very rapidly vibrate a small hammer head against
the glass tube, which it does effectually, and in doing so makes such a
sound that reading Morse characters is easy. The same current that
decoheres can also record Morse signals on paper by ink. The exhausted
tube has two wings, which, by their size, tune the receiver to the trans-
mitter by varying the capacity of the apparatus.' Choking coils pre-
vent the energy escaping. The analogy to Prof. Silvanus Thompson’s
wave apparatus is evident. Oscillations set up in the transmitter fall

upon the receiver tuned in sympathy with it, coherence follows, cur-
rents are excited, and signals made.

In open clear spaces within sight of each other nothing more is
wanted, but when obstacles intervene and great distances are in ques-
tion, height is needed—tall masts, kites, and balloons have been used.
Excellent signals have been transmitted between Penarth and Brean
Down, near Weston-super-Mare, across the Bristol Channel, a distance
of nearly 9 miles (fig. 3). (The system was here shown in operation.)

Mirrors also assist and intensify the effects. They were used in the
earlier experiments, but they have been laid aside for the present, for
they are not only expensive to make, but they occupy much time in
manufacture. r

' The period of vibration of a circuit is given by the equation T=27 7/KL, so that
we have simply to vary either the capacity K or the so-called ‘“ self induction” L to
tune the receiver to any frequency. It issimpler to vary K.

It is curious that hills and apparent obstructions fail to obstruct.
The reason is probably the fact that the lines of force escape these
hills. When the ether is entangled in matter of different degrees of
inductivity, the lines are curved, as in fact they are in light. Figure 4
shows how a hill is virtually bridged over by these lines, and conse-

There are some apparent
anomalies that have devel-
oped themselves during the
experiments. Mr. Marconi
finds that his relay acts
even when it is placed in a
perfectly closed metallic
box. This is the fact that
has given rise to the rumor
that he can blow up an iron-
clad ship. This might be
true if he could plant his
properly tuned receiver in
the magazine of an enemy’s
ship. Many other funny HERE
things could be done if this S72
were possible. I remember
in my childhood that Cap-
tain Warner blew up a ship
at a great distance off Brighton. How this was done was never known,
for his secret died Bhoruy, afterwards with him. It certainly was not
by means of Marconi’s relay.
The distance to which signals have been sent is remarkable. On
Salisbury Plain Mr. Marconi covered a distance of 4 miles. In the
Bristol Channel this has been extended to over 8 miles, and we have

by no means reached the limit. It is inteyesting to read the surmises
of others. Half a mile was the wildest dream. '

It is easy to transmit many messages in any direction at the same time.
It is only necessary to tune the transmitters and receivers to the same
frequency or “note.” I could show this here, but we are bothered by
reflection from the walls. This does not happen in open space. Tuning
is very easy. It is simply necessary to vary the capacity of the
receiver, and this is done by increasing the length of the wings W in
figure 2. The proper length is found experimentally close to the trans-
mitter: It is practically impossible to do so far away.

It has been said that Mr. Marconi has done nothing new. He has
not discovered any new rays; his transmitter is comparatively old;
his receiver is based on Branly’s coherer. Columbus did not invent
the egg, but he showed how to make it stand on its end, and Marconi
has produced from known means a new electric eye, more delicate than
any known electrical instrument, and a new system of telegraphy that
will reach places hitherto inaccessible. There are a great many prac-
_ tical points connected with this system that require to be threshed out
in a practical manner before it can be placed on the market, but
enough has been done to prove its value, and to show that for shipping
and light-house purposes it will be a great and valuable acquisition.

NOTE ON THE LIQUEFACTION OF HYDROGEN AND
HELIUM!

By Prof. JAMES DEWAR.

In a paper entitled ‘‘ The liquefaction of air and research at low tem-
peratures,” read before the Chemical Society, and published in the
Proceedings, No. 158, an account is given of the history of the liquid-
hydrogen problem and the result of my own experiments up to the end
of the year 1895. The facts are substantially as follows:

Wroblewski made the first conclusive experiments on the liquefac-
tion of hydrogen in January, 1884. He found that the gas cooled in a
capillary glass tube to the boiling point of oxygen, and expanded
quickly from 100 to 1 atmospheres, showed the same appearance of
sudden ebulition, lasting for a fraction of a second, as Cailletet had
seen in his early oxygen experiments. No sooner had the announce-
ment been made, than Olszewski confirmed the result by expanding
hydrogen from 190 atmospheres, previously cooled to the temperature
given by liquid oxygen and nitrogen evaporating under diminished
pressure. Olszewski, however, declared in 1884 that he saw colorless
drops, and by partial expansion to 40 atmospheres the liquid hydrogen
was seen by him running down the tube. Wroblewski could not confirm
Olszewski’s results, his hydrogen being always obtained in the form of
what he called a “liquide dynamique,” or the appearance of an instan-
taneous froth. The following extract from Wroblewski’s paper (Compt.
rend., 1885, 100, 981) states very clearly the results of his work on
hydrogen:

“T’hydrogéne soumis 4 la pression de 180 atmosphéres jusqu’a 190
atmospheres refroidi par V’azote bouillant dans la vide (a la tempéra-
ture de sa solidification) et détendu brusquement sous la pression
atmosphérique présente une mousse bien visible. De la couleur grise
de cette mousse, ow l’ceil ne peut distinguer des gouttelettes incolores,
on ne peut pas encore deviner quelle apparence aurait Vhydrogéne a
Pétat de liquide statique et ’on est encore moins autorisé a préciser
s'il 4 ou non une apparence métallique.

“J’ai pu placer dans cette mousse ma pile thermo-électrique et
yobtenu suivant les pressions employées des températures de —208°

jusqu’a —211°C. Je ne peux pas encore dire dans quelle relation se
trouvent ces nombres avec la température réele de la mousse et la
température d’ébullition de Vhydrogene sous la pression atmosphéri-
que, puisque je n’ai pas encore la certitude que la faible durée de ce
phénoméne ait permis a le pile de se refroidir complétement. Néan-
moins je crois aujourd’hui de mon devoir de publier ces résultats, afin
de préciser l’état actuel de la question de la liquéfaction de Vhydro-
gene.”

It is well to note that the lowest thermo-electric temperature recorded
by Wroblewski during the adiabatic expansion of the hydrogen, namely,
—211°, is really equivalent to a much lower temperature on the gas
thermometer scale. The most probable value is —230°, and this must
be regarded as the highest temperature of the liquid state, or the
critical point of hydrogen according to his observations. The above
methods having failed to produce “static” hydrogen, Wroblewski
suggested that the result might be attained by the use of hydrogen
gas aS a cooling agent. From this time until his death in the year 1888
Wroblewski devoted his time to a laborious research on the isother-

mals of hydrogen at low temperatures. The data thus arrived at ©

enabled him, by the use of Van der Waal’s formule, to calculate the
critical constants and boiling point of liquid hydrogen.

Olszewski returned to the subject in 1891, repeating and correcting
his old experiments of 1884, which Wroblewski had failed to confirm,
in a glass tube 7 millimeters in diameter instead of one of 2 millimeters,
as in the early trials. He says, “On repeating my former experiments
I had no hope of obtaining a lower temperature by means of any cool-
ing agent, but I hoped that the expansion of hydrogen would be more
efficacious, on account of the larger scale on which the experiment was
made.” The result of these experiments Olszewski describes as
follows: ‘‘The phenomenon of hydrogen ebullition, which was then
observed, was much more marked and much longer than during my
former investigations in the same direction. But even then I could not
perceive any meniscus of liquid hydrogen.” Further, ‘ The reason for
which it has not been hitherto possible to liquify hydrogen in a static
state is that there exists no gas having a density between those of hy-
drogen and of nitrogen, and which might be, for instance, 7-10 (H 1).
Such a gas could be liquefied by means of liquid oxygen or air as cool-
ing agent and be afterwards used as a frigorific menstruum in the
liquefaction of hydrogen.”

Professor Olszewski in 1895 determined the temperature reached in
the momentary adiabatic expansion of hydrogen at low temperatures
just as Wroblewski had done in 1885, only he employed a platinum
resistance thermometer instead of a thermo-junction.

For this purpose he used a small steel bottle of 20 or 30 cubic centi-
meters capacity, containing a platinum resistance thermometer. In
this way temperatures were registered which were regarded as those
of the critical and boiling points of liquid hydrogen, a substance which
LIQUEFACTION OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM. 261

could not be seen under the circumstances, and was only assumed at
the most to exist for a second or two during the expansion of the gaseous
hydrogen in the small steel bottle.

The results arrived at by Wroblewski and Olszewski are given in the
following table:

| Wroblewski, 1885. Olszewski, 1895. |

i Critical temperature. -. —2409° —234°
Boiling point .....--.-. —250° | —2430
Critical pressure. .--...- 13 at. | 20 at. |

The moment the critical point is approximately defined the boiling
point is roughly known, and the critical pressure can be inferred from
analogy with the behavior of other substances.

Ina paper published in the Philosophical Magazine, September, 1884,
“On the liquefaction of oxygen and the critical volumes of fluids,” the
suggestion was made that the critical pressure of hydrogen was wrong,
- and that instead of being 99 atmospheres (as deduced by Sarrau from
Amagat’s isothermals), the gas had probably an abnormally low value
for this constant. This view was substantially confirmed by Wroblewski
finding a critical pressure of 13.3 atmospheres, or about one-fourth of
that of oxygen. The Chemical News (Sept. 7, 1894) contains an account
of the stage the author’s hydrogen experiments had reached at that
date. The object was to collect liquid hydrogen at its boiling point,
in an open vacuum vessel, which is a much more difficult problem than
seeing the liquid in a glass tube under pressure and at a higher tem-
perature. In order to raise the critical point of hydrogen to about
—200°, from 2 to 5 per cent of nitrogen or air was mixed with it. This
is simply making an artificial gas containing a large proportion of hy-
drogen which is capable of liquefaction by the use of liquidair. The
results are summed up in the following extract from the paper: “ One
thing can, however, be proved by the use of the gaseous mixture of
hydrogen and nitrogen, namely, that by subjecting it to a high com-
pression at a temperature of —200° and expanding the resulting liquid
into air, a much lower temperature than anything that has been recorded
up to the present timecan be reached. This is proved by the fact that
such a mixed gas gives, under the conditions, a paste or jelly of solid
nitrogen, evidently giving off hydrogen, because the gas coming off
burns fiercely, Even when hydrogen containing only some 2 to 5 per
cent of air is similarly treated, the result is a white solid matter (solid
air) along with a clear liquid of low density, which is so exceedingly
volatile that no known device for collecting has been successful.”

The report of a Friday evening lecture on New Researches on Liquid
Air! contains a drawing of the apparatus employed for the production

of a jet of hydrogen containing visible liquid. This is reproduced in the
figure. A represents one of the hydrogen cylinders; B and C, vacuum
vessels containing carbonic acid under exhaustion and liquid air,
respectively; D is the coil, G the pin-hole nozzle, and F the valve. By
means of this jet, liquid air can be quickly transformed into a hard
solid. It was shown that such a jet could be used to cool bodies below
the temperature that it is possible to reach by the use of liquid alr,
but all attempts to collect the liquid hydrogen from the jet in vacuum
vessels failed. No other investigator has, so far, improved on the

results the author described in the Proceedings of ‘the Chemical
Society (No. 158), 1895, or, indeed, touched the subject since that date.
The type of apparatus used in these experiments worked well, so it
was resolved to construct a much larger liquid-air plant, and to com-
bine with it circuits and arrangements for the liquefaction of hydrogen,
which will be described in a subsequent paper. This apparatus took a
year to build up, and many months have been occupied in testing and
making preliminary trials. The many failures and defeats need not be
detailed.

and under a pressure of 180 atmospheres, escaping continuously from

the nozzle of a coil of pipe at the rate of about 10 or 15 cubie feet. per
minute, in a vacuum vessel doubly silvered and of special construc-
tion, all surrounded with a space kept below —200°, liquid hydrogen
commenced to drop from this vacuum vessel into another doubly
isolated by being surrounded by a third vacuum vessel. In about five
minutes 20 cubic centimeters of liquid hydrogen were collected, when
the hydrogen jet froze up, from the accumulation of air in the pipes
frozen out from the impure hydrogen. The yield of liquid was about 1
per cent of the gas. The hydrogen in the liquid condition is clear and
colorless, showing no absorption spectrum, and the meniscus is as well
defined as in the case of liquid air. The liquid must have a relatively
high refractive index and dispersion, and the density appears also to
be in excess of the theoretical density, namely, 0.18 to 0.12, which we
deduce respectively from the atomic volume of organic compounds, and
the limiting density found by Amagat for hydrogen gas under infinite
compression. Yet this may be a delusion due to its high dispersion.
A preliminary attempt to weigh a small glass bulb in the liquid made
the density about 0.08. My old experiments on the density of hydrogen
in palladium gave a value for the combined element of 0.62, and it will
be interesting to find the accurate density of the liquid substance at
its boiling point. Not having arrangements at hand to determine the
boiling point, other than a thermo-junction which gave entirely falla-
cious results, experiments were made to prove the excessively low
temperature of the boiling fluid. In the first place, if a long piece of
glass tubing, sealed at one end and open to the air at the other, is
cooled by immersing the closed end in the liquid hydrogen, the tube
immediately fills, where it is cooled, with solid air; a small tube con-
taining liquid oxygen became a bluish solid. A first trial of putting
the liquid hydrogen under exhaustion gave no appearance of transi-
tion into the solid state. The liquid hydrogen in its vacuum tube, which
is immersed in liquid air so that the external wallof the vacuum vessel
is maintained at about —190°, is found to evaporate at a rate not far
removed from that of liquid air from a similar vacuum vessel under the
ordinary conditions of storage. This leads me to the conclusion that
with proper isolation it will be possible to manipulate with liquid hydro-
gen as easily as with liquid air. The second experiment was made
with a tube containing helium.

The Cracow Academy Bulletin for 1896 contains a paper by Professor
Olszewski, entitled ‘‘A research on the liquefaction of helium,” in which
he states, “‘As far as my experiments go, helium remains a permanent gas
and apparently is much more difficult to liquefy than hydrogen.” Ina
paper of my own in the proceedings of the Chemical Society, No. 183
(1896-97), in which the separation of helium from Bath gas was effected
by a liquefaction method, the suggestion was made that the volatility
_ of hydrogen and helium would probably be found close together, just

like those of fluorine and oxygen. Having a specimen of purified
264 LIQUEFACTION OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM.

helium, which had been extracted from Bath gas, sealed up in a bulb
with a narrow tube attached, the latter was placed in liquid hydrogen,
when a distinct liquid was seen to condense. The same experiment
repeated, only using liquid air evaporating in a vacuum, gave no trace
of condensation. From this result it would appear that there can not
be any great difference between the boiling points of helium and
hydrogen.

All known gases have now been condensed into liquids which can be
manipulated at their boiling points under atmospheric pressure in
suitably arranged vacuum vessels. With hydrogen as a cooling agent
we shall get within 20 or 30 of the zero of absolute temperature, and
its use will open up an entirely new field of scientific inquiry. Even
as great a man as James Clerk Maxwell had doubts as to the possibility
of ever liquefying hydrogen. (See Scientific Papers 2, 412.) In conclud-
ing his lectures on the non metallic elements, delivered at the Royal
Institution in 1852 and published the following year, Faraday said:!

“There is reason to believe we should derive much information as to
the intimate nature of these nonmetallic elements if we could succeed
in obtaining hydrogen and nitrogen in the liquid or solid form. Many
gases have been liquefied; the carbonic acid gas has been solidified, but
hydrogen and nitrogen have resisted all our efforts of the kind. Hydro-
gen in many of its relations acts as though it were a metal; could it be
obtained in a liquid or solid condition the doubt might be settled. This
great problem, however, has yet to be solved; nor should we look with
hopelessness on this solution when we reflect with wonder—and as I
do almost with fear and trembling — on the powers of investigating the
hidden qualities of these elements—of questioning them, making them
disclose their secrets and tell their tales— given by the Almighty
to man.”

Faraday’s expressed faith in the potentialities of experimental inquiry
in 1852 has been justified forty-six years afterwards by the production
of liquid hydrogen in the very laboratory in which all his epoch-making
researches were executed. The ‘ doubt” has now been settled; hydro-
gen does not possess in the liquid state the characteristics of a metal.
No one can predict the properties of matter near the zero of tempera-
ture. Faraday liquefied chlorine in the year 1823. Sixty years after-
wards Wroblewski and Olszewski produced liquid air, and now, after
a fifteen years’ interval, the remaining gases, hydrogen and helium,
appear as static liquids. Considering the step from the liquefaction of
air to that of hydrogen is relatively as great in the thermodynamic
sense as that from liquid chlorine to liquid air, the fact that the former
result has been achieved in one-fourth the time needed to accomplish
the latter proves the greatly accelerated race of scientific progress in
our time.

The efficient cultivation of this field of research depends upon com-
bination and assistance of an exceptional kind, but in the first instance
money must be available, and the members of the Royal Institution

deserve my especial gratitude for their handsome donations to the
conduct of this research. Unfortunately, its prosecution will demand
a further large expenditure. It is my duty also to acknowledge that
at an early stage of the inquiry the honorable company of Goldsmiths
helped low temperatures investigation by a generous donation to the
research fund.

During the whole course of the low temperature work, carried out at
the Royal Iustitution, the invaluable aid of Mr. Robert Lennox has
been at my disposal, and it is not too much to say that but for his
engineering skill, manipulative ability, and loyal perseverance the
present successful issue might have been indefinitely delayed. My
thanks are also due to Mr. J. W. Heath for valuable assistance in the
conduct of these experiments.

ADDENDUM.

Since the above paper was written, both the boiling point and specific
gravity of hydrogen have been determined. The boiling point in the
meantime given by the use of a platinum resistance thermometer
involves, however, extrapolation of the curve correlating temperature
and resistance. The result is that the boiling point of hydrogen is minus
228° C. or 35° absolute. At this temperature, the tension of liquid air
(which, of course, becomes solid) is jess than 0.002 millimeter. The
resistance of the thermometer used was 5.338 ohm at the melting point
of ice, and this was reduced to 09.129 ohms when placed in boiling
hydrogen. The absolute zero in platinum degrees of this thermometer
was minus 263.27°, and the temperature measured on this scale 1s minus
256.29° or 6.38° from the point where the conductivity of the platinum
would become infinite. The resistance of the platinum in the liquid
hydrogen is reduced to nearly one-eleventh of what it is in liquid
oxygen. It will be necessary to find out the electric conductivity of the
fluid itself, and to repeat the observations with other thermometers
before we can arrive at more definite conclusions. The vapor of hydro-
gen at its boiling point is about eight times denser than the gas at
ordinary temperatures, or it has about half the density of air, while
the vapor coming off from liquid air at its boiling point is somewhat
less than four times the density of air at the ordinary temperature. By
evaporation in a vacuum, the temperature of liquid hydrogen will be
lowered from 10° to 15°, but it will be practically impossible (so far as
we can anticipate the results of experiment) to reach a lower tempera-
ture than minus 250° C. or 20° absolute by this means. At present we
can see no way of bridging over the last 20° or 25°, and therefore the
approach to the zero of absolute temperature and the study of matter
and energy under such conditions must be confined to temperatures
above 25° absolute.

The density of liquid hydrogen has been approximately determined
by evaporating some 10 cubic centimeters of the liquid, and collecting
266 LIQUEFACTION OF HYDROGEN AND HELIUM.

and measuring the gas produced, thereby ascertaining its weight. In
this way 8.15 liters at 14° C. and 753 millimeters were collected over
water from between 9 and 10 cubic centimeters of liquid hydrogen.
It appears, therefore, that the density of the liquid is about 0.07, using
whole numbers as the calculation works out to 0.068 nearly. Liquid
hydrogen is therefore a very deceptive fluid so far as appearance goes.
The fact of its collecting so easily, dropping so well. and having such a
well-defined meniscus induced me to believe that the density might be
about half that of liquid air. It was a great surprise to find the density
only one-fourteenth of water. Liquid marsh gas was the lightest known
liquid, the density at its boiling point being 0.417, but liquid hydro-
gen has only one-sixth the density of this substance. The density of
occluded hydrogen in palladium being 0.62, it is eight times denser
than the liquid.

Hydrogen in the liquid state is one hundred times denser than the
vapor it is giving off at its boiling point, whereas liquid oxygen is two
hundred and fifty-five times denser than itsvapor. It appears, therefore,
that the atomic volume of liquid hydrogen at its boiling point is 14.3,
as compared with 13.7 for oxygen under similar circumstances. In
other words, they are nearly identical. From this we can infer that the
critical pressure need not exceed 15 atmospheres. The extraordinary
properties theory requires hydrogen skould possess, especially as regards
specific and latent’ heat, becomé more intelligible from the moment we
know that the density is so small. In other words, when we compare
the properties of equal volumes of liquid hydrogen and air under similar
corresponding temperatures, they do not differ more than might be
anticipated.
THE RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES AND THEIR RELA-
TION TO THE PERIODIC LAW|!

By WILLIAM RAMSAY.

GENTLEMEN: It is well known to you all how the remarkable obser-
vation of Lord Rayleigh that nitrogen from the atmosphere possesses a
greater density than that prepared from ammonia or nitrates led to the
discovery of argon, a new constituent of the air. I need not say that
had it not been for this observation the investigations of which I shall
speak this evening would never have been carried out, at least not by
me. Youalso, doubtless, will remember that the search for some com-
pound of argon was rewarded, not by the attainment of the quest, but
by the discovery, in cléveite and other rare uranium minerals, of helium,
an element whose existence in the chromosphere of the sun had already
been suspected. And, further, I hardly need to recall to your minds
that the density of helium is in round numbers 2, and that of argon 20,
and that the ratio of specific heats of both these gases, unlike that of
most others, is 1.66.

From these figures it follows that the atomic weight of helium is 4
and that of argon 40. It is true that in many quarters this conclusion:
is not admitted, but I have always thought it better to recognize the
validity of the theory of gases and accept the logical deductions than
to deny the truth of the present theories. The only reason for not
admitting the correctness of these atomic weights is that that of argon
is greater than that of potassium, but this is no severer attack upon the
validity of the periodic law than the accepted position of iodin after,
instead of before, tellurium. As a matter of fact, all the more recent
determinations of the atomic weight of tellurium give the figure 127.6,
while that of iodin remains unchanged at 127.

Since these new elements form no compounds, it is not possible to
decide the question by purely chemical methods. Were it only possible
for us to propare a single volatile compound of helium or of argon our
problem would be solved. In spite of many attempts, I have not been

able to confirm Berthelot’s results with benzine or carbon bisulfid. I
have, however, offered to place a liter of argon at the disposal of my
distinguished colleague, that he may repeat his experiments on a larger
scale. No one can doubt that itis exceedingly desirable that the ques-
tion of these atomic weights should be finally decided, and that by
chemical methods.

In order that the subject may not depend wholly on physical theories,
I have considered it from another standpoint. If we assume, as from
countless chemical facts we are fully justified in doing, that the periodic
law is true, then, giving helium the atomic weight 2 and argon 20, there
is no possible place for an element of their mean atomic weight; for,
unless we absolutely overturn the accepted views, there is no vacaney -
in the table for sach an element. This appears from the following
portion of the table:

ela=sil lela?) Ila Clea OY Beall Cae) sell Ose ib
F—19 A—20(?)

It is true there is space enough between He —2 and Li=7, butitis
highly improbable that an element belonging to the argon series could
have so low an atomic weight. The difference between adjacent mem-
bers of the same group of elements is generally from 16 to 18 units, but
here such a difference is wholly excluded. If, on the other hand, we
assume He=4 and A = 40, it would be, in my opinion, by no means
improbable that such an element could exist whose atomic weight
would be somewhere about 16 units greater than that of helium, and
consequently 20 units less than that of argon. The discovery of such
an element would be, therefore, not only a proof of the correctness of
4) as the atomic weight of argon, but also a confirmation of the present
views regarding the significance of the specific heats of gases for their
molecular weight.

A glance at the periodic table will make these considerations clear,
for in the latter case we have the following series:

re C—O th — A NBL

Na=23 Mg=24.3 Al=27 Si=28 jPa= Fil
He=4

O=16 F=19 (7)=20

S=32 Cl=35.5 A=—40

Shortly after the discovery of helium I began the search for this
suspected element of atomic weight of about 20, at first in connection
with Doctor Collie, my former assistant, and later with my present
assistant, Doctor Travers.

At first it appeared not improbable that this element might be found
in those uranium minerals from which helium had been obtained. We
did not, however, confine ourselves to these minerals, but tested all
available metals, either by heating in a vacuum or by fusion with sodium
bisulphate. In many of these minerals helium was found; in many, on
RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES. 269

the other hand, only traces of hydrocarbons and hydrogen. One
mineral only, malakon, gave sufficient argon to be recognizable by the
spectroscope; the others which contained helium gave off generally also
a trace of argon, aS was later shown by our diffusion experiments.
Naturally it was impossible to be certain that the few cubic centime-
ters of gas which we collected from these minerals contained no new
gas, but we failed to detect the presence of any new lines with the
spectroscope.

You will, undoubtedly, recall that soon after the discovery of helium
doubts were expressed in many quarters as to whether the gas was
really uniform or a mixture. In order to dispel these doubts, and also
to search for the missing gas, Doctor Collie and I carried out a long
series of diffusion experiments. Through these we reached the con-
clusion that it was, in fact, possible to separate helium into two constit-
uents, one of which possessed a somewhat higher density than the
other. Later experiments, however, in conjunction with Doctor Travers,
showed that this conclusion was erroneous. In this second series much
larger quantities of helium were at our disposal, and, to our disappoint-
ment, we found that the heavier fractions of our gas owed their greater
density to the presence of a trace of argon. Here, again, we were
unable to find any new line in the spectrum, and thus far our search
was fruitless.

We next directed our attention to meteorites and to mineral waters.
Only one out of seven meteorites examined by Dr. Travers and myself
showed the presence of helium and with it a trace of argon; the others
gave only hydrogen and hydrocarbons, which were also present in the
gases from the meteorite which contained helium and argon. Here,
again, our search was in vain. The mineral water from Bath has been
investigated by Lord Rayleigh; in the waters from Cantarets, in the
Pyrenees, Dr. Schlésing has found both argon and helium. Dr. Travers
and I examined these gases for new lines, but, as before, none were
found.

Our patience was now well-nigh exhausted. There seemed, however,
to be a single ray of hope left, in an observation which had been made
by Dr. Collie and myself. You will recall that the atomic weight of
argon was apparently too high; at all events it would be more in har-
mony with the periodic law if the density of argon were 19 instead of
20, and hence its atomic weight 38 instead of 40. Hence, after some
fruitless attempts to separate argon into more than one constituent by
means of solution in water, we undertook a systematic diffusion of argon.
We did not, however, carry this procedure very far, for, at that time,
we believed that helium was a more probable source of the desired gas;
nevertheless, we found a slight difference in density between the gas
which diffused first and that which remained undiffused. We, there-
fore, decided to prepare a large quantity of argon, and, after liquefying
it, to investigate carefully the different fractions on distillation.
270 RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES.

Such an operation demands much time. In the first place, the nec-
essary apparatus is not to be found in any ordinary chemical laboratory;
the preparation can not be carried out in glass tubes in an ordinary
furnace, but requires iron tubes of large size and an especial furnace;
in the second place, the operation must be repeated several times, for
it is not convenient to work with an excessively large quantity of mag-
nesium. As before, we removed the oxygen from the air by means of
copper atared heat; the atmospheric nitrogen remaining was collected
in a large gasometer holding about 200 liters; after drying over concen-
trated sulphuric acid and phosphorous pentoxid, the gas was passed
through an iron tube of 5 centimeters diameter filled with magnesium
filings; the gas was then passed through a second copper oxid tube to
remove the hydrogen; it then entered a galvanized-iron gasometer,
which was constructed like an ordinary illuminating-gas gasometer, in
order that the argon should come in contact with as little water as pos--
sible, since argon is quite appreciably soluble in water, and, had the
ordinary form of gasometer been used, much would have been lost in
this way. Again, the gas had to be led over hot magnesium to reduce
still further the quantity of nitrogen; and, at last, it was circulated
between the gasometers, passing on its way through a mixture of thor-
oughly heated lime and magnesia at a red heat. This is a means of
absorption, recommended by Maquenne, to remove the last of nitrogen.
Since, however, it is not possible to dry the lime absolutely, hydrogen
is taken up by the gas, and this must again be removed by copper
oxid, in order that all the hydrogen may be burned, after which the
water must again be removed by drying tubes.

These operations required several months and were chiefly directed
by Dr. Travers.

Meanwhile, it seemed to be worth while to make an examination as
to whether the desired gas might possibly form compounds and be
united with the magnesium, by which the nitrogen had been removed.
Miss Emily Aston assisted me to settle this question.

Some 700 grams of the magnesium nitrid were, for this purpose,
treated with water in a large exhausted flask, in such a manner that
the evolved ammonia was absorbed in dilute sulphurie acid which had
been thoroughly boiled; all. the other gases were collected by a
Topler pump. The total volume of this gas was hardly 50 cubic cen-
timeters; it proved to be chiefly hydrogen, with a trace of hydrocar-
bons, arising from the small quantity of metallic magnesium present in
the magnesium nitrid. After the hydrogen had been removed by
explosion, an excess of oxygen was passed into the tube and the nitro-
gen removed in the usual manner by sparking over alkali. The pres-
ence of nitrogen here was undoubtedly due to the impossibility of per-
fectly exhausting all the air from so large a flask; the volume of
nitrogen was about 10 cubic centimeters. There now remained but a
minute bubble of gas, and on transferring this to a vacuum tube at
RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES. 271

very low pressure the spectrum of argon appeared. There was here,
therefore, no trace of a new gas to be found. aH
_It was not deemed worth while to investigate the ammonia, since I
had already prepared nitrogen out of this and Lord Rayleigh had
determined its density; he found this to be exactly the same as the
density of nitrogen from different chemical sources. It remained, how-
ever, possible that the sought-for gas could combine with hydrogen,
and that such a compound might possess an acid character; in this
case it might have entered into combination with the magnesium. On
account of the possibility that such a compound might be soluble, the
magnesia was extracted with water, the solution evaporated and treated
with sulphuric acid in avacuum. A gas was evolved, but it proved to
be exclusively carbon dioxid. We should have carried the treatment
of the magnesium further had not the argon at last become sufficiently
pure to subject it to the refrigerating action of liquid air, and it seemed
to me there was more hope of finding the new substance in the argon
from the atmosphere than in this residue of magnesia, which it would
require much time and labor to work up.

Dr. Hampson, the inventor of a very simple and practical machine
for the preparation of liquid air, which is based upon the same princi-
ple as that of Herr Linde, was so kind as to place large quantities of
liquid air at my disposal. In order to become acquainted with the art
of working with so unusual a material, I asked Dr. Hampson for a
liter; with this Dr. Travers and I practiced and made different little
experiments to prepare ourselves for the great experiment of liquefy-
ing argon.

It seemed to me a pity to boil away all the air without collecting the
last residue; for, though if seemed improbable that the looked-for ele-
ment could be here, yet it was, indeed, possible that a heavier gas might
accompany the argon. This suspicion was confirmed. The residue
from the liquid air consisted chiefly of oxygen and argon, and, after
removing the oxygen and nitrogen, beside the spectrum of argon were
two brilliant lines, one in the yellow, which was not identical with D,
of helium, and one in the green. This gas was decidedly heavier than
argon; its density was 22.5 instead of the 20 of argon. We had, there-
fore, discovered a new body, which was an element, for the ratio
between the specific heats was 1.66. To this element we gave the name
“krypton.” Up to this time we have not followed further the study
of this element; we have, however, collected and preserved many resi-
dues which are rich in krypton. It was, however, our first intention
to examine the lightest part of the argon. In many, however, we
remarked, in passing, that the wave-length of the green line of krypton
is exceedingly close to that of the northern lights, being 5,570, while
the latter is 5,571.

Our whole supply of argon was now liquefied in the following manner:
The gasometer containing the argon was connected with a series of
rat ea RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES.

tubes in which the gas passed over respectively hot copper oxid, con-
.centrated sulphurie acid, and phosphorus pentoxid; it then passed by a
two-way cock into a small flask, holding about 30 cubic centimeters,
which was inclosed in a Dewar tube. By means of the other opening
of the cock, the flask was connected with a mercury gasometer. By
means of a U-shaped capillary and mercury trough, it was also possi-
ble, through a three-way cock, to collect the gas at will in glass tubes.
About 50 cubic centimeters of liquid air were poured into the double
walled tube, and, by means of a Fleuss air pump kept constantly in
action, the liquid air boiled at 10 to 15 millimeters pressure. The argon
liquefied rapidly as soon as subjected to this low temperature, and in
the course of half an hour it was completely condensed. Altogether
there were about 25 cubic centimeters of a clear, limpid, colorless
liquid, in which floated white flakes of a solid substance. By stopping
the pump the pressure over the liquid air was now increased, and the
argon boiled quietly, the first portions of the gas being collected in the
mercury gasometer. Changing now the three-way cock, the largest
portion of the argon passed back into the iron gasometer; after nearly
all the liquid had boiled away and only the solid substance was left in
the flask, the last portions of the gas were collected separately. The
solid substance remained persistently in the flask; it was slowly vola-
tilized by means of a Topler pump, which stood in connection with the
apparatus.
We first directed our attention to the lighter fractions, for these had
_ for us the greatest interest. The density of this gas was found to be
14.67; the ratio between the specific heats was as usual 1.66, and the
spectrum showed, beside the well-known groupings of argon, a large
number of red, orange, and yellow lines of varying intensity. Evidently
we had before us a new element, which was contaminated with argon.

This gas was then liquefied in a similar apparatus to that first used,
but constructed on a smaller scale; a portion, however, remained
uncondensed. Even by raising the reservoir of the mercury gasometer
until an overpressure of an atmosphere was reached, it was impossible
to convert all the gas into a liqugd, although the temperature of the
boiling air was reduced as low as possible by rapid pumping. By
repeated raising and lowering of the reservoir we finally passed all the
gas through the cooled space, in order to free it, as fer as possible,
from argon. The uncondensible gas was coilected by itself, and the
remainder was evaporated into another gasometer.

You can well imagine how eager we were to know what the density
of this purified gas would prove to be. It was immediately weighed. |
Our satisfaction can well be realized when we found that its density
was 9.76. Since, however, its spectrum at low pressure still showed
argon lines, though weak, we were compelled to admit that this number
was certainly too high. It was impossible that this gas should not

contain argon, since at the temperature used argon possessed a measur-
able vapor pressure.

We have, therefore, estimated that the density of the pure gas is
9.65. Here our work for tne time was ended, by the beginning of the
summer holidays.

On our return we resumed the study of this gas, which we will here-
after designate by its name of ‘‘neon.” Its spectrum was photographed
by Mr. Baly, one of my assistants, by means of a spectrometer which
we had constructed during the vacation. To our astonishment, the
lines of helium were easily recognized. A comparison photograph
showed this beyond all question. Hence the density of the gas was in
all probability too low, owing to the presence of the helium. Since
now the temperature used was insufficient to liquify the neon, and
since the argon had been removed as far as possible, we had to face
the problem of how one could free neon from its accompanying impuri-
ties. A means was found in its solubility. It is well known that the
solubility of those gases which do not react chemically with the solvent
follows in general the same order as their condensibility. According
to this helinm should have a lesser solubility than neon, and neon than
argon. The solubility of these gases in water is, however, too slight
to be available for their separation. We have, therefore, used liquid
oxygen as a Solvent. This mixes with all three gases and boils ata
temperature not far from the boiling point of argon. We therefore
mixed the gas with sufficient oxygen to be almost wholly condensed at
the temperature attained by boiling air at the lowest possible pressure.
The uncondensed portion, about one-fifth of the whole, was separated
and collected as that richest in helium; the middle portion we con-
sidered as purified neon, while the remainder consisted of a mixture of
argon and neon; naturally, all these portions contained oxygen in
larger or smaller quantities.

After the removal of the oxygen, which was accomplished by passage
over hot copper filings, we determined the density and refractivity of
the middle portion. The density in two determinations was 10.04 and
10.19; the second figure was obtained after passing the electric spark
through the gas mixed with oxygen in the presence of caustic potash
and subsequent removal of the oxygen by phosphorus. The entire
quantity weighed was only 30 cubic centimeters at a pressure of 250
millimeters. The weight was 0.0095 gram. I mention these figures in
order to show with what an exceedingly small quantity of gas it is
possible to carry out a very satisfactory density determination.

The refractivity of this portion with reference to the air as unity was
0.338. This portion still showed the spectra of argon and helium, and
was, therefore, submitted to a second purification, in which the heavier

part was more completely removed than the lighter. Even this purifi-

cation, however, did not remove all the argon, but its quantity was
sm 98——18
274 RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES.

decidedly diminished. The density was somewhat diminished, and
helium was stronger in the spectrum. The entire amount of neon had
become, by these operations, so divided up that it was not possible to
carry out a further purification without preparing a greater quantity
of crude.neon. On this Dr. Travers and I are at present engaged.

In the meantime Mr. Baly has made exact measurements of the lines
of the neon spectrum, at the same time eliminating all the lines which
belong to argon and to helium by superposed plates. The values were
compared with iron lines photographed upon the same plate, and the
measurements were carried out by means of different pairs of these
known lines. The most important lines are the following:

Up to the present we have had little time to study thoroughly the
other companion of argon in the atmosphere. Dr. Travers and I have,
however, worked upon it. The heavier fraction of the air contains three
gases, one of which appears very perplexing. We have named it
‘‘metargon.” This gas remains, mixed with excess of argon, after the
evaporation of liquid air or argon. Up to this time we have not suc-
ceeded in obtaining it in a condition free from argon. Its peculiarity
is that when it is mixed with oxygen and subjected to the influence of
the electric spark in presence of caustic potash it shows constantly the
‘‘Swan-spectrum” as of carbon monoxid. We have treated a mixture
of carbon monoxid and argon in a similar way, and, after fifteen minutes
sparking, all the carbon had disappeared; in a Pliicker tube no trace
of the carbon spectrum could be recognized. I will, however, not yet
venture to express an opinion as to the nature of this gas. It needs
further investigation, and for this at present we have no time.

As regards krypton, which is distinguished by three brilliant lines,
one in red, one in yellow and one in green, we are in much the same
position. We have collected a considerable quantity of the impure gas,
which shows the spectrum finely, although that of argon is also present.
We hope that we shall soon be able to pursue this portion of our work
further. Wecan merely note here that the specific gravity of the gas
which shows this spectrum in such a marked way is not far different
from that of argon.

The heaviest of these gases we have weighed, although in impure con-
dition. Its density is 52.5. [need not call your attention to the fact
that there is space for an element of the helium group between bromin
RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES. 275

and rubidium. Such an element should have an atomic weight of 81

to 83, which corresponds to a density of 40.5 to 41.5, under the very

probable supposition that, like the other gases of this group, it is mona-
tomic. The spectrum of this gas, which we have named ‘“ xenon”—the
stranger—has many lines; none of these are of marked intensity, and
in this respect the spectrum resembles somewhat that of argon. It is
also analogous to argon in another particular, that the spectrum under-
goes a remarkable change when a Leyden jar is put into the circuit.
As with argon, many new blue and green lines appear, while other
lines, mostly in the red, either disappear or lose much of their intensity.
Further than this we have not proceeded in studying xenon; for our
attenton has been given chiefly to neon, as well as to a problem regard-
ing argon.

We have repeatedly met the question: ‘‘ Are the properties of argon
not appreciably changed by the presence of this new gas?” In order
to settle this question we have fractioned 25 cubic centimeters of liquid
argon several times and have collected separately about 200 cubic centi-
meters of the lightest and as much of the heaviest fraction. This
operation was repeated three times By this means we hoped to have
removed the greatest part of the neon, krypton, metargon, and xenon.
Then we liquefied the argon a fourth time, and as it boiled away col-
‘lected six samples, each after one-fifth of the whole quantity had
evaporated. These samples were carefully purified and weighed. The
density referred to 02=16 and the refractivity to air =1 are as follows:

*Contained nitrogen.

The first fraction possesses, as appears from the table, a lower density
and also a lower refractivity. The other fractions vary very little from
each other. Since these determinations were made by using only 30
cubic centimeters, we have weighed 160 cubic centimeters of the fifth
and sixth fractions. The first determined density of the fifth fraction
was 19.935, but at a pressure of 5 millimeters the spectrum of nitrogen
was easily recognizable in a Pliicker tube. After the gas had been
again purified by sparking, until all the nitrogen had been removed,
the density was 19.957. In two experiments the fourth fraction of gas
gave 19.952 and 19.961. We must then accept the true density of argon
as not far from 19.96. Independently Lord Rayleigh and I found the
density of argon to be 19.94; so it is clear that the impurities of neon
and the heavier gases have little influence. The somewhat greater
276 RECENTLY DISCOVERED GASES.

density of pure argon arises from the fact that the neon, which is the
chief impurity present, has been removed; the influence of the other
gases can not be recognized, owing to the insignificant quantities
present. In fact, in 15 liters of argon we found no appreciable trace of
xenon; it can be prepared only out of large quantities of liquid air.

I must take this opportunity of thanking you most sincerely for the
honor you have done me in inviting me to deliver this address. It has
been said by some scientist that the greatest joy of life lies in discover-
ing something which is new. There is, however, another joy almost
equally great, that of making known the results of an investigation to
one’s fellow-scientists. This joy, my friends, you have given ine to an
extreme degree, and for this I express to you my warmest thanks.

THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES AND. SOME OF ITS
CONSEQUENCES. '

By WILLIAM RAMSAY.
MW,

“lower in the crannied wall,
I pluck you out of the crannies;
Hold you here, root and all, in my hand,
Little flower—but if I could understand
What you are, root and all, and all in all,
IT should know what God and man is.”’

Though Science—Science with a capital S—is often contrasted with
Art—Art with a capital A; though the former is held to be dry and
unattractive, while the latter stirs the imagination and arouses
“thoughts that breathe and words that burn;” yet the follower of
science now and then is rewarded for his toil by an ordered sequence
which appeals to the imaginative side of his nature, no less than the
rhythmic harmony of poetry, or the measured cadences of music.
Indeed, it is not impossible for the poet to express better than, and as
truly as in, the pages of the Philosophical Transactions the highest
generalizations of science. In this Tennyson stands unrivalled. Take,
for example, the stanzas:

“There rolls the deep where grew the tree,
O earth, what changes hast thou seen!
There where the long street roars, hath been
The stillness of the central sea.

The hills are shadows, and they flow
From form to form, and nothing stands;
They melt like mist, the solid lands,

Like clouds they shape themselves and go.”

It contains an epitome of the whole of geology. The science is mere
elaboration of the ideas contained in Tennyson’s beautiful verses.

The difficulty in gaining the appreciation of the *‘ general public” is
in presenting the ideas in intelligible language. That the scientific and
the romantic are sometimes closely intermingled is indisputable; but
the romance is one which appeals to few. In the following pages an

attempt will be made to show how the thoughts of many men, each
striving to “increase natural knowledge,” as the formula of admission
to the Royal Society runs, have led to a discovery of some interest—
that of a hitherto unsuspected constituent of atmospheric air.

The Roman poet Lucretius, a friend and contemporary of Cicero,
was the author of a poem entitled “De Rerum Natura” (‘On the
Nature of Things”). In this poem, which treats of almost all things
in heaven and earth, he argues that the atoms, the existence of which
is obvious because one sees them in a cone of light passing through a
dark room, fall rapidly together in their dancing course throughout
the spheres, and by their collision engender all known things. Their
paths are, however, not directed. but fortuitous; and, therefore, the
world is the product of chance.

Passing over many centuries, we find Boyle, in the reign of
Charles I, suggesting that the difference between different kinds of
matter is to be explained by the nature and the motion of the particles
or atoms of which they are composed. The region of speculation was
narrowed when Daniel Bernoulli, in 1738, attempted to account for the
law, due to Boyle, that the volume of gases varies inversely with the
pressure to which they are exposed; and similar attempts were made
by Herapath im 1821, and by Joule in 1851. Their ideas were systema-

ized by Clausius in 1857 under the name of the ‘‘ Kinetic Theory of
Gases.”

Briefly stated, the theory is this: Granted that in gases the par-
ticles—or, as they are now termed, the molecules—of which they coy-
sist are widely separated from each other, and that the pressure which
the gas exerts on the sides of any vessel in which it may be contined—
a pressure which may be realized by pumping away the air outside the
vessel, when, if the vessel is constructed of yielding material, such as
bladder, it will distend, and ultimately burst—is caused solely by the
bombardment of the molecules of gas on the walls. It is at the first
blush not very easy to conceive of a steady pressure being due to an
enormous number of impacts irregularly delivered. But there are
many analogies which help to form the concepton. For instance, a
musical note, which may strike us as of the utmost smoothness and
uniformity, is in reality the result of a succession of blows on the
tympanum of the ear, each following the preceding one too rapidly for
our ears to distinguish the break in continuity. In a similar manner
the pressure of a gas is accounted for. And the temperature, a rise in
which also increases the pressure of a gas on the walls of a vessel con-
taining it, is attributed to the increased velocity of the molecules of
the gas. Now, for simplicity’s sake, considering a blow given by only
one molecule, the force of the blow—to use a rough expression which
will serve the purpose—-will depend not merely on the rate at which
that molecule is moving, but also on the weight of that molecule. So
that a light molecule with a high rate of motion may deliver as forcible

THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES. 219

a blow as a heavy molecule with a slower rate of motion.. By Clausius’s
hypothesis, the temperatures of two gases are believed to be equal
when the products of their masses into the square of their rates of
motion are equal. This is not quite the same thing as saying ‘‘ when

_ the force of the blows they give is equal,” but it may be taken as con-

nected with it.

Supposing, then, that two gases are at the same. temperature—that
when placed in contact neither gives up heat to the other—then the
product above mentioned must be equal for both. For it is obvious
that the specifically lighter gas must have the higher velocity; that is,
the molecules must be endowed with a higher rate of motion.

What is that rate of motion? Clausius was able to answer that ques-
tion: A molecule of hydrogen, the lightest gas known, if it moved in a

straight line, unimpeded in its motion by collision with any other mole-

cules or with any solid body, would pass through no less than a mile
and a quarter in a second. Anda molecule of oxygen equally free to
move would travel through space with a velocity of rather less than
one-third of a mile per second. The relative rates of motion are there-
fore in inverse proportion to the square roots of the densities of the
gases. Thus, aS oxygen is sixteen times as heavy as hydrogen, a
molecule of hydrogen would move through space in a straight line,
were it free to do so, at a rate four times as great as that at which a
molecule of oxygen moves.

These rates of motion are calculated for the temperature of melting
ice. But as the effect of rise of temperature is to quicken the rate of
motion of molecules of gases, so fall of temperature will cause a
decreased velocity. The question arises: Is there any possibility of so
lowering temperature that the motion of such moving molecules will
cease? Judging by the rate at which the pressure of a gas decreases
with fall of temperature, there is. That temperature has been called
the “absolute zero of temperature;” it lies 273° below the melting
point of-ice on the centigrade scale, or at —460° on the Fahrenheit
seale, the one commonly in use in this country. This temperature has
not been reached; it is unlikely that it will ever be reached; but an
approach has recently been made to it by liquefying hydrogen gas and
allowing it to boil at the atmospheric pressure. The temperature
reached in this manner is about —243° C.; and Professor Dewar, who
has recently succeeded in liquefying hydrogen in quantity, will no doubt
be able to produce a still lower temperature by causing the liquid
hydrogen to boil in a vessel connected with an air pump, so that the
pressure is reduced. For, just as raising the pressure raises the boil-
ing point of a liquid, as exemplified in the boiler of a steam engine,
so lowering the pressure lowers the boiling point.

It is now many years since Dr. Johnstone Stoney applied the kinetic
theory of gases, in a Series of papers read before the Royal Dublin
Society, to the question of the existence of atmospheres on planets and
Satellites. if a molecule happens to be moving on the surface of a
280 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

planet at arate which would carry it away from the planet more rapidly
than the planet can draw it back, that molecule will escape into space.-
It is not theoretically impossible, although practically unrealizable, to
construct a gun which would fire a bullet vertically into the air at such
a rate that the bullet might never return to the earth. What, then,
would oceur to it? Well, it would wander on through space as a little
planet, performing an ellipse round the sun, as, indeed, many aérolites
or “‘shooting stars” are known to do. It might, indeed, chance to
come within the range of attraction of some planet—e. g., Jupiter—
massive enough to hold it; or it might actually fall on the surface of a
planet; in the former case, it would act like a little satellite, and revolve
round that planet, as the numerous stones of which Saturn’s rings are
composed revolve round Saturn; in the latter case, it would simply
become part of that planet, as the falling stars which reach the earth
form, after their fall, a portion of the earth.

The molecule of gas, which we have been considering, differs in no
particular from a bullet in its wanderings or in its fate. If it chance
to come within the sphere of attraction of a planet of sufficient mass
to retain it, it will, according to Dr. Stoney, form part of that planet’s
atmosphere. If not, it will wander on, until it may, by chance, come
near enough to the sun to fall a victim to its enormous attractive force,
and it will then become part of the sun’s atmosphere.

Dr. Stoney has summed up the results of various inquiries of this

kind in a memoir entitled Of Atmosphere upon Planets and Satellites. !

One important point has been omitted in the sketch given of the
kinetic theory. Itis this: When it was said that a molecule of oxygen
moves at the rate of about one-third of a mile per second, it was not
implied that all molecuies are moving at that rate. Some, urged on
by collisions from behind, acquire.a much more rapid rate; others,
hindered in their motion by collisions with other molecules moving
more slowly than themselves, or in an opposite direction, have their
rate of motion decreased. A gas must be conceived as composed of
an almost infinite number of such molecules, jostling each other in
every conceivable way. The rate of one-third of a mile per second,
deduced by Clausius as the average rate of motion of a molecule of
oxygen, must be understood to mean that if all the rates of motion
were to be balanced out, so that the swiftly moving molecules gave up
some of their motion to the slowly moving molecules, and vice versa,
the molecules would all be moving at the above mentioned rate. But
it must be distinctly borne in mind that this imaginary state of things
never occurs. There are always many molecules moving faster, many
slower, than the average.

I find in my own case thatit helps greatly to a clear understanding of
such a conception as that of which a short account has been given if
a mental picture can be called up which will illustrate the conception,

although even imperfectly. Some such picture may be formed by
thinking of the motions of the players in a game of football. “Ata
critical point in the game the players are running, some this way, some
that; one has picked up the ball and is running with it, followed by
two or three others; while players from the opposite side are slanting”
toward him, intent upon a collision. The backs are at rest, perhaps;
but, on the approach of the ball to the goal, they quicken into activity,
and the throng of human molecules is turned aud pursues an opposite
course. The failure of this analogy to represent what is believed to
occur in a gas is that the players’ motion is directed and has a pur-
pose; that they do not move in straight lines, but in any curves which
may suit their purpose; and that they do not, as two billiard balls do,
communicate their rates of motion one to the other by collision. But,
making such reservations, some idea may be gained of the encounters
of molecules by the encounters in a football field.

In considering averages, it is clear that there must be a practical
limit on both sides of the mean. Ifa man throws dice, he may turn up
sixes thrice in succession, or some greater number of times, by chance;
but it is clear he will not go on throwing sixes forever, though there is
no absolute reason why he should not. Similarly, in thinking of the
rates of motion of molecules, there will be a practical limit of rate at
which any one molecule will move. It is unlikely that any one mole-
cule will cease to move for any appreciable time; and it is unlikely,
too, that any one molecule will develop any exceptionally rapid veloc-
ity, say twenty times the mean. Still, such events may conceivably
occur; they will, however, be very infrequent.

Those gases which are light, and whose molecules have a high
intrinsic average rate of motion, will, in the nature of things, contain
some molecules which happen to be moving ata high speed; and neces-
sarily will contain more such than a gas of higher density, the average
rate ot motion of whose molecules is slower. It may happen that
molecules of each kind, of gas with low as well as of gas of high density,
may possess such exceptionally high velocity at the confines of our
atmosphere, where there are comparatively few gaseous molecules
altogether; and it may also happen that these molecules are moving
in a direction more or less nearly perpendicular to the surface of the
planet, and it may also happen that such molecules suffer no collisions
in their vertical path; if these events all happen, the molecules will
escape. But as, on the doctrine of chances, there are more molecules
of light gas endowed with such exceptionally high velocity than there
are of heavy gas, more molecules of the former will escape away from

-the neighborhood of the planet and enter free space as independent

entities than of the latter.

Such a process, prolonged over ages, will ultimately remove from
the atmosphere of a planet all gases possessing less than a certain mini-
mum density.
282 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

The next question to which Dr. Stoney addresses himself is: What
rate of motion must a molecule have in order that it may escape from
the attraction of the earth? The least velocity which will enable such
a molecule to escape is about 7 miles per second. And it is assumed,
from observations taken at high altitudes, that the temperature of the
upper regions of the atmosphere is about —66° C., or about —87° F.

This velocity of 7 miles a second is, however, considerably greater
than the average velocity of a molecule of hydrogen, which, at 32° F.,
it will be remembered, is only about a mile and a quarter. But itis
not greater than the velocity of some of the molecules; and these wili
therefore escape. In fact, Dr. Stoney concludes that in every gas a
considerable proportion of the molecules have a velocity at least ten
times as great as the mean.

Now on this earth the important constituents of the atmosphere are
nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ammonia;
and their densities are as follows, that of hydrogen being taken as
unity:

We are here chiefly concerned with the gases of the earth’s atmos-
phere; but it may be of interest to cast a glance at other conelusions
which follow from Dr. Stoney’s speculations.

The moon, the mass of which is much less than that of the earth,
would retain a gas of density 40, or thereabouts; but all less dense
_ gases would escape rapidly. From the planet Mercury water vapor
would at once escape, and it is probable that both nitrogen and oxygen
would escape more slowly. Argon and carbon dioxide might, however,
be permanent constituents of the atmosphere of Mercury. Venus, on
the other hand, retains water vapor; but lighter gases would escape.
It must be remembered that if the water were to escape from a planet
in the state of vapor, its place would be at once supplied by evapora-
tion of planetary seas, if there were any, and that, in the long run, all
the water would, in the state of gas or water, leave the planet.

Indeed, Dr. Stoney thinks it not unlikely that we are slowly losing
our stock of water. This, however, need excite no alarm, and our
water will probably outlast our coal many millions of years. For so
few of the molecules of water comply with the required standard of
velocity that the rate of loss is almost infinitesimally small.

Similarly Dr. Stoney conjectures that water can not remain on Mars;
that all known gases would be imprisoned by Jupiter; and that Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune may probably be able to retain all gases heavier
than hydrogen. As for the sun, its mass is so enormous relatively to

that of the planets that, even at the exceedingly high temperature
which its atmosphere possesses, it is impossible for any known gas to
remove itself from the neighborhood of the luminary.

We must now take leave of Dr. Stoney’s fascinating hypotheses for
a time, and consider the recent discoveries of gaseous constituents of
our atmosphere.

After the discovery of argon as a constituent of air in 1894, one of
the discoverers, acting on advice given him by Professor Miers, was so
fortunate as to isolate helium, a gas contained in certain rare minerals,
the best known of which bears the name of cleveite. Helium had
previously been detected in the chromosphere, the colored atmosphere
of the sun, by M. Janssen, the well-known French astronomer; and its
name was suggested by Messrs. Frankland and Lockyer, in 1868, to
characterize the brilliant yellow line by which its presence in the sun
is revealed. Neither of these elements has been combined with others,
although it is possible that each exists in combination with one or more
of the elements contained in the minerals from which helium can be
obtained by heating, for it has been found that small quantities of argon,
along with considerable. quantities of helium, are evolved from such
minerals. Again, both of these elements possess one curious property,
which they share with gaseous mercury alone, so far as is known, among
all elements. That is technically called the ratio between their specific
heats at constant pressure and at constant volume. It would be difficult
here to set forth the reasoning by which itis deduced that inasmuch as
the ratio for these gases is 13 to 1 between specific heat at constant
pressure and at constant volume, the molecules of these elements,
unlike those of oxygen and hydrogen and the other commoner gases,
but like those of mercury gas, consist not of agglomerations of two or
more atoms, but of single atoms. These characteristics at once estab-
lish a connection between the two elements helium and argon, and
differentiate them in kind from all other gaseous elements.

Now, taking the density of hydrogen as unity, that of helium is
very nearly 2,.and that of argon 20. And one of the conclusions which
follows from the Kinetic theory of gases is that equal volumes of gases
contain equal numbers of molecules. Thus the fact that helium is
twice as heavy as hydrogen carries with it the conclusion that a mole-
cule of helium is twice as heavy as a molecule of hydrogen, whatever
the absolute weight of the latter may be.

Now, it can be demonstrated that there is a strong probability in
favor of the assumption that a molecule of hydogen consists of two
atoms, inseparable from each other unless by combination with some
other element. And if a molecule of helium consisting of one atom is
twice as heavy asa molecule of hydrogen consisting of two, then it
follows that an atom of helium is four times as heavy as an atom of
hydrogen; in other words, the atomic weight of helium is 4, that of
284 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

hydrogen being taken as 1. Similar reasoning proves the atomic
weight of argon to be 40, from the known fact that it is twenty times
as heavy as hydrogen. Moreover it is noteworthy that the difference
between these numbers 40 and 4 is 36.

Mr. John Newlands, whose recent death is deplored by the scientific
world, as long ago as 1863 brought forward what he termed a “law of
octaves.” It consisted in arranging the numbers which represent the
atomic weights of the elements in seven rows, beginning again with the
eighth element, so that its atomic weight occupies a position in the
table below that of the first, the ninth below the second, the fifteenth
again below the first, and so on. The reproduction of three of such
rows will make the meaning clear.

&e. &e. ‘

The elements appear in this table in groups, of which the indi-
vidual members closely resemble each other, often in appearance, and
always in the nature of the compounds they form with other elements.
Thus, to take the first column, the three elements, lithium, sodium,
and potassium, together with others not here produced, but which
occur later on in the table, rubidium and eczesium, are all white waxy
metallic solids, easily cut with a knife, tarnishing rapidly in contact
with ordinary moist air, and forming compounds which themselves
present the greatest resemblance to one another. Now, in Mr. New-
lands’s view, the fact that the eighth element resembles the first
suggested an analogy with the musical scale, where the tones can be
similarly classified, each eighth note of the major scale reproducing,
as it were, the fundamental note. In the ordinary notation, the name
C refers to many notes, separated from each other by octaves. The
analogy may be regarded as fanciful, and in the light of more modern
work the word “octave” is here inapplicable; and this perhaps over-
strained analogy did much to discredit Mr. Newlands’s views in the
eyes of the leading chemists of the day. It was not until 1868, when
the late Prof. Lothar Meyer, and Professor Mendeléef independently
arrived at a similar arrangement, that the attention of chemists was
recalled to the subject, and the justice of Mr. Newlands’s ideas was
acknowledged. The somewhat tardy award of a medal by the Royal
Society placed in its true position the work of Mr. Newlands, and was
regarded as an act of justice by hisfriends. It is deeply to be regretted
that his recent death has removed from our midst a man so kindly
and so alive to every advance in science.

The elements helium and argon, if they be really elements and not
compounds (and there is no reason to doubt their elementary nature),
should find places in this table. now known as the “ Periodic Arrange-
ment of the Elements.” And confining our attention to only a few of
THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES. 285

the vertical columns, their position should be for helium before lithium,
and for argon before potassium, thus:

Hydrogen... 1 Helium... 4 Lithium.... _7

Fluorine .-.. 19 2 Sodium .... 23

Chlorine .... 35.5 Argon... 40 Potassium... 39
icone ses

Manganese... 55 +Cobalt.. 58\. Copper -.-.- 63.5
[Nickel .. 59

Bromine _... 80 2 Rubidium __ &5

Now, we find the difference between the atomic weights of hydrogen
and chlorine to be 34.5; and between lithium and potassium to be 32;
also between argon and helium to be 36. These numbers are roughly
of the same order of magnitude. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to
suspect the existence of an undiscovered element with atomic weight
between 19 and 23, as well as of others occupying the other unfilled
positions in the argon group.

It is no easy matter to hunt the earth through for an unknown ele-
ment. The question is, where tolook. And some clew is necessary to

guide the inquiry. At first it was thought that minerals similar to

those from which helium had been obtained might possibly yield the
new element; and experiments were made, for months at a time, to test
the gases obtainable from almost every known mineral, but in vain, so
far aS a new element was concerned. They resulted in the discovery
of many new sources of helium, but the spectrum of the gas in each
ease exhibited no unknown lines. A new method of attack was then
organized. It might be that the so-called helium was really a mixture
of elements, and nota pure element. Now, an effective method of sepa-
rating from each other two gases of different molecular weights, and
hence of different densities, is the process of diffusion. From observa-
tions of the late Professor Graham, of University College, London,
subsequently mastér of the mint, it appears that lighter gases, with
rapidly moving molecules, will pass through a porous diaphragm, such
as the material of a clay pipe, more rapidly than a heavier gas, with its
more slowly moving molecules. An attempt was therefore made to
ascertain whether any heavier gas could be thus separated from the
helium obtained from minerals. The experiments involved an enormous
amount of labor, but in the end no gas other than a trace of argon could
be detected. It appeared, therefore, vain to attempt to discover a new
gas in minerals; and the justice of Dr. Stoney’s hypothesis was next
tested. It was, of course, not out of the question that the sought-for
gas might exhibit some powers of combination, and that it might have

been absorbed, along with the nitrogen of the air, by the magnesium

over which the gas had been sent at a red heat, in order to absorb and
remove the nitrogen. The compound of magnesium with nitrogen is
very readily decomposed by water; the products are ammonia and
hydroxide of magnesium. -A large quantity of this magnesium nitride
286 THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES.

was accordingly treated with water, and the resulting ammonia ab-
sorbed by means of weak sulphuric acid. There was merely a trace of
gas which refused to be absorbed, and on examination it turned out to
be the familar hydrogen, which was formed by the action of the water
on some metallic magnesium which had escaped combination with
nitrogen. This experiment was interesting, inasmuch as it proved
that magnesium refuses to. combine with even the smallest trace of

argon. The ammonia resulting from this treatment, it is true, might |

have conceivably contained a compound of the new gas, but a similar
sample had previously been decomposed, so as to obtain from it its
nitrogen, and that sample of nitrogen had been found by Lord Ray-
leigh to possess the same density as a sample of nitrogen of which the
source could not be traced to the atmosphere. Lastly, it was conceiy-
able that the hydroxide of magnesium might have contained some
compound of the new element. It was therefore treated with water,
and the soluble portion separated from the insoluble. The soluble
portion, on examination, proved to contain nothing but the carbonate
of magnesium. The insoluble portion was not further dealt with, but
was kept in reserve.

The argon of the atmosphere was next examined. A large quantity
having been prepared, it was purified, and by passing it into a vessel
immersed in liquid air, made to boil at even lower temperature than
usual by pumping away the air-gases as they boiled off, the argon, too,
was completely changed into liquid. Liquid argon is clear and color-
less, whereas liquid air has a faint blue tint, owing to the blue color
of the oxygen it contains. The argon was next made to boil, by allow-
ing the temperature of the liquid air to rise a few degrees, and the
first portions of argon-gas were collected separately, the remainder
going back into the gas-holder in which it had originally been stored.
The gas thus obtained was lighter than argon and more difficult to
liquefy; this was shown by the necessity of compressing it into the
bulb in which liquefaction took place. The most volatile portions of
this liquid were next collected separately, and the gas proved to be
still less dense than the former sample. It was not possible to liquefy
more than a small fraction of this last specimen of gas, to however low
a point the temperature of the boiling air was reduced; and after
another repetition of the same process the gas appeared to be as light
as the process could make it. Its density was 9.75 times that of hydro-
gen, and making allowance for a small quantity of argon, which it
must necessarily have contained, this number becomes reduced to 9.6.!
The weight of a molecule, compared with the weight of an atom of
hydrogen, as previously explained, must therefore be 19.2; and 19.2
lies between the atomic weights of fluorine, 19, and of sodium, 23, fall-

1This gas has since been found to contain a trace of helium, the presence of which
would lower the above density. The actual density will, therefore, be somewhat
higher than 9.6, but it will probably not exceed 10. It has not yet been determined.
F

ing therefore into the predicted place in the Periodic Table. The
specific heat ratio of this new gas, to which the name ‘‘ueon” or ‘the
new one” has been given, is, as in the case of helium and argon, 13;
like them, too, it resists combination with other elements and possesses
a brilliant and characteristic spectrum.

This account of the fulfillment of a prediction has, I am afraid, been
somewhat elaborate for the general reader; but it is interesting as a
case of discovery, where many lines of evidence, founded on the work
of many different observers, have led.to the foreseen conclusion. It
possesses, to my mind at least, some of the qualities of a scientific
poem: An orderly arrangement of ideas, drawn from many different
sources, each throwing light on the other, and all tending toward a
final event. It is true that the subject is not one to which poetical
diction can be applied with advantage; the details are too complicated,
too unfamiliar, and to be expressed only’ in Janguage which has not
received the impress of poetical tradition; but to enlarge on this would
open a wide field of discussion, in which esthetics, a subject not as yet
reduced to accurate formulation, and perhaps hardly susceptible of
treatment by scientific methods, would form the chief theme.

In epic poems the ‘‘ argument” usually precedes the matter. Here
it may be convenient to reverse the order, and to sum up the preceding
pages by the argument. We have seen, then, that the discovery by
Lord Rayleigh of a discrepancy in the density of atmospheric nitrogen
has resulted in the discovery of a new constituent of air, argon; its
discovery has led to that of a constituent of the solar atmosphere,
helium; speculations on the ultimate nature and motion of the parti-
cles of which it is believed that gases consist has provoked the con-
sideration of the conditions necessary in order that planets and
satellites may retain an atmosphere, and of the nature of that atmos-
phere; the necessary existence of an undiscovered element was fore-
seen, owing to the usual regularity in the distribution of the atomic
weights of elements not being attained in the case of helium and argon;
and the source of neon was therefore indicated. This source, atmos-
pherie air, was investigated, and the missing element was discovered.
A new fact has been added to science, and one not disconnected from
others, but one resulting from the convergence of many speculations,
observations, and theories, brought to bear on one another.

Bryps lee IN STOKES.

Nothing can be more instructive to the student interested in the
results of intellectual cross fertilization than the effect of the recent
fecundation of chemistry by physics. Through the application of phys-
ical methods and ideas to chemistry, the latter has given birth to a new
branch of study, physical chemistry, which promises to produce as radi-
cal a change in our conceptions of molecular phenomena as did the
overthrow of the phlogiston theory or the introduction of the conception
of valency at a later period.

The attempt of Berthollet to introduce dynamical conceptions into
chemistry, at the beginning of the century, fell on thorny ground, and
from that day until very recent years the growth of chemistry, great as
it has been, has been most remarkably one-sided. The Periodic Law
has been discovered, many new elements have been found, new com-
pounds without number have been prepared, the rules governing their
formations and transformations have been ascertained, and even their
microscopic anatomy has been studied to such an extent that for count-
less of them we have established formulas which express, schematically,
the relative arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. In stereochem-
istry we have even gone so far as to be able to indicate, in a rough way,
the actual relations of the atoms in space; yet, with all this, a most
important part of the problem has been almost neglected. To use a
biological expression, chemistry has been enormously developed on the
morphological, and but little on the physiological side. Chemists have
concerned themselves greatly with the products of chemical reactions,
and but little with the nature of the reactions themselves. The mole-
cule has been treated as a dead, rigid body 1s treated by the anatomist,
but its study as a living, moving mass, filled with energy and capable
of reacting by virtue of this energy, has been largely left to the future.
Even as late as 1882 the German physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond
used the words which have since been in the mouth of every physical
chemist: “In contradistinction to modern chemistry, we may eall phy-
sical chemistry the chemistry of the future.”

290 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

Since 1882, thanks to the labors and inspiring influence of Ostwald,
van’t Hoff, Arrhenius, Nernst, and others, physical chemistry is no
longer the chemistry of the future merely, but of the present, and apart
from the quickening influence which it is exerting in nearly all branches _
of chemistry proper, both pure and applied, we are beginning to per-
ceive that we are entering a period in which chemistry will be of greater
service to the allied sciences. Geological chemistry is showing signs of
reviving under the stimulus of physico chemical conceptions, and we
are finding, too, that as physiological chemistry is not merely the chem-
istry of sugar, or urea, or albumin, but preeminently a science of moving
and changing molecules, it can only progress by the aid of a knowledge
of the laws of chemical energy.

The achievements of physical chemistry form, perhaps, the most
interesting phase of the recent history of our science, but its followers
have spoken for themselves so often of late years, and have presented
the subject so much better than I could do it, that I feel compelled to
consider a perhaps humbler, but yet not unimportant, field of research,
which, in a sense, may also be called a part of the chemistry of the future,
the field of Inorganic Chemistry. The relationsof physical and inorganic
chemistry have recently been discussed by van’t Hoff in his admirable
- address delivered last summer before the Society of German Scientists
and Physicians, and I shall, therefore, limit myself to the consideration
of a few points of a more strictly chemical nature, touching the rela-
tions of physical and inorganic chemistry only incidentally.

The aim of physical chemistry will bave been accomplished when it
has established a mathematical equation which, by proper substitution,
will enable us to predict the nature of every possible chemical system
or reaction, and the properties, physical and chemical, of every possi-
ble element or compound. Until he has reached this chemical millen-
nium, unless he will risk falling into the pit which has received so many
philosophers in the past, the chemist must continue to advance by the
route by which our understanding of every other branch of physical
science has been reached. Notwithstanding all that physical chemis-
try can do with this material at present in hand, the experimenter must
long continue to take the short cut to knowledge and find out what his
elements and compounds will do by first actually getting them in hand,
by precipitation, filtration, distillation, crystallization, and the like. It
may be questioned whether our present knowledge of facts would ever
suffice to enable us to predict, for example, a single atomic weight with
accuracy, or to explain that wonderful relation between properties and
atomic weights known as the Periodic Law. A few enthusiastic physi-
cal chemists have spoken slightingly of the compound maker as a kind
of inferior being, apparently forgetting that it is just this kind of pio-
neer work which has supplied the material for their labors, that the
first requisite for successful generalization is the possession of a large.
number of pure substances, of accurately known composition and prop-

erties, many of which can only be obtained by work which is so elabo-
rate and difficult, and which requires such concentration of effort, that
he who follows it can well be excused if he does not always look on the
product of his labor as merely means to another end. It is tolerably
clear that, for a long time to come, experimentizing must keep equal pace
with mathematizing, and if the former have been pushed so far in one
direction as to appear to afford no prospect of continued progress we
must not abandon it altogether, but consider whether it may not be
still profitably pursued along other lines. Let us consider whether we
must all turn mathematical chemists, or whether there is not much left
to be done by those trained in the older school, working along old-
fashioned lines and by old-fashioned methods.

Descriptive chemistry, as it exists to-day, is a science which has
grown and is still growing enormously in a single direction, that of
organic chemistry, the chemistry of the compounds of carbon. We are
at present acquainted with about seventy-five chemical elements, which
‘are found in the most varied proportions in those parts of the earth
which are accessible to our observation, namely, the crust, the sea, and
the air. The accompanying table, calculated by Clarke, shows the rel-
ative abundance of the elements in a sphere comprising the crust for a
depth of 10 miles, the ocean, and the atmosphere:

The nineteen elements here given make up nearly the whole mass;
the remaining fifty-five or thereabouts, taken together, and making all
possible allowance for error, do not amount to more than 1 per cent.
Observe that the element carbon amouuts to but one-fifth of one per
cent. To be sure, this is no argument that the chemistry of carbon is
relatively unimportant; on the contrary, there is no necessary connec-
- tion between the abundance of an element and its ability to carry us

further toward a knowledge of chemical laws. Nevertheless, to an
292 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

intelligence not having its seat in a body largely made up of carbon
compounds, it might appear somewhat surprising that chemists should
have attempted to base a science on the investigation of an element
which exists in such relatively insignificant amounts, the compounds
of which, with but few exceptions, are incapable of formation at the
freezing point of water, or of existence at the lowest red heat, and
should have chosen to devote nearly all of their energy to its study.

Apart from the special subject of coal, petroleum, and asphalt, carbon
is of practical importance to the geologist only in the form of carbon
dioxide and the carbonates, while of the chemical properties of silicon,
which constitutes 27 per cent of the earth’s crust, and of the silicates,
which make up nearly all of it, we know vastly less than of the deriva-
tives of the single carbon compound, benzene. A study of the chem-
ical changes taking place in the sun, and of most of those occurring in
the interior of the earth, might almost leave carbon out of account; it
would certainly have no more importance: than titanium, an element
of which few but chemists have ever heard, but which is more abund-
ant and as widely distributed.

Carbon, as an essential constituent of living beings, constantly forces
itself on our attention, yet this is not to be considered as by any means
the chief cause of the predominance of organic chemistry. Compara-
tively few of the best-studied organic compounds have more than the
remotest connection with the phenomena of life. Phosphorus and
sulphur, to say nothing of oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, are quite as
important in this respect as carbon, yet how relatively little do we
know of phosphorus and sulphur in their chemical relations, or even
of nitrogen. The extraordinary development of carbon chemistry is
due mainly to reasons of a chemical nature, which, by rendering its
compounds easier to study, have made progress in this direction a line
of least resistance. This has not been without its advantages, for we
have been led to discern laws which could not have been perceived so
soon had the working forces been more evenly distributed, but it has
also had the unfortunate result that the theories of molecular structure,
derived wholly from the study of carbon compounds, have been applied
to all classes of inorganic compounds too hastily and without sufficient
research. The inorganic chemist has done little but make new com-
pounds, and ascribe to them structural formulas seldom based on the
results of experiment, but rather on the possibility of drawing schemes
on paper, in which the various valences or bonds were mutually satis-
fied (how, did not matter much), while those substances which were
inconsiderate enough to refuse to submit to this operation without vio-
lating every probable or possible assumption have been labeled
“molecular compounds” and under this name submitted to a forced
neglect, which soon resulted in their being forgotten. We shall
presently see that an increasing respect for these so-called molecular
compounds is one of the features of the revival of inorganic chemistry.
es

THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 293

In the earlier days of chemistry no sharp line was drawn betsveen
inorganic and organi¢ substances. It is generally thought that we owe
this distinction to Nicholas Lémery, who, in 1675, classified substances
according to their origin, as mineral, vegetable, and animal, a distine-
tion which has survived until the present day in popular speech. La-
voisier, recognizing in substances of vegetable and animal origin the
elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, and led by his
researches to attribute a peculiar importance to oxygen, regarded inor-
ganic bases and acids as oxides of simple radicals, and organic bodies
as oxides of compound radicals composed of carbon, hydrogen, and
sometimes nitrogen, but did not otherwise distinguish them. Even in
1811 it was undetermined whether carbon compounds obey the laws of
constant and multiple proportions, and it was two or three years more
before Berzelius, having sufficiently improved the methods of organic
analysis, definitely proved that they do, in fact, conform to these laws,
but are of greater complexity than the comparatively simple inorganic
compounds then known. In his electro-chemical theory, the theory of
dualism, developed between 1812 and 1818, Berzelius regarded the
simple inorganic bodies, such as the bases and acids, as binary com-
pounds of positive with negative atoms, held together by electrical
attraction; the more complex bodies, as the salts, being binary com-
pounds of a higher order; the organic compounds, on the contrary,
being regarded as ternary or quaternary. Later he extended the
dualistic cohception to these also, adopting the idea of Lavoisier that
they are binary compounds of oxygen with compound radicals, com-
posed of carbon, hydrogen, and sometimes nitrogen, a view which he
developed further and never wholly abandoned. In 1817 we find Leo-
pold Gmelin maintaining that organic compounds are the products of
a vital force and can not be produced artificially. This view was enter-
tained by Berzelius even as late as 1827, orlater. Berzelius attributed
the formation of organic compounds, with their relatively weak positive
and negative characters, to peculiar electrical conditions existing in
the organism. We can not reproduce these conditions in the laboratory,
and, therefore, can not produce organic compounds artificially. Those
transformations which we are able to effect are always from the more
complex to the simpler. We can isolate the intermediate stages in the
breaking down of organic matter into carbon dioxide, water and
ammonia—thatis, we can follow the change of inatter from the organic
to the inorganic, step by step—but we can not reverse the process and
build up, nor can we hope to do so in the future. This opinion of Ber-
zelius marks the widest gulf between organic and inorganic chemistry,
a guiftoo wide for human power to bridge. How dangerous it is to
set limits to the power of science! But one year later,in 1828, Wohler
announced his discovery that urea, a body of animal origin, could be
produced from ammonium cyanate, a substance which, in its turn, can
be built up from its constituent elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
294 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

and nitrogen. This was the first of a series of innumerable syntheses
which have fully disposed of the idea that any fundamental distinction
exists between inorganic and organic compounds. Aithough we have
not yet made albumin in the laboratory, we all expect that it will be
done, and nearly every chemist now believes that even the properties
of living protoplasm are due, not to any peculiar vital force inherent
in the protoplasm itself, but to the special properties of the carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements of which
it is composed. My subject does not permit me to consider in detail
how the idea of organic chemistry, as the chemistry of compound radi-
cals, was evolved; how the radical theory was replaced by the concep-
tion of the molecule as a unit; how, in 1853, the theory of valency
began to develop, and how this, with the type theory, the theory of the
linkage of atoms, and the constant tetravalency of carbon, led, in the —
early sixties, to our present conceptions of the structure of organic
molecules. With the advent of the fully developed structural formula,
the brilliant progress of organic chemistry toward fuller theoretical
development came to an end with remarkable suddenness. Kekulé’s
ingenious and fruitful theory of the benzene ring, suggested in 1865,
was an application to a particular class of compounds of principles
already established, but involved no fundamentally new conceptions.
Organic chemistry entered upon what has aptly been termed a period
of “formula worship.” The establishment of the constitutional formula
became the highest aim of the devotees of this cult, against which but
few chemists, forexample Kolbe and Mendelejeff, have had the courage
_ to protest. In pursuing this aim the organic chemists have unques-
tionably accumulated an enormous mass of valuable information and
detail; have discovered new methods of synthesis, new laws of more or
less special application, and new compounds of practical value; but,
with all their labors, the ordinary structural formula of to-day means
no more than it did in 1865. In stereo-chemistry, however, the devel-
opment of the structural formula in space of three dimensions, organic
chemistry has shown real progress, especially since 1887, when LeBel
and van’t Hoff’s theory of the asymmetric carbon atom, which was pro-
posed in 1874, but which slumbered almost forgotten, was revived by
Wislicenus. At present the most important developments of struc-
tural chemistry, both organic and inorganic, unquestionably have the
question of space relation as their basis. .

The development of inorganic chemistry presents some marked dis-
tinctions from that of organic chemistry. Up to the year 1820 nearly
all the important discoveries and generalizations came from the inor-
ganic side. Richter’s discovery of the law of equivalents; the researches
of Scheele, Cavendish, Priestley; the development of the theory of
oxidation by Lavoisier; the atomic hypothesis of Dalton and his laws
of constaut and multiple proportions, and the placing of them on a
firm foundation by the remarkable labors of Berzelius; Gay Lussac’s
ee abe ot +

law of the simple relation of the volumes of reacting gases; Dulong
and Petit’s law, aud the law of isomorphism, all fall within this period
and antedate the beginning of the rapid development of carbon chem-
istry. ‘The same is true of the discovery of the alkali metals, the recog-
nition of the elementary nature of chlorine, and of the establishment of
the existence of hydrogen acids, and many other important facts. In

. these the study of carbon played a relatively insignificant part. The

electro-chemical theory of Berzelius, too, which was of such great im-
portance as a working hypothesis, was of inorganic origin. By 1830
the predominance of organic chemistry was already pronounced, and
with the increased attention given to this new field the interest in
inorganic chemistry lagged behind. All, or nearly all, the develop-
ments of theoretical importance began to come from the organic side.
The history of chemistry from 1830 to 1865 is practically the history of
organic chemistry. I do not mean that research was confined merely
to carbon compounds. The influence of Berzelius continued to be felt,
and men like Heinrich Rose, Wohler, Bunsen and many others made
valuable contributions to inorganic chemistry, as well as several like
Dumas, Liebig, and others, whose reputation rests chiefly on their
organic work. The great inorganic chemists were mostly men of an
analytical rather than synthetical turn of mind. The growth of miner-
alogy led to the discovery of new elements, and the analytical require-
ments to which it, as well as practical chemistry, gave rise conduced
largely to the study of inorganic compounds. The conception of valency,

while due mainly to organic chemistry, owes not a little to inorganic

chemistry, though it did but little to further it. Numerous.atomic
weight determinations of greater or less accuracy were made, some-
times with a purely analytic purpose, sometimes with the object of
testing the validity of Prout’s hypothesis, but these exercised but little
influence on the theoretical growth of inorganic chemistry, which
remained for the most part a mass of unconnected facts.

In considering the causes to which is due the preeminent attention
given to organic chemistry since 1830, the point most to be emphasized
is that at no time since that date has there been lacking a well-defined
working hypothesis of the nature of organic compounds. Not only did
these substances prove eminently susceptible of classification into
types, but, for reasons to be stated later, the transformations discovered
were so numerous, and the possibilities of producing synthetically old
or new compounds, and of working out new theories, were so attractive
that most of the best chemical minds between 1830 and 1865, or even
later, were drawn into organic chemistry. Another important factor
is that of inertia. Most students of nature do not willingly enter upon
entirely new fields of research. The pupils of the great masters of
organic chemistry, Liebig,, Dumas, Hofmann, Wurtz, Kolbe, Kekulé,
and others, found enough to do in following in the footsteps of their
teachers, and were little inclined to seek new pastures. The require-
296 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

ments of candidates for the doctorate, whereby the experimental
material for the dissertation had to be accumulated in a comparatively
short time, led to the assignment of topics with which the instructor
was familiar, and which were fairly sure of giving positive results
within a year or two, and, as we all know, no branch of chemistry
yields results so readily as the study of carbon compounds, with its
highly developed synthetical methods. As the Chemiker-Zeitung has |
recently pointed out, even at the present day the full professorships in
German universities are almost invariably held by organic chemists,
while inorganic chemistry is left to subordinates. The weight of
authority and influence being on the side of organic chemistry, the
student who locks forward to a university career sees that his chances
of promotion are better if he follow the organic rather than the inor-
ganic direction. I need hardly add that the more mercenary hope of
obtaining a new dyestuff or a new remedy, or of replacing nature in
making an alkaloid, has also been a powerful incentive to many.

Let us now consider some of the reasons which have their root in the
chemical peculiarities of carbon, and which render its compounds, at
least those which are not too complex, comparatively easy to study.
These conditions are not peculiar to carbon, but no other element, as
far as is known, presents as many of them at the same time.

1. Carbon compounds being very generally soluble in neutral solvents,
frequently crystalline, and often volatile without decomposition at
comparatively low temperatures, are peculiarly adapted to separation
in a state of purity by fractional crystallization or distillation, and for
the same reason it is usually possible to determine their true molecular
weights. The very general possession of melting or boiling points
lying within easily observable ranges of temperature greatly facilitates
identification.

2. The power of carbon of uniting, atom to atom, to form chains, the
form and size of which can be easily regulated by known synthetic
methods, and the stability of which is sufficient to allow of manipula-
tion under easily attainable conditions, is a marked peculiarity of this
element. This, with the power of forming stable compounds with
hydrogen, is the basis of the definition of organic chemistry as “the
chemistry of the hydrocarbons and their derivatives.” With regard to
selflinking power, the other elements are in marked contrast. We
know with certainty no compounds in which two atoms of boron are
linked, not more than four nitrogen atoms have been arranged tandem,
while of silicon, the nearest relative of carbon, we know at best a half
dozen well-defined compounds with two atoms of this element in series,
and but one with three; analogues of the hydrocarbons are unknown,
with the exception of silico methane, and the instability of this is
sufficient proof that a series of silicon paraffins would be most difficult
to prepare, and the same would apply to all classes of silicon compounds
in which self-linking is a prerequisite. It does not appear probable that
THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 297

“we Shall ever have a very extensive chemistry of the ‘‘ hydrosilicons
and their derivatives.” Among the compounds of other elements self-
linkage occurs in but few cases and is limited in extent.

3. It is a highly important property of carbon compounds that their
molecules tend to preserve their individuality; they generally do not,
though there are exceptions, spontaneously avail themselves of oppor-
tunities for condensation, whether by polymerization or by union of
two or more molecules with separation of water or ammonia. The so-
ealled double and triple union between carbon atoms only exception-
ally leads to spontaneous polymerization, while with silicon this latter
is apparently the rule. The important carbonyl group, C—O, the char-
acteristic group of organic acids, aldehydes, and ketones, shows but
little tendency to polymerize, while organic hydroxyl compounds are
usually stable and do not spontaneously give rise to ethers or acid
anhydrides. The silicon analogue of carbonyl, Si==O, on the contrary,
appears to polymerize with great ease. The ethers of carbonic acid
are well known, but the metasilicic ethers, those of the type SiO (OR),,
appear to exist only as polymers. The silicic acids, too, show a marked
tendency to condense by dehydration and pass spontaneously into
complex bodies. It is easy to see what would have been the result if
carbon behaved like silicon. Instead of the innumerable sharply
defined organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, each produced
by a definite synthetic process, each reaction would give rise to an
almost inextricable mixture of condensation products, carbon dioxide
would be a solid like silica, and organic chemistry would be scarcely
further advanced than is the chemistry of silicon. This tendency of
carbon compounds to simplicity in reaction, each molecule acting as if
it were alone present, has been, therefore, an important, factor in
facilitating the growth of organic chemistry.

4. Another feature of carbon which plays an important part is the
ease with which intermediate or transition products can be formed.
It is much easier to limit react.ons in the case of carbon compounds
than in others. Compare, for example, the action of chlorine on CH,
and SiH,.

5. The tendency to dissociation, both hydrolytic and electrolytic, is
in general less marked among carbon compounds, whence it is easier to
control the course of a reaction and to exclude changes of a sponta-
neous nature. Finally, the carbon compounds show but little tendency
to the formation of so-called molecular addition products, of which the
metal-ammonias, the double salts and the compounds with water of
crystallization are examples, the rational interpretation of which is
difficult.

A full consideration of the peculiarities of carbon which have facili-
tated the synthesis of such vast-numbers of organic compounds would
be beyond the scope of this address. The above are the most impor-
tant, and their relative absence in the majority of elements explains
298 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

largely the backward state of our knowledge of them. Our inability -
to determine the true molecular weight of insoluble and nonvolatile
substances; the difficulty of limiting reactions so as to obtain interme-
diate products; of preventing condensations; of separating mixtures
and identifying their constituents by such simple methods as melting
and boiling-point determinations; of building up step by step; of dis-
secting atom by atom; of explaining molecular compounds—these are
hindrances which can only be overcome by greater perfection of our
experimental methods, and which often render the study of the consti-
tution of inorganic bodies a problem of great difficulty, even in the
case of many of the simplest.

At the very time that the organic structural formula was beginning
to turn the attention of organic chemists away from a further develop-
mentof theory to a greater elaboration of details the Englishman New-
lands was publishing papers which contained the germ of the Periodic
Law. In 1865 Kekulé announced his theory of the benzene ring; in-
1864 Newlands showed that if the elements be arranged in the order of
their atomic weights ‘“‘the eighth element, starting from a given one, is
_a kind of repetition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in
music.” The discovery of Newlands of a fact which later developed
into the Periodic Law does not, however, mark the beginning of a new
direction in chemical thought. It marks rather that point in a long
series of speculations at which chemists were beginning to grasp an
idea after which they had been groping blindly for many years, the
conception that the elements are not wholly unrelated bodies, but that
there is some definite law connecting their properties with their atomic
weights. Beginning in 1815, with the claim of Prout that the atomic
weights of the elements are multiples of that of hydrogen, which led
him to suggest that hydrogen is the primitive element from which the
others are built up, we find numerous speculations, some devoted
merely to finding arithmetical relations among the atomic weights, such
as the law of triads, others attempting to show how the elements could
be built up from one or more primitive constituents. Most of these
did not lead to any marked advance of chemical theory, but Prout’s
hypothesis found very able defenders and greatly encouraged accurate
atomic-weight determinations. The labors of Dumas, Marignac, and
especially of Stas, in this field, are directly due to the desire to test
the validity of Prout’s suggestion. Up to 1860 not only were the
atomic weights uncertain to within a few decimals, but, for other
reasons, even the relative position of the elements in an ascending
series was often uncertain; our present empirical formulas had not
been fully established; it was uncertain, for instance, whether water
was HO with O=8 or H,O with O—16, or whether silica was SiO, with
Si—28 or $810; with Si—21. So when Gladstone, in 1853, arranged the
elements in the order of ascending atomic weights he failed to perceive
any noteworthy relation. Nine years later the French engineer and
THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 299

geologist de Chancourtois, using the newer and now adopted atomic
weights, arranged the elements in a spiral or helical form around a
cylinder, in ascending order, and was led to the conclusion that the
“properties of bodies are properties of the numbers,” a vague state-
ment of the now familiar phrase that the properties of the elements are
functions of their atomic weights. As already mentioned, he was
followed closely by Newlands, whose work, however, met with but
slight recognition. Time is wanting to show how, in the period 1864—
1869 the Periodic Law was developed by the labors of Newlands, and
more especially of Lothar Meyer and Mendelejeff, working independ-
ently. It affords an interesting example of how a great idea is devel-
oped about the same time in the minds of several men working
independently and unknown to each other. In 1871 Mendelejeff pub-
lished a table which shows the Periodic Law essentially as we find it
to-day, the only changes consisting in the addition of a few newly
discovered elements and in placing a few of the older elements in their
proper positions, as a result of more accurate atomic weight determi-
nations.

The period 1863-1870 was, therefore, of the greatest importance for

-Inorganic chemistry, aS it saw the development of the idea that the

properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic weights.
The time which has since elapsed has been even more fruitful than any
previous period in speculations, having for their object the finding of
mathematical relations between the atomic weights and in theories of
the evolution of matter from one or two primal constituents. Many
modifications of the periodic scheme have been devised, but they pre-
sent but few or no advantages over the simple arrangement of Men-
delejeff and Lothar Meyer. The great fact still remains, unmodified and
unimproved, that if the elements be arranged in the order of increasing

atomic weights there is a recurrence of the properties of elements lower

in the scale—in short, that these properties are periodic functions of
the atomic weights.

The discovery of the new group of inert gases, helium, neon, argon,
and xenon, with perhaps krypton and metargon, has not modified our
idea of the Periodic Law essentially. They appear to fit well into the
system, and it is now only remarkable that their existence was not
surmised by Mendelejeff, who so successfully predicted several then
unknown elements. Although the periodic system is even to-day the
object of attack by a few chemists, who appear. to be blinded by its
unquestioned defects to the obvious truths which it expresses, it may
be safely said that the great central fact of the periodicity in the prop-

erties of the elements is just as firmly established as the law of gravi-

tation, and that, whatever modifications may have to be made in the
scheme as a whole, this central fact will never be done away with.
The atomic theory may be supplanted by something better, but its
successor will equally have to take account of the stoichiometrical
300 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

relations of the elements, which are based not on theory, but on obser-
vation pure and simple, and it is on these, and not on the atomic
theory, that the Periodic Law is based.

The Periodic Law is exerting a stimulating influence on inorganic
chemistry in various ways. It is leading to a more careful study of
all the elements, with the object of discovering further analogies; new
compounds are being prepared and old ones studied better with this
in view; new kinds of periodicity are being sought for in physical as
well as in chemical properties. The question of the nature of the rare
earth metals, the asteroids of the elementary system, as Crookes calls
them, is being attacked with greater energy. Are these, of which
Crookes claims there are thirty or perhaps sixty, capable of being
fitted into the system as it now exists? Must we modify it in order
to take them in, or do they represent certain exceptional phases
of the evolution of matter from the original protyl, or different very
stable modifications on allotropic forms of a few elements? Do
the blanks within the system represent existing but as yet undis-
covered elements? Do some of them correspond to hypothetical
elements, which for some unknown reason are incapable of existence,
like many organic compounds which are theoretically possible, but
which, if momentarily existing, lapse at once into other forms, or must
the scheme be so modified as to exclude them? These are some of the
questions raised by the Periodic Law which it belongs to the inorganic
chemist to solve. Most important of all is the question of the cause of
the periodicity. Before we can hope to establish a mathematical and
possibly a genetic relation between a series of numbers, such as the
atomic weights and the chemical properties of the elements, we must
establish with greater accuracy than heretofore the precise magnitude
of these numbers; and it is this that an ever increasing number of
atomic-weight chemists is striving to do. The question of the unity
of matter is one to a solution of which we are no nearer than ever, and
the Peroidic Law in its present form does not afford a proof, or, I
think, even a presumption in favor of a genetic relation between the
elements. It is quite conceivable that we may have relations of prop-
erties without a common origin. With ever increasing accuracy we
seem to be removing further and further from the possibility of any
hypothesis like that of Prout. The electric furnace, with its tempera-
ture of 3,500° C., gives not a sign of the decomposition or transforma-
tion of the elements.. These questions and the query why we know
no elements below hydrogen or above uranium, why the number of
the elements is limited, and why there are not as many kinds of matter
as there are different wave-lengths of light—all these seem to belong
as yet to a scientific dreamland rather than to the realm of legitimate
research, yet their solution, if possible at all, will be accomplished
only by the labors of the inorganic chemist.

Let us now turn to the more special consideration of the questions of
THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 301

the constitutional formulas of inorganic compounds. The more con-
servative organic chemists have always been careful to state that-the
so-called structural formulas are reaction formulas merely; that is, that
they are not intended to express the actual relations of the atoms
in the molecule, but are merely convenient schemes for rendering pos-
sible reactions visible to the eye. Probably most chemists regard them
as more than this, as actual diagrammatic representations of the way
in which the atoms are combined. ‘The formula of marsh gas, for
example, ;
H

|
H—C—H,

|
H

is regarded as more than a visualizing of its chemical properties; it
implies that the carbon atom is an actual physical link between the
hydrogen atoms, which are combined directly with the carbon but
not with each other. Stereochemical formulas are confessedly more
than reaction formulas, and the steric conception of the so-called double
and triple union asserts that these actually exist in the sense the words
imply, and are not merely names for unknown conditions.

Many of the simpler organic structural formulas unquestionably have
an enormous mass of evidence in their favor, but many others we must
be on our guard against taking too seriously, and must for the present
regard as nothing more than reaction formulas. That we can regard
any of them as well established is due, more than to anything else,
to the almost invariably constant tetravalency of the carbon atom.
Unfortunately, the valency of many of the elements entering into the
composition of inorganic compounds appears to be extremely variable
and uncertain, and this has greatly impeded the study of the structure
of these bodies. The inorganic chemist has been far too prone to
assume that the structural theories of the organic chemist are of uni-
versal applicability, and, having once for all attributed a certain
valency to an element, has been often content with devising structural
formulas which have no better claim to recognition than that all the
so-assumed bonds are “satisfied.” At other times a particular valency
has been assumed for no other reason than that it enabled him to con-
trive a formula for the special case under consideration. The books
treating of such matters frequently exhibit wonderfully ingenious inor-
ganic structural formulas which are wholly devoid of a reasonable
amount of experimental evidence and which are, therefore, often noth-
ing but purerubbish. With many inorganic chemists, formula worship
has degenerated into fetishism. Let us consider a few examples. For
“nitric acid, one of the simplest and most familiar inorganic compounds,
several constitutional formulas may be written, in which the hydrogen
is directly united to the nitrogen or separated from it by one or two
302 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

oxygen atoms, and in which nitrogen may be either tri- or pentavalent.
Some of these are given in the books as if they were gospel truth.
Briihl, who has investigated the question by physical methods, sug-
gests that the hydrogen atom is not directly united to any part of the
NO, radical, but is rotating around it and possibly combined with each
oxygen atom in succession, a view approaching that of Werner. There
are at least five formulas proposed for this simple acid. For the
familiar potassium chloroplatinate, K,PtCl;, there are four constitu-
tional formulas seriously advocated at present. It may be K,=PtCk,
with octavalent platinum;

KO=Ore
Ko1=—c1? Pte,

with tetravalent platinum and trivalent chlorine, as required by Rem-
sen’s theory; (PtCl;)K, in the sense of Werner’s theory, the two potas-
sium atoms being combined with the PtCl, as a whole, or it may be a
molecular compound in which two molecules KCl as wholes combine
with PtCl, as a whole. The formulas suggested for most minerals are
pure guesswork. The silicates are usually written as if containing the
group Si=O, by analogy with carbonyl, C=O, yet there is not a single
silicate in which this assumption rests on any experimental evidence,
and the little we do actually know of the chemical behavior of silicon
speaks against it. Such formulas, if not purely speculative ana devoid
of all basis and all value, as they frequently are, at best do not repre-
sent structure in the sense that the best established organic formulas
do: they are at most reaction formulas only, or they represent partial
molecules, in the same way that CH may stand for benzene (C,H¢) or
HPO; for a metaphosphoric acid. 'The attempt to interpret the double
salts and halides, the compounds with water of crystallization or
hydration, the metal-ammonias, the peculiar compounds of the zeolites
described by Friedel, and other so-called molecular compounds, in the
sense of the valence hypothesis, seems almost hopeless without taking .
such liberties with it as to render it nearly useless, and without making
assumptions of very narrow and limited applicability. One may well
question whether this hypothesis must not be very considerably quali-
fiea before it can be taken as the basis of a general theory of the
structure of inorganic compounds.

One of the most striking indications of a revival of inorganic chem-
istry is the recent attempt of Werner to break away from the bonds of
the organic structure theory as applied to inorganic compounds and to
establish a more general theory in which valency plays a comparatively
insignificant role. The arguments on which Werner’s hypothesis is
founded are too numerous and elaborate to be presented here. Suffice
it to say that it was primarily based on that peculiar class of bodies
known as the metal-ammonias, consisting of metallic salts, combined
with usually six or four molecules of ammonia, and in which the ammonia
THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. aUG

may be wholly or in part replaced by pyridine, water, acid radicals, and
other groups. These groups are supposed to be arranged symmetric-
ally about the metallic atom, forming a radical, which, according to
its nature, can combine as a ichole with metals, halogens, or other
positive or negative groups. Thus, in the compound CO(NH;);Cl,,
cobalt forms with NH; a radical, which combines as a whole with the
three chlorine atoms; in (PtCl];)K, the two potassium atoms are com-
bined with the whole group PtCl, and not attached to any one part of
it; the same applies to (NH,)Cl, and to K,(SO,) and K,(FeCN).. In
the formation of these radicals the bivalent NH, the neutral HO, and
the univalent Cl can replace each other indiscriminately; the valence
theory is, therefore, practically thrown overboard entirely and in place

of combination by bonds we have an extension of the old theory of

molecular compounds applicable alike to the metal-ammonias, the
ordinary oxygen salts, the double halides, and the compounds with
water of crystallization. Itis yet too soon to predict the future of this

- hypothesis, which has already won numerous active adherents. It is

scarcely too much to hope that it will lead, perhaps with some modifica-
tions and extensions, to a more comprehensive theory of structure, and
to a clearer definition of the as yet only vague conception of valency.
It is the broadest generalization of inorganic chemistry since the dis-
covery of the Periodic Law, and shows that inorganic chemists are no
longer willing to be mere imitators and to close their eyes to the exist-
ence of whole groups of bodies which do not tally with current theories,
and are beginniiig to see that in these is to be sought the key to a
broader inorganic chemistry.

The slow development of inorganic chemistry during the period from

1830 to 1865, as compared with that of organic chemistry, was due, as

has been seen, in part to the greater breadth and greater diversity of the
field, to the relative absence of leading ideas and leading motives, and to
the comparative tractability of carbon compounds as compared with
inorganic compounds under the restrictions of the experimental methods
in vogue. Prout’s hypothesis and allied speculations gave a working
hypothesis for a limited number of investigators, but the uncertainty
of the atomic weights, which in part was conditioned by the imperfec-
tion of analytical methods, prevented any satisfactory results being
reached. Absolute purity of materials and absolute accuracy of analyt-
ical methods are not of the first importance to the organic chemist, to
whom errors of one or two points in the first decimal dre seldom of any
significance. To the atomic-weight chemist, on the contrary, accuracy
is the very first point to be considered; not only must his material be
absolutely free from impurities, but his methods must be beyond
criticism, and it is only with the increasing perfection of analytical
methods, admitting not only of quantitative determinations of the
greatest accuracy, but also of the detection of traces of impurities
which for ordinary purposes are negligible. that this kind of work has
304 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

offered inducements to a large number of workers. The long-wanting
leading idea or motive has been in large part furnished by the Periodic
Law. The comparison of the chemical and physical properties of the
elements and their compounds, the search for new elements, the fuller
investigation of those already known, with the view of more firmly
establishing their place in the system, and the redetermination of the
atomic weights, are evidence of its influence. Witness, for example,
the great activity in the subject of the rare earths, the work on the
relative position of nickel and cobalt in the system, and the investi-
gations of the atomic weight of tellurium, having for their object the
decision of the question whether this element actually has an atomic
weight greater than that of iodine, as the best determinations thus far
seem to indicate, or whether it is less, as its chemical analogy to sulphur
and selenium requires.

Organic chemistry, with its limited range of temperature, is essen-
tially a chemistry of the beaker, the Liebig condenser, and the bomb
oven; it demands but comparatively simple and cheap apparatus of
glass, not calculated to withstand high temperatures, and as sueh is
within the means of the humblest laboratory. The reverence of the
organic chemist for the platinum crucible is something astounding.
With improvements in apparatus for producing and materials for
resisting high temperatures, new vistas have opened to the inorganic
chemist, while the province of the organic chemist, limited as it is by
the instability of his compouuds, has. derived no benefit therefrom.
Not only do we owe to this the beautiful investigations of Victor Meyer
and otherson high-temperature vapor densities, but with the recent
development of electrical technology the electric furnace has appeared,
and with it a new chemistry, the chemistry of a temperature of 3,500°
C. Not only have new compounds been made which can not be pro-
duced at lower temperatures, but the accessibility of many elements
and compounds has been greatiy increased. The reductions which
Wohler and Deville effected gram-wise in glass and porcelain tubes
can now be earried out in the electric furnace pound-wise and even
ton-wise. The manipulation of the current for electrolytic purposes,
rendered possible by increased knowledge of the laws of electricity,
as well as by ease of its production, is yielding results chiefly in the
domain of inorganic chemistry, while the organic chemist is but tardily
utilizing the current as a means of oxidation and reduction. Besides
the extraordinary development of electro-metallurgy, the preparation
of soda and chlorates and other technical processes, the application of
electricity to purposes of analysis and for the synthesis of new com-
pounds, such as the rare metal alums, perearbonic and persulphurie
acids, and the isolation of fluorine, may be mentioned.

Passing to the opposite extreme of temperature, we find the develop-
ment of high-temperature chemistry accompanied by the growth of a
chemistry ot low temperatures, The very recent improvements in the
THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY. 305

art of producing cold have made liquid air a cheap material, and with

its aid Ramsay has been able to fractionally distil liquefied argon and
to separate from it the contaminating elements of the same group, neon
and xenon, as well as krypton and metargon.

The part played by the spectroscope in chemistry is more or less
familiar to everyone. From the further development of the science of

spectroscopy it is clear that inorganic chemistry has much to gain.

Whether or not the view first suggested by Clarke and long defended
by Lockyer be true, that the elements undergo partial decomposition
in the stars and nebule, it is upon this instrument that we must rely
for our knowledge of the high-temperature chemistry of these bodies, a
chemistry which is wholly inorganic.

The rapid growth of these sciences into which chemistry enters is
producing an ever increasing demand upon the chemist for new
researches. While the biologist must rely mainly on the organic
chemist for his chemical data, no less must the mineralogist and geolo-
gist appeal to the inorganic chemist for the solution of many problems
in their field. The formation and decomposition of minerals, the dis-
integration of rocks, the behavior of rock magmas, the phenomena of
metamorphism, of ore deposition and vein formation, the influence of
high temperatures and pressures—all these afford problems the solution
of which is hopeless without the assistance of inorganic chemistry either
alone or aided by physical chemistry. The chemist who has to meet
the inquiries of the geologist, and who must too often confess our
ignorance of the causes of even the simplest phenomena, can not help
feeling what a splendid field is here open, awaiting only the advent of
workers suitably trained and of laboratories properly equipped for
research in chemical geology. The demands of the geologists are
unquestionably destined to be among the most Bowen f factors in the
revival of inorganic chemistry.

It is not to be expected, nor is it to be desired, that inorganic chem-
istry will at once sweep organic chemistry from its position of preémi-
nence. The causes to which this is due may outlast our generation, but
that the inorganic tide is rising, and that this branch will finally attain
its due position, can not be doubted. The recent establishment of a
Zeitschrift fiir anorganische Chemie, while it may be deplored as
increasing the already too great number of chemical journals, and as
tending to widen rather than diminish the gap between the organic
and inorganic branches, is helping to produce a feeling of solidarity
among inorganic chemists which never existed hitherto. Even in Ger-
many, the stronghold of organic chemistry, the address of van’t Hoff is
exciting wide interest, and the Chemiker-Zeitung, in urging the estab-
lishment of independent chairs and laboratories of inorganic chemistry,
is advocating what will in time unquestionably be realized.

Inorganic chemistry is fortunate in that its renaissance is coming
about at a time when physical methods arein vogue. The prediction of

SM 98——20
306 THE REVIVAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY.

Du Bois-Reymond is being realized; with the aid of physies it is attain-
ing an insight into the dynamical aspect of the science which it could
never have reached unassisted. But it is not alone by supplying new
methods and suggesting new points of view that physics is aiding the
revival of inorganic chemistry. Perhaps equally important is the fact
that the rising school of physical chemists, unhampered by the tradi-
tions and limitations of organic chemistry, is finding if necessary to
explore the whole range of the science in search of material for its
investigations. The physical chemist is neither organic nor inorganic,
or rather he is either, according to his requirements, but it is precisely
because the inorganic field is wider and less developed than the organic
that his demands are more likely to be productive of activity.

Energetics is now the basis of chemistry, and it is to be expected,
therefore, that inorganic chemistry will not, in the future, have to pass
through a period of arrested development and formula worship, such
as have so long affected organic chemistry. There will always be com-
pound makers, but their aim will be, not the establishment of constitu-
tional formulas alone, but the study of the laws of chemical energy and
the solution of the problem of the nature of matter. We may expect,
too, that the still sharp line of demarcation between inorganic and
organic chemistry and between dead and living matter will disappear.
The inorganic chemist may not affect the synthesis of a proteid, but he
will be able, with his wider knowledge, to contribute more to the
solution of the problem of the nature of life than any amount of struc-
turizing and synthesizing alone can do. To comprehend life we must
understand carbon, but we can no more fully comprehend carbon with-
out an understanding of the other elements than we can explain the
earth without a knowledge of the other planets, or man without a
knowledge of the fish. He, then, who pursues inorganic chemistry is
not only contributing to a higher development of our science than can -
be reached by the study of carbon compounds alone, but is perhaps
doing as much as the organic chemist toward realizing one of the
greatest aims of research—the comprehension of life and its explana-
tion in terms of physical science.
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING|!
By Rev. JoHN M. Bacon.

The story runs that early in the eighties of last century two young
gentlemen in Paris were trying to make a paper bag float in the air by
filling it with smoke, in which attempt they met with extremely limited
‘success. Kindling light fuel in a tin plate and holding the bag above,
the latter became distended and bouyant until removed from the flame,
when it promptly collapsed. This experiment, however, was witnessed
by their housekeeper, who coming into the room at the moment, naively
asked the young philosophers why they did not tie the tin on at the
bottom.

That old lady deserved undying fame. Her idea it was that launched
the first balloon into space; yet her name is lost to history. Such is
the way of fate. Columbus discovered America, yet the name of the
new world was borrowed from a man who remained at home and wrote
a book. Anyway, it is a fact that the Mongolfiers are credited with
the invention of the hot-air balloon, and to their perseverance certainly
is due the first successful step in aeronautics.

A machine to float in the air was from this time an accomplished fact.
The world was electrified. No sooner had the first adventurers reached
the clouds than everyone indulged in extravagant speculations as to
the wealth of new knowledge that was thought to be brought within
reach. A new kingdom. had been discovered, boundless and unfath-
omed, and heaven itself had been almost taken by storm. Man had
yet to be taught that he could penetrate but a very little way into
these new realms and live, and that he was powerless even to guide his
course. A few stubborn tacts were learned, a few brave lives were
lost, and then soon some sort of scientific HG! system alle investigation
was set on foot.

In the first years of the present century the Emperor of Russia bade
one Professor Robertson to go up and determine many things. He
was to discover how the magnetic needle behaved at a great height;
how much electric matter existed there; how a prism would act; how
a bird would fly; with many other such inquiries, which, however, led
to no results of value.

308 SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING.

The like task of rudimentary research was now transferred to France,
but with more method, and Gay Lussac: got up into regions not less
than 4 miles above the earth, where, among other things, he bottled off
air, and bringing it down to his laboratory, examined and declared it
unaltered. About this time, also, some meteorological observations of
interest were carried out during ascents which were creditable if only
for the altitudes attained. But the crowning enterprise of this period
was the famous Nassau voyage of the immortal three who in the year
1836 made a night journey from London to the heart of Germany by an
untried way, and in the face of such risks and chances as of their kind
had never before been confronted.

The undertaking was due to the enterprise of the leader, Mr. Robert
Hollond, its successful issue to the skill of an aeronaut, Mr. Charles.
Green, while the record of the night’s adventure is graphically recorded
by the chronicler of the party, Mr. Monck-Mason. Doubtless aerial
navigation received a great impetus from an exploit of such daring, and
it will be hardly out of place to give one example of such incidents as
the night brought with it, which will serve to show the lack of experi-
ence and knowledge of the craft then existing.

It was about’3.30 in the early morning when their balloon, which had
recently been lightened by a discharge of ballast, was suddenly found
to have attained the unexpected height of 12,000 feet. At the same
moment, while all around was wrapped in the very darkness and still-
ness of death, just above them came the sound of an explosion, followed
by the rustling of the silk, and a moment later the car received a
violent jerk. The party held their breath, while the same thing hap-
pened a second and a third time, and then all was still. At this
they were seized with the conviction that away up in that awful region,
in the dead of night, the balloon had burst and that they were falling
headlong to the earth. The explanation, unknown to them at the time,
was this: When flying low the balloon had contracted and elongated,
and its moisture-laden net must have frozen round it hard as Steel.
Then on its rising and swelling out again into its globular shape, the
frozen ropes had bent to their new position with a crack and a bang,
and jerked the car in so doing.

No real mishap occurred, the famous voyage being as successful as
it was daring; avd from that time onwards we may transfer our sole
attention to English enterprise, and in particular to the famous career
presently to be borne in partnership by Messrs. Glaisher and Coxwell.

If Tennyson was a born poet, Coxwell was born an aeronaut. He
could not exist in any other path of life, and in the very face of fortune
quickly took first rank in his profession; while Mr. Glaisher, from early
years a trained observer and blessed with a zeal and perseverance sel-
dom equaled, literally threw his life into ballooning ventures in the
cause of science. His review of the task he undertook, its difficulties,
and at the same time its possibilities, is a commentary on his working
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING. 309

years. He speaks of the realm of air, his future hunting ground, as
the “great laboratory of changes which contain the germ of future
discoveries open to the chemist and meteorologist, as teaching the rela-
tion to life of different heights, and as holding within its nameless

Shores a thousand discoveries to be developed in the hands of physi-

cists.” We shall have occasion repeatedly to refer to his methods and
the harvest of results secured by his researches.

A word should here be said as to the capabilities of a balloon as a
eraft to navigate the sky, and it should be remarked that Mr. Glaisher
himself was fully persuaded of the futility of any self-contained mode
of steering. A vast amount of ingenuity and speculation had been
bestowed upon this problem, which, experimenters had failed to see,
admits of no solution. It is easy to understand how theorists might
start on false premises and entertain conceptions that were hopeless of
fulfillment. A bird flies at will through the air, a fish directs its own
course in the stream; hence it was urged that a balloon should be
capable of guidance. The essential point overlooked was the radical
difference between a creature endowed with enormous natural powers
of propulsion relative to its size and an inert balloon in the nature of
which the application of adequate mechanical power is an impos-
sibility.

Let us examine the two cases. A salmon impelled by the exigen-
cies of nature will swim for miles against the force of a mountain
stream, and even leaping the waterfall will stem and struggle through
the very torrent falling headlong from above. But conceive the fish’s
bulk compelled to assume the spherical form of a balloon and the
creature at once acquires an irresistible tendency to gyrate, while to
proceed in any way different from the rate and direction of the stream
would need its muscular exertion increased a hundredfold. On the
other hand, conceive a balloon of given capacity built on the lines of
a fish, and a moment’s consideration will show that you have then
only a perfectly unwieldy craft of inordinate length, and, on the very

face of it, more completely than ever at the mercy of the wind. Given

a balloon poised and in dead calm, and theoretically the aeronaut could
propel it in any direction by the mere aid of a lady’s fan, but ‘‘ when
the breezes blow” the machine becomes simply an integral part of the
general drift, like the leaf in the stream, and is hurried onward
literally on the wings of the wind. It needs no pointing out that a
ship under sail bears no analogy soever to a free balloon. The ship is
propelled by the motion of the air, while it is held under control and
guidance by the restraint of the water; but furnish a balloon with
both sails and rudder and, freely in the wind, it is obvious that the
first will add nothing to its speed, and the second will in no way affect
its course.

In the one case only of when a balloon is flying so low that a trail
rope can be made to drag on the ground, it can be and has. been made
310 SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING.

subject to some measure of guidance. The objections, however, to
thus retarding the balloon’s motion and of fettering it to earth are
obvious, to say nothing of the consequences liable to ensue when such
a method of procedure is adopted across private property.

The only direction in which we may look for any true navigation of
the air would seem to lie in the construction of aeroplanes, or floating ~
machines, operated by engines of great power and relatively extremely
small weight. Until such an engineering fact may have been accom-
plished the attention of aeronauts must be chiefly devoted to the study
of air currents, and the force and drift of prevalent winds, and with
regard to this a great deal of important information is already to hand
which should be duly noted.

As far back as 1840 Mr. Charles Green, of whose skill as an
aeronaut we have already spoken, gave it as the result of his expe-_
rience, gained in 275 ascents, that, under all circumstances, “at a
certain elevation, varying occasionally, but always within 10,000 feet
of the earth, a current from the west, or rather from the north of
west, invariably prevailed.” Indeed, so firmly impressed was he with
the correctness of his observation in this respect that he proposed to
attempt a balloon flight from America to England, in which he was
confident of success. A very few years later we find Mr. Wise, the
then equally famous aeronaut on the other side of the Atlantic, seek-
ing with like confidence to put the same project into effect.

But, naturally, where such constant winds prevail there must be
compensating currents found elsewhere, and in actual fact at varying
heights; but within a very few miles of the earth currents are often
to be met with blowing from every quarter in the heavens.

It was during the memorable Nassau voyage already mentioned that
Mr. Green turned his knowledge of such currents to account in a
remarkable manner. Night was coming on apace, and after passing
Canterbury with the sea close ahead it was noticed that their balloon
had come under the influence of a change of wind that would bear it
out to the German Ocean. But their skipper had already mapped out
the drift of accessible currents, and consequently rose to the height he
deemed needful, with the result that he at once regained his due
course. Mr. Monck-Mason writes of this that ‘nothing could exceed
the beauty of the maneuver or the success with which the balloon
acknowledged its influence.”

A very similar experience befell the present writer during the past
summer in a scientific excursion made in company with Dr. R. Lachlan.
The ascent took place in the sheltered grounds of the Crystal Palace,
where the true force and direction of the wind could not well be esti-
mated, but at a few thousand feet a moderate current was reached
making steadily for the southeast. After a while, however, on descend-
ing near the ground for a few moments over Bromley, and again
rapidly ascending, the balloon was found considerably out of her course,
< UC

but again took the former direction due to the higher current. After
three hours the coast of Sussex was sighted fast approaching, and it
became a question in the mind of the aeronaut, Mr. Percival Spencer,
whether it would be practicable to cross the channel, The project was
eventually abandoned, but not until the outskirts of Hastings were
reached, and the old part of the town lay right ahead, stretching down
to the bare cliff. At this point, therefore, it might have seemed impos-
sible to avoid either descending on the house tops or being carried out
to sea. The altitude was over 8,000 feet when Mr. Spencer first pulled
the valve rope, and the houses were already vertically underneath. The
descent not being rapid, the balloon still sped seaward until it neared
the forest of chimney stacks around. Here, however, it was caught
by a breeze blowing stiffly from the west, and rapidly clearing the town
was brought to earth in Fairlight Glen. The stratagem was simply a
display of perfect judgment on the part of the aeronaut, who, noting
and calculating accurately the ground current, had piloted his craft to
a convenient spot which he had fixed on from nearly 2 miles high.

As may be presumed the depth of different currents varies vastly,
but it is very common to meet with a change of direction before the
first thousand feet is reached. Since, then, such fluctuations are all
important, and also all primarily due to relative temperatures, it
becomes the first care of the scientific aeronaut to record continuously
all changes of temperature observed at different heights, on different

‘days, and at all hours of the day and night. For, regulated by such

differences of temperature, seen or unseen columns of warm moist air,
or mist, will constantly rise off valleys, or woods, or crops, while return
supplies of cooler air will filter down to earth from above, and in this
way a remarkable condition of the atmosphere, which needs to be
investigated to be fully realized, may be brought about.

Late in the evening and far on into the night the explorer of the
upper regions may encounter, at varying and uncertain heights, tracts
of warm and genial air whose existence could not be detected from
below, or, indeed, from any observations made on mountain slopes.
Mr. Glaisher gives an interesting experience of an ascent of some
6,000 feet which he made over verdant Surrey, on a late May evening
just before sunset, and repeated again immediately after sunset.
Starting on the second ascent at ten minutes past 8 the temperature
was 54°, and on his ascending this steadily declined, but not so rapidly
as in the ascent prior to sunset, so that at the height of 6,200 feet the
temperature, though only 35°, was 6° warmer than it had been three-
quarters of an hour previously. On descending to 4,500 feet, however,
it had increased to 37°, from which point it went up by leaps and
bounds, registering 47° at 1,500 feet and 54° at 900 feet, below which
height it again declined till earth was reached.

In a night ascent at the end of September the present writer
recorded similar, though somewhat more changeful, observations.
312 SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING.

Leaving the earth at 9.30, the temperature rose rapidly up to 500 feet,
at which elevation a colder stratum was encountered. In another hun-
dred feet warmer air was again met with, after which a second and a
third cold stratum was found and passed, beyond which the air grew
sensibly warmer, reaching 50° at 6,000 feet, that is, some 15° higher,
probably, than the earth temperature at that moment.

The question, then, here arises, Do warmer layers exist above as
true strata, or are there rather, floating aloft and all unseen, detached
masses of a warmer air, which, if visible, would resemble a mottled, or
patchy, or stratified sky? This point will be discussed later in relation
to certain phenomena of sound.

It is clear, however, that though the diurnal rise and fall—the
vertical ebb and flow, as it were —of atmospheric currents near the
earth’s surface is a most important factor demanding thorough exami-
nation, it is yet more needful to trace, by all means available, the
vaster and more general lateral sweeps of the ocean depths above.
Valuable information respecting such winds as play over a large con-
tinent has been gathered from systematic observations made with high
flying kites in America, where confirming those views of aeronauts
already mentioned, it has been found that at considerable elevations
the kites have usually encountered winds blowing from the west while
a daily rotation of shallower winds prevails below. A remarkable
characteristic, moreover, met with is that where the direction of such
winds changes, the change may be perfectly abrupt. It has, indeed,
been recorded by scientific balloonists that they find, in the regions
where winds of different directions pass. that one appears actually to
drag against the surface of the other, as though tolerating no interval
of calm or transition; and yet a more striking fact is that a very
hurricane may brood over a placid atmosphere with a clean-cut surface
of demarcation between calm and storm.

Mr. Whymper, watching an eruption of Cotopaxi from a station 60
miles distant, observed a violent uprush of inky vapor ascend quite
vertically through serene air till, as he judged, it had reached an
altitude of 20,000 feet above the crater, or twice that height above sea
level. At that point it “encountered a powerful wind blowing from
the east, and was rapidly borne toward the Pacific, seeming to spread
very slightly, and presenting the appearance of a gigantic - drawn
upon an otherwise perfectly clear sky. It was then caught by wind
from the north, and, borne toward him, appeared to spread quickly.”

It is not only, however, when winds cross at different heights that
this remarkable close restraint within their own limits is to be noticed.
Even on the same level contrary winds will maintain their distinctive
flow more determinedly than cross currents of water amid stream.
Thus, Mr. Charles Darwin found on mountain heights winds turbulent
and unconfined, yet holding their courses like “rivers within their
beds;” so again the French aeronauts, MM. W. de Fonvielle and
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING. 313

Gaston Tissandier, use almost the same expression in describing “a
warm river which flowed for a whole month over the clouds.”

We may thus draw an outline sketch of the movements of the great
atmospheric ocean, its tides, its streams, and torrents, but a just
examination into its constitution goes further than the consideration
of temperatures and currents. Fully as important as either is the
question of humidity, while no records with which the aeronaut has
had to deal are more curious or more instructive than those that come
under this head.

Going back to the times which witnessed the early exploits previ-
ously mentioned, we find Mr. Monck-Mason formulating a theory
that when rain falls and sky is overcast there will be further cloud
layers above, while on the contrary, when no rain falls and the sky
is overcast, there will be blue sky above. Thirty years later Mr.
Glaisher records an ascent which, while lending confirmation to this
theory, supplies other noteworthy observations. It had been a calm,
brilliant, and promising June morning till noon, when, in a manner
common enough in our summers, clouds had suddenly blown up and
darkened the sky so forbiddingly that a very hasty departure was
made, and, with great lifting power, his balloon rose 4,000 feet in four
minutes. Passing through a cold, damp cloud at that height, he found,
contrary to his expectations, farther clouds above, and at 9,000 feet
the air was full of the sighing of the wind that presages storm. At
that point, however, the sun shone momentarily, encouraging the
belief that clouds would soon be passed. But instead of this the
balloon again ascended into fog mingled with fine rain. The experi-
enced aeronaut and meteorologist now seems to have become fairly
astounded at his results. At 12,000 feet he entered a wet fog, grow-
ing drier at 15,000 feet; then the sun peeped out, and then again
came wet fog. A thousand feet higher the fog was dry. A thousand
feet higher yet the sun once more gleamed for a moment, and then
gave place to fog, growing wetter, but soon passed. At 20,000 feet
dense clouds were still overhead, fringed and watery, while but a
little higher patches of blue sky appeared with floating cirrus far
above.

Contrasting with this may be recorded the register obtained during
the late exceptional summer by the writer in a series of ascents in
afternoon and night hours from the Crystal Palace, from Newbury,
and from Clifton, which showed consistently an almost uniformly dry
and thirsty condition of the atmosphere up to the highest altitude
reached; and where clouds were met with they were fast thinning
away. Wandering cloudlets would wend along and vanish into air,
like the steam of a passing train. There was, however, one notable
exception during an evening in mid-September, when, traversing
Somersetshire at an elevation of 3,000 feet and upward, the air,
though remaining clear as before, had become saturated with a
314 SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING.

moisture unseen and unsuspected, but which proved the true herald
of the short break that immediately after occurred in the hot, dry
season.

A fair indication of the moisture present in a clear heaven may,
perhaps, often be found in the tint of the blue sky—toned to gray in
dry, east winds, pale during continuance of drought, and deep blue
when storms are imminent. However, enough has been said to show
that we must, as a general rule, by no means regard even our clearest
skies aS homogeneous or uniform. Moisture will lie around or above
in pools or shallow seas, and close observation in addition to delicate
instrumental aid is needed to measure even approximately its varying
constitution. But there is a subtler test that now claims our notice,
and which is capable of far greater development than has been accorded
to it. A few records gathered from a long series of observations will
introduce and justify this new division of our subject.

From a high ridge in Berkshire there is occasionally to be heard
the sound of the firing of guns at Aldershot, 30 miles to the eastward.
These guns are chiefly noticed in the summer time, when thére is very
rarely an east wind to help the sound. Occasionally the reports are
mistaken for distant thunder, and thus cause alarm at a time when hay
harvest is in progress. ‘There is, however, a saying in the district that
the ‘‘guns are worse than thunder,” and this because they forecast
not a passing or local storm, but rather the approach of generally
unsettled weather. It is easy to prove that it is a continuity of an
uniform moisture-laden air stretching across that part of the country
that is the cause of the phenomenon. The testimony of seamen and
other trained observers goes to show that homogeneous moist air or
mist is the readiest vehicle of sound; that dry air seldom or never
conveys sound so readily; while an atmosphere of varying density
renders all sound capricious.

From a sheltered quiet lawn the Aldershot guns had not been
noticed all through the late summer until far on in one afternoon in
the middle of August, when their sound rolled out with great dis-
tinctness, the weather to all appearance remaining unchanged and the
barometer standing firm and high. In the night, however, thunder
was heard for some two hours, the first time for many weeks, and in
the morning the guns were heard again more distinctly than before.
In this case sound had been the clearest, and, indeed, the only telltale
of a humid layer of the atmosphere brooding over the countryside.

Arguing, however, by the light of such statistics as have been
given above, there was no proof here of the true condition of the air
at higher elevations; but, as it happened, only three days previously,
the writer, during an aerial trip, had had occasion to note some
remarkable acoustic conditions prevailing aloft. Weather conditions,
as indicated by hot suns and clear skies, by readings of temperature
and pressure, remained, indeed, unchanged, but there had been indi-
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING. 315

cations of disturbance overnight, and at Earl’s Court, for two hours
before closing time, the captive balloon had had to be hauled down.
Still on the day in question there was nothing of a nature unusual
save a fitful, gusty wind, and. perhaps, a feeling of languor in the air.

The ascent was made at 4 p. m. from the Crystal Palace, and the
balloon’s course lay directly over London ata mean height of 4,000 feet.
The thermometer indicated nothing abnormal, there being a fall of
half a dozen degrees in the dry bulb, and an amount of general
moisture, shown by the wet, comparable with that recorded below
previously to starting, only fluctuating constantly within small limits.
One matter of consideration only was remarkable, namely, sound, and
this was noteworthy by its absence. The cheer of the crowd lost its
wonted heartiness, lesser sounds were mute, even whistles forgot their
shrillness, and the raucous rattle of the giant city was reduced to a
mere dull hum. But not till the quiet country to the north of London
was reached did the full measure of acoustical opacity in the atmos-
phere betray itself. This is well tested by means of echo. A
hunting-horn forms a convenient instrument for evoking echoes, and
very frequentiy it is easy to hear the sound of a blast returned to a
balloon across an interval of upward of 2,000 feet. Of course the
nature of the country over which the aeronaut is traveling at the
moment greatly influences the result. The waves of sound recoil from
trees more readily than from fields, most readily of all from the surface
of still water; but days have been found when fields in open country,
irrespective of their character, have clearly responded to the horn,
though lying a full half mile below. There was, then, much significance
in the fact that on the day now being described echoes refused to be
aroused even at the range of a few hundred feet. The explanation
apparently lay in the unequal nature of the medium through which
the sound had to travel. The air was presumably, as it were, broken
up in patches, and barred the passage of sound much as glass when
broker up will impede the passage of light. We may, indeed, conceive
the air to have been invisibly mottled, after the manner, say, of a finely
divided mackerel sky; a transient condition of things, no doubt, and
we apparently see how three days later the moister masses had settled
in a general low-lying layer.

We may here note that Mr. Glaisher’s published statements with
regard to sounds heard from a balloon are interesting and valuable.
He reports that the whistle of a trainis audible at 10,000 feet, the train
itself at 8,200; the bark of a dog at 5,900; shouting of men and women
at 5,000, and soon; but since the writing of that report, atmospheric
refraction and reflection of sound have become established facts. So

_ also the strengthening of sound by resonance; its extinction by inter-

eam

ference, and that curious modification it occasionally undergoes whereby
the same sounds may vary in relative intensity on different days.
No more important inquiry can come within the province of the aero-
316 SCIENTIFIC BALLOOOING.

naut than as to the mode and measure in which his own proper element
conveys the sounds we hear, and mayhap quenches those sounds we
don’t hear. Some avenue of sound through the void below has some-
times admitted, for a moment only, the strains of a band or clang of a
bell, which the next moment has been lost utterly. Sometimes, far
beyond its proper range, some noise from earth has been caught in the
hollow of a cloud, as by a sounding-board, and concentrated loudly
upon the ear of the balloonist. Sometimes an intervening cloud far
down has damped the roar of a train more effectually than even the
mass of a hill has done, when the train had been burrowing through a
tunnel.

In all cases, with one possible exception, sounds heard aloft lose
reverberation. Mr. Whymper describes thunder on the mountain side
as uttering a “ single bang,” so to a voyager in the sky will a gun on
Plumstead Marsh speak with a single yelp. But Professor Tyndall, on
one occasion, convinced himself and those who stood around him that
reverberation could be found in empty air, and that echo can be
returned from an acoustic cloud invisible to the eye. This interesting
point is being investigated by the aeronaut, with results that will
shortly be more complete. Unquestionably the entire physies of the
firmament will shortly have undergone the closest scrutiny, its compo-
sition, the proportion of newly found constituents at highest accessible
elevations, the amount of carbonic acid it holds, the measurements of
its electricity, the condition and character of matter in suspension, the
presence or absence of germs. These are questions all important, and
on which many facts have been amassed, but on which it may be pre-
mature to generalize.

The balloon has now to be recognized as an indispensable observa-
tory. In some ways it affords the student of astronomy and optics
opportunities which can not be gained in any station on earth. The
extraordinary brilliance and steadiness of celestial objects viewed by
optical aid from a balloon 10,000 or 12,000 feet above sea level must
be seen to be realized. Indeed, from half that height the full moon,
regarded through an ordinary field glass, becomes an object intolerable
to gaze upon. But thecase is far otherwise on mountain observatories,
which can not be wholly free from disturbing currents or from that
peculiar stratum of air always and everywhere clinging to earth.

It is obvious, then, how many questions can be dealt with to great
advantage from higher and purer regions. Most important data are
being gathered bearing on refraction as influenced by altitude, by
temperature and humidity. Spectroscopic observations taken from the
earth, and again a few minutes later from some thousands of feet above,
are destined to throw very valuable light on those lines which have
simply a telluric origin. Again, many doubtful observations needing
low powers, and hitherto made from earth, will receive a crucial test
when repeated from above; and rare phenomena, such as a total solar
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING. ole

eclipse or shower of meteors, too often hid from the observer below,
can hardly escape the view of the voyager above the clouds. It is even
reasonable, indeed, to hope that the corona may be photographed
without eclipse.

Some little special training, no doubt, is needed in the observer
himself. He has to grow accustomed to the somewhat cramped
quarters within which he is confined; not less to the novelty of the
situation and to the fact that his observatory seldom remains for a
single moment in any one position. He learns only by experience not
to encumber himself with superfluous apparatus and not to attempt
too much or too varied work on any one voyage. It is noteworthy, too,
how much incongruity is found in the experiences of different indi-
viduals. To one, on ascending, the earth will seem to recede from
beneath and hollow itself out, as it were, into a basin bounded only by
the horizon. To another no optical illusion is noticeable, and the earth,
from all considerable heights, will appear only as a dead level. With
many, but by no means all, aerial travelers, when rapidly ascending
or descending, there may be a certain feeling of distress in the ears,
interfering more or less with the sense of hearing, but transient and
generally relieved by the mere act of swallowing.

On clear days, as higher altitudes are reached, all voyagers will be
conscious of such sensations as are experienced on mountain heights,
the fierce rays of the sun appearing almost capable of blistering the
skin, even though the air grow very sensibly colder. There will be few,
also, who will not own to a great exhilaration of spirits, which renders
the task of concentrating the mind on strict observational work some-
what difficult and irksome. Some striking feature of the shifting pano-
rama, some opening fairy scene in the heavenly glories of cloudland, will
almost irresistibly divert the attention.

It is sad, indeed, that these indescribable beauties do not lend
themselves readily to photography and can never be done justice to
by artist’s brush. With the startling suddenness of a transformation
scene there will sometimes burst on the view a vision of aerial Alps ot
purest snow and limitless in range; towering mountains and deep
ravines, rocks with yawning chasms, giving place to true castles in the
air with frowning battlements, dissolving in their turn into forests of
towers, domes, and spires, and all the while the beholder is conscious
that this is not illusion, but a reality of his new home, and that for the
time he himself is a naturalized inhabitant of the sky.

Later on fresh conditions unknown on earth will commonly prevail.
The sun, hastening to the west, seems loath to withdraw his warmth, |
and as the distance becomes swallowed up in gloom and shades grow
darker beneath there is the feeling that the rawness of evening is
absent, and the night grows genial instead of chill.

One special peculiarity in daylight ascents, always more or less
pronounced, has to be reckoned with in taking photographs or making
318 SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING.

visual observations of any scenes below, viz, the haze that veils the
lower levels from the traveler aloft. This is a true physical fact, and
due to the particles of low-lying matter in suspension, which, present-
ing their sun-lit surfaces toward an observer above, create a glare to
his vision, while to another observer on the earth the same dust motes,
presenting only their shaded sides, do not betray their presence save
by somewhat diminishing the direct light of the sky. On one occasion,
when rising almost perpendicularly to a great height above the Crystal
Palace, with the sun bright overhead, dense white cloud wreaths
entirely obliterated the scene below, yet visitors in the Palace grounds
continued to watch the balloon, but half hidden in what appeared to
them only the thinnest summer cloudlet.

Perhaps the most serious drawback to ballooning in our own country -
is the very limited territory over which it can be practiced. A gale
blowing 60 or 70 wiles an hour would render a voyager above the
clouds soon liable to be carried out to sea without his knowledge, and
unless he can see stationary objects below he is usually quite ignorant
of his rate of travel. He is, indeed, for the most part unconscious of
all wind or of any motion of his own vessel, until, with anchor cast
overboard, she at length strikes earth. It is then in rough weather
that delicate instruments are apt to take harm. It is then that fellow-
passengers, for mutual safety, must stick by their craft and hold on
well together. In other words, it is then that the fun begins. And
maybe, riding steeplechase with a cripple balloon, bowling over open
country before a stiff wind, yields little in excitement to a brush with
the Pytchley.

Such, however, must be considered record occasions. The more
common experience on descending is to approach the earth with an
onward flight no faster than pursuing peasants can run. Speed in
general is in proportion to elevation. On the occasion just referred
to, the balloon in question remained hovering over the Crystal Palace
grounds, and apparently over the same spot in the grounds, for some
twenty minutes, till, as altitude increased, the whole inclosure had, to
all appearance, shrunk together to the dimensions of a toy model,
when the balloon began to draw away at a steadily increasing rate, and
reached Rainham in Essex at an average speed of 7 miles an hour.

To pursue aerial travel at its best it will perhaps be agreed that a
height not exceeding 3,000 or 4,000 feet will be most convenient, but it
must be remembered that a balloon never maintains for long the same
altitude. Reaching regions of less atmospheric pressure, and other
conditions remaining the same, a portion of gas escapes, causing the
balloon to descend until checked by discharge of ballast, when it again
changes its motion, and like an unsteady balance, oscillates above and
below its true level of equilibrium.

For eye observations of earth no higher altitudes need be desired.
Clouds not intervening, the distance for 30 miles will often be distinetly
SCIENTIFIC BALLOONING. 319

defined while many hundreds of square miles lie displayed on a map in
which every detail is delineated, and often thrown into strong relief of
light and shadow. MHurrying over town and village, over patchwork
fields and wood and river, the shadow of the balloon itself may com-
monly be traced, and ever and anon stray messages from earth will
reach the car. ‘The shriek of a distant train, the hour tolled out from
some church tower, even the musical murmur of the woods far down;
and though the air around is bereft of bird or insect life, a wandering
ball of thistledown may come floating upward borne on some unseen
current.

Enough has been said to show the many capabilities of a balloon,
while, on the other hand, its disadvantages are far more apparent than
real. Its danger is greatly exaggerated. With due care and caution a
voyage through the air carries no greater risk than a voyage by sea.
Many times from want of care, or else through emergency, a balloon
has been brought precipitately to earth, but under these circumstances
in far the majority of cases, the collapsing silk has formed a natural
parachute and saved the voyagers from harm.

There are other chances, too, in cases of mishap, still in favor of the
aeronaut. On one occasion Mr. Coxwell, falling half a mile with a
broken valve, landed scathless in an apple tree.

‘THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE!

By Prof. JAMES GEIKIE, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.
(With map.)

We are all familiar with the general conclusion arrived at by geologists
that our earth has experienced many climatic changes. There have
been times when genial conditions ranged up to the highest latitudes,
and times also when the cold of the arctic regions descended to what
is now our temperate zone. The cause or causes of those remark-
able vicissitudes still baffle research. Many explanations have been
advanced—some highly improbable, others perhaps: more likely, while

-of yet others it may be said that possibly they contain a certain amount

of truth. But no one theory or hypothesis has succeeded in gaining
general assent, and we shall not therefore at present concern ourselves
with any. In place of reviewing hypotheses and speculations, I[ shall
limit myself to a survey of certain facts connected with the later geo-
logical history of our continent, the meaning of which is more or less
apparent. The evidence referred to leads to the conclusion that Middle
Europe has within the human period experienced conditions such,as
now obtain in the tundras and barren grounds of cireumpolar regions.
When these conditions passed away, the central and west-central
areas of our continent became steppe lands, comparable as regards
climate to the subarctic steppes of southeast Russia and southwest
Siberia.

As geologists reason from the present to the past, it will be well to
take first a brief glance at those regions of the globe where at present
tundra and steppe conditions respectively prevail. When we have
realized the salient characters of those regions, and the nature of their
floras and faunas, we shall be in a better position to understand the
bearing of the geological evidence.

322 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

The aretic lands of Eurasia and North America show two well-
marked zones—a zone of treeless wastes bordering the Polar Sea, and
a coniferous forest zone lying immediately to the south. The treeless
wastes are known as tundras in Europe and Asia, and as barren
grounds in North America. These form plains of immense extent, but
of very unequal width from north to south. In Eurasia they lie for the
most part north of the Arctic Circle, while in North America they
range upon the whole considerably farther south, reaching the sixtieth
parallel on the western shores of Hudson Bay. Their southern
boundary, however, is in both Old and New Worlds exceedingly irreg-
ular. Where the flat lands are exposed to the full sweep of the north-
ern blasts, tundra conditions advance far to the south, invading the
forest zone in narrower or broader stretches. Indeed, even within the
region of arctic forests isolated patches and wider areas of tundra are
encountered. In other places more sheltered from the fierce winds
coming from the polar seas, the arctic forests in their turn encroach
upon the tundras, so as nearly to reach the shores of the frozen ocean.
Such is the case in the valleys of the Yenesei, the Khatanga, the
Olenek, the Lena, and other North Siberian rivers. Similarly in North
America the arctic forests straggle down the valleys of the Mackenzie
and other rivers to beyond the Arctic Circle.

Mosses and lichens form the prevailing vegetation of the tundras—
marshes and bogs extending over vast areas in spring and- summer,
while the less marshy tracts are carpeted with gray lichens. Here and
there, too, in sheltered spots, dwarf birch and willow scrub sprinkle
the surface or flourish in denser masses, and ever and anon more or less
wide stretches of meadow put in an appearance. Now and again the
interminable plains give place to rolling ground, the low hills and
knolls being not infrequently clothed with dwarf trees. No hard
and fast line, indeed, can be drawn between the tundras and the arctic
forests. The two regions not only interosculate, but numerous oases of
trees are encountered in the tundras along their southern margin,
while equally numerous patches of tundra, as already mentioned, are
met with farther south within the arctic zone. It may be added that
in northern Siberia bare rocky hills and mountains—highly fissured,
and showing many gullies, ravines, and débris-strewn valleys—now
and again break the uniformity of a tundra landscape.

A word or two now as to the characteristic animals of the tundras
and barren grounds. First among these come the arctic lemmings.
They feed on grass roots and stalks, mosses, reindeer linchens, and the
shoots of the dwarf birch, for which in winter they tunnel through the
turf or under the snow. The banded lemming is an especially charac-
teristic form, since it is confined to the maritime tracts of Eurasia and
the adjacent islands, and the corresponding areas of North America,
and is never met with in the forest zone. The Obi lemming has a
similar distribution, but ranges somewhat farther south, and not quite

THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 323

so far north, as the banded lemming. The arctic fox is another charac-
teristic member of the tundra fauna, having a high northern range.
It occasionally wanders south to the sixtieth parallel, but that is only
in treeless regions, for it everywhere avoids the forest, seeming to
prefer the barest and most sterile lands. Another common denizen of
the tundras is the arctic or mountain hare. This is the same species
so commonly met with above the limits of the forests in the mountains
of temperate Kurope. A closely allied form (polar hare) frequents the
barrens of North America. The reindeer must also be included in the
tundra fauna, although in winter it ranges far into the forest zone.
The muskox, formerly a native of Eurasia, is now confined to North
America. Like the arctic fox it avoids the forests, ranging north of
these from the the sixtieth parallel up to the highest latitudes.

Such are the most characteristic mammals of the tundras. There
are many other animals, however, which frequent the same regions,
more especially in summer. Among these may be mentioned glutton,
voles, ermine, weasel, wolf, common fox, and brown bear. The summer
visitors also include a vast host of birds, especially water birds.

The climate of all these northern plains is extreme—the winter tem-
perature falling upon an average to 27° below zero, while in summer
the average temperature is about 50° F. The actual range in certain
regions is of course considerably greater. These conditions necessarily
giverise to annual migrations. Only afew mammals, as we have seen,
brave the long winter of the tundras, where river and lake are often
frozen solid, and the whole land is sheeted in snow. During the great
frosts the air is remarkably still, but as winter draws to a close storms
of wind and snow become frequent. Wide regions are then often swept
bare, and the snow is blown into every abrupt hollow and depression in
the plains, and into the gullies and ravines of the hills, where it becomes
so beaten as often to bear the weight of a man. Not only snow, but
sand and dust, are thus swept forward. The sand and dust are no
doubt largely obtained from the great river valleys and deltas, but no
inconsiderable proportion is derived also from the bare rocky hills and
mountains, which in many places diversify the surface of the cireum-
polar plains. Frost is a great pulverizer of rocks, not only splitting
them into fragments, but disintegrating their surfaces into grit, sand,
and dust. It is remarkable how in the highest northern regions the
surface of the snow often becomes discolored with fine sand and dust
derived in this way from exposed rock surfaces.

We need not enter into further details as to the physical conditions
of the tundras. It will be sufficient to sum up here the poiuts which
are most deserving of our attention. Briefly they are these:

1. The climatic conditions of the tundras are extreme, and necessi-
tate annual migrations.

2. The flora is represented chiefly by mosses and lichens. Here and
there, however, tracts of grassy meadow occur, while inlets and oases
324 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

of dwarf trees and scrub, chiefly birch, willow, juniper, and conifers,
not infrequently appear along the southern margin of the tundras.

3. The most characteristic animal forms are lemmings, arctic fox,
arctic hare, musk ox, and reindeer. Of common occurrence also are
various voles, ermine, and weasel. Their range, however, is hardly so
far north, and they go much farther south. So again the wolf, the
ubiquitous common fox, and the brown bear, are frequent visitants
rather than common denizens of the tundras.

4. In summer many of the animals just named push farther. north,
while swarms of birds (especially water birds) visit every part of ‘ite
treeless zone.

5. Lastly, in winter, storms of snow and dust are common.

We may now take a similar brief glance at the steppe lands of Europe
and Asia. The regions included under this head show considerable
variety. ‘Some steppes are mere desert wastes while others are fertile
tracts capable of high cultivation. Many are low plains, others are
elevated plateaus, the former having a subarctic, the latter a subtrop-
ical climate; and between low and high steppes many gradations are
met with. All are more or less characterized by an extreme range
of temperature. The steppes with which we are at present concerned,
however, are the generally low grassy plains which Professor Nehring
designates the subarctic steppes. These occupy wide areas in south-
east Russia and southwest Siberia, extending between the middle course
of the Volga and that of the Irtysch. It is quite a mistake to suppose
that these steppes are throughout all their extent treeless plains. In
many places chains and irregular groups of hills diversify the surface,
while here and there trees of various kinds, such as pines, larches,
birches, oaks, limes, alders, willows, wild apples, and others, are more
or less plentiful. Many of the woods are mere oases, extending along
the banks of rivers and streams, or clustering around the margins of
fresh-water lakes. In southeast Russia the boundary between the
steppes and the forest lands is very irregular—the two regions con-
Stantly interosculate.

The climate of these subarctic steppes is quite continental, the sum-
mer being relatively warm and the winter relatively cold. The average
temperature in January hardly exceeds 3° F. while that of July is at
least 70°. Again, the rainfall is very uncertain. In some years it is
excessive, in others meager, while occasionally it altogether fails. With
the approach of spring vegetation rapidly develops, becoming rank
and luxuriant, but with the heat of summer it quickly fades and withers
away. Severe frost, and frequently heavy snowstorms, characterize
the winter. In such areas as are more or less wooded the climate is
somewhat less continental, the summers being relatively less dry and
the winters not so cold. Buteven in those wooded regions the seasons
are strongly contrasted. In general, we may say the steppe lands in
summer are practically rainless, The ground is thus parched and burnt

up, so that sand and dust rise with every wind, and as the open plains
are often swept by summer btrans, vast quantities of loose materials
are transported from place to place, and here and there accumulate
in hollows and depressions, or come to rest in the lee of sheltering rocks
and hills. In winter, if little snow has fallen, the unprotected ground
is similarly scoured by the tempests, dust, sand, and even small stone
being carried forward. Thus both in summer and winter sand and
dust storms play an important role, and loose materials are piled up to
great depths in valleys, and in the ravines, fissures, and crevices of the
rocky hills.
As a rule these heaps and sheets of drifted sand and dust show little
or no arrangement, although now and again some trace of bedding may
appear. Should they chance to become well covered with snow in
winter, then, when warmth returns and the snow gradually melts away,
plants quickly spring up, and the heaps become fixed and cease to drift.
It is obvious that not infrequently land shells, and often enough the
remains of mammals, must be entombed in such wind-blown materials.
In winter, however, it is snow more commonly than dust that drifts
before the wind. The great snowstorms of the subarctic steppes are
quite as terrible as those of the tundras. No life can withstand the
fury of the blizzards, and many are the disasters on record. Thus in
1827 all the flocks and herds that wandered over the steppes between
the Volga and the Urals perished in one great storm. According to the
Government report the loss sustained by the Kirghiz amounted to
10,500 camels, 280,500 horses, 30,480 cattle, and 1,012,000 sheep. Not
many years pass without some disaster of this kind, and when the snow
has melted away, hundreds of cattle, often far strayed, may be found
huddled together in one place—some suffocated, frozen, or starved to
death, others drowned in the creeks and ravines in which they had
vainly sought for refuge from the blast. Now we ean readily conceive
how the carcasses might eventually be buried under drifted sand and
dust, and the bony skeletons thus become preserved for an indefinite
period.
Among the most characteristic animals of the subarctic steppes are
jerboas, pouched marmots, bobac, pika or tailiess hare, small hamster
rat, various voles, corsac, caragan fox, manul cat, saiga, dzeggetai, -
wild horse, etc. Besides these, many other animals are met with in the
steppes, but are hardly so characteristic, since they range into adjacent
regions, to which they more properly belong. Among them may be
mentioned lynx, wild-cats, tiger, wolf, jackal, common fox, martens,
ermine, weasel, otter, glutton, badger, brown bear, squirrels, beaver,
common hare, mountain hare, wild boar, elk, reindeer, roedeer, stag,
etc. Several hundred species of birds frequent the steppes, among
which may be mentioned great and little bustards, larks, grouse, buz-
zards, eagles, owls, etc.
We may now sum up, in a few words, those features and characters

326 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. —

of the subarctic steppes which are of most importance from our present
point of view.

1. Steppes, like tundras, are not exclusively plains. They include
rocky uplands and hills, and are traversed in many places by streams
and rivers.

2. Vast expanses are clothed with grasses, while others are more or
less sterile and bare. Oases of forests are not infrequently present.

3. The most characteristic animals are jerboas, pouched marmots,
bobacs, and others—the mammalian fauna being more varied than that
of the tundras.

4, Many animals properly belonging to forest lands and to mountains
frequent the steppes. :

5. The seasons are strongly contrasted, and the whole region is
exposed to dust storms in summer, and to snowstorms in winter.

With these facts relating to existing tundras and steppes kept in
view, let us now examine the evidence adduced by geologists to show
that tundra and steppe conditions have successively prevailed in Middle
Europe.

One of the most remarkable superficial deposits of central and west-
central Europe is that which is known under the general term of léss.
Typically it is a fine-grained, yellowish, calcareous, sandy loam—con-
sisting very largely of minute grains of quartz, with some admixture of
argillaceous and calcareous matter. Upon the whole the quartz grains
are well rounded, although often enough they are sharply angular.
Frequently the accumulation shows a porous structure, and is pene-
trated by long, approximately vertical root-like tubes or canals, lined
with calcareous matter, which cause the deposit to cleave or divide in
vertical planes. Hence it usually forms more or less upright bluffs
upon the margins of streams or rivers which intersect it. It is usually
unstratified, except now and again toward the bottom of the deposit,
where intercalated layers, and even sometimes thick beds of sand, make
their appearance. The léss is essentially a deposit of the low grounds,
and is well developed in the broad river valleys of western and central
Europe, as in those of the Seine, the Garonne, the Khone, the Maas,
the Moselle, the Rhine and its tributaries, the Danube and many of its
affluents, such as the Drave, the Save, the Morava, and the Theiss. It
also extends as a narrow belt along the southern margin of the great
plains of North Germany. It is in southern and southeastern Russia,
however, where it attains its widest development, covering as it does
an immense tract, stretching west and east between the valleys of the
Pruth and the Volga. Throughout this vast region it is usually very
dark in color, forming what is known as the black earth.

Without at present going into the question as to the origin of the
materials of which the léss is composed, it is obvious enough that they
have in some places been arranged by water. Thus here and there,
especially at or toward the bottom of the accumulation, distinct traces
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 327

of bedding may be seen, and the beds have yielded fresh-water shells.
This, however, is exceptional. Loss is, for the most part, a subaerial
accumulation—a wind-blown deposit. This is shown not only by the
rounded character of its minute constituents and by the general absence
of bedded arrangement; but by the abundant presence of snail shells
and the frequent occurrence of relics of land animals. Its organié
remains are essentially terrestrial. Moreover, its particular distribu-
tion-—the mode in which it occurs—points clearly to the action of prev-
alent winds. Thus, although it is widely developed over low-lying
regions, it nevertheless sweeps up to heights of 200 to 300 feet and
more above the bottom of the great river valleys. Not only so, but
ever and anon it extends across the hiils and plateaus between adjacent
valleys, wrapping the whole land, in short, like a mantle. Again, in
many places, we find it heaped up in the lee of hills, the exposed wind-
ward slopes of which bear no trace of it, while in certain valleys it
shows a similar partial distribution.

Among the organic remains yiclded by the léss are some that indi-
cate arctic conditions, while others are strongly suggestive of a steppe
climate, and yet others tell us of forest lands. It is impossible that all
the creatures referred to could have lived side by side in the same
region, and annual migrations will not wholly explain their appearance
in the same deposit. The evidence leads to the conclusion that the
accumulation of the loss must represent a long period of time during
which climatic changes took place. Fortunately now and again the
léssic accumulations exhibit a succession of faunal zones—different
suites of organie remains occurring at different levels. And a similar
and corresponding succession has been discovered in many of the caves
of middle Europe.

A tundra fauna is the earliest of which we have any record in the
l6ss and in the particular caves referred to, and it is worth while to
glance for a moment at the former wide distribution of that fauna in
Europe. It will be remembered that two of the most characteristic
tundra forms are the banded and the Obi lemmings. Now, remains of
both these species have been met with again and again over all central
Hurope—in Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary, north and south Ger-
many, north Switzerland, France, Belgium, and England. Sometimes
they occur in single specimens, at other times tuey are extremely
numerous, the remains of several hundreds having been obtained at
various localities. In many places both species of lemming are found
together; elsewhere either one or other occurs alone. The banded
lemming, as a rule, has left its remains most abundantly in hilly and
upland tracts, while those of the Obi lemming are met with more fre-
quently in low-lying areas—a distribution quite in keeping with that
which obtains at present in the tundras. That these arctic animals
were not mere passing or occasional visitors is shown by the fact that
young aud full-grown individuals occur together in hundreds at various
328 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

places and are associated with the remains of other characteristic
arctic animals which breed in the same regions. Thus well-preserved
skeletons of arctic fox, having their milk teeth, have been found lying
side by side with the bones of the lemmings. As the arctic fox breeds
in June, it is obvious that those young individuals must have died in
summer.

Our knowledge of the former distribution of the arctic lemmings is
no doubt not so full as it will yet be, but already we have ascertained
that these creatures ranged as far south as central France and the
base of the Alps, in Switzerland, and as far west as Somerset, in Eng-
land. Besides the arctic fox, many other northern forms were con-
geners of the lemmings in middle and western Europe, such as moun-
tain hare, muskox, reindeer, glutton, voles of various kinds, ermine,
weasel, wolf, common fox, and the now extinct mammoth and woolly
rhinoceros. A number of northern birds have also been recorded from
the same deposits as those which have yielded relics of the tundra
-animals. I need mention only ptarmigans, buntings, snow owls, ducks,
geese, and swans, all of which are in harmony with the arctic charac-
ter of the mammals, since the same forms are in our day constant sum-
mer visitants in the circumpolar treeless lands.

We may note, further, that just as there is this evidence to the former
occupation of middle and western Europe by an arctic fauna, so we
have abundant traces in the same regions of a well-marked arctic flora.
High northern species of mosses, the polar willow, the dwarf birch, and
various other northern plants have been met with in superficial deposits
over a very wide area, extending from southern Sweden and England
across middle Europe to the foot of the Alps.

We can not doubt, therefore, that true tundra conditions have for-
merly prevailed at relatively low latitudes in Europe. The widespread
distribution of the arctic animals and plants just mentioned points
clearly to that and to no other conclusion. We may therefore reasonably
infer that the climate of middle Europe must then have approximated
in character to that of northern Siberia, the seasons being doubtless
strongly contrasted, and thus compelling annual migrations. With the
advent of summer the home of the arctic lemmings was invaded by
troops of visitants—by mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, wild horse, saiga,
and many others, and by numerous birds. An arctic-alpine vegetation
clothed the low grounds, which in the warm season doubtless showed
wide stretches of bog and marsh and many shallow lakes. Here and
there flourished patches and wider tracts of birch and willow scrub,
but the land was practically treeless. Man, we know, was an occupant
of middle Europe at this time. Perhaps, like the mammoth and the
woolly rhinoceros, he may have been rather a summer visitor than a
constant denizen, departing for more clement regions at the approach
of winter. We shall probably not err in supposing that the winter
would have much resemblance to that now experienced in northern
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 329

Siberia—long spells of still weather, with intense frost, interrupted now
and again (especially at the changes of the seasons) by fierce snow-
storms, in which the wild animals could hardly fail occasionally to
perish in large numbers.

How long these tundra conditions obtained we can not tell. All we
know is that eventually they gradually passed away and the climate
became less arctic. This is shown by the well-ascertained fact that
both in the léss and the contemporaneous cave accumulations remains
of the arctic animals are confined to the lowest beds, becoming grad-
ually less numerous as we trace them upward, until they finally disap-
pear. But before the last of the tundra forms has vanished remains
of a steppe fauna begin to occur. In a word, there was no sudden dying
out of one fauna and precipitate appearance of another, but a gradual
replacement, consequent, doubtless, upon changing climatic conditions.

All the animals already mentioned as most characteristic of the
subaretic steppes are represented in the caves and alluvial deposits
of west and middle Europe. Jerboas, pouched marmots, bobacs, and
true marmots, tailless hares and others, all formerly flourished in those
latitudes. Besides these most characteristic steppe animals occurred
many other forms which were not restricted to steppe lands, such as
mammoth and woolly rhinoceros, marsh lynx, cave lion, hyena, wolf,
common fox, ermine, weasel, badger, reindeer, urus, bison, ete. Many
birds also were present—all of them species which in our own day
frequent the steppes of southeast Russia. Land shells are also very
often found in less or greater abundance along with the relics of the
steppe animals just mentioned, most of the shells representing forms
that now live in dry steppes, while some are denizens of wooded
regions.

The plant remains associated with relics of the steppe fauna are quite
in keeping with the latter, but are upon the whole seldom met with,
the conditions not being favorable to their preservation. Trunks and
branches of trees occur very rarely, the most common remains being a
few thin layers and seams of peaty matter, apparently consisting chiefly
of grasses. Nevertheless, we need have no doubt that a steppe flora
formerly flourished in middle Europe, for (as Engler, Ascherson, Petry,
and other botanists have shown) many well-known steppe plants survive
in the existing flora of that region.

Among the animals associated with the true steppe forms were some
which, as we have seen, had already invaded central Europe in tundra
times. Of these, perhaps the most notable are the mammoth and the
woolly rhinoceros. Probably they were only summer visitors, but in
the subsequent steppe epoch they became truly indigenous and very
abundant. The broad valleys and open spaces of central Europe were
at that time treeless plains, although woods seem to have existed here
and there, especially along the margins of lakes and streams. The
climate, we need not doubt, was much like that of the subarctic steppes
330 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

of southeast Russia and southwest Siberia, regions which, like the
tundras, are much exposed to wind action. The general character and
distribution of the loss prove its eolian origin, and its organic contents
are quite in keeping. We may be sure, then, that dry steppe conditions
formerly prevailed throughout central Europe, and that in those regions
dust storms and snowstorms must have been of common occurrence.
We have seen how, in existing tundras and steppes, the semidomesticated
and wild animals of those regions are now and again overwhelmed in
storms and smothered in snow. Now, similar catastrophes must have
happened again and again in the tundras and steppes of prehistoric
times. And we are not left in this matter to mere conjecture, for the
carcasses of some of the more notable animals of those days, now ex-
tinct, have been preserved to the present in the frozen snows—the
famous ice formations of northern Siberia. So perfectly preserved,
indeed, was the mammoth discovered by Mr. Adams that its flesh was
devoured by wolves and bears, and from the appearances presented
by it and others we can not doubt that the animals had perished in
snowdrifts. Brandt records, for example, that the congested veins and
capillary vessels in the head of a rhinoceros examined by him were
charged with coagulated blood, as if the animal had died of suffocation;
and Schrenck says of another described by him, that the distended
nostrils and gaping mouth were highly suggestive of a similar death.
It is probable that these animals were summer visitors to the tundras,
overtaken by autumnal snowstorms. If perfectly preserved carcasses
are rare, such is not the case with skeletal remains. In many places
throughout Siberia the bones of various mammals occur in enormous
quantities, huddled together, as it were, in very limited spots. It
seems impossible to account for such hecatombs on any other supposi-
tion than that they are the silent records of great blizzards and snow-
torms. Even in our own time herds of wild reindeer, with their
young, are overcome by snowstorms in the tundras, while in North
America great flocks of sheep and cattle frequently perish in the same
way. Professor Garman, who draws attention to the disastrous results
of blizzards in the great prairie lands of that region, is of opinion that
the extraordinary heaps of skulls and other remains of the bison that
are met with here and there in northern Colorado and Wyoming, are
the remains of herds which have been suffocated in snowdrifts.

It is not necessary to suppose that all the relics and remains of the
mammoth and its congeners in Siberia are evidence of the destructive
effect of blizzards. The animals doubtless met their death under many
different circumstances. Sometimes they would appear to have been
bogged in swampy holes and morasses. I have referred to the peculiar
ice formations of the arctic coast lands. These are sheets of ice of
unknown thickness, preserved under more or less thick accumulations
of earthy and loamy materials. The ice is believed to represent the
blown or drifted snows of prehistoric times, which here and there have
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 331

been protected from complete dissolution by soil and subsoil flowing
over and accumulating upon them, under the influence of thaw, in
spring and summer. Such movements of superficial materials are in-
deed of common occurrence in high latitudes at the present day. The
surface of the buried ice strata is very uneven, being furrowed and
trenched by deep ruts aud hollows. These depressions are filled up
with frozen mud, etc., containing vegetable débris and abundant mam-
malian remains, including those of mammoth and woolly rhinoceros.
Probably a large number of the bones may simply have been introduced
into the hollows by the flowing soil in spring—they may have been
lying originally scattered over the surface. In other cases, however,
the animals themselves seem to have fallen or sunk into the depres-
sions. All the evidence leads to the inference that in the warm season
these high northern regions were visited abundantly by mammoths,
rhinoceroses, horses, bisons, wapiti, and others. Such being the case,
it is not hard to understand how the bulkier animals might now and
again become trapped in the treacherous bogs and subjacent muds that
covered and concealed the ice formations and their deep clefts and
depressions.

When we turn to the loss of HKurope, we meet with copious evidence
to show that the wild animals of our prehistoric steppes and tundras
were often done to death in their hundreds and thousands. Again and
again great heaps and accumulations of their skulls and skeletal
remains have been encountered in our loéssic aceumulations—appear-
ances exactly recalling the similar bone finds of Siberia and North
America. The deposits in which the European bone finds occur are of
wind-blown origin, and we seem justified, therefore, in concluding that
the animals perished in snowstorms. In these low latitudes, however,
we could not expect to meet with ice formations like those of the
tundras. But that drifted snows did formerly accumulate in middle
Europe, and were preserved for long periods under coverings of sand
and other materials, we have good reasons for believing. Indeed, even
at the present day the drifted snows in southeast Russia are occasionally
buried under sand and so persist for years. In one ease recorded by
Borszcow, what appeared to be an ordinary sandhill proved to be a
mass of congealed snow cloaked in sand about a foot in thickness.
Immediately under the surface the snow was granular and névé-like,
but a little deeper it was firm and solid likeice. This wasin one of the
tributary valleys of the Lek, in the steppes south of Orenburg, about
the fiftieth parallel—a relatively dry region. If in a low-lying region
so far south snow can be preserved in this way, we may readily believe
that in the steppe epoch of middle Europe snowdrifts similarly protected
might now and again have persisted for years. But it was during the
preceding tundra epoch that this would be most commonly the case.
And much interesting evidence is forthcoming to show that in many
places thick sheets of congealed snow did accumulate and become buried

332 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

and preserved at that time. Many of the so-called “rubble drifts” of
middle Europe—sheets of rocky rubbish which have traveled down
gentle hill slopes and spread themselves over the adjacent low grounds—
point to the former presence of great snow drifts, in and upon which
the rock débris traveled. These were not glaciers, but simply sheets
of névé-like snow, charged with and covered by earthy and rocky débris,
which kept moving outward, more especially in spring and summer
when the heaps were more or less rapidly melting. ‘lhe occurrence in
this débris of bones of the reindeer and other mammals shows that the
deposits belong to prehistoric times. Again, certain phenomena con-
nected with the river gravels of the same period lead to the conviction
that the drainage was often interfered with by snowdrifts in tundra
times. The river valleys would seem to have become filled in places
with alternate sheets of congealed snow or ice and layers of gravel and
shingle. Long afterwards, when the interbedded strata of ice melted
slowly away, the associated river detritus quietly settled down, and
owing to the differential movement of the subsiding materials the —
longer stones naturally arranged themselves in lines of least resistance,
so that now we find them most usually standing on end in the gravel
beds.

Thus, apart from the evidence supplied by the bone accumulations of
the loss, we have good reason to believe that snowdrifts were of common
occurrence in middle Europe in prehistoric times. Doubtless most of
the snow which covered the plains of our continent in winter melted and
disappeared in summer, just as is the case in the tundras and steppes of
our own day. The carcasses of animals that may have perished in
blizzards would thus most frequently become uncovered in spring, to be
devoured by hyenas, wolves, and bears, and the disarticulated skeletons
might often be bleached and weatherworn before they were finally
buried in loss. Nor was it only in plains and open valleys that sudden
death may have overtaken large numbers of animals at a time. In
tundras and steppes alike the wild and semiwild denizens of the plains
seek refuge from the drifting snow in the fissures, caves, gullies, and
ravines of the hills and mountains, where they are sometimes frozen to
death or smothered in snow. Herbivorous and carnivorous animals thus
often perish together, for in the presence of a common danger, whether
it be prairie or forest fire, or flood or blizzard—natural antipathies and
animosities are forgotten, and all alike struggle to escape.

Man, as I have already mentioned, lived in middle Europe in tundra
times, and we have abundant evidence of his presence there throughout
the succeeding steppe epoch. Again and again his relics and remains
have been met with at all levels in the léss throughout central Europe.
Thus in the valleys of the Danube and some of its tributaries they have
been discovered in undisturbed loss at depths of from 20 to nearly 100
feet from the surface. Not a few of these finds evidently represent old
prehistoric camping stations—marked by the presence of quantities of
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 333

charcoal and ashes, burnt and calcined bones, together with worked
flints, bones, and ivory. Among the animal remains are those of mam-
moth, woolly rhinoceros, musk ox, reindeer, elk, horse, lion, glutton,
bear, wolf, arctic fox, common fox, and hyena. Nor is it only in the
léss that we have human relics associated with the tundra and steppe
faunas. Similar finds have been recorded from many caves and rock
shelters, of which we may take the rock shelter of the Schweizersbild,
near Schaffhausen, as a good example. The deposits at that place show
a clear succession, and tell a highly interesting tale. The following is
the sequence, the beds being numbered from below upward:
6. Humus bed.
. Gray relic bed.
. Breccia bed, with upper rodent bed.
. Yellow relic bed.
. Lemming bed.

1. Gravel bed.

With the lowest bed (No.1) we need not at present concern ourselves,
beyond remarking that it is obviously of fluviatile origin. All the over-
lying beds are clearly of subaerial formation—the flooded torrential
water, which laid down the gravel bed (No. 1), had left the rock shelter
high and dry before the succeeding lemming bed began to accumulate.
This latter is a yellowish earth, charged with fragments of limestone
detached by the weather from the overhanging rock. Scattered
through this earth are abundant remains of arctic lemming, arctic fox,
mountain hare, reindeer, glutton, and a number of other forms which
are constant summer visitors to the tundras. The banded lemming is
the most plentifully represented species, and next to it in abundance
comes the alpine hare. In close association with this tundra fauna
occur flint implements, and awls, chisels, harpoons, and needles of bone
and horn. Only one old hearth, with its ashes, was encountered, and
from the fact that no calcined bones were met with, while the number of
worked bones and antlers was relatively small, it may be inferred that
man was not a persistent occupant of the rock shelter during the slow
accumulation of the lemming bed. The same conclusion is suggested by
the occurrence, especially in the upper part of the bed, of abundant
traces of various birds of prey, which appear to have been able to nest
undisturbed on the rock and in its crevices.

It can not be doubted, therefore, that during the formation of the
lemming bed an arctic climate reigned in north Switzerland. Toward
the upper part of that bed, however, we find evidence to show that
tundra conditions were gradually passing away. This is indicated by
the fact that some of the tundra animals, so common in the lower part
of the stratum, become scarcer, and at last cease to appear, while at
the same time a few representatives of the subarctic steppe fauna
enter upon the scene.

The next succeeding stratum (yellow relic bed) proved to be rich in

bo e Ot
334 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

human relics. It yielded some 14,000 flint implements, and a large
number of worked bones and antlers, comprising needles, bodkins and
awls, chisels, harpoons, whistles, and other objects. Bits of wood
worked and charred, and fragments of worked and unworked lignite
were also obtained. Besides these, drawings and patterns were found
on reindeer antlers, on bones, and on tablets of limestone, while many
shells, fossils, and teeth of the arctic fox and the glutton were met with,
bored and pierced, as if they had been used for necklaces and other
personal ornaments. The presence throughout this relic bed of nuclei
or cores from which flints had been struck, of abundant chips and splin-
ters, of old hearths, ashes, and burnt bones, shows that the reindeer
hunters were for a long time constant occupants of the rock shelter.

Turning to the abundant animal remains, we find that these represent
no fewer than 49 species, viz, 30 mammals, 15 birds, 3 amphibians, and
1 fish. AJl the most characteristic tundra forms—the banded lemming
and its peculiar associates—are now absent, and in their place we find
a true steppe fauna. Amongst the new arrivals are red suslik, pika,
and true hamster, and associated with these are such constant visitors
of the steppes as manul cat, wild horse, dzeggetai, and various birds.
Certain forms which appear in the lemming bed are still represented, as
arctic fox, glutton, and others—all of which, however, in our own day
range south of the true tundras. Their presence therefore is not out
of keeping with the characteristic steppe forms. It is clear therefore
that in north Switzerland a tundra fauna was eventually succeeded by
a Steppe fauna.

Toward the top of the yellow relic bed once more new arrivals begin
to put in an appearance, and their presence seems to show that the
climate was again gradually changing, for they include red deer, roe
deer, wild boar, squirrel, pune marten, and beaver, all of which belong
to a forest fauna.

The next stratum in succession is the breccia bed. This consists of
small fragments of limestone, either lying loosely together or cemented
by calcareous matter. Relics of man were not so common in this bed,
although occasional splintered bones and flint implements occurred all
through it, and in places were even abundant. About midway between
the top and bottom of the breccia occurred a layer of dark-earth, in
which human relics and the remains of various rodents were conspicuous.
It would seem that during the accumulation of the breccia bed small
groups of reindeer hunters only now and again visited the rock shelter;
it was evidently not so continually occupied as it had been. The animal
. remains met with in the stratum undoubtedly tell a tale of changing
climatic conditions. Amongst the species represented are reindeer,
pika, hare, squirrel-tailed dormouse, garden dormouse, squirrel, water
rat, various voles, shrews, mole, ermine, marten, and others. This is
obviously a mixed fauna—a few of the steppe animals being still present,
but the larger number of the species are forest forms. The fauna of
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 335

the breccia bed, in a word, marks the transition from steppe to forest
conditions. Obviously the climate was gradually improving, the forests
continuing to increase at the expense of the earlier steppe flora.

In the gray relic bed that succeeds we lose all trace of the character-
istic steppe fauna. The most abundant remains are those of red deer,
roe deer, horse, and ox, and with these are associated relics of a number
of other forms, such as badger, wild-cat, hare, urus, goat, and sheep.
The steppe fauna had now obviously become replaced by a forest fauna.
Paleolithic man—the reindeer hunter of the tundras and steppes—had
also vanished, and his Neolithic successor now occupied the rock shelter
of the Schweizersbild. The gray relic bed and the overlying humus
bed tell a most interesting tale, but into that I can not go. It is suffi-
cient to note that the old reindeer hunters seem to have departed before
forest conditions had been fully established. We may surmise that as
the climate became warmer the reindeer gradually withdrew from the
Alpine Vorland. Probably it had already become somewhat scarce
during the accumulation of the breccia bed, in which, as will be remem-
bered, traces and remains of it and its hunters become less and less
common. One can hardly doubt that the emigration of the reindeer
and the finai exodus of Paleolithic man from north Switzerland were
contemporaneous events, brought about by changing climatic condi-
tions. We can picture to ourselves the old race of hunters, with the
contemporaneous steppe fauna, gradually passing east and northeast,
while the forests continued to encroach upon and overspread the fertile
lands of central Europe. It is possible that Neolithic man may here
and there have come into contact with his Paleolithic predecessor, but
of this we have no evidence. All we certainly know is that the latter
vanished from central Europe with the steppe fauna, and that when
Neolithic man made his earliest appearance a forest fauna was in pos-

session of the land.

ie

In my preceding lecture evidence was adduced to show that tundras
and steppes, with their characteristic faunas, formerly existed in cen-
tral and west central Europe. We saw that for a long time the
climatic conditions of these regions must have resembled those that
now obtain in northern Siberia and the barren grounds of North
America, where mosses and lichens form the prevailing growths, and
arctic lemmings, hares, and foxes, the reindeer, and the musk ox are
the common indigenous animals. All these characteristic species
formerly lived in middle Europe. Eventually our tundra flora and
fauna gradually disappeared and were as gradually replaced by steppe
forms of life. Jerboas, pouched marmots, pika, and many others—
such an assemblage as we now see in the subarctic steppes of southeast
Kiussia and southwest Siberia—flourished throughout the regions over

which the lemmings and their arctic congeners had formerly prevailed.
Throughout both tundra and steppe epochs Paleolithic man was an
occupant of middle Europe. To the steppe epoch succeeded a forest
epoch, with its characteristic fauna, by which time Paleolithic man
had vanished, his place being taken by the so-called Neolithic race, or
races, for there were several of these.

We must now ask what relation the tundra and steppes deposits
bear to other well-known superficial accumulations of Europe. To
what particular stage of the geological history of our continent do
they beiong? When we remember that an arctic-alpine flora formerly
flourished on the low grounds of central Europe, it seems extremely
probable that the tundra epoch must fall within the glacial period.
But the glacial period embraced a complex series of geographical and
climatic changes, and it is necessary, therefore, to come somewhat closer
to the question.. Among the most conspicuous deposits of the Ice age
are moraiues of all kinds and fluvio-glacial gravels, while the léss, as
we have seen, is the most prominent accumulation of the tundra and
steppe epochs. How, then, does the latter behave with regard to the
typical glacial and fluvio glacial formations? Is it older or younger
than these, or are the two sets of accumulations contemporaneous?
The answer we get to that question is, at the first blush, disconcerting,
for we Jearn that it is each in turn—sometimes underlying, sometimes
overlying, and in other places occurring intercalated among glacial
deposits. This only means, however, that loss appears to have been
formed during different stages of the Ice age. It will be remembered
that while we discussed the wind-blown character of the loss, we left
untouched the question of the origin of its materials. Whence were
those materials derived which the wind worked over, and largely
rearranged, and redistributed in the low grounds of central Hurope?
To answer this question we must examine more closely the relation
borne by the léss to the fluvio-glacial deposits and morainic accumula-
tions. We note, in the first place, that in its horizontal distribution it
follows closely that of the valley gravels of glacial times. Where the
latter are well developed, the loss appears in full force; where they are
wanting there is a like absence of loss. In all the valleys leading down
from the Alps to the low grounds of middle Europe the loss puts in a
prominent appearance. It obviously bears a close relation to the main
lines of drainage, and may be said to be confined to valleys that head
in formerly glaciated areas. So, again, in north Germany and southern
Russia it spreads over all the low-lying tracts that lay in front of the
vast mers de glace of glacial times. These facts alone, taken in con-
nection with the occasional well-stratified character of the loss, the
intercalation in it now and again of beds of sand, and the presence
ever and anon of fresh-water shells, seem strongly suggestive of a
fluviatile origin. And that such was really the origin of the materials
of the léss will appear clear enough when we consider the conditions
that obtained during a glacial epoch. (See Map A.)
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 337

While all northern and northwestern Europe were covered by an ice
sheet, the mountains of middle Europe ana the alpine lands supported
great glaciers, which in many cases deployed upon the low grounds.
Vast bodies of water must then have escaped from tie terminal front
of the northern mer de glace, while the streams and rivers flowing from
our mountain tracts must have greatly exceeded their present succes-
sors. With each recurring spring and summer wide areas in the low
grounds would thus be subject to floods and inundations. Coming
from regions where glacial grinding was being carried on upon a most
extensive scale, it goes without saying that all these waters would be
clouded with the fine flour of rocks. The enormous morainic accumu-
lations formed underneath and in front of the alpine glaciers, aud over
the vast areas traversed by the Scandinavian mer de glace, bear em-
phatic testimony to the intensity of glacial erosion. In like manner
the great terraces of gravel that stretch down tie valleys in front of
the alpine moraines and the broad sheets of similar deposits which
extend outwurd from the glaciated tracts of northern Europe, are
equally impressive witnesses to the vigor of the flooded glacial rivers.
It is certain, however, that gravel, grit, and sand would not be the
only materials carried forward by those rivers. As they reached the
low-lying tracts their rate of flow would gradually diminish, and finer-
grained materials—fine silt and loam—would eventually be deposited.
When we consider the great volumes of water descending to the low
grounds, we can not, indeed, escape from the conclusion that many
wide areas in the plains during a glacial epoch must have been inun-
dated, and in those slack waters and temporary lakes the finer-grained
fluvio-glacial sediments would tend to accumulate. We must also bear
in view the probability—I had almost said the certainty—of great
derangements of the drainage having taken place in middle Europe.
In winter, when the rivers of that region were frost bound, snow must
frequently have drifted to great depths in the valleys, and the spring
and summer thaws would often fail to remove these heaps. In this
way the valleys might here and there become entirely filled with the
blown and congealed snows of successive years, so as to compel the
rivers in summer to rise in flood and to reach levels which they might
otherwise have been unable to attain. We have positive proof, indeed,
that such accumulations of drift snow actually did appear in extra-
glacial regions, for some of them have persisted to the present day.
The ice formations of the arctic coast lands, with their associated mam-
malian remains, certainly belong to the glacial period. They are
simply the arifted snows, now converted into granular and massive
ice, which accumulated in valleys and depressions outside of the gla-
ciated regions. Protected under a covering of superficial detritus,
alluvial matter, and peat, they have in those high latitudes persisted
to the present day. Farther south, in central and western Hurope,
similar masses of congealed snow, as we have seen, appear to have

sm 98 22

338 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

accumulated, and may well have endured for some time after glacial
conditions had passed away. In these temperate latitudes, however,
they were bound ere long to melt and allow the overlying alluvial
deposits to settle down in the manner already described.

There are thus various lines of evidence which lead to the conclusion
that during a glacial epoch the lower reaches of all the great valleys
opening out from glaciated regions, as well as large tracts of the wide
plains extending in front of the northern mer de glace, would be more
or less drowned in temporary lakes of turbid water, over the beds of
which a fine sediment of somewhat uniform character must have been
deposited. And such is generally believed to be the origin of the
materials of the léss. The lOss, as we now have it, is a fluvio-glacial
silt or loam, very largely reassorted and rearranged by the wind. Its
history, therefore, is involved with that of the Ice age, and we must
consequently turn our attention to the unquestioned deposits of that
period, with a view to discover, if we can, at what particular stage of
it the glacial silts were worked over by the wind, and tundra and
steppe faunas successively occupied the low grounds of middle Hurope.

Let us first, then, trace as briefly as may be the history of the glacial
and interglacial deposits. Avoiding detail, we shall confine attention
to the more salient features of the evidence and try to picture the suc-
cession of events from the beginning to the close of glacial times.

The facts upon which geologists base their conclusion that a vast
ice sheet formerly covered much of northern and northwestern Europe,
while great snow fields and glaciers existed not only in the Alps, but
in many of the minor mountain ranges of central and even of southern
Europe, may be very briefly summed up.

First, we have the evidence supplied by morainic accumulations of
all kinds—bottom moraines or bowlder clays and terminal moraines.
Second, we have the proofs of former glaciation afforded by striated
rocks and roches moutonnées and by the crushed, broken, tumbled,
and confused rock surfaces that occur so frequently underneath the
bottom or ground moraines. Third, we have the presence of certain
remarkable ridges of gravel and sand which appear to have been
formed in tunnels under the ice, and of enormous sheets of similar
materials which have been spread out by the waters escaping from the
terminal front of the inland ice of northern Europe, while in all the
great valleys leading down from the Alps and other glaciated moun-
tains we see broad terraces of alluvial detritus which have been
deposited by torrential streams and rivers. All those fluvio-glacial
deposits, when followed from the low grounds into the regions occupied
by moraines, are found to dovetail with the latter and are consequentl—
of contemporaneous origin.

By mapping rock striz and noting the general trend of the erratics
which constitute sv large a portion of the ground moraines we acquire
a knowledge of the directions followed by the inland ice and the great
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 33

glaciers. Not only so, but by tracing the horizontal and. vertical dis-
tribution of glacial phenomena we have been able to show what regions
were wholly ice covered, to measure the thickness attained by ice
sheets and glaciers, and to estimate the angle of their surface slope.
It is, in short, quite possible now to draw maps of Europe which shall
give a fairly accurate presentment of the aspect presented by our con-
tinent in glacial times. On maps of a sufficiently large scale we can
delineate not only the great inland ice of the north and northwest, but
the snow fields and numerous glaciers of the Alps and other moun-
tainous tracts, together with the areas govered by fluvio-glacial
deposits.

So much for what we may call the physical evidence. But this is
not all, for associated with the true glacial accumulations occur in
many places beds charged with the remains of arctic-alpine plants and
animals. The evidence of fossil-organic remains, therefore, fully sup-
ports the conclusions arrived at from a study of purely glacial
phenomena. We know that arctic forms of life lived in our seas at
the time of which I am speaking, and that the countries outside of
the glaciated areas were then clothed and peopled by an arctic-alpine
flora and fauna.

But, as if in contradiction of this evidence, certain other deposits
charged with the remains of temperate and southern species of plants
and animals appear intercalated among the true glacial accumulations.
The study of these and of their relation to subjacent and overlying
morainic and fluvio-glacial accumulations has led to the conclusion
that the Glacial period was not one continuous period of arctic condi-
tions, but a cycle or succession of alternating cold and genial epochs.

So far as we at present know, glacial conditions first supervened in
late Tertiary times—in the so-called Pliocene period. In the earlier
part of that period the European climate had been singularly genial.
Warm seas, tenanted by many southern species of mollusks, washed
the shores of the British area, while the land was clothed with a much
more varied and abundant flora than we now possess. Great forests
seem to have covered vast areas, occupying not only the plains and
the river valleys, but extending far up the mountain slopes of such
regions as France without much change of character. The same
Species, indeed, appear to have flourished equally well in Cantal and
central Italy. Some of these had come down from early Tertiary
times and were destined soon to become extinct; some, again, were
special forms belonging to genera which in our day are exotic; others
were species which have survived to the present in more southern and
eastern regions, while yet others are still represented in Europe by
identical or very closely allied species. Thus the flora of the Pliocene
was connected both with the past and the present plant life of Europe,
while at the same time it had relations with the floras of distant
southern and eastern regions—with Florida, the Canary Islands,
340 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

China, and Japan. All the evidence thus implies for early Pliocene
times an equable and uniform climate, which permitted the intimate
association in our continent of many plants which are now no longer
able to exist at similar elevations or in one and the same latitude.

The mammalian life of Europe in early Pliocene times was in keeping
with the flora. The deinotherium and mastodon still survived, and
along with these were rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and elephants,
and many cervine and bovine animals. Carnivores of extinct and still
existing types and many monkeys were also present.

Such, then, was the character of the climate, and the aspect of the
flora and fauna of Europe in preglacial times. The gradual approach
of glacial conditions is evidenced by the fact that the percentage of
northern and arctic shells in the upper Pliocene marine deposits
increases from the lower to the higher members of the series. We note
a gradual dying out of southern species and a gradual coming in of
northern forms, until at last the beds are charged with the remains of
a truly arctic marine fauna. We have no direct evidence as to the
terrestrial conditions which obtained in Britain and Ireland at that
time. The climate, however, could not have been genial and temperate
as itis now. The presence of an arctic fauna in our seas shows that
our shores were washed by currents coming from the north, and not as
at present from the southwest. Reasoning from the analogy of to-day,
therefore, we might infer that the climate of our area was probably not
unlike that of Labrador.

The traces of the first glacial epoch are more clearly read in the
deposits of the continent. An immense glacier at this time, fed from
the uplands of Scandinavia, filled the basin of the Baltic. The bottom
moraine of that great ice flow is seen in the low grounds of Scania, in
southern Sweden, while its fluvio-glacial deposits have been detected
at many places in north Germany. The alpine lands were contem-
poraneously covered with extensive snow fields, and large glaciers |
descended the deep mountain valleys, to deploy upon the Vorlander, in
Switzerland, and south Germany. The terminal moraines of these
- glaciers have been mapped out, and tke general conditions of the epoch
have been so well ascertained that the position of the snow line at the
time has been determined. It is believed to have been upon an
average some 4,000 feet lower than now. While the valleys of the Alps
were thus gorged with ice and the basin of the Baltic was occupied by
an immense mer de glace, it is not probable that the higher parts of
our islands could have escaped glaciation. We can hardly doubt that
snow fields and glaciers must also have existed here. No trace of —
these, however, has been or is ever likely to be detected. Direct
evidence of the kind, if it ever did obtain, has been obscured or
destroyed by the action of the much greater glaciers and ice flows of
later epochs.

In tracing the succeeding events in the geological history of Europe,
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 341

I shall confine attention in the first place to the alpine lands, for it is
in the low grounds at the base of those mountains that the relation of
the léss to the glacial and fluvio-glacial deposits can be most clearly
made out.

It has now been ascertained that glaciers have on three successive
oceasions filled the great mountain valleys of the Alps and descended
to the low grounds. The earliest advance I have already described—
this constitutes the first glacial epoch of Swiss geologists. It was
followed by a long spell of genial conditions when the great glaciers
melted away, and retired to the inner recesses of the mountains. Many
relics of the flora of this genial epoch have been preserved. Thus in
the valley of the Inn, near Innsbruck, certain deposits have yielded
an assemblage of plants similar to that which we now meet with in
the valleys of the mountain regions south of the Black Sea—most of the
plants being existing species. The mean annual temperature of the
-regions in which that flora now flourishes is 57° to 65° F., while that
of Innsbruck at present is only 47°. But in the genial epoch of which
I speak, the flora in question flourished on the mountain slopes over-
looking Innsbruck at elevations of 3,600 to 3,900 feet, where the mean
- annual temperature in our day does not exceed 40°. This is enough
to show us that the climatic conditions of the alpine valleys must
formerly have been considerably more genial than at present. From
this and similar evidence in other alpine valleys we may safely infer
that the retreat of the glaciers was the result of a great change of
climate, and that during the first interglacial epoch the snow fields
and glaciers must have retired to the highest ridges of the mountains.

The plant beds just referred to are not only underlaid, but overlaid
by bottom or ground moraines, the overlying moraines belonging to
the second glacial epoch. It was during this epoch that the glaciers of
the Alps attained their greatest development—the snow line becoming
depressed to 4,700 feet below its present level. The glaciers now
pushed their way into the low grounds considerably beyond the limits
reached by their predecessors in the first glacial epoch. That the sec-
ond, like the first glacial epoch, was of long duration is shown by the
aon of erosion effected by the ice flows and the enormous extent of
their bottom and terminal moraines.

_ Overlying the ground moraines of that epoch we again come upon
alluvial deposits in many places, which are crowded with the remains
of a temperate flora—a flora resembling that of the low grounds of
Switzerland and north Italy in our own days. It is obvious, therefore,
that when such a flora flourished in the great valleys of the Alps the
climate could not have been less genial than the present; the snow
line must have again retreated to a higher level, and the névés and
glaciers were probably not more extensive than they are now. This
constitutes the second interglacial epoch of Swiss geologists. Hre long
it was followed by a third general advance of the glaciers, which once

more reached the low grounds at the base of the Alps, but did not
flow so far as their predecessors of the preceding or second glacial.
epoch. The snow line of this third glacial epoch stood at an average
level of about 4,400 feet below the present. .

Each glacial epoch was necessarily marked by profound glacial
erosion, and the consequent formation of massive sheets of ground
moraine in the lower reaches of the great valleys, and of huge terminal
moraines at or opposite their mouths. Enormous quantities of shingle
and gravel were at the same time swept outward by the rivers escap-
ing from the ice—each series of terminal moraines being thus closely
associated with its separate and distinct set of fluviatile deposits. No
difficulty is found in separating those successive accumulations of
gravel. They form terraces lying one within the other at three suc-
cessive levels. The highest rises upon an average 250 to 300 feet above
the present rivers; the surface of the middle terrace is about 100 feet
below the surface of the highest, and about the same distance above
the level of the lowest terrace. [ach terrace rests upon solid rock,
and it is obvious, therefore, that the several epochs of gravel accumu-
lation have been separated by epochs of active river erosion. This
remarkable valley-within-valley formation is clearly the result of
climatic changes. The highest terrace indicates the action of flooded
rivers escaping from the glaciers of the first glacial epoch. These
glaciers then disappeared or shrank into comparative insignificance,
and an interglacial epoch of active valley erosion succeeded—the
rivers cutting their way down for a hundred feet or more into the solid
rocks. Next came the second glacial epoch, and the lowered valley
bottom was again deeply covered with gravel. The glaciers of this
stage then in their turn retired, and a second interglacial epoch super-
vened, when the rivers as before deepened their channels, working
down through the older gravels and excavating the underlying rocks.
Thereafter the third glacial epoch ensued, and a new series of gravels
was deposited at a lower level than the preceding accumulation.
Lastly, this third glacial epoch passed away and the rivers again
trenched the fluvio-glacial gravels, the upper surface of which is now
much above the reach of the greatest floods.

What relation, then, does the loss bear to the glacial and inter-
glacial accumulations of the alpine lands? Fortunately to this ques-
tion a definite reply can be given. It is dovetailed with the glacial
deposits in such a manner as to show that its formation has taken place
at successive epochs. ‘I hus it occurs occupying an interglacial position
between the accumulations of the first and second, and between those
’ of the second and third glacial epochs. When we pass down the valley
of the Rhine a similar succession is encountered. In the wide plain
lying between the Vosges and the Black Forest, l6ss is met with-on the
same geological horizons, overlying the gravel terraces of the first and
the second glacial epochs. Not only so, but even the youngest or lowest
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 3483

eravel terrace (that of the third glacial epoch) is in like manner sheeted
in léss. The loss on these three separate horizons is for the most part
wind blown, and exactly resembles that of middle Europe generally,
showing the same structure and arrangement, and containing a similar
assemblage of organic remains.

To what extent each of these “horizons” of lOss may be represented
in the low grounds of middle Europe we can not definitely say. But as
the materials of the léss are for the most part of fluvio-glacial origin, it
is obvious that such accumulations must have been formed during each
successive advance of the alpine glaciers. As each glacial epoch passed
away those accumulations were greatly modified by the wind, and drifted
into the valleys that drain the Alps, where they were subsequently
covered and to some extent preserved under the morainie and fluvio-
glacial deposits of the succeeding epoch of glacial advance. It seems
probable, therefore, that the wind-blown loss of the low grounds of
middle Europe does not belong exclusively to any one particular stage
of the glacial period. It is impossible, however, at present to divide
it up into separate stages. But we may feel sure that if tundra and
Steppe faunas succeeded each other again and again in the valley of
the Rhine, they could hardly fail to have done the same in the wide
plains of middle Europe.

It will be remembered that at the Schweizersbild the deposits con-
taining remains of tundra and steppe faunas rest immediately upon
fluvio-glacial gravels. These gravels were laid down during the third
glacial epoch. It is quite certain, therefore, that the faunas referred to
must have entered Switzerland after the retreat of the glaciers from the
low grounds. But how long an interval may have elapsed between the
disappearance of the glaciers and the advent of the lemmings and
their congeners we can not tell. All we know is that after the appear-
ance of the tundra fauna in Switzerland the climate, at first cold and
arctic, gradually became less extreme, so that in time a steppe fauna,
and afterwards a forest fauna, succeeded. In other words, no percepti-
ble hiatus separates the present from the conditions that obtained when
the reindeer hunter vanished from the alpine lands. He was succeeded
by Neolithic man, just as the latter was followed by the men who used
bronze and iron implements and tools. So far as the evidence of the
Schweizersbild rock shelter is concerned, we should infer that no great
alternations of cold and genial epochs followed after the final retreat of
the great glaciers of the third glacial epoch. But, as we shall see
presently, the tale told by that interesting rock shelter is incomplete.
Certain considerable climatic changes did take place after the third
glacial epoch had passed away. The evidence of such change, however,
though not wanting in the alpine lands, is much more clearly displayed
in northwestern Europe. ‘To the testimony yielded by the glacial and
interglacial deposits of that region, therefore, we shall now direct
attention.
344 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

It will be remembered that during the first glacial epoch a great
Baltic glacier existed, and an arctic fauna lived in the North Sea. That
epoch was succeeded by the first interglacial stage, when the southern
part of the North Sea became dry land, and England was occupied by
an abundant mammalian fauna—comprising hippopotamus, elephants,
rhinoceros, horse, bison, boar, many kinds of deer, and a number of
carnivores, including bears, hyena, saber-toothed tiger, wolf, fox, ete.
The contemporaneous flora was temperate, resembling very much that
which now exists in southeast England. In similar latitudes on the
continent the same mammalian fauna flourished, while the flora was
temperate, but suggestive of less strongly contrasted summers and
winters than the present. A kind of insular climate, in short, seems to
have characterized north Germany.

To this genial interglacial epoch succeeded the second and most
extreme of all the glacial epochs. An enormous mer de glace then
extended over all northern and northwestern Europe, from the British
area in the west to the Urals in the east, and from Lapland in the north
to the mountains of middle Europe in the south. (See Map B.)

When these extreme conditions eventually passed away, the second
interglacial epoch supervened, characterised, as the earlier one had
been, by a genial temperate climate, by the presence in England and —
the continent of the great pachyderms and their congeners, and by the
appearance of Paleolithic man.

This second interglacial epoch was in its turn succeeded by a third
advance of the Scandinavian “inland ice,” which once more coalesced
with the mer de glace of the British area. It did not, however, flow so
far as its predecessor. Nevertheless, it reached the Valdai Hills in the
east, the valley of the Elbe in the south, and covered all Scotland, the
north of England, and the major portion of Ireland. This ice flow was
most probably contemporaneous with the third advance of the great
glaciers of the Alps. (See Map C.)

It is noteworthy that the léss in north Germany nowhere overlies
the morainic accumulations of the third glacial epoch. It does, how-
ever, cover the marginal area of the ground formerly invaded by the
second and greatest mer de glace. This clearly shows that the loss
of north Germany must belong, in part at least, to the second intergla-
cial epoch. The fact that it everywhere avoids the regions over which
the third great ice sheet prevailed, does not, however, prove that tun-
dra and steppe conditions did not supervene at a later date in middle
Europe. The evidence supplied by the alpine lands, and the great
valleys that drain those lands, is quite conclusive of the contrary.
There is no doubt whatever that the Paleolithic reindeer hunters fol-
lowed the chase in middle Europe long after the third great Scandina-
vian mer de glace had retired from the plains of north Germany. The
geographical distribution of the wind-blown léss shows that steppe
conditions were restricted to a broad belt of land in middle Europe.
THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE. 345

These conditions were rendered possible by the former greater extension
of our continent into the Atlantic, when the major portion of the North
Sea and the English Channel were dry land, and the British Islands
formed part of the continental area.

Considerable climatic changes continued to take place after the pass-
ing of the third glacial epoch. These have left their traces in the
alpine lands, but they are nowhere so clearly seen as in northern and
northwestern Europe. Temperate conditions supervened in north
Germany, the flora and fauna closely resembling those of the present.
But eventually a relapse to glacial conditions followed, and from the
Seandinavian snow fields another invasion of north Germany took
_ place. Norway, Sweden, and Finland were now once more shrouded
in ice, and a great Baltic glacier came into existence, the gigantic ter-
minal moraines of which are met with in Denmark, Schleswig- Holstein,
and Prussia. The Scottish Highlands and other mountainous parts of
the British Islands at the same time nourished local ice sheets and
large valley glaciers, which in many cases descended to the sea. The
alpine Jands in like manner witnessed a recrudescence of glaciation,
large glaciers flowing into the great longitudinal valleys, but nowhere
deploying as before upon the low grounds. It is to this stage, proba-
bly, that we should assign the tundra fauna of the Schweizersbild.
(See Map D.)

The succession in that interesting rock shelter has shown that as the
severity of the climate relaxed, steppe and forest faunas successively
followed the disappearance of the tundra forms. The climate of Europe
generally became temperate, and immense forests overspread wide
regions. It was during the approach of these conditions, as we have
seen, that Paleolithic man seems finally to have vanished and the
Neolithic races to have made their earliest appearance in Europe. The
British Islands at this time formed part of the continent and the Baltic
existed as a great fresh-water lake. The lower buried forests of our
peat bogs are among the conspicuous remainsof this stage. Eventually,
however, submergence ensued, the British Islands were severed from
the continent, and the sea again invaded the Baltic basin. It is nota-
ble that the character of the marine fauna which at this stage lived off
the coasts of Scandinavia and Britain is indicative of more genial con-
ditions than now obtain. The climate, however, gradually became
colder, the vertical and horizontal range of the forests was. restricted,
and snow fields again appeared among the higher mountains of our
islands. In Scotland glaciers here and there came down to the sea,
and dropped their moraines upon the beaches then forming; the large
majority, however, terminated inland. At that time the snow line in
north Britain ranged between 2,000 and 2,600 feet. Similarly, in Nor-
way and in the A\ps an advance of glaciers took place—the snow line
in southern Norway being about 2,400 feet, while in the alpine lands
it seems to have averaged 7,500 feet, or some 1,600 feet lower than the
present.
346 THE TUNDRAS AND STEPPES OF PREHISTORIC EUROPE.

Later climatic oscillations followed, but on a decidedly reduced scale.
The effect of these was, naturally enough, most marked in northwestern
Europe, decreasing gradually southward, and doubtless eventually
fading away in the lower latitudes of the continent. It is not neces-
sary for my present purpose to do more than briefly indicate the gen-
eral character of these later changes so far as they affected our own
area.

The local glaciers of the British mountains, some of which, as I have
said, actually entered the sea, at last began to retreat. The climate
became more genial, and so once more favored the growth of forests,
which in many places began to overspread the now dry peat bogs,
beneath which the trees of the earlier forest epoch lay entombed.
Eventually, however, colder and more humid conditions returned, and
small glaciers appeared in a few places among the loftiest heights of
the Scottish Highlands. The position of the moraines of these glaciers
indicates a height of 3,500 feet for the snow line. The forests now, as

before, began to decay in many places, and the bog moss and its allies
again extended in all directions, and so, eventually, a second forest
bed became entombed in growing peat. It is needless to say that the
evidence of these later changes is not restricted to Scotland. The bogs
of the two sister countries, and of the corresponding latitudes on the
continent, present us with precisely the same phenomena.

The present decayed aspect of the bogs in many places where they
formerly flourished, and the fact that certain plants and groups of
plants are once more beginning to invade such wastes, shows that
we are now living under somewhat milder and less humid conditions.

Although these later climatic oscillations certainly affected the dis-
tribution of plants and animals to some extent in northern and north-
western Europe, yet the changes brought about were insignificant as
compared with those which characterized the alternations of preceding
~ glacial and interglacial epochs. The earlier cold and genial stages
were strongly contrasted, and marked by great migrations of flora and
fauna. But, as the strange cycle drew to a close, the contrast between
glacial and interglacial phases became less and less pronounced and
gradually faded away into the present. The steppe fauna vanished
from middle Europe during the fourth interglacial epoch, and it never
returned. The climatic oscillations that followed were on too small a
scale to induce great migrations, and thus the succeeding forest fauna
retained its place. Hence in such a section as that seen in the rock
shelter of Schweizersbild, we find no recognizable evidence of the cli-
matic changes to which the buried forests and peat bogs and the small
local moraines of northern and northwestern Europe bear testimony.
It is thus only by correlating and comparing the evidence over the
widest area that we are able to get the story completed.

In fine, we have seen that tundras and steppes appeared at successive
epochs in prehistoric Europe. The former were contemporaneous with

the great ice sheets and glaciers, while the later came into existence
when glacial conditions were passing away. The tundra and steppe
conditions of our continent belong, in short, to that remarkable cycle of
climatic and geographical changes known as the Ice age or glacial
period. Paleolithic man undoubtedly lived through both phases, for
his relics and remains are found associated alike with the arctic lem-
mings and the succeeding steppe animals. Whether the reindeer hun-
ter of middle Europe ever came into contact there with the Neolithic
man we can not tell. Were we to trust to negative evidence we should
say he never did. But negative evidence can not be trusted. It is
quite possible that the two races may have met and even commingled,
but of this no proof is forthcoming. The strong hiatus that separates
the Old Stone and the New Stone epochs in western and northwestern
Kurope has not yet been bridged over in middle and southern Europe.
When last we see Paleolithic man he is hunting the reindeer and the
mammoth in the Danubian steppes. His Neolithic successor seems not
to have appeared in middle Europe before steppe conditions had passed
away and a forest flora and fauna had become dominant.

MODIFICATION OF THE GREAT LAKES BY EARTH
MOVEMENT!

By G. K. GILBERT,

United States Geological Survey.

The history of the Great Lakes practically begins with the melting
of the Pleistocene ice sheet. They may have existed before the in-
-vasion of the ice, but if so their drainage system is unknown. ‘The ice
came from the north and northeast, and spreading over the whole Lau-
rentian basin invaded the drainage districts of the Mississippi, Ohio,
Susquehanna, and Hudson. During its wandering there was a long
period when the waters were ponded between the ice front and the up-
_lands south of the Laurentian basin, forming a series of glacial lakes
whose outlets were southward through various low passes. A great
stream from the Erie Basin crossed the divide at Fort Wayne to the
Wabash River. A river of the magnitude of the Niagara afterwards
flowed from the Michigan Basin across the divide at Chicago to the
Illinois River; and still later the chief outlet was from the Ontario
Basin across the divide at Rome to the Mohawk Valley.

The positions of the glacial lakes are also marked by shore lines,
consisting of terraces, cliffs, and ridges, the strands and spits formed
by their waves. Several of these shore lines have been traced for
hundreds of miles, and wherever they are thoroughly studied it is
found that‘ they no longer lie level, but have gentle slopes toward the
south and southwest. Formed at the edges of water surfaces, they
' must originally have been level, and their present lack of horizontality
is due to unequal uplift of the land. The region has been tilted toward
the south-southwest. The different shore lines are not strictly parallel,
and their gradients vary from place to place, ranging from a few inches
to 3 or 4 feet to the mile.

The epoch of glacial lakes, or lakes partly bounded by ice, ended
with the disappearance of the ice field, and there remained only lakes
of the modern type, wholly surrounded by land. These were formed
one at a time, and the first to appear was in the Hrie Basin. It was

large as the modern lake. Since that time the land has gradually risen
at the north, canting the basin toward the south, and the lake has
gradually encroached upon the lowlands of its valley. At a date to

equally clear. Before the Ontario Valley held a land-bound lake it
was occupied by a gulf of the ocean. Owing to the different attitude
of the land, the water surface of this gulf was not parallel to the
present lake surface but inclined at an angle. In the extreme north-
_ east, in the vicinity of the Thousand Islands, the marine shores are
nearly 200 feet above the present water level, but they descend south-
ward and westward, passing beneath the lake level near Oswego, and
toward the western end of the lake must be submerged several hun-
dred feet. This condition was of short duration, and the rising land
soon divided the waters, establishing Lake Ontario as an indepen-
dent water body. The same peculiarity of land attitude which made

the original Erie a small lake served to limit the extent of Ontario,
but the restriction was less in amount because of the steeper slopes
of the Ontario basin. Here again the southward tilting of the land
had the eftect of lifting the point of outlet and enlarging the expanse
of the lake.

There is some reason to think that the upper lakes—Huron, Michigan,
and Superior—were at first open to the sea, so as to constitute a gulf,
but the evidence is not so full as could be desired. When the normal
lacustrine condition was established they were at first a single lake
instead of three, and the outlet, instead of being southward from Lake
Huron, was northeastward from Georgian Bay, the outlet river follow-

‘ing the valleys of the Mattawa and Ottawa to the St. Lawrence. The
352 MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT.

triple lake is known to us chiefly through the labors of F. B. Taylor,
who has made extensive studies of its shore line. This line, called the
Nipissing shore line, is not wholly submerged, like the old shores of
Lakes Erie and Ontario, but lies chiefly above the present water surfaces.
It has been recognized at many points about Lake Superior and the
northern parts of Lakes Huron and Michigan, and measurements of its
height shows that its plane has a remarkably uniform dip, at 7 inches
per mile, in a south-southwest (lirection, or, more exactly, 8. 27° W.
As will be seen by the accompanying map, reproduced from Taylor, it
crosses the modern shore line of Lake Superior near its western end,
thereby passing beneath the water surface, and it similarly passes
below the surface of Lake Michigan near Green Bay and below the
surface of Lake Huron just north of Saginaw Bay. The southward
tilting of the land, involving the uplift of the point of outlet, increased
the capacity of the basin and the volume of the lake, gradually carry-
ing the coast line southward in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, until
finally it reached the low pass at Port Huron and the water overflowed
via the St. Clair and Detroit channels to Lake Erie. The outlet by
way of the Ottawa was then abandoned, and a continuance of the
uplift caused the water to slowly recede from its northern shores.
This change after a time separated Lake Superior from the other lakes,
bringing the St. Marys River into existence, and eventually the present
condition was reached.

These various changes are so intimately related to the history of the
Niagara River that the Niagara time estimates, based on the erosion
of the gorge by the cataract, can be applied to them. Lake Irie has
existed approximately as long as the Niagara River, and its age should
probably be reckoned in tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands
of years. Lake Ontario is much younger. All that can be said of the
beginning of Great Lake Nipissing is that it came long after the begin-
ning of Lake Erie, but the date of its ending, through the transfer of
outlet from the Mattawa to the St. Clair, is more definitely known.
That event is estimated by Taylor to have occurred between five
thousand and ten thousand years ago.’ .

The lake history thus briefly sketched is characterized by a pro-
gressive change in the attitude of the land, the northern and north-
eastern portions of the region becoming higher, so as to turn the waters
more and more toward the southwest. The latest change, from Great
Lake Nipissing to Great Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron,
involving an uplift at the north of more than 100 feet, has taken place
within so short a period that we are naturally led to inquire whether
it has yet ceased. Is it not probable that the land is still rising at the
north and the lakes are still encroaching on their southern shores?

the glacial lakes and has given much study to related problems, is of

- opinion that the movements are not complete, and predicts that they
will result in the restoration of the Chicago outlet of Lake Michigan

and the drying of Niagara.'

The importance of testing this question by actual measurements was
impressed upon me several years ago, and I endeavored to secure the
institution of an elaborate ses of observations to that end. Failing in
this, I undertook a less expensive investigation, which began with
the examination of existing records of lake height as recorded by
gage readings, and was continued by the establishment of a number of
gage stations in 1896. To understand fully the nature of this investi-
gation it is necessary to consider the difficulties that arise from the
multifarious motions to which the lake water is subject.

If the volume of a lake were invariable, and if its water were in per-
fect equilibrium under gravity, its surface would be constant and level,
and any variation due to changes in the height of the land could be
directly determined by observations on the position of the water sur-
face with reference to the land; but these conditions are never realized
in the case of the Great Lakes, where the volume continually changes

-and the water is always in motion. The investigator therefore has to

arrange his measurements so as to eliminate the effect of such changes.

Consider first the influence of wind. The friction of the wind on the
water produces waves. These are temporary and practically cease in
periods of calm; the perpetual ground swell of the ocean is not known on
thelakes. The friction of the wind on the water also drives the water for-
ward, producing currents. The water thus driven against the lee shores
returns in undercurrents, but the internal friction of the water resists and
delays the return, and there is consequently a heaping of water against
lee shores and a corresponding lowering of its level on other shores.
During great storms these differences amount to several feet, reaching
a maximum in Lake Erie; in October, 1886, a westerly gale is reported
to have raised the water 8 feet at Buffalo and depressed it 8 feet at
Toledo.” For light winds the changes of level are much smaller, but
they are nevertheless appreciable, and they have even been detected
in the case of the gentle ‘‘ land and sea” breezes which in calm weather
are created by the diurnal cycle of temperature change on land.

The water is also sensitive to atmospheric pressure. If the air pressed
equally on all parts of the lake surface, the equilibrium of the water
would not be disturbed; but its pressure is never uniform. As shown
by the isobars on the daily weather map, there are notable differences
of pressure from point to point, and within the length of one of the
Great Lakes these often amount to several tenths of a barometric inch.

354 MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT.

A column of mercury 0.1 inch high weighs as much as a column of water
1.3 inches high; and whenever the atmospheric pressure at oue point
on a lake exceeds the pressure at another point by the tenth of a baro-
metric inch, the water level at the first point is, in consequence, 1.3
inches lower than the water level at the second point. When acumulus
cloud forms over the water, there is a reaction on the water, disturbing
its equilibrium, and the passage of a thunderstorm often produces oscil-
lations attracting the attention of even the casualobserver. Such sud-
den and temporary variations of pressure give rise to waves analogous
to those caused by a falling pebble, except that they are broad and low,
and these waves not only travel to all parts of a lake, but are continued
by reflection, so that a local storm at one point is felt in the water sur-
face at all points and for a considerable period. The passage of the
great atmospheric waves associated with ordinary cyclonic storms and
the impulses given by winds are also able to set the whole body of
the lake in motion, so that it sways from side to side or end to end
like the swaying water in a tub or basin, and these swaying motions
are of indefinite continuance. In the deeper lakes, and probably in all
the lakes, they are so enduring as to bridge over the intervals from
impulse to impulse. Such oscillations, which appear at any point on
the coast as alternate risings and fallings of the water, with periods
ranging from a few minutes to several hours, are called seiches. Their
amplitude is usually a few inches, but at the ends of lakes is sometimes
a foot or more.

The lakes, like the ocean, are swayed by the attractions of the sun
and moon. Their tides are much smaller than those of the ocean, and
are even small as compared to the seiches, but they are still measurable.
At Milwaukee the lunar tide rises and falls more than an inch and the
solar tide a half inch. At Chicago and Duluth each tide amounts to an
inch and a half, and their combination at new and full moon to 3 inches.

Water is continually added to each lake by rivers and creeks, but
the rate is not uniform. Usually a few freshets, occurring within two or
three weeks, contribute more water than comes during all the remainder
of the year. Water is also added in an irregular way by rain and snow
falling directly on the lake. It is subtracted by: evaporation, the rate
of which varies greatly, and by overflow, which varies within moderate
limits. The volume of water contained in the lake, being subject to
these variable gains and losses, is itself inconstant, and the general
height of the water surface therefore oscillates. In average years the
range of variation for Lake Superior is 12 inches; for Lakes Michigan
and Huron, 12 inches; for Lake Erie, 14 inches, and for Lake Ontario,
17 inches. Low water occurs normally in January or February for
all the lakes except Superior, where it occurs in March. High water
is reached sooner in the lower lakes, June being the usual month for
Ontario, June or July for Erie, July for Michigan and Huron, and
August or September for Superior. Figure 4 shows the character of
the annual oscillations, as given by averages of long series of years.
- MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT. 355

In a wet year more water enters the lake than leaves it, and there is
a net rise of the surface; in a dry year there is a net fall.. A series-of
wet years produce exceptionally high water and a series of dry years
exceptionally low, so that the entire range of water height is consider-
ably greater than the annual range. The recorded range for Lakes
Superior, Michigan, and Huron is between 5 and 6 feet; for Erie and
Ontario, between 4 and 5 feet.

The accompanying diagram (fig. 5) of the oscillations of Lake
Michigan illustrates the annual cycle and also the progressive changes
from year to year. Being compiled from monthly means of gauge
readings, it does not show tides and seiches nor the oscillations of
short period.

These various oscillations of the water, though differing widely in
amplitude, rate, and cause, yet coexist, and they make the actual
movement of the water surface highly complex. The complexity of
movement seriously interferes with the use of the water plane as a
datum level for the measurement of earth movements, and a system of
observations for that purpose needs to be planned with much care.
356 MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT

The main principles of such a system are, however, simple, and may
readily be stated. The most important is that the direct measurement

of the heights of individual points should not
be attempted, but comparison should always be
made between two points, their relative height
being measured by means of the water surface
used as a leveling instrument.

In the diagram, figure 6, A C B is the profile
of a lake basin, A and B are fixed objects on
opposite shores, and we will suppose the water
surface to have the position X X’. Assuming
the water in equilibrium, all parts of this surface
have the same height. If the height of A above
the water at X be accurately measured by the
surveyor’s level, and the height of B above the
water at X’ be similarly measured, then the dif-
ference between these two measurements gives
the difference in height between A and B. After
an interval of some years or decades the work is
repeated. The water surface then has some dif-
ferent position, Y Y’, and the heights measured
are of A above Y and of Babove Y’. The differ-
ence between the two heights gives, again, the
relative height of A and B; and if earth move-
ment has tilted the basin toward A or B, the
change in their relative height may be shown
by the difference in the two results of measure-
ment.

As the water is in fact not still, but in contin-
ual motion, the mere running of lines of level
from A and B to the water does not suffice, and
it is necessary to determine from observations
on the oscillating water surface what would be
its position if still. Such observations are made
by means of gages. These are of various forms,
but each consists essentially of a fixed point, or
zero, close by the water, and a graduated scale,
by means of which the vertical distance of the
water surface from the zero is measured.

Changes in the volume of the lake influence
all parts of its surface equally and at the same
time. To eliminate their effects from the meas-
urements it is only necessary that the gage

observations at the two stations be simultaneous. The effects of wind
waves can be prevented by breakwaters. Disturbances due to cur- -
rents propelled by strong winds can be avoided by choosing times
te
- MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT. 357

- when there is little wind. The effects of light winds can be approxi-
mately eliminated by taking the average of many observations, and so
can the effects of seiches and tides. The effects of differences of atmos-
pheric pressure can be computed from barometric measurements of air
pressure, and the proper corrections applied. It is also possible, by
the discussion of long series of observations at each station, to deter-
mine the local tidal effects and afterwards apply corrections; and the
land and sea breeze effect may be treated in the same way.

In the investigation I was able to make, consideration was given to
these various sources of error, but it was not practicable to take all
desirable measures for avoidance or correction, because the reading of
gages was only partly under my control. Gage stations have been
‘established on the Great Lakes at various times and at various places,
and the records of readings have been preserved. In some eases the
zeros of gages were connected by leveling with bench marks of a
permanent character, and in a few instances the gages themselves are
stable and enduring structures. The most important body of informa-
tion of this character is contained in the archives of the United States
Lake Survey, which were placed at my service by the Chief of Engi-

neers, United States Army. By searching the records I was able to
select certain pairs of stations at which the relative heights of
permanent points on the shore (equivalent to A and B of the diagram)
had been practically determined twenty or more years ago. At some
of these stations gages are still read; at others I established gages
and ran the leveling lines necessary to connect them with the old
benches. At all of them observations were maintained from July to
October, 1896, and these observations, in combination with the
levelings, afforded measurements that could be compared with those
made earlier, so as to discover changes due to earth movement.
It will not be necessary to give here the details of observation and
computation, as they are fully set forth in a paper soon to be printed
_by the Geological Survey,' but the general scope of the work may be
briefly outlined. As the tilting shown by the geologic data was toward
the south-southwest, stations were, so far as possible, selected to test
the question of motion in that direction. The most easterly pair were
Sacketts Harbor and Charlotte, New York, connected by the water
surface of Lake Ontario. (See map, fig. 7.) From observations by the
United States Lake Survey in 1874, it appeared that a bench mark on

the old light-house in Charlotte was then 18.531 feet above a certain
point on the Masonic Temple in Sacketts Harbor. In 1896 the measure-
ment was repeated, and the difference found to be 18.470 feet, the point
at Sacketts Harbor having gone up, as compared to the point at Char-
lotte, 0.061 foot, or about three-fourths of an inch. Similarly it was
found that between 1858 and 1895 a point in Port Colborne, at the head
of the Welland Canal, as compared to a point in Cleveland, Ohio, rose
0.239 foot, or nearly 3 inches. Between 1876 and 1896 a point at Port
Austin, Michigan, on the shore of Lake Huron, as compared to a point
in Milwaukee, on the shore of Lake Michigan, rose 0.137 foot, or 14 —

inches; and in the same period a point in Escanaba, at the north end
of Lake Michigan, as compared to the same point in Milwaukee, rose
0.161 foot, or about 2 inches.

There is no one of these determinations that is free from doubt;
buildings and other structures on which the benches were marked may
have settled, mistakes may have been made in the earlier leveling,
when there was no thought of subjecting the results to so delicate a
test, and there are various other possible sources of error to which no
checks can be applied; but the fact that all the measurements indicate
tilting in the direction predicted by theory inspires confidence in their
verdict. This confidence is materially strengthened when the numerical
results are reduced to a common unit and compared.

The stations of the several pairs are at different distances apart, the
directions of the lines connecting them make various angles with the the-
oretic direction of tilting, and the time intervals separating the meas-
urements are different. ‘To reduce the results to common terms, I have
computed from each the rate of tilting it implies in the theoretic direc-
tion, S. 27° W. In the sixth column of the preceding table the rate is
expressed as the change in relative height of the ends of a line 100 miles
long during a century.

Compared in this way, the results are remarkably harmonious, the
computed rates of tilting ranging only from 0.37 foot to 0.46 foot per
100 miles per century; and in view of this harmony it is not easy to
avoid the conviction that the buildings are firm and stable, that the
engineers ran tbeir level lines with accuracy, that all the various
possible accidents were escaped, and that we have here a veritable
record of the slow tilting of the broad lake-bearing plain.

The computed mean rate of tilting, 0.42 foot per 100 miles per cen-
tury, is not entitled to the same confidence as the fact of tilting. Its

“probable error, the mathematical measure of precision derived from

the discordance of the observational data, is rather large, being one-
ninth of the whole quantity measured. Perhaps it would be safe to
say that the general rate of tilting, which may or may not be uniform
for the whole region, falls between 0.30 and 0.55 foot.

While the credit of formulating the working hypothesis or geologic
prediction which has thus been verified by measurement belongs to
Spencer, it is proper to note that the fundamental idea of modern
differential earth movement in the Great Lakes region was announced
much earlier by G. R. Stuntz, a Wisconsin surveyor. In a paper com-
municated tothe American Association for the Advancement of Science
in 1869, he cites observations tending to show that in 1852-53 the water
of Lake Superior stood abnormally high at the west end, while it was
unusually low at the east, and he infers that the land is not stable.

The geographic effects of the tilting are of scientific and economic
importance. Evidently the height of lake water at a lake’s outlet is
regulated by the discharge and is not affected by slow changes in the
attitude of the basin, but at other points of the shore the water
360 MODIFICATION OF GREAT LAKES BY EARTH MOVEMENT.

advances or retreats as the basin is tipped. Consider, for example,
Lake Superior. On the map (fig. 7) a line has been drawn through the
outlet at the head of St. Marys River in a direction at right angles to
the direction of tilting. All points on this line, called the isobase of the
outlet, are raised or lowered equally by the tilting and are unchanged
with reference to one another. All points southwest of it are lowered,
the amount varying with their distances from the line, and all points to
the northeast are raised. The water, always holding its surface level
and alwaysregulated in volume by the discharge at the outlet, retreats
from the rising northeast coasts and encroaches on the sinking south-
west coasts. Assuming the rate of tilting to be 0.42 foot per 100 miles
per century, the mean lake level isrising at Duluth 6 inches per century
and falling at Heron Bay 5 inches. Where the isobase intersects the
northwestern shore, which happens to be at the international boundary,
there is no change.

Lake Ontario lies altogether southwest of the isobase of its outlet,
and the water is encroaching on all its shores. The same tilting that
enlarged it from the area marked by the dotted line of figure 2 is still
increasing its extent. The estimated vertical rise at Hamilton is 6
inches per century. The whole coast of Lake Erie also is being sub-
merged, the estimated rate at ‘Toledo and Sandusky being 8 or 9 inches
per century.

The isobase of the double lake Huron-Michigan passes southwest of
Lake Huron and crosses Lake Michigan. All coasts of Lake Huron
are therefore rising aS compared to the outlet, and the consequent
apparent lowering of the mean water surface is estimated at 6 inches
per century for Mackinac and at 10 inches for the mouth of the French
River, on Georgian Bay. In Lake Michigan the line of no change
passes near Manistee, Mich. At Escanaba the estimated fall of the
water is 4 inches per century; at Milwaukee the estimated rise is 5 or
6 inches, and at Chicago between 9 and 10 inches.

These slow changes of mean water level are concealed from ordinary
observation by the more rapid and impressive changes due to variations
of volume, but they are worthy of consideration in the planning of
engineering works of a permanent character, and there is at least one
place where their influence is of moment to a large community. The
city of Chicago is built on a smooth plain, little above the high-water
level of Lake Michigan. Every decade the mean level of the water is
anu inch higher, and the margin of safety is so narrow that inches are
valuable. Already the older part of the city has lifted itself several.
feet to secure better drainage, and the time will surely come when other
measures of protection are imperatively demanded.

Looking to the more distant future, we may estimate the date at
which the geographic revolution prophesied by Spencer will occur.
Near Chicago, as already mentioned, is an old channel made by the
outlet of a glacial lake. The bed of the channel at the summit of the

pass is about 8 feet above the mean level of Lake Michigan and 5 feet
above the highest level. In five or six hundred years (assuming the
estimated rate of tilting) high stages of the lake will reach the pass,
and the artificial discharge by canal will be supplemented by an inter-
mittent natural discharge. In one thousand years the discharge will
occur at ordinary lake stages, and after fifteen hundred years it will be
continuous. In about two thousand years the discharge from Lake
Michigan-Huron-Erie, which will then have substantially the same
level, will be equally divided between the western outlet at Chicago
and the eastern at Buffalo. In twenty-five hundred years the Niagara
River will have become an intermittent stream, and in three thousand
years all its water will have been diverted to the Chicago outlet—the
Illinois River, the Mississippi River, and the Gulf of Mexico.

THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.!

By J. W. GREGORY, D.Se.

THE VARIATIONS OF TOPOGRAPHIC FORM.

Despite the extreme variability in the shapes of the continents and
their apparently capricious distribution, geographers of all ages have
believed that the arrangement of land and water on the globe is based
on a regular plan. The plan can, of course, only be recognized in
broad outline, for the shape of the land masses depends on the struc-
ture of the earth forms, which vary indefinitely. Intricate mountain-
valley systems open out to wide-flung rolling prairie, stoneless alluvial
flats are broken by the crags of rock ridges, voleanic cones stand
isolated like pyramids, while mountain chains run thousands of miles
unbroken. Such contrasts are natural, as the land forms are the result
of the struggle of complex forces with varying powers of attack against
complex rock masses formed of materials having varying powers of
resistance. Coast lines, for example, project where hard rocks repel
the surf, where rivers deposit alluvium more quickly than the tide can
remove it, or where the winds build up sand dunes, whose very weakness
disarms the waves. Coast lines are indented where soft beds crumble
under frost and rain, and where dominant winds, the inset of an ocean
current, or an undulation on the sea floor directs a jet-like stream of
water against the shore. Topographical form depends on so many
incalculable, inconstant factors that the stages of its growth are often
now untraceable. The missing links of geographical evolution are
indeed as numerous as those of organic evolution, and the chapter of
accidents is invoked by geographers to explain difficulties analogous
to those for which naturalists appealed to the doctrine of special crea-
tion. But unexplained differences in the geographical units no more
disprove an orderly progress in the growth of the continents than the
existence of isolated, unexplained groups of animals is fatal to Dar-
winism. Such topographical differences are of secondary importance
in contrast to the numerous coincidences and repetitions of the same
essential form among the geographical units. Geographers accordingly

have believed that there is a hidden continental symmetry which, when
discovered, will explain the law that has determined the distribution
of land and water on the globe.

This idea dates from the dawn of geographical science. The early
classical geographers noticed how the seas radiated from the Levantine
area, and opened to a broad, boundless ocean. They accordingly
described the land of the globe as an island, floating on a vast surround-
ing sea, whence channels converged toward the hub of the classical
universe. This radial plan reappears in the medieval wheel maps in
which Jerusalem was accepted as the center of the world, whence the
main geographical lines radiated like the spokes of a wheel.

These systems fell forever on the discovery of America, which could
not be brought into conformity with the radial plan by even the
ingenious devices of medieval cartographers. Later on came an even
worse blow. Geologists showed that, instead of the land areas being
fixed and immutable, they are really more fickle and less enduring than
the sea. The distribution of land is therefore constantly changing,
owing to local variations in its level. The discovery of this truth
seemed to destroy the very basis of any possible earth plan. Indeed,
_ Lyellism, with its essential doctrine of the alternate elevation and
subsidence of the land under the agency of local causes, seemed incon-
sistent with the existence of any general cause governing the geo-
graphical evolution of the globe as a whole.

But a truer appreciation of this later knowledge did not confirm
these first deductions. America is now used as the typicai or, to borrow
a biological phrase, the schematic continent. And when, remembering
the probability of local variations in land level, allowance is made for
them, new resemblances are revealed, and exceptions that once were
serious difficulties are removed. For instance, the oceans all end in
triangles pointing to the north. This is the case with the Pacific, the
two sections of the Indian Ocean, and the basins of the Mediterranean.
The Atlantic alone is broadly open at its northern end. But Scotland
and Iceland are connected by a submerged ridge, which is said to be
capped by a line of old moraine. If this ridge were raised to sea level,
the Atlantic would conform to the general rule by tapering northward
to a point between Iceland and Greenland.

Similarly with the land masses. There seems at first sight no resem-
blanee in shape between the Old World and the New. But the Old
World is divided into halves by a band of lowland, which extends
southward from the Arctic Ocean to the Caspian, and northward from
the Arabian Sea up the Persian Gulf. There is evidence to show that
the sea recently covered these northern lowlands and occupied the
Persian depression; while somewhat earlier, in Miocene times, the
intervening ridge was also submerged. Restore these conditions, and ~
the continents would occur as three meridional belts, each broken
across by transverse Mediterranean seas, viz, North and South America
the geographical units.

separated by the Caribbean depression; HKurope and Africa (the
Kurafrica of Professor Lapworth) separated by the Mediterranean;
Asia and Australasia divided by the Malaysian folds.

Hence the oscillating character of the land, which appeared fatal to
the old faith in an earth plan, helps to justify it, now that oceanog-
raphy and geology have shown us how much to allow for the obscuring
action of these changes of level.

But it is inadvisable, in attempting to explain the existing plan of
the earth, to introduce any alterations in the distribution of land and
water. For, although a geologist may have no doubt about such
assumed changes, he can not expect geographers to have an equal
faith in them, or even to take much interest in a world thus modified.
The geographer is concerned with the existing arrangement of the
world, and not with the more or less problematical plans of former ages.
The introduction of earlier and more primitive geographical systems,
though it would simplify the question, is unnecessary, since the exist-
ence of a present earth plan is clearly revealed by three striking facts.

GEOGRAPHICAL SYMMETRY.

Two of these facts are stated in every geographical text-book.
They are evident on the most casual examination of a map. The first
is the concentration of land in the Northern and of sea in the Southern
Hemisphere. The second
is the triangular shape of

gular, with the bases to

it three oceans project northward into the angles between the conti-
nents. The belts of sea and land are fixed on the earth’s axis like a
pair of cogwheels with interlocking teeth. These two belts may be
referred to as the northern land belt and southern oceanic belt.

The third striking feature in the earth’s physiognomy is less con-
spicuous, but is even more significant. It is known as the antipodal

arrangement of oceans and continents. It is most easily recognized

by examination of a globe; but it can easily be illustrated by a plain
366 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

map. The antipodes of a point in the center of the continent of North
America occurs in the Indian Ocean; and if we mark on a map the
antipodes of all the points in North America, we should find that the
whole of that continent is exactly antipodal to the Indian Ocean.
Similarly, the elliptical mass of Europe and Africa is antipodal to the
central area of the Pacific Ocean; the comparatively small continent
Australia is antipodal to the comparatively small basin of the North
Atlantic; the South Atlantic corresponds—though less exactly—to the
eastern half of Asia; and the Arctic Ocean is precisely antipodal to
‘the antarctic land.

These, then, are the three fundamental facts in the existing plan of
the globe. Our main problem is, Why are the geographical elements
thus shaped and thus distributed ?

THE EARTH’S CONCENTRIC SHELLS.

It simplifies the statement of the problem to remember that the
earth consists of three parts: There is the vast unknown interior, or
‘‘centrosphere,” concerning which physicists have not come to any
unanimous decision, some saying that it is throughout solid and
rigid, others that it is partly fluid, and others again that it is partly
gaseous. This interior mass is inclosed by a shell formed of two layers,
the solid crust, or “lithosphere,” and the oceanic layer, or ‘“ hydro-
sphere.” Itis possible that at first the two layers of the shell were
regular and uniform, in which case the whole world was covered by a
universal ocean; but before the dawn of geological history this arange-
ment had been disturbed by the formation of irregularities in the
surface of the lithosphere. Dry land appeared at the areas of eleva-
tion,and the waters gathered together into the intervening depressions.

The problem, then, of the distribution of land and water on the
globe is the problem of the distribution of irregularities in the surface
of the lithosphere. Weare accordingly at once brought face to face
with the question, When were the existing irregularities made? If, as
many authorities say, these depressions date from the earliest days of
the earth’s history, and have lasted unchanged in position throughout
geological time, then we are thrown back upon some cause which
acted when the earth was in its infancy. In that case the question is
astronomical and physical, instead of geological and geographical.

PRE-GEOLOGICAL GEOGRAPHY.

There have been several attempts to solve the question astronom-
ically, of which the most important is that of Prof. G. H. Darwin.
According to his luminous theory the tidal action of the sun on the
viscous earth formed two protuberances at opposite points of the
equator; one of the protuberances broke away and solidified as the
moon, which revolved round the earth much nearer than at present.
As a new equatorial protuberance formed the moon pulled it backward,
thus causing a series of wrinkles in the earth’s crust, which persist as
‘THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 367

the main structural lines of the continents. These wrinkles ran at first
‘north and south from the equator. But, owing to the moon’s strong
pull on the equatorial girdle, this part of the earth would tend to revolve
more slowly than the polar regions. Hence the primitive wrinkles were
deformed; instead of being meridional in direction, they would trend
northeasterly in the northern hemisphere, and southeasterly in the
southern hemisphere. Professor Darwin points out that some of the
most striking geographical lines on the earth run in accordance with this
plan. He instances the eastern coast of North America, the western
coast of Europe, part of the coast of China, and the southern part of
South America. But, with characteristically Darwinian frankness, he
does not overpress the facts, admits that the resemblances are not so
convincing as they might be, and that some cases—e. g., the western
coast of North America—are absolutely inconsistent with the scheme.

THE OBLIQUE COURSE OF THE MAIN GEOGRAPHICAL LINES. (AFTER PRINZ.)

Another theory that attributes the formation of the main geographical
‘lines to pregeological incidents is given in a paper by Prinz, “Sur les
similitudes que presentent les cartes terrestes et Planétaires,” which
elaborates and gives an astronomical basis to ideas previously suggested
by Lowthian Green and Daubrée. His theory is that the northern
part of the earth had a lower angular velocity than the equatorial and
southern regions. Therefore the land masses in the southern hemi-
sphere were gradually pushed forward toward the east. The line
between the northern retarded hemisphere aud the southern swifter
hemisphere is the great line of weakness and fracture that runs from
the Caribbean along the Mediterranean, down the Persian Gulf and
across Malaysia. Prinz has drawn a map (fig. 2) showing how the
main geographical lines agree with his assumed lines of torsion.
368 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

This map is interesting, for these primitive torsion wrinkles must
have been formed in the same period as Professor Darwin’s primitive
tidal wrinkles. It is significant that the lines do not correspond. The
chief geographical lines which Darwin claims as his primitive wrinkles
are inexplicable on Prinz’s theory, and the great lines which Prinz
claims to support his wrinkling are opposed to those of Darwin. The
geographical primitive lines of the two theories are often contradictory.

A third theory assigning the geographical distribution to very
ancient causes has been proposed by Professor Lapworth. In an
address to the geographical section of the British Association in 1892,
and in a brilliant lecture on ‘The face of the earth,” delivered to the
Royal Geographical Society in 1894, Lapworth attributed the arrange-
ment of oceans and continents to an intercrossing series of primitive
earth folds. The oceans, according to this theory, occupy ancient basins
of depression; and the continental masses are domes of elevation.

‘The surface of the earth crust at the present day,” says Lapworth,
‘is most simply regarded as the surface of a continuous sheet which
has been warped up by two sets of undulations crossing each other at
right angles * * * The one set ranges parallel with the equator,
and the other ranges from pole to pole.” Professor Lapworth contends
that the intersecting of two simultaneous orthogonal sets of undulations
explains the forms and dispositions of the continents, the triangular
shapes of their extremities, the diagonal trends of their shores, and
the course of the linear archipelagoes. In some interesting diagrams
he suggests why the intersecting nodal lines which mark the divisions
between the areas of elevation and of depression should coincide with
the steep slopes that separate the ocean floors and the continental
platforms; and why the existing shore lines should so often run
diagonally between the meridians and parallels.

This theory, and that of Sir John Lubbock, which also attributes the
continental forms to a double intercrossing series of folds, have the
advantage over the astronomical theories of more detailed agreement
with geographical facts; but Professor Lapworth has not, so far as I
am aware, explained what caused his intersecting folds. His theory is
accordingly less complete than the others, as it is rather a statement
of facts than an explanation of causes.

These suggestive theories are open to one objection which seems fatal
to their application to the existing geographical plan. We should
expect from them that the main geographical structure lines in the
northern and southern hemispheres should be either symmetrically
arranged or continuous on both sides of the equator. But that the land
systems of the two hemispheres are asymmetrical is the most glaring
factin geography. It may be urged that the primitive folding, wrinkling,
and torsion formed a symmetrical or continuous land system, and that °
the asymmetrical arrangement is due to later movements. In that case
the theories are geographically inadequate, because they give no expla-
nation of how the existing geographical asymmetry was developed.
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 369

But there is another and still more serious objection which applies
toallthreetheories. They not only explain too little, but they explain too
much. The primitive lines of these systems often coincide with features
_ of modern development, and are inconsistent with the old-established
geographical arrangements. For instance, Professor Darwin quotes
the trend of the western coast of Kurope from Spain to Norway as in
accordance with his scheme. Prinz makes the primitive line here run
exactly at right angles to Darwin’s line; and geological evidence favors
Prinz. The coast line from Spain to Norway is almost certainly of
modern date, while the lines of wrinkling, both Hercynian and Alpine,
run transversely to the direction which they ought to have followed if
due to tidal strain. Moreover, Professor Darwin quotes the western
coast of North America as inconsistent with his theory; but that coast
is parallel to a line of primitive wrinkling, for there is an Archean pro-
taxis to the coast ranges and Rocky Mountains.

Prinz’s torsion wrinkles are no better. The most striking case of
apparent agreement between his theory and geography is the trend of
the Andes and Rocky Mountains. Professor Lapworth also lays stress
on “the great Rocky Mountain-Andes fold * * * the Jongest and
most continuous crust-fold of the present day.”' The agreement was
important so long as the Rocky Mountains and the Andes were regarded
as a single mountain system, connected into a continuous line by a
mountain axis running north and south across Central America. But
that axial mountain chain in Central America is a myth. Central
America is traversed by a series of ridges which run east and west,
and not north and south.2 The watershed, it is true, runs along the
Pacific border, but that is due to a movement later than the mountain
ridges which are thus truncated. The continuation of the Andes is in
the mountains of Venezuela, not in North America or the Sierra Nevada.
The Andes and the mountain system of the Western States of America
are essentially distinct; they differ in every important respect, geolo-
gical structure, geographical characters, and dates of formation. Any
theory which assigns the Andes and the great mountain series on
the western coast of North America to a common origin is thereby
prejudiced, instead of being supported.

These three theories assign the earth plan to a venerable antiquity;
but there is a fourth theory, which carries it back to an antiquity even
more venerable. Lord Kelvin attributes the oceanic and continental
areas to a chemical segregation in the gaseous nebula which was the
parent of the earth. According to this theory “‘ Kurope, Asia, Africa,

'The term ‘‘Rocky Mountains” is here apparently used for the Sierra Nevada and
Coast Range series of British Columbia. ‘The true Rocky Mountains are at a great
distance (ranging up to 1,000 miles) from the Pacific coast, the trend of which they

America, Australia, Greenland, and the Antarctic continent, and the
Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic ocean depths, as we know them at
present,” were all marked out in the primeval gaseous nebula. These
gaseous continents condensed to liquid continents, marked off from the
suboceanic areas by chemical differences; and these liquid continents
were fixed as the solid continents, heightened by shoaling as the molten
globe and its last lava ocean solidified.

That theory appears probable with one verbal amendment—the sub-
stitution of theterm ‘ archean blocks” for continents. That these

archean blocks—the earth’s great corner stones—were embryonically
outlined by chemical segregations in the molten or gaseous stages of
the earth seems probable. But these archzean corner stones, though
the foundations of the continents, are not the continents. Lord Kel-
vin’s theory suggests no explanation why chemical segregations shouid
have assumed the shapes of the continents, so that his explanation
rests on an unexplained cause; and even if his theory be amended by
application to the archzan blocks instead of to the continents, the
theory is geographically insufficient, as it does not show the relation
between the archzan blocks and the existing continents.

THE PERMANENCE OF CONTINENTS.

That Lord Kelvin’s nebulous segregations, Professor Darwin’s primi-
tive wrinkling, Sir John Lubbock and Professor Lapworth’s double
folds are all true causes seems probable. What is doubtful is whether
any extensive trace of their influence can be discerned in the present dis-
tribution of land and water. A map of the world in early Cambrian
times might show the influence of these pregeological incidents; but
their geographical effects seem to have been obliterated by the changes
of geological times.

Reference to such changes reminds us that we can not assume their
occurrence without considering the unending controversy as to the
Supposed permanence of oceans and continents.

There are, it must be conceded, many weighty arguments in favor of

the permanence hypothesis. Many of the last great mountain foldings

follow the lines of much older movements; and if the mountain axes,
the “backbones of the continents,” have occupied the same positions,
why not also the continents molded upon them? Again, some of the
great mountain chains, such as the Andes, run parallel to the nearest
Shore line, as if the movements that formed them had been deflected
by the ocean basin.

The character of the ocean floors, moreover, suggests that they have
never been continental, as they are at present covered by deposits not
known in the interior of the continents, and as they are supported by
material much heavier than that which forms the foundations of the

-continents.

These arguments, however, are not conclusive. Great earth move-
ments of one date often cut obliquely and transversely across those of
earlier periods. Thus the old northwesterly and southeasterly move-
ments of France and Spain have been cut across by the east and west-
ern movements of the Pyrenean-Alpine system. Mountain axes have
not always been deflected by or limited by existing ocean basins. Thus
the north Atlantic basin cuts directly across the old Hercynian moun-
tain chains, which may at one time have extended across the whole
Atlantic channel. This is rendered probable by three lines of evidence.
Thus in northwestern France, and in the south of the British Isles, there
is a Series of ranges trending north of west which is cut off abruptly
by the Atlantic slope. On the opposite shore of the Atlantic in New-
foundland there +s a similar series of truncated ranges formed at the
same age as those of western Europe, and having the same trend.
Bertrand maintains (1887) that the resemblance between the opposite
mountain series is so striking that they should be regarded as parts of
one mountain system, of which the central part has been sunk below
the Atlantic. The well-known telegraph plateau on which the cables
rest may mark the site of this sunken land. Paleontological evidence
also supports the formation of the Atlantic by subsidence; for a shal-

low water, subtropical, marine fauna ravged from the Mediterranean
to the Caribbean, and can only have crossed along a belt of shallow
water in tropical or subtropical latitudes. Direct evidence of the
existence of Shallow water, continental deposits of the age required is
given by the Azores, which, although now separated from Europe by
a deep depression, contain shallow water deposits with fossils of the
Mediterranean fauna.

Thus there is strong evidence to show that the Atlantic, in its
present form, is of no great geological antiquity, and Suess’s theory of
its origin continually gains stronger support. Similar, though less
compiete, evidence shows that the other ocean basins have been broken
up along certain lines, and emphatically denies their entire permanence
throughout geological times.

ELIE DE BEAUMONT’S “PENTAGONAL RESEAU.”

Hence, if the ocean basins were not formed pregeologically, but
have grown from the changes that have occurred during the long ages
of geological time, then we must seek for a cause that has acted con-
tinuously and is acting to-day. A more permanent cause is supplied
by the contraction of the earth’s crust, as the globe gradually cools.
Since the cold, hard erust is less plastic than the hotter interior, it is
necessarily crumpled as it is forced into a smaller space.

This idea is well known, as it has been invoked by geologists to
explain the formation of folded mountain chains. That the mountain
systems of the world were formed by this agency is improbable; but it
is perhaps still too much to say that it is impossible. For Prof. G. H.
Darwin has suggested that the contractility of the rocky crust has
been exaggerated, and it has been shown that Reade’s leve! of no strain
may lie much deeper than was at first thought.

That secular contraction is the direct cause of the great fold-moun-
tain systems is however less widely believed by geologists than it once
was; but it may have an important influence in determining their
direction. The trend of the great chains of fold mountains is to us a
significant question, because there is much truth in the phrase, pro-
verbial since its use in 1682 by Burnet in his ‘ Theory of the earth,”
which describes the mountain chains as the “backbones of the conti-
nents.” The first geological attempt to explain the plan of the earth
was based on this belief. The author of this system was the French —
geologist Elie de Beaumont, whose theory of geomorphogeny was stated
at length in his “‘ Notice sur les systemes de montagnes” (3 vols., Paris,
1852). This famous theory was bused on a correlation of the mountain
chains by means of their orientation. Elie de Beaumont accepts the
view that the earth consists of a thin rigid crust surrounding a fluid,
solidifying interior. The crust being thin, it necessarily collapses as
the internal mass contracts. He assumes that these collapses occur at
intervals of time. and that at these collapses the crust is broken along
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. oto

lines of weakness, which are crumpled up into mountain chains. He
assumes that for practical purposes the earth’s crust may be taken as
homogeneous; hence that the fractures of the crust would be regularly
distributed, and those of successive periods would cross one another
along the lines of a regular symmetrical network.

Among the regular simple geometrical forms that known as the
pentagonal dodecahedron, which is inclosed by twelve equal regular
pentagons, possesses an exceptionable degree of bilateral symmetry,
i. e., it can be cut into exactly similar halves in an unusually large
number of directions. Sections along any of the edges of any of the
pentagons and through the center of the pentagonal dodecahedron
divide it into equal and similar halves. So, also, do sections from the
center of the pentagons to any of the angles, and likewise sections
across the pentagons from alternate angles. Each face of a pentagonal
dodecahedron may therefore be divided by fifteen planes of symmetry.

A sphere may be described upon the pentagonal dodecahedron, so
that all the corners (or, to use the correct term, solid angles) occur in
the surface of the sphere. By joining the corners by lines the sphere
is marked off into twelve spherical pentagons, which possess the same
amount of symmetry as the plane pentagons. The lines where these
planes of symmetry cut the surface of the sphere form a network of
spherical triangles. Such a network Elie de Beaumont called his
pentagonal network, and he used it in the following way: He studied
the mountain ranges of the world, and by elaborate calculations showed
their relative directions at a few localities which he chose as centers of
comparison. He found that many mountain ranges have the same
orientation and that others cross the first set at definite regular angles.
The directions of the different sets of mountain ranges coincide with
the lines of his pentagonal network. Elie de Beaumont claimed that
the mountains whose directions are parallel! were formed at the same
date. Successive mountain-forming movements raised chains parallel
to different edges of the network, and thus the intersecting mountain
lines of the world, and consequently the forms of the continents, were
determined.

Elie de Beaumont had no difficulty in pointing out striking coinci-
dences between important geographical lines and his pentagonal net-
work. Thus the Mediterranean volcanic axis, passing through the
Grecian archipelago, Etna, and Teneriffe, is parallel to the Alpine
chain and at right angles to the circle through Etna, Vesuvius, Ice-
land, and the Sandwich Isles. He was able to show a close geometrical
relationship between those lines and the line of the Andes, with the
pentagon that covers Europe. That the earth is traversed by great
intersecting lines is undeniable. KE. g., Daubrée showed that the valley
system of northern France follows a line of rectangular fractures, which

he called diaclases. The directions of the Greenland fiords is deter-
mined by a similar series of intersecting diaclastic fractures. Bertrand
has shown that the movements in the Paris Basin, the North Sea, and
English Channel have followed a double set of orthogonal intersecting
lines.

But that the fracture lines or lines of weakness in the earth’s crust
should intersect more or less rectangularly is natural on any theory
of their formation. And such coinei-
dences as those pointed out by Elie de
Beaumont in support of his system are
inevitable in so crumpled a globe as
ours, but they are not sufficiently nu-
merous to be convincing, especially in
face of the fundamental differences be-
tween the facts of geography and Elie
de Beaumont’s elaborate artificial sys-
tem. His theory could only be applied
to a symmetrical world;' in a dodeca-
hedron the opposite faces are always
similar and parallel; in Elie de Beau-
mont’s network the antipodal areas are
always Similar. But, as we have seen,
the fundamental fact in the plan of the
world is that opposite areas are dis-
similar. In crystallographic language,
the lithosphere is hemihedral, not holo-
hedral, and no scheme based on a holo-
hedral form will serve. It is the rec-
ognition of this principle that led to
the next great advance. —

his predecessor, Green assumes that the earth isa spheroid based on a
regular geometrical figure. He adopted as his base the apparently
hopelessly unsuitable figure of the tetrahedron, which is contained
within four equal similar triangles. This form, with its four faces, six
sharp edges, and four solid corners, does not conform to the ordinary
conception of the figure of the globe. Any comparison between them
_looks ridiculous. Butif we place a three-sided pyramid on each side
of the tetrahedron, its proportions are nearer those of a globe; and if
these pyramids had elastic sides, so that they could be blown out and
the faces thus made curved, then the tetrahedron would become sphe-
roidal and even spherical. Conversely, if a hollow sphere be gradually

exhausted of air, the external pressure may force in the shell at four
mutually equidistant points, and, by the flattening of these four faces,
make it tend toward atetrahedral form. Now thetetrahedral theory does
not regard the world as a regular tetrahedron with four plane faces. It
considers that the lithosphere has been subjected to a slight tetrahe-
dral deformation, to an extent indeed only faintly, if at all, indicated
by geodetic measurements, but yet easily recognizable owing to its
influence on the distribution of land and water. As the centers of the
flattened faces are nearer the earth’s center of mass than the edges, the
water will collect upon them. The ratio of the area of land to that of
water on the globe isas 2 to 5. If on a model of a tetrahedron we color
the five-sevenths of the surface that is nearest the center, the colored

areas would show where the water would collect if the earth were a
stationary tetrahedron. On the upper face there is a large central coi-
ored area in the position of the Arctic Ocean. It is surrounded by a
land belt, from which three projections run southward down the three
lateral edges. These three land areas taper southward to a point,
below which is a complete belt of sea. South of that, again is our
fourth projecting corner, which is above the water level, and is the
Antaretic Continent. So that on the model the general plan of the
arrangement of land and water is identical with its actual distribution
on the globe. For the land occurs as three triangular equidistant con-
tinents, united above into aring and tapering southward; there is a
great excess of water in the Southern and of land in the Northern
Hemisphere; and land and water are antipodal, since in a tetrahedron
a corner is always opposite a flat face.

But of course in the earth the faces are not flat, but are convex. If
the flat faces be replaced by projecting pyramids with curved faces, so
that the form is globular, the arrangement of land and water remains
the same, but the shore lines are more complex. Green has shown
what the shapes of the land and water areas would be in such a tetra-
hedron. The resemblance between his diagrammatic continent and
Africa and South America, and between his ocean and either the
Pacific, Indian Ocean, and South Atlantic, is very striking.

THE TETRAHEDRAL COURSE OF GEOGRAPHICAL LINES.

The agreement between the facts of geography and the tetrahedral
theory goes further. The four faces of a tetrahedron meet along six
edges, which should be lines of elevation on a globe. The trace of the
edges of a tetrahedron on a surrounding sphere form a circle in the
Northern Hemisphere, and three vertical or meridional edges meeting at
the South Pole. In the earth the major watersheds have exactly this
arrrangement. The great watershed of Eurasia, dividing the northern
and southern drainages, runs, not along the main mountain axis, but
far to the north of it, between the parallels of 50° and 60°. The
northern and southern slopes of North America are separated by a
divde along the same latitude. The southern watersheds, instead of
following the lines of highest mountains, or the middle line of the
continents, run close to the coast lines; the three watersheds mark
the three vertical tetrahedral edges, and they occur at almost the the-
oretical distances, 120° apart.

Similarly with the mountain chains. As Sir John Lubbock has
pointed out, ‘In the Northern Hemisphere we have chains of mountains
running east and west—the Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Himalayas,
etc.—while in the Southern Hemisphere the great chains run north and
south—the Andes, the African ridge, and the grand boss which forms
Australia and Tasmania.” That is to say, the northern mountains are
parallel to the upper edges and the southern mountains parallel to the
meridional edges of the tetrahedron.
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. St

THE CAUSE OF THE TETRAHEDRAL PLAN.

The statement that the elevations of the lithosphere are tetrahedral
in arrangement is not a hypothesis, but a simple statement of geo-
graphical fact. Is the fact a mere coincidence? On the contrary, there
are good reasons why the earth should acquire such a tetrahedroid
symmetry. When the earth solidified it would (neglecting the influ-
ence of rotation) have contracted into a spherical shape. It would have
tended to acquire this form because the sphere is the body which
incloses the greatest volume for a given surface. But as the earth
contracts it tends to acquire a shape in which there is a greater surface
in proportion to its bulk. Now, among the regular geometrical figures

with approximately equal axes the tetrahedron is that which contains
the smallest volume for a given surface. Hence every hard-shelled
body which is diminishing in size, owing to internal contraction, is con-
stantly tending to become tetrahedral in form. Fairburn’s experiments
(quoted by Green) illustrate this tetrahedral collapse for short tubes;
and that it is considered probable by some geodists is shown by the
following quotation from EB. D. Preston:

“ Nothing is more in accordance with the action of physical laws than
that the earth is contracting in approximately a tetrahedral form

tangential strains; for, while the sphere is of all geometrical bodies the
one with a minimum surface for a given capacity, the tetrahedron gives
a maximum surface for the same condition. Experiments on iron
tubes, on gas bubbles rising in water, and on rubber balloons all tend
to bear out the assumption that a homogeneous sphere tends to contract
into a tetrahedron.”

THE EARTH A GEOID.

But it may be said this tetrahedral theory is impossible, because we

know from our elementary text-books that the earth is not tetrahedral,
but is an oblate-spheroid—that is to say, a sphere slightly flattened at
the poles.
. The oblate spheriod is no doubt the form that rotation would have
caused the earth to assume as it solidified if the earth were quite
homogeneous. But the earth is not homogeneous; it varies in strength
and density, and an unequal load on the earth in any area leads
to a divergence there from the circular shape. It is, I believe, now
universally admitted that the earth is flattened laterally at the equator
as well as at the poles. The question was long disputed between the
astronomers, who, from theoretical considerations, declared what the
shape of the world ought to be, and the geographers, whose measure-
_ments showed what the shape actually was. There is now a general
agreement that the geographers were right; that the equatorial section
of the earth is elliptical, similar to a section through the earth passing
across the poles. The earth is therefore not a true spheriod, and it
was accordingly regarded as an ellipsoid with three unequal axes.
But there is good reason to believe that the earth is not even an
ellipsoid, for the Northern and Southern hemispheres are unlike, and the
earth is therefore shaped like a peg top. This is shown in two ways.
It is a well-known property of the ellipse that degrees measured along
the flatter side are longer than degrees measured near the sharper end.
It was by proving that’a degree of latitude in Lapland is longer than a
degree of latitude in Kcuador that the French astronomers in the seven-
teenth century definitely proved the earth’s flattening at the poles. In
continuation of these observations La Caille, in 1751, measured the
length of a degree at the Cape of Good Hope. His measurements
showed that the Southern Hemisphere was also flattened, but to a
different extent than the Northern Hemisphere. This anomalous result
of La Caille’s was confirmed and extended by Maclear.

The inequality of the two hemispheres has also been shown by the
variations of gravity in the two hemispheres, which, as it is more
easily tested, has been more widely applied. The principle is simple.
A pendulum swings more rapidly the nearer it is brought to the center
of the earth. A pendelum swings more slowly on a mountain top than
at sea level. It was because Richer, in 1672, found that a clock which
kept correct time in Paris lost two minutes a day in French Guiana that
the polar flattening was first suspected. So many observations have
been made that maps have been compiled showing the variation of the
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 319

force of gravity throughout the globe. Figure 6 is a copy of Stein-
hauser’s map, in which the variation of gravity is illustrated by showing
how many millimeters aave to be added to the length of a pendulum
which beats seconds at the equator to make it vibrate at the same
rate elsewhere. In both Northern and Southern hemispheres the
second-beating pendulum has to be steadily lengthened as we approach
the poles, but the deviation is at a different rate for the two hemi-
spheres. The surface of the Southern Hemisphere does not approach
the earth’s center of mass at the same rate as the Northern Hemisphere.
If the earth’s center of mass is at its geometrical center, then the
earth’s form is elongated southward like a peg top. It is often held
that the earth’s center of mass is to the south of its center of form,
because of the accumulation of water in the Southern Hemisphere. It
is held that the water is piled up there owing to the greater density
of the Southern Hemisphere. If that be the case, then the peg-top
elongation is all the greater.

Moreover, there is evidence to show that the earth’s figure is still
more irregular than that of a peg top.!. Sir John Herschel, although
taking the astronomical side in the controversy, aptly stated the facts in
the statement that “the earth is earth-shaped.” Listing’s name of
geoid, which expresses this view, has now supplanted the old oblate
spheroid from everything except the text-books. That there are local
deformations in the earth’s shape is demonstrated by the differences
between the astronomical and trigonometrical determination of posi-
tions. Places have two different longitudes, the astronomical longitude
obtained by astronomical observations, and geodetic longitudes deter-
mined by terrestial measurements; the differences are often consider-
able. It was calculated, e. g., that the trigonometrical and astronomical
determination of the stations used in the delimitation of the Canadian
and United States frontier should have agreed within 40 feet, or 0.4 of a
second of arc; but the average error was more than five times as great,
and ran up to eighteen times as much as it should have been.

Astronomical determinations, moreover, are often not only incon-
sistent with geographical measurements, but they are often inconsistent
with themselves. Jor example, one of the most refined estimations
of longitude that has yet been attempted, is the series undertaken
by the “ K. K. topographische militiir Institut” of Vienna. To insure
accuracy during these observations the most elaborate precautions
were taken. Corrections were even made for the effect of the doses of
quinine which the astronomers took when working in malarial climates.
In one of the series of observations the difference in longitude between
Vienna and Milan was determined first directly, and then by determin-
ing the difference between Vienna and Brescia and that between
Brescia and Milan. But in spite of all the care the results did not
tally. The sum of the two differences was not the same as the single

' As Professor Darwin suggests, potato-shaped would be a more correct simile.
380 THE PLAN OF YHE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

difference. The whole, in fact, in this case was less than the sum of its
parts.

To astronomers it may seem an unnecessary waste of time to devote
so much to proving these deformations from the “ spheroid of reference.”
But as the idea is less familiar to geographers and geologists, the
insistence of this deformation may not be useless. It may be worth
while adding a quotation from Prof. C. A. Young,! to show that the
spheroid of reference is only a convenient assumption. ‘ On the whole,”
says Professor Young, ‘‘astronomers are disposed to take the ground
that since no regular geometrical solid whatsoever can absolutely repre-
sent the form of the earth, we may as well assume a regular spheroid
for the standard surface, and consider all variations from it as local
phenomena, like hills and valleys.”

As deviations from the assumed spheroid of reference exist, it remains
to inquire whether there is any evidence that they agree in position
and arrangement with the theory of the tetrahedral] deformation of
the lithosphere. -

The evidence already quoted of the dissimilarity between the northern
and southern hemispheres and the elongation of the latter, is geodetic
proof of the northern flattening and the antarctic projection, i. e., of
one face and one tetrahedral corner.

The three flattened lateral faces and three projecting vertical edges
are sufficiently demonstrated by the three great oceans and the land-
lines that divide them. Practically, all the theories agree upon that
point. It is well known that gravity is greater than was expected at
most oceanic islands. Lallemand and de Lapparent have suggested
that this is due to those islands being below the level of the ordinarily
accepted figure of the earth, and therefore nearer the earth’s center of
gravity.” Fisher has suggested that the Pacific Ocean is the hollow
left by the loss of the material which forms the moon. Faye has
explained the ocean basins and the greater density of the crust below
them as due to more rapid refrigeration below the cold oceanic abysses.
According, therefore, to Faye, the rocks below the oceans contracted
more than those below the continents, became denser, and accordingly
sank.

Thus from all points of view the three oceans represent areas of
depression, and the three land lines of South America, Africa, and
Australasia mark intervening projections. The oceans mark the low
areas in the lithosphere as obviously as the bubble of a spirit level
marks its higher end; and they give, theretore, evidence of the trian-
gular lateral flattening of the southern half of the globe.

But as, on the mathematical figure of the earth, such lateral flatten-

1C, A. Young, General Astronomy, p. 101. 1889.

2This explanation is inadequate, as it does not explain the deviation of the pendu-
lum on coast line toward the ocean. The excess vertical attraction of the islands
has been explained as due to the attraction of the mass of the island and its base.
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 381

ing 1s more improbable than variations along the axis of rotation, let us
consider whether there is any geodetic proof of these flattened faces
and projecting edges.

There has been a long controversy as to whether Bessel’s or Clark’s
ellipsoid better represents the figure of the earth. Clark’s figure was
the later in date, and is generally considered as the more exact.
_Helmert therefore expresses some surprise that the gravitational
observations in central Europe along the fifty-second parallel of north
latitude agree with Bessel’s curve better than they do with Clark’s;
this is the case all across the area on which Bessel’s own work was
done. But as soon as we get into the Volga Basin, the gravity line
diverges from Bessel’s curve and approaches that of Clark. The
change comes due north of the Eurafrican meridional edge. The
anomalies are at once removed if we assume that both ellipsoids are
locally correct; that Bessel’s curve is true for Europe, and Clark’s
correct for Asia; and that the two merge into one another north of the
line of the Eurafrican tetrahedral edge.

On the tetrahedral theory there ought to be a projection north of this
tetrahedral edge. And gravity determinations show a great deficiency
in gravity in western Russia in an appropriate area along the Volga
Basin. It is true that the figures have been queried. Thereisa natural
tendency to query all facts that do not agree with theory, and the
notes of interrogation in this case may illustrate that tendency. But
on the view that there is an upward deformation of the earth in this
area, the anomalous deficiency in gravity observations is at once
explained.

It may be replied that the existence of a normal gravity attraction
at Moscow negatives the assumption of a superficial deformation, but
the relative excess of attraction there is possibly due to the outcrop of
Paleozoic rocks, of greater density than the loose sediments of the
Russian lowlands.

Passing from Russia to the area in North America, where the next
tetrahedral corner should occur, thereis another area of deficient gravity,
which may also be due to that area being a tetrahedral elevation. The
deficiency is explained by the assumption of vast subterranean blocks
of very light material. But that explanation is prohibited in the Rus-
sian case, since, aS Helmert has shown, the deviations of a plumb line
from the vertical are inconsistent with the existence of such blocks.
In reference to the North American case Helmert has remarked that
the light subterranean blocks must descend for several kilometers; and
Mendenhall has shown that no reasonable assumption will suffice to
explain the facts.

It would be too much to claim that geodetical evidence at present
available proves the tetrahedal theory, for accurate data are not yet
available for a sufficient proportion of the earth to show whether the
mInajor deviations are based on aregular plan; but papers, such as that
382 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

of Mr. E. D. Preston, show that geodesists are more inclined to regard
the theory with favor. Itis at least clear that geodesy does not dis-
prove the hypothesis, and that some puzzling geodetic anomalies receive
a simple solution if the theory be true.

GEOLOGY AND THE TETRAHEDRAL COIGNS AND EDGES.

Let us now turn to geology, to see if its evidence as to the past his-
tory of the world refutes or supports the theory.

The geological evidence ought to be of especial value, as we should
expect it to determine the position of the tetrahedral coigns on the face
of the earth.'

If the tetrahedral theory be true, the four tetrahedral coigns should
be areas of unusual stability and strength. Comparison of the three
meridional land belts shows that each of them begins in the north with
a vast block of Archean rocks. The Eurafrican zone, in longitude 20°
E., begins with the block occupying Scandinavia, Finland, and Lap-
land, which Suess has termed the “ Scandinavian schild.” It is an
area of great geological antiquity, which has long remained above sea
level; bands of marine deposits of different ages sweep round it, but
the block may never have been below sea level. It has unquestionably
remained as a solid impassive block which has dominated the whole
geological history of northern Europe. South of the Scandinavian
coign are the transverse east and western chains of the Alps and the
Atlas, with the Mediterranean trough between; and far to the south
we have the old plateau of South Africa.

Let us now go 120° westward to the American zone. It begins with
another block of old Archean rocks, forming what Suess has called the
“Canadian schild.” It occupies Canada, Labrador, and most of Hud-
son Bay and Baffins Land, and underlies Greenland. Bands of marine
deposits surround it, but it has perhaps never been itself below sea
level; its geological age, at any rate,is enormous. South of the North
American coign we have again a pair of east-west mountain chains,
forming the highlands of Cuba and Venezuela, separated by the Carib-
bean trough. This zone also ends southward in an old plateau resting
on Archean rocks.

The third meridional zone repeats the same characters. It begins
with a block of Archzean rocks, for which we may speak as the “‘ Man-
churian coign.” South of this coign are the east and west ridges of
Malaysia and the depressions parallel tothem; and south of that, again,
we have the Archean plateau of Australia.

The three main land axes of the world have remarkable resemblances
in structure, and they present three equidistant blocks of great stability
at the three tetrahedral corners. We may therefore speak of the
‘““schild ” as the three northern coigns or corner stones of the earth.

| They were assigned to their geometrical positions by Green, and in the interest-
ing recent tetrahedral volcanic map of M. Michel-Levy.

THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 383

The existence of these massive coigns' at the three tetrahedral corners
has produced one point of divergence in the earth plan from the geo-
metrical figure of the tetrahedron. The existence of three such broad
massive blocks naturally strengthens the line between them; and, as
we have seen, the main divide in the northern hemisphere runs from
coign to coign. The tetrahedral edges would naturally be lines of
weakness and of movement; but in the northern hemisphere the hori-
zontal lines of yielding are deflected southward by the stability of
the band supported by the earth’s three northern coigns. Hence the
great band of disturbances is subtropical, and runs from the Carib-
bean to the Mediterranean, across the Persian Guif and the Malaysian
Archipelago.

In the case of the vertical edges, however, the agreement in position,
as well as direction, is exact. Precisely below the three corner blocks
thereare three lines of instability coinciding with the vertical tetrahedral
edges. Belowthe Canadian coign thereis the line of the Andes (longitude
75°), which according to some geologists is still undergoing elevation.
Almost 120° east of the Andes, and below the Scandinavian coign, is
the Erythrean rift-valley (mean longitude 40°), in which some of the
earth movements are unquestionably of very recent date. Again,
nearly 120° eastward, and due south of the Manchurian coign, is the
recent line of movement represented by the eastern coast of Australia.

The main mountain system of the world corresponds, then, in
direction or position, or in both, with the edges of the tetrahedron.
The mountain lines run east and west in the Northern Hemisphere,
and run meridionally in the Southern Hemisphere—that is, always
parallel to the tetrahedral edges.

But it will be said there are three great exceptions, for the Ural
Mountains, the Appalachians, and the Kocky Mountains are meridional
instead of transverse, and that they therefore contradict the scheme.
The contradiction is only apparent. The existing mountain ranges
date from two main periods of mountain-building—the Upper Cenozoic
and the Upper Paleozoic. The Upper Tertiary system includes the
Alps, Andes, Himalaya, Pyrenees, Caucasus, and Atlas,ete. The Urals,
Rocky Mountains, and Appalachians belong to the Upper Paleozoic
system. Before we can say whether these chains confirm or refute the
tetrahedral theory, we must determine the distribution of land and
water at the time when they were made.

Now, we know that in Upper Paleozoic times one land fauna and
flora ranged round the Southern Hemisphere from Australia to India,
and thence to the Cape and South America. Instead of there having
then been a continuous ocean belt separating triangular points of land,
there was then a southern land belt, which was supported by three

whom I am indebted for much helpful advice. The term is suitable, as it is used for
@ printer’s wedge as well as for the corner stone of a house.

384 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

great equidistant corner stones, the Archean blocks of South Africa, of
Australia, and of Patagonia and the Patagonian platform.

What the South Pole was doing then is hidden by our deplorable
ignorance of that area; but there is evidence that to the a of this
southern land belt there was a cold, ice-laden sea.

Now let us consider the state of affairs in the arctic regions at the
same period. At the present time the mollusca of the Bering Sea and
North Atlantic belong to two essentially distinct faunas. But in Upper
Paleozoic-Triassic times one fauna occupied both regions, and that
fauna moreover extended uninterruptedly round the Northern Hemis-
phere, and apparently, along certain lines, extended some distance to
the south. There was, in fact, a northern ocean belt, which apparently
surrounded a cold arctic land. The distribution of land and water
was then on the same plan as at present, but with land and water
exactly reversed. There were two opposite interlocking belts of land
and sea, the former based on three Archean corner stones, the latter
projecting toward the equator between three Archean plateaux.

Thus the plan was the same as at present, but the conditions were
reversed. This gives us the clue to the mountain chains of the same
period. That, also, was a double system. There was a subtropical
mountain girdle, the ruins of which we can trace right acress the Old
World from Eastern China to Western Europe, where it is cut off by
the Atlantic slope. And projecting meridionally from that equatorial
girdle, opposite the three coigns, we have three mountain ranges
running along the meridional edges. These are the Ural Mountains
(60° E.) north of the eastern continuation of the South African coign,
the Appalachians (80° W.) north of the western part of the old
Patagonian coign, and the old broken axis of Kamtschatka (160° E.)
north of the coign of Australasia.

DEFORMATION AND RECOVERY.

Such a change in the position of the flattened faces is by no means
improbable in the case of a revolving globe. In the case of a stationary
body, a tetrahedral deformation once begun would be strengthened by
every fresh contraction. But owing to the world’s rotation, the tetra-
hedral collapse is steadily resisted, and confined within narrow limits.
The deformation formed by one period of slow, quiet contraction may
be lost on the restoration of equilibrium at an epoch of great crustal
disturbance. When deformation begins again, in consequence of
renewed contraction, the flattening may occur elsewhere.

This hypothesis of the alternation of periods of deformation with
periods of spheroidal recovery is geologically useful, as it suggests
an explanation of a certain periodicity in geological phenomena. For
instance, the latter half of Paleozoic time may have been a time of slow
tetrahedral collapse, culminating in an instability which led to the
great mountain movements which closed the Paleozoic; then followed
THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 385

a quiet period of slow restoration of the spheroidal form, causing the
series of marine “transgressions” which are the dominant feature of
the geological history of the Mesozoic era.

VERTICAL RANGE OF DEFORMATION.

Reluctance to admit the possibility of such changes is reduced when
we recollect how insignificant are the differences in level, when com-
pared with the size of the earth. The use of exaggerated diagrams
leads to unconscious magnification of the extent of the polar flattening,
and of the difference between the continental summits and the oceanic

itatively reeommended. The examination of true-scale

curves and outlines may help us to realize the actual con-

ditions. The accompanying figure! shows a section of

there were no flattening. The lowest line marks the

ness of this zone in comparison with the size of the earth is shown
on fig. 7, b, which is a sector of a circle, with the zone of a shown,
reduced to its true relative size. The polar flattening is barely recog-
-nizable, and the difference between sea bottom and mountain summit
is marked only by variations in the thickness of a line.

The diagram illustrates the insignificance of the deformations re-
quired; and that crustal disturbance occurs much deeper than the layer
with which the tetrahedral theory is concerned is shown by the fact
that the estimated center of origin of the Lisbon earthquake lies far
below.

This diagram also serves to show that the amount of contraction in
the earth necessary to allow tetrahedral deformation is very small.

SM 98 25
386 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

This is important because, as Lord Kelvin has shown, the amount of
contraction allowable during the later stages of the earth’s history is
very limited. But geologists have the authority of Professor Darwin
for accepting a certain amount of contraction. ‘A cooling celestial orb
must contract by a perceptible fraction of its radius after it has consoli-
dated,” he tells us, and his considerations *‘ only negative the hypothesis
of any large contraction of the earth since the moon has existed.” !And
unlike the contraction theory of the origin of mountain chains, the
theory of the tetrahedral deformation of the lithosphere requires only
a small amount of radial contraction.

Finally, it may be urged that even such deformation as the tetrahe.
dral theory requires is impossible, since physicists have taught us that
the earth is rigid. To this objection it is only necessary to reply that
Lord Kelvin’s rigidity arguments apply to the earth as a whole, and
not to its crust; they deny the fluidity of the interior of the earth, and
do not prohibit any local deformations of the exterior crust. The once
prevalent astronomical belief in the absolute invariability of the earth’s
Shape and in the absolute fixity of its axis of rotation (expressed,
e. g., by Sir J. Herschel in 1862) no longer hinders progress. In fact,
astronomers tell us that, instead of the absolute fixity of the pole, it
now shifts its position to an appreciable extent under the influence of
the movements of the atmosphere, the unequal melting of the polar ice,
and by heavy fails of snow on the Siberian highlands. These move-
ments of the pole are important, because they are taken to prove a
certain elasticity intheearth. The movements demonstrated by actual
observations are so far minute; but they at least allow geologists to
say that, as such slight causes as those mentioned produce appreciable
effects, more powerful causes acting for longer periods would work
greater changes.

SUMMARY.

The object of the paper is to show that the old belief in a definite
plan of the earth is justified, since the distribution of land and water on
the globe has been determined by the tetrahedral arrangement of the
elevations and depressions in the surface of the lithosphere.

This tetrahedral plan is shown by the existence of (1) a northern
land belt, surrounding anorthern ocean, and giving off three meridional
land lines, which taper southward; (2) the southern ocean belt sur-
rounding a south polar continent, and the three meridional oceans; (3)
by the antipodal position of land and water; (4) by the course of the
main watersheds and mountain chains. |

It is held that this arrangement was not established in the earth’s
infancy, and therefore has to be attributed to some agency which has
acted throughout geological history.

There are reasons for believing that a contracting sphere with a hard

THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES. 387

crust would undergo tetrahedral deformation, and the evidence of

-geodesy shows that the earth has been deformed from its spheroidal

form. Its present figure may be defined as a geoid, which has been
derived from a spheroid by irregular tetrahedroid deformation.

If such tetrahedral collapse be granted in the case of the earth, then
the existing arrangement of oceans and continents receives a natural

explanation.

The changes in the distribution of land and seas in the past may be
explained as due to the conflict of two opposing forces, collapse caused
by the earth’s contraction producing deformations, which are reduced
by the effects of the earth’s rotation. Geological history affords evi-
dence of the alteration of periods of tetrahedral collapse and spheroidal
recovery.

The plan of the earth may, in short, be attributed to the continual
foundering of the earth’s external shell, owing to the unceasing shrink-
age of its internal mass.

After the reading of the paper, the President said: In inviting the
discussion of this paper, I believe that there are those here who have
given some thought to the subject, and who will at least be inclined to
tell us what their impressions are respecting the views set forth in Dr.
Gregory’s paper. I hope Sir John Murray for one will be disposed to
give us the result of his impressions on the subject, and also Mr.
Blanford.

I find there is a reluctance on the part of learned men to commit
themselves to any opinions on a question which at present is in its
infancy, and on which their views are not entirely settled. I think
that some parts of the paper might have been discussed, and I can not
help expressing, as I have done on other occasions, my regret at the
loss we have sustained in our lamented friend General Walker, for
there is no man who could have spoken with so much authority on one or
two points, especially on the very slight differences that have occurred
between astronomical observations and geodetic measurements. As
Mr. Whittaker, the president of the Geological Society, is present,
perhaps he would be disposed to address us.

Mr. WHITTAKER. I came to listen, not to speak. I found a little
time ago that many gentlemen have come here after having the pleasure
of seeing the proof. Iam not one of those, and were I to speak, it would
be without the advantage they have had; consequently they would have
the pleasure of sitting upon me, and this goes against my feelings. I
would offer one general remark—it is the satisfaction I feel with any
paper of this sort that shows the interdependence of the various sci-
ences, and how men who follow one branch of science should not have
too much of that branch alone, but should see occasionally how it bears
on others, and, on the other hand, how others bear on it. This calls in
geologists, physicists, mathematicians, and many others, and it is too

388 THE PLAN OF THE EARTH AND ITS CAUSES.

big to take up without a chance of going into the matter beforehand,
and I decline to commit myself to details.

It is uncomfortable to think that, instead of being on a comfortable
globe, as we had imagined, one is placed on a tetrahedron.

Mr. VAUGHAN CORNISH. The tetrahedral theory was described by
Mr. Lowthian Green. When it was first promulgated it attracted very
little attention, and no favorable attention; it was met almost with
ridicule, and I think that it is, perhaps, not the smallest part of our
indebtedness to Dr. Gregory that his great power of exposition has
brought this theory again before the world, and though he has not yet
secured for it a universal assent, he has at least secured a very careful
consideration of what must, at all events, be considered a most sub-
stantial hypothesis. I think those who have followed carefully the
able exposition of Dr. Gregory given to-night must admit that the
tetrahedral convention, at all events, represents the observed distribu-
tion of land and water upon the surface of the globe. That distribution
is essentially hemihedral, as they say in crystallography; the forms are
not whole forms, but two half-forms interpenetrating, as we see in the
oppositely directed wedges of the continents and oceans, and so far, I

think, we shall most of us be prepared to go with Dr. Gregory. With

regard to the physical causes which have produced such a deformation
of the assumed spheroid, I think most of us will wish to reserve our
judgment until mathematicians and physicists and followers of experi-
mental science have tested it quantitively, and have seen whether
these causes, which I suppose would go in the direction of producing
tetrahedral, or tetrahedroid, deformation, are sufficient to produce the
effects that Dr. Gregory has described.

The PRESIDENT. I think we shall all be agreed that this difficult
subject, about which so few people seem inclined to give an opinion,
has been set before us in a very clear and graphic manner and with
great ability by our friend Dr. Gregory. I am sure you will all be
ready to pass a vote of thanks for his most interesting paper. Although
we are now almost for the first time realizing that the shape of the
earth is not what it is said to be in the text-books, we may remember
that the first person who supported the theory that the earth was the
shape of a pegtop or a pear was Christopher Columbus, although he
did not put the pointed end of the pear at the south pole, but near the
region where the Venezuelan arbitration is going to take place. I now
wish to ask you to pass a cordial vote of thanks to Dr. Gregory for his
paper.

FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL!

By W.J.Souuas, M. A., LL. D., D.Sc., F. B.S.

(Professor of Geology and Paleontology in the University of Oxford).

By far the largest portion of the untrodden surface of our planet is
formed by the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Submerged at an average
depth of over 1,000 fathoms, it lies out of reach of the geologist’s
hammer for all time, and for the present at least is inaccessible to the
diamond drill.2. The geology of an almost entire hemisphere is thus
the secret of the Pacific.

“Tt is the nature of a God,” Bacon quaintly remarks, ‘‘to conceal a
thing, it is the glory of a man to find it out,” and certainly there would
seem to be few secrets in Nature to which a clew has not somewhere
been left for those who have virtue to discover it.

The mountainous margins of the ocean, still young and actively
moving, may doubtless furnish us with many precious hints, but it is
to the multitudinous islands, which in serried rows like the tops of
submerged mountain chains extend across it, that we must turn in
search of the true guiding thread.

Some of these islands, like New Zealand and New Caledonia, are in
many important respects similar to our own, and seem to be the sur-
viving fragments of a lost continent, which has fallen into ruins and
sunk beneath the waves. Others, such as the Sandwich and Fiji islands,
are also of a kind long since familiar to us, clusters of volcanic cones
which, like Stromboli and Vuleano of the Mediterranean, rise from the
depths of the sea.

In addition to these, however, there exist a third and strange kind
of islands, restricted to the torrid zone, and known to the daring mariners
of the Elizabethan period as “low” islands, a name well deserved, since
few of them attain a greater elevation than many of the pebble beaches
which fringe our own coasts; few indeed so great, the loftiest summits
of most not exceeding the insignificant height of 10 feet. Owing to
this fact they are scarcely visible till a ship is close upon them, and the

390 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

first glimpse of a low island presents itself as a thin dark-green band,
which separates the deep azure of the sky from the still deeper blue of
the sea; with nearer approach a cream-colored streak inserts itself
below the green and is instantly followed by a line of dazzling snowy
white, which is soon recognized as the fringe of surf which marks the
boundary of the sea. Sailing nearer, the streak of cream color becomes
the island beach, and the zone of green resolves itself into a mass of
luxuriant vegetation, over which the feathery crowns of the graceful
cocoanut palms, towering to a height of 80 feet, wave indolently in the
sea breeze.

As the details of this gracious scene, rising like an apparition from
the deep, unfold before the eyes, one seems to gaze on some island of
enchantment, and with the music of the surf thundering in one’s ears
one thinks of the Tritons sounding the loud conch, and half expects to
‘see old Proteus rising from the sea!”

If it be with surprise that we first make the acquaintance of these
islands the feeling is in no degree abated with closer familiarity; from
- beginning to end their whole story is a chapter of surprises.

Mariners soon learned to dread the surf-beaten shores, for they could
find no anchorage within a safe distance of the breakers, the sides of
the island descending precipitously to great depths within a few hun-
dred yards of the coast; and within this distance a reef of rough and
rugged rocks forms the shelving floor of the sea. A bark once driven
on to this heels over, with its deck facing the pitiless waves, and is
swept clean from stem to stern.

Bristling with dangers on the outside, the island conceals within
itself a spacious inner sea or lagoon, into which, through dangerous
passages, a ship may make its way, and once there securely ride out
the most destructive storm. The island thus differs from most others
in being hollow in its midst; a mere rocky rim to a sea lake, which may
be as much as 60 or even 100 miles across, and 60 fathoms deep, though
20 fathoms is more usual. From this feature the islands are known,
not only as ‘“‘low” islands, but as ‘‘lagoon” islands. The shores of the
lagoon are bordered by a smooth, gently sloping beach of flesh-colored
sand, over which the wavelets fall faintly; and palms and laurel-like
shrubs growing down to the water’s edge are reflected in its crystal
margin.

When the voyager first set foot on this strange new land it was a
fresh surprise to him to find it peopled. The inhabitants, usually
graceful and prepossessing in appearance and amiable in manners, came
timidly forth to welcome him, speaking a language full of soft vowel
sounds, which has been aptly styled the Italian of the Pacific. In some
cases, particularly when the natives were not red men but black, they
showed less favor to strangers, and the island sometimes became the -
theater of bloody strife.

Besides man, whose presence is an additional problem of the islands,
FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL. 391

no other mammals are indigenous, their place being taken by various
land crabs and spiders of many kinds.

An examination of the rocks of a low island reveals another singular
feature; save for a few fragments of pumice, brought from distant vol-
canos by sea-currents and cast by the waves upon the strand, they
present us with but one kind of material, carbonate of lime, which has
been extracted from solution in the sea and built up into a diversity of
solid forms by the agency of organisms—plants and animals, of which
the most conspicuous are corals. Thus but one kind of rock enters
into the constitution of the island, and this is limestone; of granite,
slate, sandstone, clay, such as we are familiar with at home, there is
none; all is limestone, whatever you see!

The interest of this fact is enhanced by another. Repeated investi-
gation has proved that the island is not merely a residuum, a mortuary
of calcareous organisms, but that it is still alive and in active growth.
A profusion of gaily tinted corals form reefs within the lagoon, and
the whole of the shelving plat-
form, which descends from the
surf to a distance of 20 or 30
fathoms below the sea, is alive
with them; this platform is in-
deed the true growing surface
of the island.

Corals, by reason of their con-
siderable size and brilliant colors, first attract the attention of the
observer, and hence, although numerous other kinds of creatures col-
laborate with the corals in the construction of the reef, these islands
are known not only as “low” islands and “lagoon” islands, but also as
‘‘coral” islands, or more particularly as ‘‘coral atolls.”

The remarkable discovery that coral atolls consist of the remains of
animals and plants of precisely the same kinds as those which are at
present adding to its substance excited general interest, and led to
many fantastic speculations which need not now be recalled. The
state of opinion at the beginning of this century may best be learned
from the works of the poet naturalist, Chamisso, who may probably be
more widely known as the author of Peter Schlemihl’s wunderbare
Geschichte (The Story of the Man who sold -his Shadow) than as an
investigator of coral reefs. In a description, which even in the light
of the most recent research must still be pronounced excellent, Cha-
misso (fig. 1) speaks of atolls as table mountains which rise steeply
from great depths. The summit of the table nountain is always under

-water, and is covered by the living reef which surrounds its margin as

a broad platform and rises to the level of low tides. Sand banks rest-
ing on this form the dry land. Since, he observes, every particle of the
atoll which lies within the reach of observation consists of coral, it is
only just to conclude that the whole structure, including the table
392 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

mountain, is formed of the same material. Not perhaps a strictly logi-
cal conclusion, yet, as events have proved, in the main correct.

Chamisso’s opinion was not destined to remain long unchallenged,
for two famous French naturalists—Quoy and Gaimard—asserted, as
the result of their observations, that the coral rock of an atoll is only
skin-deep—i. e., it forms, according to them, a mere superficial crust,
not more than about 25 feet in thickness; the rest (Chamisso’s ‘table
mountain” ) being, on this view, of volcanic, or at all events of inorganic,
origin. ,

Few of the arguments by which it was attempted to sustain this
erroneous conclusion strike one as being very satisfactory, but they
include one highly important observation, viz, that reef-building corals
do not live at greater depths than 25 feet below the level of low tides.
Subsequent inquiry, while fully confirming the existence of a limit,
has at the same time extended it down to a depth of as many as 25 or
perhaps even 40 fathoms. Yet, even with this modification, the unex-

pected discovery of Quoy and

ieee onae Gaimard seems to stand in

flagrant contradiction to the

views of Chamisso. If corals

can not grow below a depth

of 25 fathoms, how could they

possibly have built up islands

of over 100 fathoms in thick-
ness?

The answer to this question,
| as is well known, was given

Puan by Charles Darwin. If, we

eee Ne admit the truth of both the

apparently conflicting state-

ments, it is obvious that the corals at the base of a reef 100 fathoms
in thickness must have been situated within the. limit of 25 fathoms
at the time they were alive. But in order to bring them within this
limit it is only necessary to suppose that the foundation on which they
grew originally stood 75 fathoms nearer the sea level than it does
now; or, in other words, that since the lower layers of the reef were
alive and flourishing, the ground which supported them has sunk 75
fathoms deeper in the sea. No fact is better established than the rise
and fall of islands situated in mid-ocean, and thus there is nothing
antecedently improbable in this supposition. But once grant it, and
Darwin’s explanation of atolls naturally follows. Thus, let a be an
island with its summit rising 100 fathoms above the sea; let its shores-
become peopled with corals, which extend seaward down to the limit
of 25 fathoms, beyond which, as we admit, they can not proceed; a reef
is thus started, which will continue to grow, rising upward till it
reaches the level of low tides; when this is attained upward growth

will cease, and the reef will begin to pass into decay, from the shore
edge outward. So long as the island remains stationary, neither rising
nor falling with respect to the sea level, this is practically all that
will happen, and the final result is a reef not much exceeding 25
fathoms in thickness (fig. 2, first stage). But let us next suppose that
the island begins slowly to sink into the sea, carrying the reef with it;
the upward limit to the growth

of the corals will be displaced ; ENCIRCLING REEF

they will commence to flourish
afresh, and the reef will continue
to extend upward till the level
of the low tides is once more
encountered, and growth again
arrested. This process of sub-
mergence and upward growth
may of course be repeated in-
definitely, and by the time the
island has descended 50 fathoms ee

‘below its original position, the eae Serpe

reef will have acquired a corre-

sponding thickness. In such a case the unfavorable conditions to the
coral growth which prevail on the inner side of the reef, together with
the retreating slope of the flanks of the island, will have led to the
formation of a channel of sea water between the mee and the shore (fig.
2, second stage). TVinally, let the submergence of the island continue
till it is completely swallowed up by the sea, not a vestige of its summit
remaining to mark its place; the upward growth of the corals, con-
stantly proceeding, will bring
them once more to the level of
low tides, and the result will be
the formation of a ring-shaped
reef surrounding a central la-
goon, or, in other words, of an
atoll (fig. 2, third stage).

If this Ten onell scheme
of the progress of events corre-
spond to the facts, we may ex-
pect to find its various stages
still represented among the
numerous islands of the Pacific,
and this, as Darwin endeavored to show, is clearly the case. The first
_ Stage, in which the reef is no more than 25 fathoms thick, and forms a

Selvage accurately following the margin of the land, is represented by
that numerous class known as “fringing” reefs. The second, in which
a comparatively thick reef surrounds an island with an intervening salt-
water channel, is illustrated by another class, known as “encircling” or

Fig. 2.
THIRD STAGE.
394 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

“barrier” reefs. In these, as we might expect, the form of the reef is
only remotely related to the contour of the inclosed island, the valleys
of which present that fiord-like character so suggestive of sunken land.
The last stage is that of the atoll itself.

The excellence of Darwin’s theory lies in this, that it explains all the
essential features of an atoll on one simple assumption. It is incon-
sistent with no known fact, and as additional discoveries have been
made it has not required to be supplemented by fresh hypotheses. It
is not like a Gothic structure, supported by flying buttresses and other
tours de force, but rather resembles some noble Italian tower, which
rises from its base, straight, simple, and self-sufficing. It was no
sooner given to the world than it commanded almost universal assent.

Nevertheless, it has never been without a rival. Even before
Darwin published his celebrated work Ainsworth! had suggested a
different explanation. He rightly pointed out that Quoy and Gaimard

had not established a limit
AINSWORTH for all reef-building organ-
isms, and that although cer-
tain corals, such as they
had observed, might be
restricted to shallow waters,
there might yet be others
capable of flourishing at
greater depths. If so, these
deep-water organisms might be engaged in laying the foundations of
an atoll on which the shallower water furms might erect the super-
structure (fig. 3). This suggestion seems to have fallen stillborn, but
the notion of ‘laying the foundation” of an atoll was not destined to
perish; it has been revived of late years by Sir John Murray, who,
guided by his observations made when on board the Challenger, was
led to suppose that the submerged summits of deeply sunken islands
might be raised to within the limits of 25 fathoms, not by the upward
growth of corals but by the incessant downward rain of minute organ-
isms from the surface of the sea. The same agencies which were sup-
posed to be spreading out a layer of chalky mud, or ooze, over the
abyssal floor of the ocean were also imagined as engaged in piling a
Pelion of mud on every submarine Ossa (fig. 4).

The publication of Sir John Murray’s views was followed by a long
controversy, in which Darwin’s theory was subjected to a most search-
ing criticism. An impartial summary of the arguments arrayed on
both sides of the question is given by Professor Bonney in the last
edition of Darwin’s ‘‘ Coral Reefs,” and the general subject is treated

ueber die Entstehung der Koralleninseln und Korallenriffe (Leipzig,
1890).

So far as the opposition to Darwin’s views has come to count among
its adherents a number of distinguished thinkers, it can only be
regarded as having achieved a certain measure of success; a result
not, to my thinking, to be wholly accounted for by the nature of the

_ arguments employed. Possibly in this, as in similar cases, the ostensible

objections are mere weapons of combat, while the real. power has lain
in the strong and subtle influence exercised by some general current
of thought. Such a current is indicated in the tendency to a belief in
what is spoken of as the permanence of continental areas and oceanic
Basins.

According to Darwin, every atoll marks the site of a vanished island,
but the atolls of the Pacific are so numerous that if one imagines all the
islands they represent as summoned back from the ‘‘vasty deep” and
restored to their original position above the sea, they will constitute a
very considerable tract of land, and this situated in the very middle of
the Pacific Ocean. Such
a prospect could not fail
to be unpleasing to those
who believe in the immu- teat jae. ol feome
tability of the ocean. facnenes mo LoFE7

Of late years, however, Z
this doctrine of “ perma-
nence” has begun to look
a little threadbare. Ina
theoretical restoration of the distribution of land and sea during the
Jurassic times, Neumayr has treated it with scant consideration, since
he represents the North and South Atlantic, as well as the Indian Ocean,
as then toa great extent occupied by land, and it is now very generally
supposed that this land did not disappear to make way for existing seas
till a comparatively late period in the history of the earth. Bold as
Neumayr showed himself in the treatment of these oceans, he had not
the temerity to take liberties with the Pacific. This he and geologists
in general are disposed to regard as having maintained its existing
features from a very early period. Of this ocean, and of this alone,would
they exclaim, “Such as Creation’s dawn beheld, thou rollest now.”

Darwin’s theory, as we have seen, does not hesitate to recall to
existence land in the middle of even this ocean; this is its unforgiv-
able offense—it lays sacrilegious hands on the Pacific, and thus attacks
the doctrine of “permanence” in its stronghold.

While the recent controvesy on Darwin’s theory was at its fiercest,
and both sides seemed equally persuaded that the truth was theirs and
must prevail, it occurred to me that a simple solution might be obtained
by sinking a bore-hole through some well-characterized atoll, and thus

obtaining specimens of the material of which it is composed, down to a
depth considerably greater than that at which corals are supposed to
build. How would this illustrate the question? Allow me to employ
a homely illustration: buyers of cheese are not, I presume, naturally
more suspicious than other persons engaged ia trade, but they are
unwilling to trust too much to mere outward appearance; they
are not inclined to adopt the argument which commended itself to
Chamisso in a parallel case, that because there is good cheese on the
surface it must be good cheese all through; consequently, by means of
a boring instrument, called a scoop, they make a hole through the
cheese and bring out a core or cylindrical rod, in which the several
strata of the material, if there be more than one, are displayed in their
true thickness and natural position. The atoll is our cheese, which we
propose to sample with a complicated kind of scoop called a diamond
drill. This should provide us with a core in which the various layers
of the coral reef should be faithfully represented. Should Darwin’s
theory prove correct, the core wiil

Be No one who has any notion of the

| which Darwin attacked this as every

other problem that he investigated,

will be at all surprised to learn that
the same solution had already occurred to him, and in a letter to A.
Agassiz (May 5, 1851) he sighs for ‘‘some doubly rich millionaire, who
would take it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific ©
and Indian atolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a depth of 500
or 600 feet.” As the wished-for millionaire did not appear to be forth-
coming, it appeared to me that the boring might be achieved in another
way. by a method very familiar to this association—I allude, of course,
to a “committee.” On approaching Professor Bonney with a sugges-
tion to this effect he warmly entertained the proposal, and in 1891 a
strong committee, including the most distinguished supporters and
opponents of Darwin’s theory, was formed, having for its object the
investigation of an atoll by boring and other means.

Through the kind offices of Professor Stuart, of Sydney, we obtained
from the government of New South Wales the offer of the free loan of
a diamond drill. Our next step was to select an island for investiga-
tion. This wasrendered an easy task through the invaluable assistance

FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL. 397

afforded by Admiral Wharton, whose extensive knowledge of coral
reefs renders him the most formidable of Darwin’s opponents. At his
suggestion our choice fell on Funafuti, one of the Ellice or Lagoon
Islands, situated in the middle of the Pacific (latitude 84° 8.), seven
days’ sail northward of Fiji. No better selection could possibly have
been made. Not only is Funafuti an atoll of unexceptional character
itself, but it belongs to a family of atolls all of equally unexceptional
character; and these again to a system which includes the Gilbert and
Marshall islands, all of them excellent atolls. So far as these are all
distinguished by the same characters, whatever may be found true of
Funafuti will apply to all the rest.

The labors of the committee of the British Association were then
taken over by a committee of the Royal Society, at whose request the
admiralty generously assigned to our assistance the Penguin, one of
Her Majesty’s gunboats, commanded by Captain Field, and stationed
in the Pacific for exploring purposes. The Royal Society furnished
funds to defray expenses, and the direction of the expedition was placed
in my hands; two volunteers, Mr. Gardiner, of Cambridge, and Mr.
Hedley, of Sydney, were, with my permission, to accompany me.

We joined the Penguin and left Sydney on May 1, 1896, taking with
us a boring party which had been selected for the work by Mr. Slee,
the Government inspector of mines and drills. Its foreman, Ayles,
had acquired great reputation in the colony by his success in conduct-
ing boring operations of exceptional difficulty. On May 21, after three
weeks’ voyage, we heard the welcome cry ‘‘Land ho!” and Funafuti
was seen on the horizon. The ship was steered for the southern
entrance; this was safely made, and we steamed into the noble lagoon.
Flying fish spurted from under our bows, and zigzagged in their dart-
ing flight around us; here-and there in the midst of the blue waters
green and purple shallows marked the site of growing coral patches.
On the starboard side Jay the beautiful island of Funafuti proper, its
pale sands ablaze in the light of the tropical sun, its groves of palms
cool with a refreshing green. A boat put off from the beach manned
by a crew of copper-colored natives, their black hair crowned with
wreaths of gardenia and hibiscus flowers. They were soon swarming
over our sides, bringing with them the solitary white trader of the
island, who safely piloted us to anchor within a mile of the shore.
Captain Field and a party immediately landed, and we went at once to
pay our respects to the king, who, notwithstanding the narrow limits
of his realm and the smallness of his nation, which numbers only some
240 souls, we found to be every inch a king. His Majesty received us
with gracious dignity, led us into his palace, one of the few stone huts
on the island, and seated us by his side on the dais, which consisted of
packing cases. The chief men sat round the walls on the floor, and smil-
ing damsels, with large black eyes, ivory white teeth, and long black
tresses floating loose, shyly presented us with freshly opened cocoanuts
398 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

to drink, a civility which as inevitably attends a call in Funafuti as
the afternoon cup of tea at home. We told our errand, and received
permission to choose a site for boring operations. We then requested
that a house should be built for us, and were promised that this should
be done for the modest sum of £6. The reception ended, we proceeded
to choose a site for the boring and for landing gear, and marked out
the plan of our house; it was to measure 15 by 20 feet. We were
anxious to have the building of this put in hand at once, and were
assured that it should be ready for us by the afternoon of the next day.
The east is supposed to be more fertile in promise than performance,
and our expectation was that we should see this house when we did see
it. Judge, therefore, of our surprise when on passing the same spot
the day after we found a substantial structure already standing there.
It had grown up like Aladdin’s palace in a single night. The whole
population had been employed on the work; the men had cut down
trees and shaped them into poles, sunk these in the ground, and bound
them together into a solid framework; the children had been set to
gather palm leaves from the forest, and the women had woven these
into mats, which were used to form both the walls and thatch of our
dwelling. The result was an excellent house which served all our
needs, protecting us from sun and storm during our residence of nearly
three months. Not a nail was driven in its construction, all the joints
being firmly made with cocoanut cord.

After contemplating the work with great satisfaction I left for a
stroll, and returning an hour after was aghast to find our new house
surrounded with smoke and flames. To my great relief it turned out
that the conflagration proceeded from the surrounding bush, which
the thoughtful natives had purposely set alight to prevent its taking
fire by accident.

The work of landing gear and erecting machinery was set about
vigorously. The crew of the Penguin toiled all day heroically in the
burning sun, refreshing themselves at sunset in swimming matches
with the natives. Progress was so rapid that by June 3, not quite
a fortnight after landing, the boring party were already at work.
So far all our plans had been carried out with expedition and success,
and, since ‘‘things done well and with a care” are said to ‘‘exempt
themselves from fear,” we may now safely leave our miners industri-
ously boring while we take a walk across the island. Standing on the
shore of the lagoon near the site otf our boring, it is just possible to
catch a glimpse of the palms on the opposite side, some ten miles
away. The beach slopes so gently, that although the tide falls only
about 5 feet, it leaves a wide expanse of sand uncovered. This is a per-
fect warren of shore crabs (Calappa), which scurry along like blown
thistle down and vanish into holes with mysterious suddenness. It is
at night that these are most active, when they dig deep burrows in the
sand, casting up conical hillocks at the entrance nearly a foot high,

which give the beach the appearance of a miniature encampment.
The sand is the famous ‘“‘coral” sand; but on picking up a handful for
nearer inspection we are surprised to find that it contains scarcely any
coral; and, so far from consisting of detrital material, it is almost
entirely composed of the shells of Foraminifera, two species predomi-
nating, Tinoporus baculatus and Orbitelites complanata. From speci-

mens collected on other atolls by the late Professor Moseley, and pre-

served in the University Museum at Oxford, it would appear that the
sand at Funafuti is by no means singular in this respect, and the term
“coral” sand is only another instance of the “lucus a non.”

The lagoon beach ends in a tiny cliff about a foot in height,! to the
very edge of which sparse turf and vegetation of a larger growth
extends. The land to which this cliff is boundary consists chiefly of
small fragments of coral and shells of Foraminifera. It rises a little, so as
to attain a maximum height of 3 or 4 feet above high-water mark. In
breadth it varies considerably, and where broadest the native village
stands, with the church, iarge enough to contain the whole population,
all churchgoers, the school, mission house, and palace. A row of
graves, made tomb like with slabs of coral, rans down the middle of
the main street. The whole of this sandy flat is covered with rich
forest growth, cocoanut palms in all stages, from the young plant just
sprouting from the shell to the ancient of the groves, 80 feet in height,
bearing heavy clusters of ripe fruit beneath its crown of feathery
fronds; pandanus, with its strange adventitious roots and truculent
sword-shaped leaves, broken in the middle; the Jaurel-like Nono
(Morinda citrifolia) and the “Nya” tree (Pemphis), with its heavy
stem of hard red wood and delicate foliage. Ferns abound, and some
brightly colored flowering plants; an Abutilon, which puts forth fresh
blossoms day by day, and a handsome bean, which trails through the
forest, bearing large heart-shaped leaves and heavy racemes of lilae
flowers.

The great robber crab (Birgus), which feeds on cocoanuts and pan-
danus fruit, is at home here, and may be seen climbing the cocoa palms
by night. Other land crabs scramble through the fallen palm leaves
which thickly strew the ground. Many of these are of the hermit
kind, and one of them has a curious habit of croaking like a frog when
eaptured. But nopart of the island is free from land crabs. Like rats
and mice, they are the universal scavengers. They undermined our
house, attacked our tinned provisions, and one could not sit down to
eat a cocoanut without some of these weird creatures gathering round
to pick up the fallen crumbs.

AS we continue our passage across the sand the scene rapidly, even

1'This apples to that part of the islet on which our house was built. In some
places more considerable cliffs are met with, e. g., on one of the northern islets of
Funafuti called Amatupu, where a conglomerate of coral pebbles form steep faces

some 6 feet or more in height.
400 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

abruptly, changes its aspect. The place of the forest, so rich and varied,
is taken by a grotesque growth of ‘‘ Nya” trees, whose stubborn, con-
torted trunks, strangely at variance with their dainty foliage, bar the
way. Struggling through these, one enters upon a savage plain “ hor-
rid” with rugged fragments of blackened coral and cumbered here
and there with huge bowlders of coral rock some tons in weight.! At
low water this desolate region is dry and burns in the sun, but as the
tide rises sea water oozes up through holes in the ground and covers it
with shallow pools. Few animals live in this desert. Spiders, that
infest the ‘‘ Nya” trees, and mosquitoes, that lie greedily in wait by
day as well as night, are the chief that I bear in mind. Proceeding
lengthwise along this plain, which lies in the middle of the island, it
broadens out and passes into a muddy swamp planted by the natives
with taro, a delicious substitute for potatoes, and bananas, which one
still reflects upon with pleasure. ‘Their fruit was our chief luxury, and
we willingly paid for it at the somewhat exorbitant price of 4 fathoms
of calico a bunch.

Farther on, beyond the plantation, the depression becomes still
wider, forming an extensive flat, partly margined by mangrove trees
and Hibiscus. This was known tous as the mangrove swamp. It isan
interesting corner of the island. The floorrepresents the upper surface
of a deal coral reef, composed partly of great masses of Porites. Their
flattened summits, standing some 8 or 10 inches abeve the floor, give
them the appearance of a row of stepping-stones and mark what was
the level of low tide at the time the reef was living.’ Radiating from
these blocks as from a nucleus are vertical plates of the “blue coral”
(Heliopora coerulea), which extend outward, branching as they go, for
a distance of 3 yards or more. Overlapping the reef lies a layer of con-
solidated coral breccia. It has suffered much from erosion by the sea
and bounds the innerx side of the depression in cliffs 3 or 4 feet in height.
A sheet of clear, green water covers the swamp at high tide, converting
it into a shallow lake, which, as the tide falls, empties itself through
deep holes in the floor into subterranean passages, which freely commu-
nicate with the outer sea. The northern end of this depression is closed
by coral breccia and overgrown with mangroves, but farther on it
recommences and extends through the remainder of the island, almost
as far as its northernmost extremity, forming a discontinuous narrow
trough bordered by steep cliffs. This trough and the depression to
which it belongs owes its origin in some degree to solution by sea
water.

We have deviated from our walk across the island to follow the course

‘One of these measured 6 feet by 5 feet by 4 feet.

2The last episode in the history of the island appears to have been a slight eleva-
tion of some 4 or 5 feet; at least I was led to this conclusion from evidence furnished
by the “dead reef” of the mangrove swamp, by the ‘‘sea stacks” or pinnacles of
coral rag of the tidal platform, and by the steep cliffs which in some of the islets
border the lagoon.
FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL. 401

of its central depression. Let us now return and resume our traverse.
The blackened fragments of coral, resembling nothing so much as the
clinkers of lava which cumber the slopes of Etna, continue seaward,
and are loosely piled to form a gently rising ascent—so loosely piled that
they often topple over at a touch and afford very uncertain or even
dangerous foothold.

Walking circumspectly, therefore, up the slope, we soon reach the
summit of a long ridge and find ourselves looking toward the Andes,
some thousands of miles away over the broad waters of the Pacific
Ocean. We stand on the top of the “storm beach,” the loftiest region
of our island, at the imposing altitude of 10 or even 15 feet, according
to the state of the tide. On the seaward face the storm beach descends
somewhat rapidly, and near its foot a sheet of hard consolidated coral
rag emerges from under it, to form a gently sloping platform, over which
the tide ebbs and flows. In places this tidal platform rises in low cliffs,
ridges, and pinnacles ' of fantastic shape, but for the most part it pre-
sents itself as a sheet of limestone, smoothed and polished by the wear-
ing action of the waves. For about 50 yards from its seaward edge it
is hollowed into a broad, shallow depression, not deep enough to be
called a channel, and finally swells into a narrow rounded rim formed
by the growth of a pink-colored calcareovs seaweed known as Melobesia.
Beyond this rim, which projects above the sea at low tide, lies the
growing surface of the reef, which is constantly submerged, so that
under no circumstances are the corals, which thickly cover it at any
time, exposed to the air.

Deep chasms gash the edge of the tidal platform, the continuation
inland of the lanes of clear sea which wander through the growing
reef; in these chasms a few corals may generally be found, their polypes
sometimes brilliantly colored and in full expansion.

The caleareous alga, previously alluded to as Melobesia, forms the
lips of these chasms, and by its luxuriant growth may more or less
completely roof them over, generally leaving one or more apertures,
which act as blowholes.

The ocean side of the reef is one of the pleasantest parts of the
island; a cool breeze almost always blows there; and, under the wel-
come shelter of the palms and pandanus which crowd the summit of
the storm beach, one may watch the beautiful and impressive spectacle
below; the ocean, of a deep majolica blue, rolls inward in majestic
waves, which suddenly grow gigantic as they approach the. shore,
towering in a wall of water above the reef, and then spring with a
furious roar into a confusion of white foam, which seethes about the
madder-tinted margin of Melobesia, rushes through the chasms of the
tidal platform, and often spouts up through the blowholes with sudden
and explosive violence, like a kind of marine geysers. It is only on
calm days that the extreme margin of the reef can be approached with

‘See note 1, p. 400.

402 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

safety. Such is the violence of the breakers that the tidal platform
presents the appearance of an almost lifeless desert; a few green and
brown seaweeds, little fish darting in the pools, occasional sea snails
with dense shells, and a few hermit crabs heavily armored, are all that
is seen at first glance. All the inhabitants of the tidal platform seem
to stand in dread of the sea; even the active shore crabs (Grapsus) are
afraid of it, and only venture in when inspired by their greater terror
of the human form; even then they cling tenaciously with their many
legs close to the sides of the rocky shore, and sidle off to land directly
they fancy the enemy’s back is turned.

The observer who trusted to first impressions, and judged the plat-
form by its outer aspect, would fall into grievous error; it is by no
means so dead as it seems. On breaking off a fragment with a hammer
a new world of life is revealed; the rock is tunneled through and
through, as closely as it can be mined, by a variety of animals, which
have taken to an underground life as a protection against the sea;
worms, shellfish, crabs, sea squirts, and barnacles are to be found in
these subterranean dwellings; they constitute a specialized fauna of
marine troglodytes, which might, if we wished to add to the burden of
nomenclature, be designated the “‘ Cryptone.”

After this brief description of the superficial features of the atoll we
may next endeavor to trace the history of that part of it which rises
above the sea and properly constitutes the land. The sheet of hard
coral rock which we mentioned as cropping out beneath the storm
beach can be traced into the interior of the island, where it forms the
floor of the central depression; and again to the lagoon side, where it
emerges to form the floor of the lagoon and in many places the beach
or as well even a low line of cliffs. In the little islet of Pava, north of
Funafuti, it is seen to extend continuously from one side of the land to
the other—from the ocean to the lagoon.

We may, therefore, fairly conclude that this sheet of rock forms the
solid base on which the land above it rests. It is composed mainly of
slabs of coral, lying not quite horizontally, but overlapping like the
tiles of a roof, with a slight inclination toward the ocean side of
the reef.

These fragments have evidently been derived from the outer zone of
growing coral. Before the land as it now exists was formed the waves
were incessantly engaged in tearing off fragments from the coral zone
and driving them across the reef into the lagoon till a thick sheet of
débris was the result. This became consolidated as it formed, partly
by the growth of incrusting calcareous algz, and now forms the solid
floor of the island.

Masses of broken corals, torn up and driven inland by the breakers,
continued to accumulate after the formation of the floor; and thus that
great pile of coral clinkers which forms the storm beach has been and
is still being built up.
FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL. 403

On the other side the wavelets of the lagoon have washed up smaller
fragments of coral and foraminiferal shells, and thus the strip of land
which borders the lagoon and on which the village of Funafuti stands
has been produced.

The middle of the island—the great central depression including the
taro ground and the mangrove swamp—is the remains of the original
solid platform left exposed between the storm beach on the one hand
and the lagoon land on the other. Thus all that portion of Funafuti
which stands above high tide has been cast up from the ocean and the
lagoon, and this beautiful island, like another Aphrodite, has been
born with the foam from the waves of the sea.

If this be the true history of the island, how then did it acquire its
inhabitants? Did they climb upward like the corals as the island
was submerged or did they arrive as tlotsam and jetsam of the sea?
As regards the natives there can be but one answer—they came by
boat. In former days the Polynesians possessed excellent seagoing
craft, in which they were accustomed to make long voyages, steering
by the stars and other signs in the sky. They well knew how to pre-
serve food by drying, and thus had no difficulty in provisioning for a
cruise. The routes they followed in passing from island to island are
gradually becoming known to us and have been indicated on a chart
by Professor Haddon. Considering the remarkable similarity of lan-
guage which characterizes all Polynesia, from New Zealand on the
south to the Sandwich Isles on the north, there can be little doubt that
the migrations of these peoples must have taken place comparatively
recently, and judging from tradition one might conjecture within the
last seven or eight hundred years.

Thus, long before the illustrious townsman of this city, John Cabot,
had anticipated Columbus in his famous voyage to America, these
navigators, whom we libel with the name of savages, were venturing
on equally arduous explorations with still more imperfect means at
their command. It was not often, however, that long voyages of over
a thousand miles were made of set purpose; too frequently they were
the result of accident, as when frail canoes were overtaken by a sudden
storm and driven at the mercy of the winds, sometimes to perish
miserably, sometimes by good hap to land on undiscovered shores.

The Funafuti people seem some of them to have entered the island
with intent; others are mere waifs and strays cast away by shipwreck
on the reef. The prevailing stock is Samoan, with an admixture of
Tongan. In bygone times the Tongans used to make _ periodical
descents upon the island, after the fashion of the Vikings in early
English history. The Tongans, however, came not only to kill, but to
eat their foes, a proceeding not wholly unintelligible among a people
who knew absolutely of no other kind of meat. In justice to the
copper-colored races of Polynesia I hasten to add that cannibalism was
seldom the custom of this folk; wherever it is met with it may be
404 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

taken to indicate the influence of black blood. So far as we know
cannibals are almost always black people.

Returning to the boring party, which we left busily engaged. For
nearly three weeks they worked by shifts continuously night and day,
but at the end of that time, when the bore hole was only 105 feet deep,
their most arduous efforts failed to advance it farther. The difficulties
opposed by the nature of the ground—a mixture of flowing sand and
obdurate bowlders—were such that neither the good will of the work-
men nor the ingenuity of Ayles, the foreman, could contend against
them, and there was no alternative but to abandon the undertaking.

Thinking that there might be a better prospect of success on the
ocean side of the reef, we determined to make a fresh attempt there,
and in two days, without the help of wheels and in a country without
roads, we succeeded in transporting the bulk of our 25 tons of machinery
across the island to a fresh site. The new boring commenced in hard
rock and at first deepened rapidly. Before long, however, it entered
a mixture of sand and bowlders similar to that we had previously
encountered, and after attaining a depth of 72 feet further progress
became impossible. We left the island on July 30, and on reaching
Fiji had the mortification to learn that we had passed on the way a
ship coming to our assistance with a fresh supply of machinery, which
our friends in sydney had promptly dispatched on hearing of our
difficulties.

Our attempt to penetrate the reef had proved a failure, but it was
not wholly without result. It had revealed the nature of the material
with which any subsequent attempts at boring would have to contend,
and it had added one more surprise to the history of atolls, for no one
had suspected that for a depth of over 100 feet the island would be
found to consist of more sand than coral, or in other words, that the
organisms which play the chief part in the construction of a coral reef
are not corals, but Foraminifera!

The expedition had other objects in view poses boring. The next
in importance was. the investigation of the atoll by sounding. This
was accomplished with complete success by Captain Field. Other
atolls had been sounded before, but never before had an atoll been
sounded with such accuracy and completeness as was Funafuti on this
occasion. The form of the floor of the lagoon was made more exactly
known than that of most lakes in the British Isles. The slopes of the
flanks of the atoll were determined in four different directions, approxi-
mately at right angles to each other and running about north, south,
east, and west. A study of these enables us to frame a clear picture
ot the general form of the atoll. It is a conical mountain with an oval
base situated at a depth of about 2,000 fathoms, measuring 30 miles in
length by 28 in breadth. It rises at first with a very gentle slope, but
gradually grows steeper as it ascends (fig. 6) till at a depth of 400 or
500 fathoms it begins to present precipitous faces, and above 130 to 140
fathoms is crowned by the almost vertical cliffs of Chamisso’s ‘‘table
FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL. 405

mountain,” which, as he rightly divined, is of a similar nature from
base to summit. All this is coral reef; how much more may be so it is
impossible in the present state of our knowledge to say.

The general feeling of disappointment with which our failure to bore
through the reef was received was fully shared by our friends in
Sydney. Determined not to be put off with a first rebuff, they promptly
commenced to make arrangements for a second attempt, and last year
(1897) an expedition again left Sydney for Funafuti, this time under
the direction of Prof. Edgeworth David, of the University of Sydney.
Under his leadership the boring proved a complete success. The reef
was penetrated to a depth of 697 feet, or 116 fathoms. Thus Darwin’s
wish has now been more than satisfied. The core brought up was sent
over to this country and is now in the hands of Professor Judd for
investigation. Till he has completed his report it would be premature
to enter into details, but from a general examination, made without the
aid of the microscope, I think I may fairly venture to say this much:
That the material brought up from the boring, and of which the reef is

composed, presents much the same general character throughout and
so far supports Darwin’s theory; that layers of chalky ooze, such as on
Sir John Murray’s hypothesis we might have expected to find in the
lower parts, are conspicuously absent; and finally that it presents no
trace of volcanic material.

On whatever side judgment may ultimately be given in this question,
the thanks of the scientific world must undoubtedly be conceded to Sir
John Murray for having disturbed a decided opinion from its slumber,
for having awakened a fresh interest in Darwin’s theory, and in thus
leading to renewed investigation, which is both adding to our knowledge
and suggesting fresh inquiry.

The sand showing little trace of consolidation, which was noticed in
our boring down to 100 feet, is maintained in Professor David’s boring
down to about 100 fathoms, and it is not a little remarkable that
material so loosely aggregated should be able to sustain itself in slopes
of as much as 80°, such as characterize the flanks of Funafuti. It is
406 FUNAFUTI: THE STORY OF A CORAL ATOLL.

important, however, to observe that none of the borings yet made have
been sunk through the true growing substance of the atoll. They have
commenced on the lagoon side of the true coral reef, and the deeper
they have descended the more remote they have become from the ocean
flanks. The possibility exists, and should not be overlooked, that a
great part of the material passed through in the bore holes represents
deposits of the lagoon and of the fragmentary débris driven toward it
by the breakers.

It will be observed that Professor David’s bore hole does not trayv-
erse the whole thickness of the table mountain; judging from the
soundings, it would have to descend 20 or 30 fathoms deeper to do this,
and it would seem likely that the material obtained from this last 20
or 30 fathoms might surpass in interest all the rest. Our friends in
Sydney fully appreciate this, and are so bent on probing this question
to the utmost that they have already dispatched, at great pecuniary
risk, an expedition to make a third attempt on Funafuti, and this time
to carry the bore hole right through the table mountain.

The boring party is at this moment at work on the island, and before
many weeks have elapsed we may expect to receive tidings of their
success. A great stride will then have been taken toward a final
determination of the long-standing controversy on the origin of atolls.!

We eagerly await the result, which will inform us whether these
central oceanic islands are ancient remains of land which have plunged
beneath the sea and are renewing their youth, or whether they are
among the latest products of our planet, aspiring mountains which
have scarcely yet succeeded in their struggle upward to the light of
day; whether they are, as has been said, ‘a garland laid by the hand
of Nature on the tomb of a sunken island,” or whether they may not be a
wreath of victory crowning a youthful summit on its first conquest of
the main.

'The critical point has been passed. (See Nat. Sci. XIII, p. 362.) According to
the news from Funafuti (September 6) the boring attained a depth of 987 feet, or
147 feet below the base of the steepest cliff. The material passed through was coral
limestone. It is of interest to ubserve that, soon after passing the bottom of Pro-
fessor David’s bore hole, loose unconsolidated deposits ceased to be encountered,
and the drill passed with comparative facility through a hard limestone containing
numerous well-preserved corals. A erux of all theories of atolls is the lagoon. On
Darwin’s theory its explanation follows naturally from the fundamental assump-
tion. Sir John Murray has to supplement his hypothesis by a separate explanation,
and proposes to account for the lagoon by solution. Jn this connection the success
which has attended an attempt of the present expedition to bore into the bed of she
lagoon is most welcome. The boring was made from the deck of H. M.S. Porpoise,
commanded by Captain Sturdee, and after passing through 101 feet of water sank
144 feet into the deposits of the floor. The first 80 feet were found to consist of the
calcareous alga Halimeda mixed with shells; the remaining 64 feet of the same
material, mingled with coral gravel. This alga is universally distributed over the
floor of the lagoon, as proved by an examination of the material obtained by Cap-
tain Field in sounding, and since it contains a certain percentage of magnesium
carbonate we are led to expect that the formation of dolomite will be found to stand
in some connection with the transformation of lagoon deposits.
OCEANOGRAPHY!

By M. J. THOULET.

A new science has lately made its appearance and is beginning to be
recognized. To be exact, it is not absolutely new; it is nearly two cen-
turies old in its well-defined aim, its methods of investigation, its known
laws, the indication of possible discoveries which remain to be accom-
plished; in a word, in its individuality as a didactic science, but until

very lately it was the object of individual research only, and as it was

studied but by a few specialists it remained almost unknown to the

public.

This science is oceanography. Its purpose is to ascertain the phe-
nomena which are going on in the depths of that immense mass of water
which covers more than three-fourths of our globe, to consider them,
explain them, discover and formulate the laws that govern them on the
surface and at the bottom of those abysses which were once supposed
to be unfathomable—at the time when people believed in the unfathom-
able. To-day oceanography is progressing with giant strides. All mar-
itime nations contribute to its development, no less from the theoretical
point of view, for its great benefit to the human mind, whose right and
duty it is to seek to know all things, than from the practical point of
view of tbe material advantages to be derived from it; for the contest
between man and nature, growing always more severe, makes it imper-
ative that no force be left unproductive. France established ocean-
ography. She made important discoveries and then stopping, left the
care of continuing the work to others, forgetting even those of her

~ children whose attainments, unnoticed by her, were elsewhere seized

upon and utilized. Now that foreigners have made an advance which
it is impossible to ignore, she seems to be aroused to a regret for the
time and territory lost. She is certainly in a position to promptly regain
both if she desires it.

We intend to explain of what oceanography consists, to show its direct
relation with other sciences, its theoretical and practical utility; we
Shall give a short history of its progress from its beginning until the time
when it became a complete whole; a clear and systematic exposition

of facts carefully considered and elucidated. We shall say a few
words concerning what has been done in this line of thought by differ-
ent nations, with the character which their peculiar temperament, the
conditions of their past and of their present have given to their work.
In fact, just as the acts of each man, physical as well as moral, are
marked with the special imprint of his personality so in the domain of
science every race stamps its work, the product of its collective intel-
ligence, with an impress peculiar to it, which constitutes the very essence
of its genius.

Oceanography is the study of the sea. Static oceanography deals
with salt water considered independently of the movements which are
manifested in it; it treats successively of the topography of the ocean
beds and of their formation, their lithology. It analyzes the waters,
their composition and their influence on the nature of the depths, their
numerous physical properties, the effect on them caused by changes of
temperature, their density, their compressibility, the way in which
light is diffused throughout the superposed strata, and the different
optical phenomena. ‘The ice of the polar region offers subject matter
for a chapter on the effect of cold on the sea.

In dynamie oceanography the ocean is studied in motion. We study
the waves, which move the surface under the influence of the wind, and
the currents, which, like the network of our arteries and veins, traverse
its mass to a certain depth, and result from the simultaneous actions
of heat, evaporation, the topography of the sea bottom, the geographic
configuration of the surrounding continents, the climate, the force of
the winds; in a word, from the total of exterior causes which, whatever
they may be, all exert some influence and in turn are influenced—a
constantly recurring cycle of change whose cessation would bring
instant death to our planet as the last beat of the human heart termi-
nates the life of the body. Dynamic oceanography also includes the
study of the tides, whose rhythmic movements accord with those of the
stars, and the examination of those processes by which the débris of
the continents, swept off by winds or washed away by rivers, reach the
great common reservoir, are diffused throughout its waters, descend in
a Shower to the very lowest depths, and there accumulate to form
rocks like the greater part of those which we find now on our continents
and which formed the bottom of the oceans of former ages. It deals
with the phenomena that result from the contact between sea and
land, seeks out the laws which control the formation of deltas or of the
bars which extend across the mouths of rivers, the filling up of estua-
ries, the way in which waves and currents shape the contours of the
shores, dunes, lagoons, and those madreporic formations—atolls and
coral islands—conquests of organic life over inorganic matter, of the
infinitely small, the zoophyte, over the infinitely powerful, the ocean.
OCEANOGRAPHY. 409

Oceanography has to do then, directly or indirectly, with a multi-
tude of sciences and, more than any other, with geology. The present
is at the same time the key of the past and of the future, especially in
natural history. Man, in his investigations, works from the known to
the unknown, from what he can see with his eyes, touch with his hands,
measure with his instruments, to that of which he can perceive only
the results; from phenomena present before him to those which were
accomplished thousands of centuries ago. [or a long time geology
advanced in a rut out of which oceanography has forced it perhaps a
little against its inclination. Old people and old sciences have their
habits and a dislike to change, but old sciences, more fortunate than
man, can grow young again.

Rocks are of igneous or metamorphic and of sedimentary origin. The
former are the object of the researches of a special science, petrogra-
phy, which studies their intimate nature and all the different branches
of knowledge which relate to eruptive phenomena. Stratigraphy deals
with rocks of aqueous formation, and, as the genesis of these is inti-
mately connected with the order of their superposition, stratigraphists,
in their investigations, consider together the constitution and the order
of the sedimentary strata. Now, since these strata have been found
beneath the water, nothing is more fitted to make their genesis clear
than observation of the manner in which at the present time rocks are
being formed on the bottom of our oceans. This task, to which it
applies itself with ardor, is the duty of oceanography. When the par-
ticular character of the formations on the coasts or in the depth of the
sea is known, when careful observation and exact measurement of
actual phenomena shall have taught, for example, the necessary rela-
tion between the form and dimensions of a grain of sand and the
exact velocity of the current which has transported it and affected its
shape—angular when supported by force of the water, worn and
rounded when simply rolled along the bottom among other grains; as

physical and mechanical laws, to determine whether this deposit was

repeated in different parts of the ocean, shall have established the

Shall be ready to reconstruct the past. It will be sufficient to find
the same characteristics in an old deposit to be able to call established
relations to our aid. We may affirm that the point where the deposit
was formed was at such and such a depth in the ocean, at such a dis-
tance from the shore. If, later, other sciences bring forward their
cooperation and point out new relations, all the details will, one after
another, appear. We shall then ascertain the size and form of the
Silurian, the Carboniferous or the Cretaceous Sea, the force of its waves,
its salinity, the temperature of its waters, the intensity and direction

of its currents, its flora and its fauna. Thus, having for foundation
only a single grain of sand observed beneath the microscope and which,
through oceanography, shall have recounted all the events at which it
has assisted, after centuries upon centuries the edifice will appear firm,
solid, in its complete magnificence. Do not think that this is a scien-
tific dream, as full of uncertainty as of charm. These deductions have
the absolute and unquestionable precision of mathematics. After so
many unexpected discoveries, our epoch leaves it no longer in doubt
that the greatest poets are sometimes the scientists.

The laws of meteorology present an important practical interest
because they lead up to the forecasting of the weather. There is no
need to dwell upon the profit humanity may derive from such a dis-
covery. How many misfortunes will be averted for the agriculturist!
Navigation will feel no less benefit if it can know in advance the regions
of calm, of contrary or favorable winds. How many voyages will be
shortened, how many lives saved! Wecan judge of this from cyclones.
Formerly the terror of sailors, since their laws have been known they
have been utilized to expedite voyages. The subjugated hurricane
works for the sailor, and when ordered to bring the ship more quickly
into port the docile tempest obeys and thus averts the dangers of the
route. Who among our forefathers would have dared to formulate such
a dream, realized, nevertheless, through the work of Bridet? Now the
laws of the aerial ocean and of the liquid ocean are the same, although
more complicated for the first than for the second. They should con-
sequently be studied synthetically on the sea and applied afterward to
the atmosphere, with such modifications as are made necessary by the
great difference in the mobility of the two fluids. The rational intro-
duction to meteorology is oceanography. Steam has greatly modified
and simplified the former conditions of navigation, and to-day steamers
progress almost in a straight line despite wind and sea. However, the
sailing vessel is not as dead as some may believe. As a result of the
mutual interactions, so delicate, so changeable, of economic conditions,
of the high price of coal, of the large space occupied by the machinery
and the store of fuel, of the higher salary of mechanics, and for still
other causes, many nations are returning to sailing vessels. Americans
in particular possess clippers of great speed, which carry freight at less
charges than do steamships. The study of the phenomena of the ocean
has lost none of its practical utility to navigation and it has become
indispensable for the elucidation of a multitude of points. Marine
currents are elucidated by meteorology, because of the influence which
regular winds have upon the flow of the waters. They control the
course of floating ice fields. The dangers to boats off the banks of
Newfoundland are well known. To this place come the icebergs which
have broken off from the glaciers of Greenland, and have been carried
down Baffin’s Bay by the Labrador current to melt away at contact with
OCEANOGRAPHY. All

the Gulf Stream. The accumulation of the resulting débris of rocks
forms the banks of Newfoundland.

These ice fields are of Sartioular interest because of fe fear they
inspire, because of the shoals formed by their melting, and particularly
because the chilling occasioned by their contact with an atmosphere
warmer and more saturated with moisture, gives rise to heavy fogs.
Hundreds of disasters would be avoided, enormous economy in the
transportation of merchandise would be effected if we could succeed
in understanding and foreseeing these phenomena. The admirable
pilot charts published every month by the Hydrographic Bureau at
Washington seek to solve the problem empirically, noting to what
latitude the ice fields descend each year, observing their number, and
establishing the probabilities concerning them according to the average
of numerous observations. [Togs due to analogous causes—that is to
say, to marine currents—are frequent in the northern or even the tem-
perate region, on the North Sea, the English Channel, and on the
Atlantic coasts of England and France. Everywhere they are the
terror of sailors; ships move in them bewildered, advancing at the risk
of running ashore or colliding with another vessel, while if they remain
stationary they are in danger of being themselves struck, and in any
case they lose time, that precious commodity whose price rises higher
every day. The ability to foresee their presence, or if overtaken by
them to find the course and follow it with certainty, would be the imme-
diate consequence of the perfecting of oceanography.

Some attempts at this have been crowned with success. The position
of a ship in the ocean is usually determined by the aid of astronomical
coordinates. According to the observed position of a heavenly body,
star or sun, the observer calculates his own position on the surface of
the waves. Knowing where he is and where he is going, nothing is
easier for him than to follow his course. But the indispensable con-
dition is to see the star; this the fog renders impossible. This impos-
sibility is the cause of most shipwrecks. However, tie position can be
otherwise determined. If we have a so-called bathymetric chart,
plainly indicating by means of contour lines the depth of the water at
each point, and another chart drawn up after a series of soundings and
of preliminary analyses showing in the same part of the sea the changing
nature of the bottom, here sand and there mud of one kind or another
and there rocks, by a single cast of the lead a vessel lost in the midst of
the ocean can determine her position. The depth of the sounding will
confine the observation to the area for which the bathymetric chart
gives this depth. If, moreover, care has been taken to fit the sounding
lead with some means by which a sample of the bottom nay be brought
up, the area covered by this kind of bottom may be looked up on the
lithologie chart, and, combining this information with the preceding,
one will be able to ascertain his position almost exactly. Excellent
412 OCEANOGRAPHY.

applications of this method have been made in France by Commander
de Roujoux and by Captain Trudelle for landfalls in different localities,
along the Channel, at the entrance to New York, Havre, Brest, and the
very dangerous approaches to Cape Guardafui. Two oceanographic
coordinates have taken the place of the astronomical coordinates. The
vessel, having lost her sight, makes use of feeling. To draw up bathy-
metrical and lithological charts is one of the principal objects of ocean-
ography.

Oceanography has to maritime fisheries a relation still more impor-
tant, if that is possible, than to geology, meteorology, and navigation, for
this industry is related closely to the very life of nations. In France we
have more than 86,000 marine fishermen, while more than 200,000 people
derive, directly or indirectly, their means of existence from fishing; as,
for instance, the men and women employed in the canning factories.

There are very many marine animals of which man makes use either
as food, such as fishes, crustaceans, certain mollusks such as oysters
and mussels, or to gratify his needs of all sorts, as sponges, pearls, coral,
the great cetaceans, as whales or cachalots, and seals, from which he
obtains oil and skin. No being escapes from the influence of the sur-
roundings in the midst of which he lives and which govern his material
existence as well as his manners, his morals, and his intellectual facul-
ties. Nowhere are these restrictions more strikingly evident than in
the water, probably because they are found there in a state of the
greatest simplification or, to be more exact, the least complication. The
laws of oceanography are, then, the rational basis for the conduct of
fisheries, which have become methodical and consequently scientific,
and pisciculture is a kind of agriculture of the sea.

In the harmony between a being and his environment, three cases
present themselves: If the harmony is perfect, the being, finding the
utmost satisfaction for his needs, develops and multiplies; if it is only
partial, the being who suffers it becomes rare; if, finally, the harmony
is absent, the being will disappear by flight if he possesses, like an
animal, the power of motion, or by death if, like a plant, he is con-
demned to remain in one place. The living creature thus indicates in
three ways the condition of his surroundings—by his presence, his
rarity, or his absence. Dredgings made even in great depths show
in a striking way the extreme specialization in the distribution of the
animal species, among which some are evidently more sensitive to the
environment, others lessso. Hach special group conforms to correspond-
ing, special, exterior conditions, physical, chemical, or mechanical, and
in this way the animal, vegetable, and, to a certain degree, even the
mineral becomes an instrument of measurement, roughly graduated, it
is true, because while abundance or absence are relatively easy to rec-
ognize, nothingis more vague and less determinable than degrees of rar-
ity. A fish found in a certain locality indicates that the water there
possesses a depth, a temperature, a certain limited range of salinity, a
OCEANOGRAPHY. 413

special kind of bottom and currents of calculable speed. Al these details
are implied in the presence or absence of this fish. Fishing isa problem
whichconsists in knowing beforehand whether in sucha place atsuchand |
such a time the fish will be abundant, rare, or absent. Other nations
have fully recognized that the study of fisheries is, above everything,
the study of the relations existing between the marine environment
and the animal; that is to say, a question of zoology whose first basis
is knowledge of the environment, which is a question of oceanography.
They have put the principle in practice in their laboratories and in
their official administrations, working out in detail the oceanography
of a region before devoting themselves to zoological researches there.
It is to be wished that this practice were more generally followed. It
is a common sense law, but it is only too true that such are the slowest
in making themselves known. [Every improvement is simplification,
and the men who cry unceasingly for simplicity are as if appalled when
they come upon it unawares.

But if the presence or absence of a fish is so difficult to determine
except by long and expensive trials, it is not so with the condition of
the environment, which can be estimated and even recorded in figures,
by means of instruments; temperature by the thermometer, density
and salinity by the areometer, depth by the sounding line, the nature
of the bottom by a lithological or chemical analysis. The instrument
offers the advantage of having a perfect graduation, recording a suffi-
cient number of degrees and consequently great delicacy of indication.
On the other hand, it has the inconvenience of recording but one of the
conditions of the surrounding of which the living creature records the
whole. However, we must not forget that the purpose of science is,
briefly, to discover what is above all others the most essential influence,
and besides that if a single instrument is not sufficient, there is nothing
to prevent our having recourse to many in succession. It would cost
the fisher less time and trouble to measure the temperature and then,
if it is necessary, the transparency and even the density in a certain
region, then according to the results obtained set to work fishing with
great probabilities of success, or to immediately leave the ground, than
to cast his line and nets into the water, throwing his bait away hap-
hazard, to learn finally only after a prolonged trial that the fish will or
will not bite. Prof. H. Mohn, of Christiania, formerly head of the
splendid Norwegian oceanographic expedition of the Voringen, in 1876,
found out! that at the Loffoten Islands the cod remained always in a
bed of water between 4° and 5° in temperature (39° to 41° F.). Accord-
ing to his instructions a Government vessel, commanded by Lieut. G.
Gade, went to ascertain the position in depth of this bed and to verify
the scientific previsions. The success of this examination was perfect,
and now Norwegian fishermen use the thermometer as a fishing

apparatus. They seek a stratum having a temperature of 4° or 5°, the
depth being variable not only in the same locality but also in the same
region from time to time, and as soon as they find it they cast their
lines and fish with certainty. The example is pertinent. It was fur-
nished by an eminent scientist; it has received and still receives, every
season, the sanction of practice and affords actual benefit to fishers.
How eminently desirable it is that such a study should be made on
the Newfoundland Banks or in Iceland, I mean in a serious way, by a
competent person, and, as was done by the Norwegians, on board a
vessel specially adapted for this research.

Other experiments no less interesting have been made in the labora-
tory of pisciculture in Flé6devig. The Norwegians live by the sea; they
are obliged to cultivate it, and, in fact, they declare that they have suc-
ceeded in restocking it with cod. Their processes are now being applied
at Newfoundland by the English. It has been observed that the spawn
of the cod must be raised in water of a certain temperature and density.
If the water is too dense the young fisb are not sufficiently strong to
overcome its resistance and seek food on the bottom; if it is too light
they easily reach the bottom, but have difficulty in holding themselves
there, while if it is within the required limits of density, the animal,
able to move at liberty, finds entire satisfaction of his needs and devel-
ops rapidly until, having reached his full strength, he ceases to be sen-
sitive to the slight variations in his surroundings and can nourish
himself in the sea where he is given his liberty. Breeding is carried
on at Flédevig under perfectly systematic and scientific conditions,
with the greatest benefit to the industry.

In the laboratory at Dildo, near St. John, Newfoundland, where simi-
lar restocking is carried on, the director, Mr. Nielsen,' discovered that
the water in the breeding ponds for the male and female cod intended
for reproduction must have a temperature from 4 to 7 degrees and that
young cod, living well in water at zero, will die as soon as the tempera-
ture falls only half of a degree.

By reason of the development of science and general progress, war
has become so difficult and frightful in its consequences for the two
adversaries, neither of whom can ever be really victorious, that it is
almost impossible between nations that are about equal in the scale of
civilization. If nations wish to live and not be overwhelmed, peacefully
but completely, by other peoples, their competitors in the terrible strug-
gle for existence, they must use to their best advantage the riches of
their territory. If agriculture, now scientific, obtains profit from the
work of scientists who have transformed it from the collection of em-
pirical recipes into a positive science; if we seek by knowledge of the
soil, by suitable alternations of the crops, by appropriate fertiliza-
tion to procure the best results from a piece of land, to make it pro-
duce a maximum of yield, we should do the same with the sea. We

1 Dr. Nielsen, Annual Report, 1893, pp. 21 and 22.
; OCEANOGRAPHY. 415

must admit that we are in this respect undeniably inferior to other
nations. Still plunged in lamentable ignorance and regardless of the
information obtained by careful scientific experiments, we ravage our
coasts, and statistics show that the fishing industry is incapable of
furnishing daily bread to those who practice it at the cost of so much
trouble, fatigne, and danger. We profit by the sea as savages profit
by the earth, when, according to the famous simile, finding a fruit tree
in the forest they cut it down to gather its fruit. We have no com-
plete and detailed map, not even a mediocre one, of the sea bottom,
nor have we any exact ideas of the variations in temperature, in
density, in salinity, along our coasts; we have not calculated the
amount of sediment deposited by any of our great rivers; we are
ignorant to what depth currents are felt and, except for a very small
number of localities, as to their direction on the surface; we have no
idea of their variations in intensity at different periods of the year.
It is only too easy to add to this list of the data which we now lack.
However full of good intention the measures of the administration
may be, they are fruitless if they have not the intervention of author-
ity to sanction the application of the measures approved by science.
How can we be astonished by the poverty of our fishers and the fatal
consequences which can not fail to affect the country? Fish are an
important item in the economies of nations. According to statistics
now somewhat old but rather increased than diminished by time, the
world captures and consumes annually 2,000,000,000 frances worth of
fish.

The industry of laying submarine telegraphs depends on oceanog-
raphy to the same extent that the construction of railroads or canals
depends on topography and continental geology. Perhaps the depend-
ance of the telegraphs is even greater. The railroad and the cable
- follow the contour of the soil; both, for analogous reasons, must avoid
too irregular ground, and the nature of the bottom is of the utmost
importance. On certain bottoms swept by currents, as on the Wyville
Thomson reef to the north of Scotland, the cable, subject to continual
vibrations against the pebbles or frayed by their unceasing friction as
they are washed about by the movement of the waves, wears out and
breaks, however solid its envelope may be. At other times, on volcanic
bottoms, as near Greece, for example, or in the Malay Archipelago, the
cable may be stretched by displacement of the ground, causing changes
in the level which break it.

The landing of the cables is no less important. Rocks are always
very dangerous if they are situated in the zone of action of waves and
tides. While in the open sea the land has every chance of being uni-
form, near the coast it often becomes irregular. It presents sudden
declivities or deep hollows, reefs, straight crevasses bounded by almost
perpendicular walls, such as M. Pruvot has recently discovered, not
in some unknown corner of the Pacific or the South Sea, but in the
416 OCEANOGRAPHY.

Gulf of Lyon, some miles from the little port of Banyuls near Port-
Vendres. A cable laid across such a valley is sure to break, and if
the perfect knowledge of the topography of the region does not make
the cause of the accident clear, we may be tempted to strengthen its
envelope, that is to make it heavier and consequently more certainly
provoke a subsequent rupture. It is not without reason that the
English companies have in their service a fleet of telegraphic vessels
intended for these studies alone, carrying a special technical staff,
unceasingly employed in working on oceanography. They evidently
guard against making known the obtained results, and are no more
to be blamed for their secrecy than would be those contractors for
building railroads who, provided with detailed maps of a region over
which they have been ordered to lay a road, should conceal their docu-
ments, acquired laboriously and at great expense, from the engineers
charged with overlooking their work and with paying them, and who
on their side must, therefore, remain in ignorance of the topography
and geology of the country. England holds the monopoly in the con-
struction of submarine lines. France possesses only a small number,
and, even of these, the larger part were built by the English. It is
not enough to possess colonies beyond the ocean; it is necessary to
be in direct communication with them. That we are at the mercy of
foreigners for our telegraphic communications, the events of Siam and
Madagascar furnish proofs painful to record.

Il.

Oceanography is a science which applies to the natural phenomena
of the sea, the precise methods of the exact sciences, mathematics,
mechanics, physics, and chemistry.

It is a science of experimentation, of measurements, working by
analysis and by synthesis toward the final end of learning the present
history, and consequently the past and future history, of the earth,
because all science which discovers and states laws is a prevision.
Oceanography is thus a branch of geology, and since the soils stratified —
that is to say, deposited—in the midst of the sea, formed by it, enter
largely into that portion of the earth’s crust which is directly accessible
to our investigations, we would be authorized to claim oceanography as
the most important branch of geology. It is ludicrous to hear argu-
ments on the Silurian, the Devonian, or the Carboniferous oceans, now
millions of years old, to hear discussions concerning their shores, their
waters, or their currents, while we still know so little of our own ocean
of to-day, on whose surface our vessels sail, into which we plunge our
bodies, over whose immense circumference we are free to cast our gaze,
with whose waters we moisten our lips if we wish, whose waves sing
their monotonous and majestic harmony in our ears, of which we can
take full possession by all our senses.
OCEANOGRAPHY. ALT

The foregoing considerations enable us to appreciate in its principal
characteristics the method employed in oceanography. The applica-
tion of experiment and of measurement seems at first particularly diffi-
cult, if notimpossible. Itis neither. As regards the ocean, it is cer-
tain that the phenomena apparent there are more than complicated—
they are terrible; and their grandeur apparently puts them far beyond
the power of man. It would be of no use to approach the study
directly. However, even the forces of the sea are forced to yield to
experimentation on condition that we proceed gradually, studying first
lakes—oceans in miniature, governed by laws similar, although less
complicated, and consequently more easy to discover and verify. In
oceanography a phenomenon must pass through three phases of study:
It is established on the ocean, found in lesser degree on lakes, and
studied by synthesis in the laboratory. Thus its law is discovered.
Then, taking the inverse order, it is ascertained whether the law
is verified on lakes, and at last we come back to the ocean. We
observe whether the law holds good there, and in case of modifications
(which usually occur) we seek their causes and consider what new ele-
ments have become involved which were absent, or perchance inef-
fective, on lakes or in the laboratory. The study is now complete and
definite, since, if necessary, we may return to the laboratory, where, rich
in the suggestions which have arisen from our new survey, fortified by
a first approximation, we can arrive at a greater precision, thanks to
a new synthesis established by new experiments. We work from the
known to the unknown and from the simple to the complex, retracing
our steps if necessary.

The objection has been made to the experimental method that phe-
nomena in miniature such as we can produce in the laboratory are not
identical with natural phenomena, since they represent them on a
reduced scale. This reasoning rests on a misunderstanding; every-
thing goes to prove the contrary. Why should a heavy body left
unsupported descend into the sea in any different manner than it
descends in a tube some meters in height filled with salt water? If
the changes are brought about by the duration of the fall, the depth,
the pressure of the layers of water, and other circumstances, these
changes can be studied and estimated by means of separate experi-
ments. It is the usual method of resolving a natural phenomenon by
means of curves of a single equation with multiple variables. Admit-
ting that in certain cases a single experiment in the laboratory is
insufficient to reproduce the phenomenon, yet a series of experiments,
each of which would be performed to make clear the action of one of the
components of the problem, would represent it in its entirety. When,
for example, we have measured in a tube 3 or 4 meters long the dura-
tion of the fall of globigerina in sea water, we evidently do not learn
all the laws of such a fall in the sea. It would be otherwise if, after
having made the experiment with ordinary pressure, we repeat it with

SM 98——27 :
418 OCEANOGRAPHY.

pressure more and more considerable, then with different temperatures,
and each time note the variations resulting from the influence of each
of these variables. Suppose that we have experimented carefully and
tested separately everything that reason, ordinary common sense,
points out as playing a part in the descent of dust particles through
the ocean. If we then verify, first in a lake, then in the ocean, each of
the laws discovered in the laboratory; if we determine that in the
latter they are simply multiplied by a number, the constant coefficient
of increase, we shail refute the critics. If there is a disagreement, we
are apprised of the influence of some variable of which we have not
taken account; and it will be necessary, after having discovered it, to
experiment on it in turn. When all the work is finished we shall have
the proof that, while with a single experiment taken separately we can
not analyze nature, with the entire series we can do so.

It is thus that we should consider oceanography, which, proceeding
upon the plan of not studying the past until the present is well under-
stood, has introduced the experimental method into all that part of
geology relative to sedimentary deposits. It is thus properly a branch
of this science.

When a traveler, overcome by the long and painful ascent of a moun-
tain, finally reaches the summit, he finds it pleasant to him to sit on a
rock and, while recovering from his fatigue, contemplate the plain which
he has crossed, the river whose windings he has followed and which at
this moment spreads out below him, and also the difficult, even danger-
ous, ground, the sand, the marshes, over which he has come with great
exertion. Certain stages of the journey had seemed to him short,
others had appeared very long, and now he calculates what they are
in reality. He distinguishes each error that he has committed. If,
then, turning round, he looks down the other slope of the mountain,
he sees what road he must follow to arrive surely and promptly at the
end of his journey, visible afar in the mist of the horizon. What he
has done gives him courage to complete his task; the victory he has
won over fatigue and obstacles is the warrant of his victory over the
fatigues and difficulties of the future. He gathers new ardor, strength,
and hope. Is not this traveler like the man of science in his journey,
laborious and painful as is all travail, toward the distant truth which,
in his short life, he is certain never to reach? At least he will approach
it at the cost of many mistakes. He has opened up the path, and those
who follow behind him, profiting by his labor, will surpass him. They
will go on farther and yet farther, obedient to that thirst for truth with
which God has endowed every human soul as a mark of its divine
origin and future immortality.

It is necessary to know the history of a science to understand those
works with which it deals and to foresee those which remain for it to
accomplish. Let us now show in the history of oceanography how its
development has been influenced by different sciences and how it
OCEANOGRAPHY. 419

has influenced in its turn numerous others and their applications. It

is the same in every stage of the intellectual improvement of humanity.
We realize with difficulty the momentum (giving to this word the mean-
ing usually assigned to it by physicists) of a-new idea, which leads in
its train a veritable world and pushes another on before it. This is,
perhaps, the explanation of the difficulty with which a new idea over-
comes the opposition it meets from a crowd of people and things that
feel that after having lived they are about to disappear. Nothing
consents to die, and routine is only an instinct of preservation.

-. Oceanography came in without noise. The human mind naturally
seeks causes for that which is seen, or to better recollect them after
they are discovered or even surmised, because of its very weakness it
hastens to deduce laws for them. The first navigators were not impelled
by curiosity which would have been incapable of fortifying their hearts
with the triple armor necessary for facing the sea; they were moved by
selfish interest and by want. The Phoenicians ventured upon the blue
waves of the Mediterranean to provide themselves with slaves and
metals to sell elsewhere and because it was impossible for them to live
confined on the narrow strip of land bounded by the chain of moun-
tains which separated them from hostile hordes. The Scandinavian
pirates, on their light “ drakkars” with curved prows crowned with the
head of a dragon or bird of prey, fled through the rough waves and
tempests of the North Sea from a vast but unfruitful fatherland where
their time, which it was useless to spend in agriculture or in the tran-
quil arts of peace, was given up to social struggles, to perpetual combat,
to victories and, consequently, to defeats, after which the vanquished
was.forced to submit to the vengeance or oppression of the vanquisher.
Thus, not many years ago, the Polynesian, driven by famine from his
island which had become too densely populated, flew in his pirogue
with high sails of matting over the great swell of the Pacific. To all
these voyagers the sea, despite its terrors, became a refuge. He who
feels himself separated only by a few planks from moving abysses,
where his gaze sees nothing when, profiting by the hollows in the waves,
he tries to penetrate their depths, realizes that terrible forces too vast
to be conquered by any human power surround and rule him, and that
brute force avails nothing; it is necessary to call to his aid skill and
science. All sailors are scientists, some more so, some less, according
to their abilities, in order to elucidate the phenomena going on around
them, of which they would be the plaything if they did not set to work
in some measure to predict them in order to draw from them, first,
security and then profit. How useful it would be to know the probable
regions of calms and of storms, the strength and the direction of the
currents, and the mutual connection of the phenomena of the earth, the
heavens, and the waters, so that when one of them has been examined
the other may be foreseen, and if it is to be feared, conquered. The
more humanity advanced the more the sum of its known facts increased,
420 OCEANOGRAPHY.

the more indispensable it became to coordinate them, the more legend
and empiricism became transformed into science.

Thus antiquity and the middle ages passed; thus these ‘‘sea rovers,”
as Michelet calls them, advanced—Icelanders, Arabs, Dieppois, and
Basques. We can not admit that the sailors who then plowed the
Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, and the seas of China could remain indif-
ferent to the favorable or unfavorable circumstances whose advantages
or dangers were tlhe more worthy of attention since their ships were
smaller and less capable of resistance than are the enormous vessels of
the present day propelled by steam. It is only through skill that the
weak are victorious. When the Norsemen about the year 1000 went
from Norway to Iceland, from Iceland to Greenland, and from Green-
land to that Vinland which five centuries later was to become America,
they left in the places which they there discovered names which showed
that natural phenomena had markedly attracted their attention; Stra-
umsoe, the island of currents; Straumsfjorde, the bay of currents;
Straumness, the cape of currents.

Suddenly, about the middle of the fifteenth century, the world experi-
enced a great disturbance. The Renaissance began to make its influ-
ence felt throughout all Europe. ‘There was a universal awakening of
curiosity, of science, of ambition, of life; that is to say, of desire of
enjoyment and of gold. There are such periods of fermentation in the
lives of individuals as in those of nations. Their primary wants were
satisfied, they desired more. The earth was divided among different
races, each race divided into peoples, the peoples into provinces, the
provinces into villages, hamlets, castles, all hostile to one another, war-
ring, fighting, massacring, and being massacred. The least painful
road for peaceful or for adventurous spirits, impatient with an ambition
difficult to satisfy in the old countries, was now the sea. All nations
launched out upon the waters. Some, Venetians, Genoese, sought
riches and found them, others sought riches and rule over vast coun-
tries. The sea gave glory and fortune, asking in exchange only bold-
ness, and valiant spirits of all nations, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians,
French, English, and a little later Dutch, embarked on vessels. Colum-
bus discovered America anew, a discovery that was not the result of
chance. Admitting that he had not received formal assurance of its
existence, he foresaw it, guided by his observations and oceanographic
information, marred and distorted, but nevertheless collected and trans-
mitted from mouth to mouth. At Porto Santo he had handled a piece
of carved wood thrown upon the shore by the currents and during for-
mer voyages he had remarked that the western shores of Norway, Scot-
land, and Ireland were strewn with pieces of wood of unknown species
brought by the waves from an unknown land. He, too, sought this
land and found it.

When he reached it and, wishing to broaden the field of his discov-
eries, navigated that sea which was later to be called the Caribbean
~~

Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, he never relaxed his observation of the
movement of the waters. At the ‘‘Serpent’s Mouth,” near the Gulf of
Paria, he saw that the current turned to the west; he recognized this
again on the coast of Honduras. Grouping the results of his experi-
ments he formulated an hypothesis and declared that the sea in its
advance followed the firmament from east to west. The true father of
oceanography is the Gulf Stream. It seems as if men had invented
the science solely to explain this current, which even to-day is the most
studied and best known of the phenomena of the ocean. For many
years all the sailing expeditions from Spain radiated around Hispa-
niola and Cuba. Ocampo sailed all around the latter island. In 1513
Ponce de Leon, having for pilot Anton de Alaminos (who had been
pilot for Columbus in his last voyage), set out in search of the Foun-
tain of Youth in Florida, and his vessel passed with difficulty through
the waters whose current set with great force toward the north. A
little later Diego Columbus, the son of the admiral, gathered together
his data, combined them, and as Pierre Martyr d’Angleria recounts,
asserted the continuity of this river of the ocean and that of the con-

_ tinent which checks it on the west and turns it back in a contrary

direction. Scientific data appeared. Anton de Alaminos, after he had
accompanied Cordova, then Grijalva, around Yucatan and the Gulf of
Mexico, became chief pilot of Cortez when he went to seize the empire
of Montezuma, and when the conqueror feared to be stopped by the
jealousies and intrigues of his enemies in Cuba and Madrid, in order
to baffle them, he charged his pilot to return in all haste to Spain and
carry to the court dispatches, and particularly presents. Alaminos was
the first to make use of his observations. To arrive more promptly he
took the longer route, and leaving Vera Cruz turned his vessel toward
the north of Cuba and the straits of Florida. We have here the three
successive phases—the oceanographic discovery, its formulation and use
for deductions, and lastly the putting it in practice.

All seas were traversed. Bartholomeu Dias discovered the Cape of
Tempests; Vasco da Gama doubled it and entered the Indian Sea;
Magellan and his Basque pilot, Sebastian del Cano, made the first
voyage around the world; the Cabots, Jacques Cartier, Francis Drake,
Hudson, Willoughby, and many others went from all! coasts seeking
empires or a more direct route by the north of America to India and
China. Navigation and geography gave rise to the first observations
relative to the sea. Each people, seeing, with reason, a competitor in
every other people, took the greatest care to guard the secret of its

discoveries. The Carthaginian boat, pursued by a more powerful

Roman vessel, did not hesitate to cast itself on the coast and to break
upon the rocks rather than indicate the way to the country of tin.
Vasco da Gama in his war vessel massacred the crew and passengers
of the poor Arabian boutre which he found laden with pilgrims in the
Indian Sea. However, despite all efforts, the facts which could be made
422 OCEANOGRAPHY.

use of were slowly divulged, spread, and reached the ears of scientists,
who arranged them and disseminated them with the power that had
arisen with the recent invention of the art of printing.

Interest and curiosity awoke in proportion as knowledge developed.
The era of geographic discoveries passed because there were no more
empires to conquer. Competition died out and there began a period
during which a passion for natural history seized the nations, while
individuals bore proudly the title of naturalists. Travelers visited
unknown islands and continents, gazed with wonder at the curiosities
of these lands, and wished to describe them in detail. They did not at
first consider whether or not this would be of any practical advantage,
but confined themselves to the knowledge that these things existed,
that the forms of plants and of animals were unusual, and this was suffi-
cient to interest them. It was the epoch of enthusiasm. From the
middle of the last century until about the middle of the present the
world was enamored of social ideas, of political ideas, of art, litera-
ture, science, and even geography. They were taken by everything.
Like children in infancy, they rejoiced almost without suspecting it
in the supreme happiness of possessing a faith—often, indeed, two or
three rather than one. Setting out boldly to discover the Utopia
of their dreams, so long known and yet always so new and so full
of charm, they traversed the oceans. Great voyages were made. In
1772 Cook went to Tahiti, accompanied by the naturalist Forster,
to observe the transit of Venus. In 1815 the Russian Kotzebue
went round the world on the Rurtk, with the naturalist Chamisso;
in 1826 the future Admiral Fitzroy took Darwin aboard his ship, the
Beagle; Bougainville on the Boudeuse, De Freycinet on the Uranie in
1827, Vaillant on the Bonite in 1836, and still others studied the natu-
ral history of all climates and brought back large collections. There
was the same enterprise on land as on sea. Victor Jacquemont went
to India overflowing with ardor, intoxicated with love of science at the
aspect of the wonders and grandeur of nature. Those who were born
half a century ago look back on a childhood and youth brightened by
the last gleams of these emotions. We did not then have encyclope-
dias of scientific romances, the quintessence of human knowledge con-
tained in 500 pages as the meat of an entire ox is concentrated into
one Small pot, and we were, for want of more or less substantial nour-
ishment, forced to feed our minds with fancies. We began with the
history of Sindbad the Sailor, the old man of the sea, the valley of
emeralds and of rubies, over which the roc hovered, beating the air
with great outspread wings. We went on with the library of voyages—
Cook, Dampier, Carteret, Lapérouse, the reminiscenses of Jacques
Arago, the blind man, and the adorable letters of Victor Jacquemont.
With our books of pictures—and what pictures they were!—we could
bask in the dazzling light of the equatorial sun; we breathed the odors
of primeval forests, where the lofty cocoa palm waved its leafy top
OCEANOGRAPHY. 423

high over the thick undergrowth and the vast shades at whose feet the
sleepy waves broke softly on the sandy beach of a desert isle; we
looked out into the somber depths of starry nights. These were the
feasts of thought. Over the open page of an atlas we dreamed, trav-
ersing the seas from the Tropics to the Poles, braving teinpests and
eternal ice, gathering incalculable treasures of poetic thought, the con-
solation and often the strength of our mature age, which, after many
years, dissipated, scattered iu light smoke by the wind of the tempests
of life, terrible and implacable as those of the ovean, reduced to no
more than the humble denier, the widow’s mite, remain still the joy
and blessing of old age, which advances upon us with giant strides.
Just as the thirst for discoveries was assuaged because there was
nothing more to discover, the thirst for natural curiosities diminished
and in its turn disappeared. Many grew tired of being enthusiastic,
of admiring, when they thought that they had seen everything; they
grew more tired yet of cataloguing. Moreover, it was necessary to
make other use of the riches acquired than giving a name to each
object, placing samples of minerals in glass cases or cellars, samples of
plants between sheets of paper in a herbarium, stuffing animals and
setting them in line ina gallery. Ideas became more serious; poetry
and fancy gave way to science, which is in itself poetry and fancy.
The intelligence of a man, following its natural bent, wished now to
group the accumulation of facts in his possession under hypothetical
laws, and he went to nature to verify the hypotheses suggested in his
laboratory. Cook observed—that is to say, measured—the transit of
Venus; Dumont d’ Urville sought the southern magnetic pole; Sabine
and Sir John Franklin went for the same purpose to the arctic regions.
We gathered no more at random; we advanced toward a definite end.
Little by little, aided by the progress of chemistry and physics, the
need of exactitude is making itself felt everywhere. Weare applying
it to oceanography. Realizing that it is indispensable to measure, we
are no longer content to describe. We invent instruments, make chem-
ical analyses, record figures, which are condensed facts, aud true
science, methodical and useful, is being evolved. At the head of each
chapter on oceanography is found the name of a man of genius or of
talent and an instrument. The currents of the sea have Franklin and
the thermometer; the topography and lithology of submarine depths
have Buache with his isobathic charts, Brooke and his detachable sound-
ing lead, Delesse and his lithological charts; the chemistry of the sea
has Forchhammer and his analyses; thermatics has Miller-Casella, then
Negretti and Zambra with their differential thermometer; optics has
Bérard with his porcelain plate, which shortly after becomes the disk of
Secchi; physics, the mechanism of the waves, has Aimé with his mer-
cury gage and the ball apparatus which he tested in the roadstead of
Algiers, and the Weber brothers with their trough. All data are now
reduced to graphical form constantly improved to approach nearer and
424 OCEANOGRAPHY.

nearer the truth, showing at a glance on each sheet of paper the pic-
ture of what is going on over the entire world in each order of phe-
nomena, Showing this even more clearly than it could be seen in nature,
for on paper the phenomena are to some extent analyzed and dissected
for easier comprehension of their components. We have leisure
to examine separately and at the same time, by the superposition
of charts having the same scale, the salinity, the temperature of the
surface and of the depths, the meteorology, the contour of the bottom,
its mineralogic constitution, the currents, waves, and all else. These
charts permit us to combine, analyze, synthetize, experiment, sum up
in every way, without fatigue or danger, without travel or loss of time.
The scientist considers nature without leaving his laboratory, whither
gathers the entire world to show itself in its slightest details and to
unveil its mysteries,

I have not spoken of the author of theoretical and practical oceanog-
raphy, founded on experimentation and measurement, as rigorous,
considering the imperfections of the instruments employed, as in our
own time. Marsigli founded it at one stroke. Born in Italy in 1658,
successively engineer in the service of the Emperor Leopold I, slave in
Turkey, member of the Academy of Sciences of Paris and of the Royal
Society of London, covered with glory, ignominiously degraded from
all his titles and honors, a veritable Bohemian of science, who studied
the sea in Provence and published the first didactic treatise on oceanog-
raphy in Holland, and whose funeral eulogy was pronounced by Fon-
tenelle. Marsigli rose suddenly, having had neither master nor
precursor. Nothing was lacking to his work. It was complete—too
complete, for though admired and appreciated by a few rare, eminent
minds, among others the illustrious Boerhaave, he did not found a
school. Oceanography, invented by Marsigli in the last years of the
seventeenth century, fell into oblivion. One and a half centuries later,
about 1842, his studies were taken up without much success by a French-
man, Aimé. In spite of these two men of genius, who were merely
isolated workers, the merit of important discoveries, and especially of
methodical work continued uninterruptedly during a hundred years,
gives to the United States the right to call themselves the founders
of oceanography.

Applications of sciences result in new discoveries. The periods of
ambition, of geographic discoveries, scientific discoveries, observations,
generalizations, commercial or political interests, are evidently not
clearly defined. They intermingle as they succeed one another. The
mind goes back more than once over its steps, because attention is
awakened by some point which has been passed over without attach-
ing to it sufficient importance. Phenomena are connected with one
another as are the studies to which they give rise. It is necessary for
the success of the fishing industry that the formation and character of
the sea bottom be noted and submarine lithology be observed, because
OCEANOGRAPHY. 425

the skate lives in mud, the sole in sand, and the gurnet among the
rocks; zoology seeks to learn how temperature and salinity are distrib-
uted in the water; the telegraph industry needs very precise topo-
graphic charts of the bottoms where it proposes to lay its cables.
Discoveries multiply and every science develops with each generation
of men.

As soon as a science is almost complete another replaces it, or per-
haps two or three are founded together, for we see that natural mani-
festations, believed to be of a different order, are dependent in reality
on the same law. Evolution is going on. Mineralogy is only a chap-
ter of physics and chemistry; chemistry grew out of physics; physics
grew out of mathematics; natural history is differentiating into groups
and sciences; paleontology becomes paleozoology, a chapter of zoology,
and paleobotany a section of botany; stratigraphic geology is paleo-
ceanography and paleogeography; light is electricity; rhythmic vibra-
tion, measurable and measured, the wave—of sound, of light, of heat,
of chemical action, of electricity—rules throughout the universe; bar-
riers fall, matter follows the laws of the mind, everything advances
toward scientific unity, as in the social domain everything moves
toward unity of condition—that which assures to all, in the name of
their common right to life, the maximum of happiness compatible with
the human condition. There is slowly evolving a glorious moral and
intellectual unity of truth, of science, of force, and of peace.

Though every nation aspires to this final end, each will reach it by
different ways. While we hope for the day when all will possess the
same intelligence because all will possess the same needs and the same
ideal, this day has not yet,arrived. We see this in every event, no
matter what it may be, literary, artistic, or scientific; we recognize it
in the way in which oceanography has developed. The Englishman
carries into his researches qualities of precision and boldness aroused
by the thought of the practical utilization which he knows will result
from his discoveries. The North German carries a temperament fond
of work, but opinionated, slow, and diffuse; the Frenchman his ready-
witted character, a discoverer, original but not persevering, submissive
to routine, which he never ceases to execrate. The younger nations
are profiting by the experience of their elders and inherit the improve-
ments made in older times; they are endowed from birth with wealth
of incalculable value inherited from former generations. They enter
into action with the ardor, the boldness, and power of youth, and conse-
quently with itssuccess. They take the first rank, or will do so. They
traverse in a few years all] the phases which others took many centuries
topassthrough. In oceanography they undertake voyages of discovery,
make geography, pure science, generalize, find practical applications.
This is what is shown in the history of the development of the studies
relating to the sea in the United States and Russia.

THE RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO THE OTHER
SCIENCKHS.!

By Dr. JULIUS WIESNER,

Rector of the University of Vienna.

Most WorTHY ASSEMBLAGE: In entering upon the honorable but
also responsible office of rector of our university I shall first perform
the duty of thanking my honorable colleagues for the trust which
placed me in this position of high esteem.

Few institutions have outlived the century so vigorously as the
rectorate of this university, which has become more and more strength-
ened by the course of time. The reason for this lies not only in the
purposeful end of this office, but equally in this, that each rector placed
in the balance his greatest possible sacrifice toward the fulfillment of
his task of representing, for the time, this highest academical honor.
So each rector has become an example for his successor for the most
conscientious fulfillment of duty. So accrued to the office an authority
which will make it possible to exercise a discreet power in fulfilling
the assumed responsibilities, as well as in upholding the honors and
rights of the office when sustained by the wisdom of the academic
senate, by the willing cooperation of all colleagues, and by the trustful
demeanor of the academic youth, who have always found in the rector
the promoter and chosen solicitor of their true interests.

In the alternation of faculties, and in view of the alternation between
members of the mathematical-natural-science and of the philosophical-
historical groups of professorships (a principle observed by common
consent in the philosophical faculty), the rectorship after a period of
five years fell to a representative of the first-named scientific group.
1 am grateful from a special combination of circumstances for the
honor of bearing the rectorate in a year in which Austria celebrates
the fiftieth-year jubilee of His Majesty the Emperor. You have just
heard from the lips of my honored predecessor what preparations have

the University of Vienna. Translated from the original German, published at
Vienna, 1898. ;

been made by the academical senate during the preceding collegiate
year for a celebration worthy of this rare occasion.

But the jubilation of the anniversary has suddenly turned to deep
sadness. We still stand under the dazing influence of the horrible
deed by which our noble Empress was torn from us, and we sorrow
deeply with our sorely tried august Monarch, to whom we all owe so
much, and not least our university.

During the more than five hundred years of its existence, the
University of Vienna has passed through no more brilliant epoch than
the half century just closing. We are surrounded by speaking wit-
nesses—the building in which we gather for work and for celebration,
the grandest palace that was ever built for a university, and a corps of
instruction which is scarcely rivaled in the whole world.

Most of the professorships and our university institute were founded
during the reign of our present Emperor, including the professorship
which has been intrusted to me—exactly a quarter of a century. This
was the first regular professorship of plant anatomy and physiology,
not only in Austria, but above all, in any university.

In following the time honored requirement of delivering a lecture in
the field of one’s specialty upon the occasion of entering into the new
office, two themes especially present themselves—the development of
plant physiology and its present status. Since both subjects have been
recently and thoroughly discussed, I have decided to take for the sub-
ject of my present address one allied to and scarcely less interesting
than those, namely, ‘‘The relation of plant physiology to the other
sciences.”

In the narrow limits of the time allotted to me I can only attempt
to sketch in a few strokes the essential features in the reciprocal action
between plant physiology on the one side, and on the other side other
natural sciences and the social and mental sciences, and to make clear
that plant physiology represents not merely a branch for a few special-
ists, but that it is aided in its advance by the other sciences; that in
turn it contributes to advancement in various fields of science and
practical life, and, finally, that it reaches out as a many-branched whole
into the Universitas literarum.

In my present address I shall use the term “plant physiology ” in its
‘broadest sense, as the whole system of teaching relative to the structure,
development, and life of plants.

Like all other sciences, plant physiology has developed in response
to the demands of life. As physics and chemistry had their basis in
the industries, so plant physiology grew by each experience gath-
ered from agriculture, horticulture, and sylviculture. [ven if the origin
of plant physiology be not historically demonstrable as a result of the
demands of practical life, still a portion of our terminology would bear
witness to the correctness of the assumption. Expressions like grow,
blossom, and graft, designations such as leaf, stem, and root, were not
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 429

introduced by botanists, but originated in practical life and passed
over from the popular vocabulary into our science.

The first demonstrable beginnings of plant physiology we find among
the Greek philosophers, chiefly Aristotle and Theophrastus. But in
these beginnings there was no developmental capacity. In our indue-
_ tive developmental period it was necessary to lay a new foundation for
the doctrine of plant life. The Englishman, Stephen Hales, in the
beginning of the eighteenth century, was undoubtedly the founder
of plant physiology in general, and especially the founder of phys-
ical plant physiology, while the commencement of chemical plant
physiology is to be referred to the Hollander, Ingenhouss. Ingenhouss
is closely identified with us in this regard, that for years he resided in
Vienna as physician of the Empress Maria Theresa and of Emperor
Joseph Il. Some of his first contributions to plant physiology were
worked out in Vienna—a fact little known. Later, until the middle of
this century, the science was advanced by investigators of French
nationality, foremost the Swiss investigator, De Saussure. At the
present time, all civilized nations, the Japanese not excluded, take
part in the advancement in this field. But if in our time names like
De Saussure and Boussingault stand as towering monuments and the
teachings of Darwin cease not to influence our physiological concep-
tions, there have been for many decades German plant physiologists
who stood not simply as compeers of their French and [English col-
leagues, but without exaggeration one may venture to say that German
investigators have assumed the leading role in the solution of the
most important questions.

The present developmental period in natural sciences, so rich in
unprecedented results, is characterized by the inductive method of
research and by the principle of the division of labor. It required
thousands of years to show mankind that the experience of all knowl-
edge takes root, and that the human mind, with its limitations, despite
the genius of occasional great men, can only by the combined work of
many, each deep in his narrow specialty, arrive at the solution of the
great problems of science. AS a consequence, we see in all fields of
research the modern socialism of scientific progress vanquishing the
intellectual giants of the olden time.

The objections to the principle of the division of labor in behalf of
the mental stage of the individual are well known. These are grad-
ually disappearing, and I will leave them without discussion. But for
the development of science all of the weaknesses and failures resulting
from this principle will be eradicated, as I shall later demonstrate by
certain examples at hand.

In the realm of botany the division of labor brought about first a
separation of descriptive botany from the studies directed toward gen-
eral morphology and physiology, which latter, reenforced in a measure,
placed themselves in rather sharp opposition to the descriptive side.
430 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

In his epoch-making Elements of Systematic Botany, Schleiden, near
the middle of the century, challenged the systematists in these words:
“ The time has passed wherein a man who could give the names of 6,000
plants would because of that be called a botanist, but another who knew
10,000 plants would be designated a greater botanist, and the formerly
so-called systematic botany has been thrust back into its proper place
of simply a hand servant of the true and exact sciences.” But the sys-
tematists returned the thrust. One of her foremost representatives
declared to the men of the “true science:” ‘If one were to collect all
the positive results thus far offered by plant physiologists it would
scarcely suffice to fill a nutshell.” Wrong judgments Jay here on both
sides, such as are always called forth by insufficient knowledge and
limited insight into the relation of things. The principle of the division
of labor led here, as usual, first to a separation of two so closely related
territories, and it was only as one of the later results of the applica-
tion of this principle that they were again brought into their natural
relations.

The science, however, incurred no lasting injury from the fact that
- descriptive botany and physiology first pursued opposite ways. In

each field good constructive material was accumulated. An earlier
commencement of common constructive work would only hoe led to
complications.

A really gratifying prospect is presented when one considers how
gradually systematic botany was advanced by this branch of physiology
in its widest sense. Linnzeus and his school could still content them-
selves with a very elementary form of plant description, form and
_ position of leaves, number and arrangement of flower parts—in short,
any character which a plant in flower presented to the naked eye suf-
ficed for the end of plant description as then pursued. Now, however,
a hundred thousand species of plants are kuown. Of orchids alone
there are as many species as all the species of plants described by Lin-
neus put together, and it is easy to see how the few superficial charac-
ters at first used for distinction of species became wholly inadequate.
Besides, descriptive botany could not content itself with simply distin-
guishing plant species and supplying them names,

Furthermore, it became necessary to consider the systematic arrange-
ment of the ever-increasing species. There had also to come into play
that great principle of natural science investigation which one of our
most distinguished colleagues has called the ‘‘economy of science.”
When I speak of orchids 1 express the sum of all those characters
which are common to these 8,000 species. This expression of the sum
of common characters must possess this quality, that by it I can dis-
tinguish this plant group from all others and, besides, express their
relationship to other groups. The sum total of isolated characteristics
must be brought into the simplest, briefest expression possible. Lin-
nus sought to attain this “economy” by his artificial system. ‘This
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SGIENCES. 431

was a good key for the determination of species while the number was
still small, but it was far from being a natural system of plants. In
order to attain to such a system, one had to dig deep into the devel-
opment and the inner structure of plants. This permeating of sys-
tematic botany with general botanical knowledge raised this study to
a height where it might with propriety be called the earlier systematic
botany.

The separation of plant species proceeded, therefore, no longer, as it
did earlier, upon the basis of external characters, but came to be more
and more promoted through the facts furnished by anatomy and embry-
ology. That pure physiological characters, i. e., characters that find
_ expression in the life processes of the plant, should be brought forward
to distinguish species is one of the latest discoveries. A physiological
character of plants would formerly have been held as unreal. Distin-
guishing characters were wanted which were always to be found in
dead material, such as lies in our herbaria. So long as that sort of
character sufficed there was nothing to be said against the proceeding.
Now, however, we meet plant forms whose scientific nature is to be
recognized only in their life activities. A Swedish botanist has made
the observation that rust fungi exist which on morphological characters
are impossible of separation, but are characterized only in this, that
they will live on one or a few species of grasses, but will not develop
when transferred to other grasses which are hosts for fungi of exact
morphological equivalence. The well-known black rust of grain (Pue-
cimia graminis) occurs upon wheat, rye, oats, barley, aud several uncul-
tivated grasses. It was formerly supposed that the grain rust could
- choose at will between these species of grasses. This is, however, not
the case. It is known, for example, that the rust of rye can develop
on barley, but not on wheat and oats, and it is evident that several
physiological forms of grain rust may be distinguished upon this ground.

So in the progress of research has come about a union between two
branches of botany which appeared widely separated, so widely that
it was formerly supposed that the chasm between them would never be
bridged over, i. e., between systematic botany and physiology in its
broadest sense—indeed physiology in the narrowest sense of the doc-
trine of function. It is plain that all other fields of botany stand in
reciprocal relation with physiology, but it required a long time for this
state of things to come about.

Nothing would seem more natural than that in scientific investigation
a plant form and the function of its organs would be equally con-
sidered—to consider it as a machine, whose parts are arranged for a
purpose and in their combined action accomplish an intended result.

One need not wonder, therefore, that investigations undertaken at an
earlier time, with the purpose of making clear the agreement between
form and function of the plant organ, wholly miscarried and led to
vague speculations and barren telleology. It was in the midst of our

“
432 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

inductive research period when these natural philosophical specula-
tions sought to establish themselves. Once again it was the return
to the inductive method and to the principle of the division of labor
which cleared the way to real progress. There came about a sharp
sundering of morphology from the doctrine of function—so sharp that
it was regarded as dangerous and punishable for one of these subjects
to deal with things pertaining to the other. Under the chastisement
of Schleiden no one attempted to demonstrate the functional signifi-
cance of a morphological structure. Narrow minded as this method of
procedure appeared, it was to the purpose. Embryology of plant organs
arose out of these conditions, and physiology was gathering richly of
usable constructive material for the future.

Only a small part of morphology, which we botanists call anatomy,
but which is identical with the histology of the zoologists, developed
along with physiology. The greater part of morphology, which cor-
responds to what zoologists call anatomy, pursued its way independently
of physiology.

I venture to raise the question here as to why zoology and botany
have not chosen the same expression for analogous branches of their
science; why under the term “anatomy” botanists and zoologists des-
ignate different things. The cause of this lies again in the principle
of division of labor, which at first always leads to a sharp separation,
and only after advances in scientific work does it bring about union.
The development of botany proceeded independently of zoology, and
vice versa.

Terminology, taken at the beginning, is not of such serious impor-
tance, but subsequently it would be in accord with the “economy of .
science” if in related subjects sirailar expressions were employed to
express similar concepts. That will come to be the case; and even
now in botany the expression ‘“‘histology” begins to be used in the same
sense as in zoology.

The collaboration of working material in the form of demonstrated
facts on the side of morphology, as well as in the realm of the doctrine
of function, has aided in bringing the two nearer together, and the solu-
tion of the questions as to the functional significance of morphological
structures is in full tide. The most successful has been the union of
morphological and physiological knowledge as regards plant tissues,
the study of which, as previously mentioned, was from the first often
entangled with the doctrine of function. In this way has arisen in
recent times the much cultivated branch of botany to which has been
given the name of physiological plant anatomy.

No field of research stands so near plant physiology as does
animal physiology. Where run, above all, the boundaries of these
two territories, when, in the lower stages of plant and animal organ-
isms, it is no longer possible to distinguish with certainty between
plant and animal, and when investigations are ever revealing new
RELATION OF PLANT PILYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 433

identities between plant and animal life? To-day we know that plants
respire in the same sense and for the same purpose as animals; indeed,
the forms of respiration are the same in both kingdoms. Besides ordi-
nary respiration in which free oxygen is taken up, there is, in plants
as in animals, a so-called intramolecular respiration, in which fixed
oxygen in highly oxidized compounds serves to carry on respiration.
The newer investigation has acquainted us in no equivocal way with
the power of motion—yes, even with the sensibility of plants. Slow
movements which are to be detected by change of position during
growth are common in plant life, but even very lively movements such
as are exhibited by swarming of certain reproductive cells (swarmspores
and spermatozoids) occur frequently in the lower groups of plants.
And shall one not speak of sensitiveness in plants when it is shown
that external influences such as light, gravity, ete., act as an irritant
which the plant receives, conducts to parts more or less distant and
responds to by some definite movement or in general by some definite
reaction ?

The principle of the division of labor has worked here as elsewhere
n the natural sciences, first separating and then bringing together.
Plant physiology has gone its own way, as has also animal physiology,
the one not concerning itself about the other; and only enlightened
minds have first discerned the inner identities of both, and felt them-
selves compelled in the solution of fundamental problems to reach out
for data into the apparently foreign territory of the other. Thus, one
of the greatest animal physiologists of the new era, Ernst von Brucke,
who once occupied this same place of honor, to which investigator we
are indebted for three great fundamental contributions in the field of
plant physiology.

When investigation in each of the two fields had yielded a rich fund
of usable data and had placed them in an orderly arrangement, the
union of the two—plant physiology and animal physiology—began.
When one takes up a recent, work on animal physiology he discovers
with satisfaction that already much consideration is given to the facts
and conclusions of plant physiology. Recently certain works upon
general physiology attest the natural association into which animal and
plant physiology have entered.

The relations of physics and chemistry to plant physiology lie so
closely before us and are so well known that I need not here go into
nearer details concerning them. But that both these great fields of
investigation stand in reciprocal exchange with their younger sister,
plant physiology, I will illustrate by a characteristic example. One of
the foremost living plant physiologists investigated the working of
osmotic force in the life of a plant. He soon had to learn that, how-
ever much the physiologists had contributed to the knowledge of this
question, both in elementary and advanced works, it was not sufficient
for his purpose, and thereupon it was thought unecessary by him to

SM 98 28

434 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

deal with a whole series of questions in osmotics from the standpoint
of pure physics. As a result, an insight was attained by which the
significance and explanation of numerous processes in plant life could
be arrived at. Moreover, the experiments of this plant physiologist
formed the foundation upon which was built the now famous Van’t
Hoff’s theory of osmotic pressure, which, according to this theory,
comes about in a way analogous to that of gas pressure. This is not
the first time that plant physiologists have taken up the question with
helpful results in the theory of osmosis. The genial and many sided
Dutrochet, the discoverer of ‘‘exosmosis and endosmosis,” was in the
front rank of plant physiologists.

As with chemistry and physics, plant physiology stands also in this
relation of reciprocal exchange with meteorology and climatology. How
greatly plant life is affected by meteorological conditions and how the
distribution of vegetation is dependent upon climate is evident every-
where, and rich is the knowledge which plant physiologists have gained
by the application of the teachings of these two sciences. But in cer-
tain investigations relating to the life processes of plants these teach-
ings did not suffice, and so,on the part of plant physiologists, many
climatological and meteorological questions had to be taken in hand.
For example, one physiologist, in order to learn the mechanical effect
of rain, i. e., to find out the exact force of large rain drops on leaves,
determined the weight of the heaviest rain drops, the velocity of fall,
and the working force of falling rain. Likewise, contributions to a
more exact knowledge of the importance and significance of light to
plant life were made by plant physiologists.

The connection between science and life has never been so conspicu-
ous as now at the turning of this century, and will doubtless become
yet more striking in the next century. Proud overbearance on the one
hand and a capacity for misunderstanding on the other have often and
for along time maintained a sharp antagonism between science and
practical life, which rested with both sides on insufficiency of knowledge _
and narrowness of view. Really great investigators always recognize
that, as Helmholtz opportunely expressed it, knowledge alone is not
the end of mankind upon the earth, but that knowledge should be
applied in the affairs of practical life. Only in this sense is knowledge
power, as Helmholtz thoughtfully added on the same occasion.

The great botanical reformer, Schleiden, declared in the middle of
the century to his fellow-botanists, who absolutely disregarded the
application of botany in practical affairs: “All the industries which
make use of vegetable stuffs in manufacturing, etc., in doubtful cases
ask in vain of botany for information, although it is in a position to
direct and advise the industries, but it has no practical knowledge to
give; knows least, often, the very plants which furnish the most
important stuffs, and borrows even from artisans themselves every-
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 435

thing outside of the circle of that systematic botany which deals only
in nomenclature.”

This rebuke did not pass without effect. A student of Schleiden’s,
the honored anatomist, Hermann Schacht, taught how to identify the
commoner fibers used in spinning by microscopical characters. Soon
from Austria strong impulse and effective work appeared along these
lines, where, by the‘use of methods of investigation practiced by plant
‘anatomists, the foundation was laid for technical microscopy and the
technical study of raw material in the plant kingdom, which two
studies were first placed in the curriculum of the technical high schools
of Austria.

Through the use of plant physiology in questions of practical life
this science came to be an aid in the administration of justice. The
courts request from plant physiologists as from chemists professional
opinions, and more than once has the botanical institute of our univer-
sity been in a position to respond to the requests of the court.

Botany, as is well known, came early to be a strong aid in the medi-
cal science, which encouraged not plant physiology but systematic
botany—in fact, called it into existence. What the diggers of roots and
herb dealers in the Grecian age began, Hippocrates and other Grecian
physicians continued, namely, the search for plants with healing quali-
ties, the naming and distinguishing of which appeared in the most
thoroughly collaborated materia medica of Dioscorides. Until the
period of the reawakening of the arts and sciences, this work formed
the chief source of botanical knowledge. The repayment of this great
debt of botany to medical science was made, however, not so much by
the immediate debtor—systematic botany—but chiefly through plant
physiology. Let the science of medicine always remember that the
subject of bacteriology, now become so important, owes its origin to
botanists. It was not merely that bacteria were first differentiated by
botanists, it was likewise a botanist, the late Ferdinand Cohn, director
of the Institute for Plant Physiology in Breslau, who first recognized
bacteria as the cause of diseases. It was he, also, who originated the
well-known generic names of bacilli, micrococci, and bacteria. What
importance bacteriology has come to assume in the diagnosis and
etiology of disease, for hygiene, and other branches of medicine is gen-
erally known.

Likewise those branches of plant culture which gave the first
impulse toward the establishment of plant physiology have in turn
been richly repaid for all the suggestions and usable facts which they
furnished. Agriculture, forestry, and horticulture are to-day per-
meated by the spirit of plant physiology, and what these practical
studies have gained in scientific insight is for the most part due to
plant physiology. It must be said also that agricultural chemistry has
contributed materially to the principles of plant culture, but the one-
436 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

sidedness of the perceptions of chemical analysis, which drew conclu-
sions as to the soil nourishment for vegetation only by comparing
soil analysis with plant analysis, could only yield a one-sided solution
of the question at issue, particularly that of plant nutrition. Not
until synthetical research as to the nutrition of plants made upon liy-
ing specimens could it be determined on the side of the plant what
elements taken up from the soil serve for food, what of the material
taken up is used for other purposes, and what is merely neutral. Thus
agricultural chemistry, under the influence of plant physiology, has
become transformed into agricultural physiology, which to-day is to be
counted one of the most important studies that contribute to practical
life.

The fruitful cooperation of scientific learning and of agriculture and
industry may be illustrated by the following instructive example:
Long before Liebig’s time the farmer knew that the cultivation of
leguminous crops would make the soil richer in nitrogen, in that nitro-
gen compounds accumulate that which can be assimilated by plants.
It was also known that leguminous plants produce peculiar little
tubercles on their roots, which were explained in most varied and cir-
cumstantial ways. Bacteriological investigation has shown that these
tubercles constitute the habitat of certain bacteria, which obtain
entrance into the roots of leguminous plants, and live there in the
mutually helpful relation of symbiosis. These bacteria, which live in
peas, lentils, lupines, etc., possess the remarkable capacity of bringing
the nitrogen of the air contained in soil into compounds which can be
assimilated by plants. Thus the old riddle was solved. If beans be
planted in sterilized soil they grow less vigorously than in ordinary
soil, which harbors the bacteria in question. Abundance of these
peculiar bacteria in the soil increases the productiveness of leguminous
crops. This knowledge has resulted in a newindustry. In the famous
dyeworks of Meister & Lucius, in Hochst, is generated a product called
‘“nitragin” for the cultivation of lupines, peas, and other legumes.
This “nitragin” is simply artificially increased bacteria of different
species kept in the resting stage, which, added to the soil in which
lupines, etc., are planted, increases the available nitrogen supply.

Similarly numerous other sciences were richly repaid in practical
help by plant physiology for what they had first furnished for “ work-
ing capital” in the form of knowledge and stimulus. Therein, how-
ever, the account between theory and practice is not settled. That
great account will, indeed, never be canceled. With the advancement
of agriculture, of commerce and industry, arise continually scientific
problems, and new scientific learning and discoveries ceaselessly pro-
mote practice. Ever more and more is disappearing the old opposition
between science and practice, and more and more the opinion matures
that human progress rests upon the harmonious cooperation of both.

The invasion into the realm of practical life by plant physiology has
é
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 437

-ealled forth many relationships between it and the social sciences.
What it has done in explaining the exhaustion, what it has contributed
to the understanding of the significance of the forest covering for cli-
mate and for the cultivation of field and garden vegetation has benefited
the social sciences. But there are besides many other relations exist-
ing between these two seemingly widely separated sciences. In order
further to illustrate this I will give another example, intentionally an
extreme but instructive case. For almost a century men busied them-
selves with the question as to how long the earth’s stores of coal would
last in view of the enormous increase in the use of fuel. The estimates
awakened grave apprehensions, though one might reassure himself by
this fact that the premises upon which such dire conclusions were based
lacked very much of being accurate. Next, comes from across the ocean
amore disturbing and vexatious intelligence. Through the American
and English papers goes the news—reflected also in the German press—
that the danger of extinction of mankind would come sooner than had
hitherto been feared. Under an appeal to the authority of a great
physicist it was claimed that, with the increasing consumption of min-
eral fuel by the various industries, all supplies of mineral coal would
be exhausted within five hundred years. But the last remnants of
coal—so it was further claimed—it would no longer be possible to bring
out of the earth, because in the meantime the oxygen of the atmos-
phere, as a result of the enormous increase in combustion, would have

decreased to such a limit that the air would no longer be adapted for
human respiration.

The computations in question seemed to be entirely accurate, but
again the assumptions were uncertain, upon which these terrible results
were predicted, as indeed the whole question whose solution proceeded
upon complications of a similar kind, were dealt with only from the
chemical standpoint, quite disregarding the character of living organ-
isms.

Every condition of the earth which corresponds with the Kant-
Laplace theory forms the starting point for computations like those
above cited. All of the earth’s carbon is burned up; all of the oxygen
allotted to our planet is exhausted. After cooling of the earth, the
green vegetation appears and generates free oxygen under the inftlu-
ence of sunlight. This hypothesis derives the whole of the atmos-
pheric oxygen from the green vegetation. Since, at that time, there
was no other natural source of oxygen upon the earth besides the green
plants, it followed that with increasing combustion the oxygen supply
would diminish. In order to check this decrease it was advised that
extensive areas of fruit trees should be planted. So it was hoped that
in this way a sufficient quantity of oxygen and human sustenauce
would be assured to help out the inhabitants of the earth. What small
agencies opposed to the harmonious working of the powers of nature!

Upon how weak a foundation the foregoing hypothesis stands may
438 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

be seen from the fact that a totally opposite conclusion may be drawn
from applying the premises in field experiment, with the use of certain
well-established facts of plant physiology. It has been shown, for
example, by the French plant physiologist, Boussingault, that the vol-
ume of carbon dioxide taken up by green plants is exactly equal to the
volume of oxygen given off in the presence of sunlight. So if, as sup-
posed, all the oxygen of our atmosphere were liberated from carbon
dioxide by green plants then would the quantity of carbon dioxide of
the earth’s atmosphere have been seven hundred times more before the
appearance of green plants than at present, while the proportion of
oxygen, according to this hypothesis, would have increased from 0 to
21 per cent in volume, while the enormous proportion of carbon-dioxide
would have fallen to its present mass, namely 0.03 per cent in volume.
If one were to go so one-sidedly into such conclusions as happened in
the hypothesis above cited it would be possible, under the assumption
of such an enormous decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide, to under-
take beforehand to predict the disappearance of vegetation, indeed to
foresee that both organic kingdoms—the plant and the animal world—
were so ordained as to maintain continually a reciprocal influence upon
each other, and the capacity of adaptation of plants and animals, bor-
dering on the wonderful, would make possible their continuance under
external conditions widely different from the present.

But the discovery of Boussingault teaches another thing. Since the
quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is practically constant,
namely, an average over the earth of about 0.03 per cent in volume of
the atmosphere, and since the succession of elements upon the earth
will not be interrupted (i. e., carbon dioxide, through combustion,
respiration and putrefaction, is constantly being produced, and also
through green plants—whether on this side of the world or at the
antipodes—is constantly being reduced to oxygen by the agency of
light), this gas can scarcely increase to a greater proportion than 0.03
per cent in volume because so constantly involved in transformation,
and even a much higher rate of combustion than is now prevalent
would scarcely alter the great surplus of oxygen. An important
feature our question has thus far been only. briefly referred to—the
extraordinary capacity of organisms of adapting themselves to their
environment. If the proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
should notably increase because of the consumption of coal, the
plant world would still adapt itself to these changed conditions. This
adaptation must, however, be granted to those whose hypothesis leads
to such dire consequences as previously depicted; for they must con-
cede that the earlier vegetation of the earth endured a far greater pro-
portion of carbon dioxide than at present, and indeed made use of it.
But when the capacity of plants to adapt themselves to the proportion
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is conceded, then the increased
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 439

consumption of coal need lead to no disquietude, at least in so far as
there will be no diminution of oxygen in the atmosphere.

I have dealt thus at length with this illustration, because i wished
through it to indicate to what false conclusions one-sided assumptions
and problematic suppositions can lead. The problem in question here
is much more complicated than is often supposed, even by prominent
scientists, «nd to the objections which I have already urged against
this doctrine of disaster very many more may be added, though it
must be said that the matter was never taken very seriously in

scientific circles.

In the impulsiveness of its youth, natural science has framed still
many other one-sided suppositions when dabbling in strange territory.
Thus Liebig ascribed the dcwnfall of the world-embracing Roman Empire
to the exhaustion of the soil, to the lack of phosphoric acid and _ potas-
sium in the cultivated land, brought about by “ robber farming,” i. e., by
too-continuous overcultivation of the soil. With propriety Du Bois-
Reymond rejected this theory; but, on theother hand, the historian could
not agree with this critic when he said: ‘Roman culture disappeared
because it was built upon the quicksand of «esthetics and speculation.”
Du Bois-Reymond likewise attempted to solve a complicated phenome-
non by too simple a formula.

Inadvertently we have just touched upon the relations of the natural
sciences to the mental sciences, especially of history. For a long time
these relations were very uncongenial, and insufficiency of knowledge
and narrow conceptions upon both sides have often enough led to severe
strife. The first attempts of naturalists to engage in the solution of
historical problems from their point of view, and of historians—I reeall
here above all Buckle—to make use of natural history teachings in his-
torical research, did not turn out well, and on that account could
seareely contribute toward an intellectual intercourse between the two
“camps,” as they were referred to frequently in those times of strife.
It happened more frequently that these efforts suffered a severe rejec-
tion. So the saying was: ‘‘ With the knife of the physiologist one may
not cultivate the hard soil of history, but to that end is needed the
strong plow of the historian.” Or, an eminent historian relates that it
had been made clear to him that history could not permit itself to be
molested by Darwin and his associates.

An eminent historical investigator who once occupied this place of
honor published very recently a work on genealogy. ‘This, the author
himself said, built the bridge between the historical and the natural
sciences. In this work the effort is made to present systematically
genealogy as learning in all its various relations to historical, social,
political, judicial, and natural science questions.

The animal physiologists as well as those of botany have busied
themselves not a little with the question of the determination of sex,
440 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

but they have considered this question from the ontogenetic standpoint,
if I may so express it; they have simply asked, ‘‘What conditions of
the parents and what influences upon them lead directly to male or to
female progeny? In the above-mentioned work on genealogy the ques-
tion is philogenetically treated, if I may thus again express it. The
author raises the question, namely, whether inheritance is not of sig-
nificance in the determination of sex; whether, to express it plainly,
certain fathers or mothers, because of prominent deep-rooted peculiari-
ties, are not destined to produce either wholly or chiefly either male
or female offspring.

It is no idle fancy which our historian has brought forward for the
statement and proof of this question; on the contrary, with astonisk-
ment one sees by an examination into this work on genealogy how the
author has gone into the finest natural science problems of inheritance,
into the subtilest phenomena accompanying creation and the beginning
of sex, in order by thus bringing forward in support all available
knowledge to give the greater vaiue to his work.

The genealogical method here brought into use by the author is
worthy the high consideration of biologists. He studied the genealog-
ical history of numerous families of the nobility and found as a rule
that in one, male, in another, female, descendants so predominate that
the tendency toward inheritance of sex within a family can scarcely be
called in question.

For further biological studies the following discovery resulting from
genealogical investigations ought to be of significance: That in the
human family the male element is of more weight in the formation of
sex than the female.

Similarly other branches of knowledge that stand as aids to history
e. g., diplomacy and paleography, the same is true also of archeology,
have come to hold certain relations to the natural sciences. The study
of the physical characteristics of old documents, of the substance written
upon and the material used in writing, was undertaken earlier by the
historians themselves. Now, microscopists of various special fields,
foremost among them plant physiologists, have taken up this task; they
cleared away old errors like the charta bombycina (paper made of cotton
which is supposed to have preceded that made of rags), the charta cor-
ticina which proved to be papyrus, and many others, and traced the
cloth or rag paper, so important to civilization, back to the eighth cen-
tury of our era; whereas the historians could trace it only to the four-
teenth century, and show that this paper was first invented neither by
the Germans nor by the Italians, but was due to the oft illustrated
inventive genius of the Arabs. Thus the history of paper was placed
by the skillful work of plant physiology upon a new basis whose cer-
tainty, tested by the historical researches of the foremost historical and
linguistic students, has met with fullest acknowledgment.

Plant physiology also rendered active assistance in the construction
RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 441

of a not unimportant bit of the history of civilization. In this diree-
tion, meanwhile, there had appeared early botanical contributions. For
instance, I would recall that a professor of botany in our university,
my ever-remembered teacher, Franz Unger, renowned as a plant physi-
ologist, submitted important contributions toward a knowledge of the
origin of the various cultivated grains and other cultivated plants of
importance to mankind during his botanical incursions into the field of
the history of civilization.

In this very territory of the history of civilization the most widely
differing branches of mental and natural science become associated.
For example, by such associated investigation was demonstrated the
distribution of the most important cultivated plants from Asia to
Greece and Italy, and from here over the rest of Europe.

The origin of wheat is lost in tradition; the Greeks considered it as
a gift from Ceres, the Egyptians as one from Isis. Neither from the
historical nor from the linguistic point of view is there any indication
as to the origin of wheat. But the physiological character of this
cereal shows that its original home must have been in the Steppes.

Again, the native habitat of barley is shrouded in darkness. But
on the other hand, on linguistic grounds, the native habitat of rye—
which, like wheat and barley, is one of the Steppe grasses—is to be
sought between the Alps and the Black Sea.

The distribution of many of the more valuable species of fruits from
western Asia through Italy to us has been confirmed on historical, lin-
guistic, and natural science grounds. The home of the peach (persica)
lies in Asia, perhaps, as the name signifies, in Persia.'! In the days of
the Roman republic the peach was unknown, and is first mentioned in
writings of the first century of the empire. The culture of the peach
tree in Italy was begun and prosecuted by slaves and freedmen from
western Asia, who, moreover, established the famous fruit-culture of the
Romans.

Likewise the cultivation of vegetables spread from Italy over Europe,
as the names of many vegetables show; for example, the name ‘“ kohl”
for our commonest vegetable (cabbage) is taken from the Latin word
caulis.”

Plant physiology, like every science, whether it be only through bring-
ing forward explanatory figures or through systematic contribution, has
stepped into association with philosophy. The attempt to gain a con-
ception of the molecular or micellar structure of the make-up of cells, or
through direct observation to disclose the ultimate life unit of the plant
through known facts, belongs, as does the origin of invisible atoms and
molecules, in the region of metaphysics; that is, they are within the
province of philosophy.

1According to Buhse the peach tree grows wild in the Persian province of Ghilan.
2 Certain varieties of ‘‘kohl” (cabbage) (e. g., the varviol) are called in lower Aus-
trian dialect ‘ kauli,” which corresponds more nearly to the Latin stem.
442 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

Perhaps I shall not be accused of going too far if, finally, | consider
a moment the somewhat phantasmically spun threads which bind plant
physiology with psychology. I have in mind that work of Fechner,
the founder of psychophysics, published in the stormy year of 1848,
a book written with the tenderest human sympathy. It had been for-
merly thought that plants were incapable of locomotion, and on that
basis were distinguished from animals. This view was refuted by the
same facts which destroyed the long-held opinion as to the insensi-
bility of plants. Now, the last year has brought valuable explanations
of the power of sensation in plants, and many fancies of Fechner’s as
to the sensibility of plants have been transformed into scientifically
grounded views. The reception and conduction of stimuli and response
to them, as in the nervous system of animals, have been demonstrated,
although these organisms have no nerves, but, as Fechner said, fune-
tion often as if they had nerves. If, now, plants possess a soul in the
sense employed by modern psychology, then intimacy with the life of
plants would offer the psychologists much support in testing the psy-
chical functions from the standpoint of the unity of all organized
beings, and the more exact separation of these psychic functions from _
other life functions.

I hasten to the close, and must leave unconsidered many important
relations of plant physiology to the other sciences. I have not men-
tioned the studies upon the adaptation of flowers to insects, and vice
versa, resulting in fruit production in the former—studies which eall
into existence a new borderland between zoology and plant physiology.
I omitted also to mention the physiological elements in plant geography,
also the great assistance which mathematics has rendered our science,
and must likewise pass over much besides.

I have been able to trace only in a few characteristic examples the
results which issue from a consideration of the relation of plant phys-
iology to the other sciences. Essentially my whole treatment of the
subject has been merely an example, for whatever holds true in my
specialty holds true likewise in every other branch of knowledge,
namely, the very intimate union of each with other, often widely sep-
arated, branches of learning—a union which, with the progress of
research, assumes constantly greater power.

The relation of the individual branches of science to each other proves
to be so complicated, as is clear from the examples cited, that we may
well conceive how all attempts must be frustrated which, from Bacon
to d’Alembert and from the encyclopedists to the present time, had
for their object a classification of the sciences. One can not parcel off
the sciences like a building plot. Weourselves have drawn the division
lines between the individual sciences, compelled by the limitations of
our human mind, which necessitates us to make a division of labor. But
with our advances these boundaries disappear; the individual studies,
often inimically opposed, unite into a single whole. Thus science

RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES. 443

seems to be one great totality whose parts are in reciprocal relation and
mutual interaction, like the organs ofa living organism. I would like to
consider the unity of science under the figure of a tree of life which
grows upward from the earth from which one part takes its power and
nutriment and in which it finds its support. The parts of this tree—
roots, stem, branches, and whatever they may all be called—appear to
us externally different, but within they belong together; they stand
among each other continually in helpful interaction. As the organs,
so are the tissues adjusted to each other, and not one of the millions of
cells in a tree is without purpose, and if each cell does not stand in
fast relation to all others, how also need not each single scientific ques-
tion be related to all others? This can as little destroy the unity of
Science as the unity of organic structure of a tree can be destroyed
by the fact that each cell does not stand in mutual relation with every
other cell.

Wonderingly we see this tree of science develop and broaden out;
but for this provision is made, namely, that this tree shall not grow
even into the heavens.

After thousands of years of seeking and groping, mankind has finally
discovered how he may reach high aims of knowledge in spite of the
limitations of his mind, by the often slow and heavily progressing indue-
tive method, and the principle of the division of labor, which first leads
to division, but after arich harvest binds all together. It becomes
even clearer that the synthetical mental work, tlowing out of the prin-
ciple of division of labor, must lead to even greater conceptions, and
that the number of men must be even greater who, raising themselves
above the level of specialists, will be investigators in the best sense of
the word.

Held in bounds by the exact nature of its work, science strides for-
ward, ever attaining more and more of what is seemingly unattainable
to the human mind, and likewise ever more clearly recognizing the
unattainable as unattainable. Indeed, more and more we come face to
face with the limits of our knowledge. To the Grecian thinkers it
seemed a play that allowed the living to spring out of the lifeless, plants
or animals from slime or damp earth. But the inductive method has
led us thus far to know that, so far as observation can go, the living
can arise only from the living. Even the smallest known living beings,
the bacteria, do not come into being parentless, as not long since the
last notes of retreat of the defense of spontaneous generation declared.
In the organism itself, all that is living proceeds only out of the living—
the cell from a cell, the nucleus from a nucleus—and the smallest plastid
lying on the very border of microscopic observation proceeds from its
like. The possibility enlarged upon by many naturalists, that in the
organism living constituents can arise spontaneously, is only a reaction
of the old doctrine of spontaneous generation; for, so far as investiga-
tion shows, there can rise within the organism organized substance
444 RELATION OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY TO OTHER SCIENCES.

only out of the organized. So that growth of organisms appears to us
only a multiplication of what is already at hand.

The progress of research has reduced to naught all the facts that
pointed toward spontaneous generation, and so we find ourselves duly
forced to turn away from spontaneous generation and to regard the
living substance as given, just as the physicist regards matter, and
takes no further thought as to the question of its origin. The most
exact research, even in the domain of matter, has led to impassable
boundaries, and the old riddles of the world and all its beings remain
unsolved in spite of all progress, and we know, perhaps more clearly
than the thinkers of earlier science epochs, that their solution lies beyond
the power of the human mind. They remain as unsolvable to the
greatest philosopher as well as to the simplest understanding. Other
faculties of the mind than those busied in the sober pursuit of science
may undertake to show a tangible relation between eternity and our
own insignificance.

The mind of the most learned, free from the shadow of its own great-
ness, bows with the spirit of a child before the unknowable, before that
source of all Being which the greatest German poet has thus designated :

< * *« * der sich selbst erschuf
Von Ewigkeit in schaffendem Beruf,

* = * der den Glauben schafft
Vertrauen, Liebe, Thitigkeit und Kraft.”
PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS—A FORM FROM THE
ANCESTRAL STOCK OF MANKIND.

By EuGENE DUBOIS.

The fossil remains upon which I have founded this new species con-
sist of a calvarium, or skullcap, two upper molars, and a femur. With
the exception of one tooth, the second upper molar on the left side, they
have already been described by me in a paper published in Batavia in
1894.2, It now seems desirable to give some special details.

It is well known that a not inconsiderable number of anatomists and
zoologists hold diametrically opposite views regarding the significance
of these remains. For instance, as to the skull, a few have believed
that it is human, although of much more ape-like appearance than
hitherto known, while others have considered it the skull of an ape far
more human in character than any previously discovered. It is remark-
able that only a few have believed in a third possibility, intermediate
between these two views, viz, that we have before us here a transition
form between apes and men that is neither man nor ape. Recently
this intermediate view has made quite significant progress, and a con-
siderable number have accepted it. As to the anthropists and pithe-
cists, as the upholders of the extreme views may be called, the former
find their fossil Java man more ape like than they at first did, while
the latter have placed their most anthropoid of apes still a few steps
higher on the ladder of ascent toward man. These views now tend to
coincide still more, because in the meantime it has been possible to test
them by an exhibition of the objects themselves, and I have been able
to give further particulars, especially as to the circumstances under
which the remains were found.

For the proper interpretation of these osseous remains the circum-
stances under which they were found is quite as important a factor as
the anatomical considerations. I will therefore first give some partic-
ulars regarding their situation when discovered.

Java, at Trinil, in the Ngawa district of the Madinun Residency, a great
number of fossil skeletal parts of other vertebrate animals belonging to
the same species as those found by me during five years of researches
at many other places in the same strata, which lie exposed over some
hundreds of square kilometers. To judge from the uplifting which
these strata have undergone, in the course of which they have all been
tilted (at Trinil about 5 degrees south), and also from other geological
evidence, they are older than the Pleistocene, apparently older than the
early Pliocene. They are of a fluviatile character, and lie, more than

350 meters thick, unconformably, upon marine strata, which K. Martin,
in Leyden, has determined as Pliocene.

According to the fauna, also, as far as I have been able to study it
up to this time, it is highly probable that the strata are early Pliocene.
This fauna is very similar to the fossil vertebrate fauna of western
India, but appears to be younger than the Siwalik fauna of the early
Miocene or later Pliocene and somewhat older than the fauna of Nar-
bada, which has been placed in the earliest Pleistocene.

At the place where the remains were discovered at Trinil the strata,
everywhere composed of volcanic tufa, lie exposed in the cliff-like decliv-
PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS. 447

ity of the bank of a river of considerable size, the Bengawan, or Solo,
They usually consist here of a sandstone of slight consistency which, in
its deeper layers, at about the level of the river during the dry season,
becomes coarser and coarser aS more and more Japilli or volcanic
stones form part of its composition. The bones are found throughout
the entire thickness of the sandstone strata, being very numerous in
the lower half, and most so in the stratum, about 1 meter thick, in
which the lapilli are found. In the conglomerate which lies under this
I found but few, and none at all in the subjacent argillaceous layer.

The four fragments of the skeleton of Pitheeanthropus were found in
different years, because, on account of the rise in the river during every
rainy season, the excavations were necessarily suspended and could not
be resumed until the next dry season. Besides, in the same working
season one fragment was found later than the other, because the stone
had to be removed cautiously in layers and by marked-off areas.

The four fragments were, however, found at exactly the same level in
the entirely untouched lapilli stratum (fig. 1). They were therefore
deposited at the same time; that is to say, they are of the same age.
The teeth were distant from the skull from 1 to, at most, 3 meters; the
femur was 15 meters away. The quite sharp relief of their surface does
not support the theory that they have been washed out from some older
layer and then embedded for a second time. They werefound at the place
of their original deposit. Besides they all show exactly the same state of
preservation and of petrefaction as do all other bones that have been
taken from this particular stratum at Trinil.' Their specific gravity
(sp. gr. of compact tissue=2.456) is much greater than that of unpetri-
fied bones (sp. gr. of compact tissue=1.930). The femur weighs 1 kilo-
gram, therefore considerably more than double the weight of a recent
human femur of the same size; the medullary cavity is partly filled
with a stony mass. The eroded upper surface which the skulleap and
not the femur shows occurred in the bed where it was found, appear-
ing on many bones excavated near the skullcap, and is caused by
infiltration of water through the cliff at that place.

Associated with these bones I also found very numerous remains of
a small axis like species of Cervus, frequently, also, the remains of
Stegodon. Farther away were found Bubalus, apparently identical with
the Siwalik species, Leptobos, Boselaphus, Rhinoceros, Felis, Sus,
Hyena, that all appear to be of new species. Of species found in
other situations of the same stratum [ will mention a gigantic Manis,
more than three times the length of the existing Javanese species; a
Hippopotamus, belonging to the same subspecies, Hexaprotodon, as the
forms from the Siwalik and Narbada strata of western India.

Upon the evidence of theseremains I determined that the four skeletal

varium. The latter appears to be somewhat different because it has been prepared

448 PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS.

fragments were of exactly the same age, and very probably early Pliocene.
Further, these remains, in connection with the anatomical investiga-
tion of the skeletal fragments, have firmly convinced me that these
fragments are all parts of one and the same skeleton. The total result
of the discussion of these fragments that has been carried on by many
eminent anatomists in no way contradicts this conclusion; on the con-
trary, it raises the presumption that itis highly improbable that they
do not belong together.

A few anatomists hold that the fragments are parts of a human skel-
eton; according to others there is no doubt but that they belonged to
individuals of the same race. Others, again, consider the femur to be
quite human, while they think that the skulleap and the teeth must
have belonged to the most anthropoid of all anthropoid apes. A few
anatomists, however, agree with me in the opinion that a femur entirely
human in character might nevertheless belong to the same individual
as this ape-like skull, because a similar function would entail a similar
form. Besides, this femur has certain peculiarities that I have not
been able to find in a single one of some hundreds of thigh bones, so
that it is not human in the usual sense of the word.

If we adopt the view that the skullcap is that of an ape, and, indeed,
as inust be acknowledged, that of the most man-like of all, but that
the femur is that of a man, then both of these fragments must have
been deposited at the same time in what was very probably an early
Tertiary bed. We would then have in this case two specially impor-
tant, but wholly unknown, closely related forms found together. Now,
on the one hand, human bones have never been recognized below the
Middle Pleistocene, much less as low as the Tertiary, and, on the other,
but few remains of apes have been found, and these are much smaller,
more significant, and by no means as human in character as the skull-
cap in question. There is therefore little probability that this view is
correct. The view that these fragments were derived from different
individuals of one and the same race has also very little to support it.
After explorations which have been extended for five years over hun-
dreds of square kilometers of exposed strata more than 350 meters
thick and containing everywhere a numerous and homogeneous fauna,
I have found, with but one possible exception, nothing which could be
referred to this or any similar race.

According to all paleontological experience, the parts must have
belonged to a single skeleton in case their anatomical configura-
tion does not contradict such unity of origin. Thisis, however, not the
case. The considerations advanced by many anatomists on this subject
lead, when taken together, really to no other conclusion than that the
fragments were derived from one individual. The more I myself have
studied these fragments the more firmly I have been convinced of this
unity of origin; and at the same time it has become ever clearer to me
that they are really parts of a form intermediate between men and apes,

which was the ancestral stock from which man was derived. They all
show, though in somewhat different degree, intermingled human and
ape-like characters.

L—THE SKULLCAP.
_In the form of the skullcap similitude to that of the ape is undoubt-

edly predominant. Never yet has there been seen so flat and low a
human skull, never yet, outside of the true apes, has so strong a projec-

‘tion of the orbital region been found. The skulls of Neanderthal and

Spy and all microcephalic skulls are more highly vaulted, especially in
the parietal region; the ratio between the central portion of the skull
and the orbital part lying in front of the temporal fossa is quite the
Same as in the apes, differing widely from that of the lowest human

- skulls, even that of Neanderthal and those of microcephali. Virchow

has referred especially to this. It can be seen only on the left side, the
right having suffered a notable loss of substance. The part of the wall
of the orbit that lies in front of the deepest portion of the temporal fossa
and belongs to the zygomatic process (external angular process) of the
frontal bone is, in its antero-posterior dimension, about twice as large as
that of the most ape-like human skulls. Further, it would be difficult
to find in a human skull so strongly developed a torus occipitalis trans-
versus as that of the Javanese skull, and the lower part of the squama
temporalis of that specimen retreats outwardly, as it does in the apes.

Those who have followed the history of the Neanderthal skull are
aware that there has never existed regarding it such divergence of
opinion as to its man- or ape-like qualities as has arisen concerning the
Pithecanthropus. The two opposed views in that case were: Ape-like
man or diseased man; the native of the Neanderthal has from the very
first always been considered as an undoubted, real man. The human
character of the Pithecanthropus is, however, very questionable. The
skuli of the gibbon almost doubled in size would not be very different
from it in external appearance.

Its considerably greater size constitutes a significant difference
between it and all other skulls of apes. In the length and breadth
measurements of the skull the chimpanzee is exactly a mean between
it and the largest gibbon. Its cranial capacity I estimated in my
above-mentioned description, according to a comparison of the external
lineal dimensions, as about 1,000 c.cm. Estimating nowupon a more
recent comparison of the internal linear dimensions with those of gib-

bons’ skulls makes it but little more than 900 ¢.cm.' <A capae ty of

900 c. cm. is, however, far above anything we know in the skull of apes.

The largest skulls of anthropoid apes have, on the average, no greater

capacity than about 500 c.cm., and it is very seldom that they have
been found to attain the capacity of 600 ¢. cm.

1 Besides the method of estimating the capacity which I detailed in my last
description, and which I again applied after removing the siliceous matter from the

SM 95 29

450 PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS.

Disregarding this, some believe that the skull may have belonged to
atrue ape. If we should imagine the’skull of Hylobates agilis to have
somewhat more than doubled its mass, we should have a skull of a
similar great ape. But if in actual fact a Hylobates had reached such
a size, it is quite certain that his cranial capacity would not have in-
creased in the same degree, for we continually find in the most diverse
families that large animals have relatively smailer brains than smaller
allied species. For example, the dwarf antelope (Nanotragus pyg-
meus) has in proportion to its bodily weight more than four times as
much brain as. the Beisa antelope.! The smaller lower apes very much
surpass in this respect the large anthropoid apes, and the gibbons
possess, in proportion to their bodily weight, at least twice as much
brain as the great anthropoids.’

_ Such an imaginary gigantic Hylobates would be about as tall asa
man and about as heavy as the great anthropoids. its cranial capacity
would therefore not exceed some 500 c.cm. But this is only a little
more than that of Pithecanthropus. A true ape with a capacity of 900
c.cm., must, on the contrary, be a giant besides which the largest
gorillas would be dwarfs. Even if the bodily size increased only in

cavity of the skullcap so that I could compare the dimensions of the cranial cavi-
ties, two other methods were also used by me, as follows:

A. (1) The external volume of askulleap above a plane passed symmetrically
through the glabella and the external occipital protuberance was determined.
(2) Its surface was found by weighing a tin-foil covering that had been spread over
it. (3) Its internal capacity was approximately determined by deducting from the
value found under (1) the product of the surface found under (2) with the medium
thickness of the skull plus the volume of the frontal sinuses. From the result thus
obtained (540 c.em.) the capacity of the entire Pithecanthropus skull was estab-
lished by (4) comparing with it skulls of Hylobates of as similar build as possible,
whose skullcap capacity and total cranial capacity has been determined by direct
measurement.

B. After the siliceous matter had been for the most part removed from the skulleap,
this was also directly measured by filling it up to the above-mentioned plane with
mustard seed and adding to this volume the estimated volume of the siliceous mat-
ter yet remaining. I found that the above-mentioned portion of the cavity of the
skulleap measured about 550 c.cm. The cast of the cavity of the Neanderthal skull
taken to the same plane measures 750 c. cm.

It is well known that Huxley estimated the entire capacity of the Neanderthal
skull at 1.236 ¢.cm. The ratio of the capacity of the skullcap to that of the entire
skull is, therefore, 3:5. In askull of the Hylobates agilis, which, though only half
the size, strikingly resembles that of Pithecanthropus, I find the same ratio.

According to all these methods, the total cranial capacity of the Pithecanthropus
skull is found to be 900 c.cm., or somewhat more. The difference between this and
my earlier estimates (compare also the Verhandl. der Berliner Gesellschaft fir
Anthropologie, 1895, p. 728) depends upon this, that in the first I did not allow suffi-
ciently for the thickness of the skull (it is about 6 mm.), and secondly I could not
directly compare the cavity of the skullcap.

the same ratio as the cranial capacity, the animal would have a body
almost twice as large as that of a large gorilla. But the bodily size
increases in a greater ratio than that of the brain and the cranial
capacity, so that it may be assumed that the size of an anthropoid
ape having a cranial capacity of 900 c. cm. would be at least three times
as large as that of a large gorilla; that is to say, about as large asa
pretty large horse. It is not easy to imagine an ape like that leading
the tree life of the nimble Hylobates.

The cerebral portion of the skull of such a gigantic ape would, in
relation to the rest of the body, be much smaller than that of the
gorilla. This relatively small cranial capsule would have all the provi-
sions for the attachment of a powerful masticatory apparatus for fur-
nishing nourishment to the gigantic body, such as is shown by the
skull of a gorilla, but in a much greater degree than in this living
gigantic ape. For a jaw of such mighty proportions, which would be
much larger in mass than the whole of the rest of the skull, there would
have to be a zygomatic arch much more extensive and more strongly
vaulted than that which the gorilla possesses. Upon the skullcap
there would have been formed strong bony ridges for the attachment
of the temporal muscles, and these ridges would certainly have formed
crests in the middle and behind. The orbital rims would have been
raised in a much more striking manner than is seen in the gorillas’
skull, and the impression of the bestiality of such a gigantic ape would
have been much greater.

We see, however, nothing of this in this fossil skull. Itis as smooth,
even, and destitute of crest as the skull of an ordinary gibbon.

The skullcap, therefore, in spite of its ape-like appearance, can not
have belonged to an ape, because in its excessive capacity it is dissim-
ilar to both a gibbon’s skull and that of a great gorilla.

There are, however, some features that separate this skull from that
of the apes of the Old World and ally it to that of men. These con-
cern the occiput. As already remarked above, there is a peculiar for-
mation occasioned by the abrupt separation of the planum nuchale from
the upper part of the squama occipitalis, determined by the torus occip-
italis transversus, which is certainly a pithecoid feature; compare the
inclination of the planum nuchale to a plane formed symmetrically
. through the most prominent part of the glabella and of the external
occipital protuberance, and it will be seen that in this respect there is
a great difference between this skull and those of all the apes of the
Old World. The most diverse species of the latter show a slighter
variation with each other regarding the angle between the nuchal
plane and the glabello-protuberantial plane than is shown between
them and the fossil skull. Among the anthropoids I find not more than
three degrees of variation; in Semnopithecus maurus the inclination of
_ the nuchal surface is 4° less, and in Macacus cynomolgus it is 10° less
than the minimum among the anthropoids. In the Java skullcap,
452 PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS.

however, it surpasses the maximum of anthropoids by 18°, being, never-
theless, but 9° below the Spy skull No. 2, and about 12° below the usual
angle in recent human skulls.

The apes of the New World are in this respect much nearer to man
than even the anthropoids. In an Ateles beelzebuth, for example, I find
the angle of inclination of the nuchal surface 11°, in a Cebus niger 7°
greater than the maximum of anthropoids. Indeed many other things
in their cranial formation are more similar to that of man. The platyr-,
rhines stand, however, so far from man in other respects that they are
excluded from any closer comparison. In any case there is in this

feature not an accidental but an essential difference between the
anthropoid skull of Java and those of the anthropoid apes.

In man the stroug forward inclination of the nuchal portion of the ©
occipital bone is considered to have a relation to the upright position.
I can not see why it should not be interpreted in the same way in the
fossil skull under consideration. ;

By the removal of the siliceous matter from the interior of the skull-
cap, which was at first partially and afterwards quite completely
effected, it was shown that the sulcus transversus of the occipital bone,
which, as place of attachment for the tentorium, marks the boundary
between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, lies at about the same rela-
tive distance from the superior curved line of the bone as it does in the
PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS. 453

gibbons.! By laying bare the sulcus transversus we have obtained a
more fixed point of departure for measuring the height of the skullcap

_ aS an expression of the relative extent of the cerebrum. Accordingly,

we find that the skull of Pithecanthropus was almost as highly vaulted
as that of the Spy and Neanderthal men, remaining, however, far below
the vaulting of the skulls of recent men. The exceptionally highly
vaulted skull of Hylobates agilis, inclosed, however, a cerebrum that
reached nearly to the upward curve of the Neanderthal man. The
remaining apes fall in regular series. Cunningham’s microcephalous
boy Joe has a flatter brain than the gibbon and the chimpanzee.

The breadth indices of the skulls represented here are about the
same; therefore the height of each profile curve is an approximate
measure for the relative sizes of the cerebrums.

If, then, the former possessor of this cranium was not an ape, and if
he possibly walked erect, must he then have been a man?

I think that the ape-like form of the skullcap and its capacity, too
small for a man, can not be brought to harmonize with such a concep-
tion. Even Cunningham, who has examined the skull, and is con-
vinced that it is human, finds that its ape-like characters greatly
predominate, and that there is nothing human about it except its
excessive size for an ape. Virchow has also, after a personal examina-
tion of the skullcap, very clearly adjudged it, in Leyden and Berlin, as

the skull of an ape. So experienced a craniologist as Hamy, in Paris,

a is

said, after examining the same, that he never would have supposed it
to be human. On the contrary, the most ape-like human skulls that
are anywhere known, the Neanderthal, the Spy, and the Australian
skulls, were not considered by any as apes. It was only questioned
concerning these skulls whether or not their resemblance to the
pithecoids should lead us to give to that race a higher phylogenetic
significance.

According to the conception which we have of the human skull, the
Java Skullcap is certainly not a human relic.

But the size also is not adapted to that of the human skull. For it is
quite inadmissible to suppose that we are here dealing with a micro-
cephalous skull, not only on account of the great improbability of such
a view, but also because its form is quite different. We are certainly
acquainted with normal human skulls of an equally small capacity; but

1 As I have been able to remove only a quite small portion of the siliceous matter
from the cavity of the skullcap, I, as well as others, had erroneously (as now
appears, misled by its different position on the right and left sides) taken the lower
edge of the sulcus transversus for its upper one. I now find that it lies considerably
higher than I had at first supposed. On the other hand it appears from an examin-
ation of a large series of gibbon skulls that the average distance from the superior
curved line is somewhat greater than I had previously stated. My present data are
therefore more correct than those given in the Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesell-

‘schaft fiir Anthropologie 1895, p. 731. The similarity to the gibbon is therefore

much greater.
454 PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS.

these appear less ‘‘ bestial” the smaller they get, while, on the contrary,
the very ‘“bestial” Neanderthal and Spy skulls are very large. The
smaller the absolute size of a cranium is, within the same species of
mammals, the more significant is its relative size as compared witli the
rest of the body, and the more reduced are those features of the cranium
that have directly to do with the size of the body and are especially
related to the skeleton of the face. It is exactly these features that
constitute the bestial marks of any skull.

A skull that in comparison with that of normal man is so small and
so ape-like in its form that it is declared by not a few experienced
anatomists to be the skull of an ape, can not be human!

The fossil skulleap has been, with more or less strong conviction,
interpreted as follows:

In opposition to the view of the human character of the fossil skull,
the two other views taken together constitute a majority, which cer-
tainly would be considerably greater, namely, by an increase of the
pithecanthropists, if all the learned people who have expressed an opin-
ion upon this fundamental specimen had openly published their views
about it. It may also appear questionable whether this majority might
not be increased through later expressions of the authors above cited,
PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS. 455

For example, Cunningham is now of the opinion that the fossil skull
belonged to an individual with strongly marked simian characters.! He
might on this account be properly placed under the first category.

In a praiseworthy manner Manouvrier,’ in a recently published figure,
has undertaken to restore the skull of Pithecanthropus according to
the cast. Before this I had tried the same thing, especially for my own
satisfaction, in order that I might be clear as to the result of such an
unprejudiced restoration. After the emptying of the skullcap I have
now tried it again. The fact that I have arrived at different results

Fig. 3.—Attempt at a restoration of the skull of the Pithecanthropus erectus half the natural size
C, coronal suture; O, foramen magnum.

The following corrections should be made in this figure: The point O (posterior border of the fora-
men magnum) is about 3 mm. (in the half-sized figure; in nature, therefore, 6 mm.) too high. Also the
posterior part of the Linea temporalis is about 3 mm. (in natural size about 6 mm.) too low.

than those of the worthy Parisian anthropologist in some not unimpor-
tant points arises chiefly from this, that I had resort to the emptied
fossil skulleap itself for the restoration, which caused me to consider
the temporal and occipital regions somewhat differently from what Man-
nouvrier did. It is this that induces me to now publish my restoration
also.

Especially of the temporal region I will again say that it has the very
greatest similarity to that of the adult gibbon, and indeed the entire
skullcap, with the exception of the strongly inclined planum nuchale of

the occiput, has the greatest likeness—only being double the size—to
the highly vaulted skull of a gibbon. It is not strange, therefore, that
I have made the facial portion of the skull not very different from that
of the gibbon.

IIl.—TEETH.

The teeth, a left second upper molar and a third right upper molar,
belong, if we may judge from the circumstances of their discovery, to each
other and to the skullcap. They are also modeled in a very similar man-
ner and are in the same state of preservation and of petrifaction. The
unequal wear of their crowns and the considerable difference in their
size are appearances that can often be seen both in the skulls of men
and of apes. Both have very strongly diverging roots, such as others
as well as myself acknowledge never to have seen in human molars.
Only exceptionally are there found in man upper molars with a crown
of such great size. I measured on a skull from New South Wales, in
Virchow’s laboratory, the transverse and sagittal diameters of a left
second upper molar, finding it 15.5 by 12.5 mm., and those of a third
- left upper molar, finding it 15 to 10.5 mm. The same dimensions of the
fossil molars from Java are 14 by 12 mm. for the second upper molar,
and 15.3 by 11.3 mm. for the third upper molar. A second upper molar
from the cave of Spy I found to be of exactly the same dimensions as
the molar from Java.

In the form of the crown the Javanese molars show a marked ape-
like type; that is to say, in the relative development of their cusps.
As in anthropoid apes, the posterior buccal cusp is in both teeth the
smallest, so that the cusps of both are smallest on the outer side. In
man the reverse is the case. Only in the third molar is an exception
to this rule rarely found.

An exhaustive comparison has, however, convinced me that the teeth
are in no closer relation to those of any of the living anthropoids. ©

In spite of all their simian characters, both, especially in the third
molar, show a strong retrogression of the crown, such as is more fre-
quently found in man than in the anthropoid apes. According to this
the general arrangement of the dental arch must have been widely dif-
ferent from that which obtains with the great anthropoid apes. Com-
paring the size of the teeth with that of the skull, the proportion is
found to be the same as that in the gibbon, but somewhat less than
that which prevails with the anthropoid apes. They therefore agree
very well with the smooth, crestless skullcap.

I11.—FEMUR.

The femur was quite generally declared to be human by authors who
had closely examined either the actual specimen or drawings of it. It
has, as before mentioned, a very deceptive resemblance to the human
femur. It differs from the latter, however, and that difference is as

great as that between bones of the same name in different but some-
what related species of mammals having a similar locomotion, as, for
instance, Colobus and Semnopithecus, Cervus and Antilope. The most
important difference concerns the form of the diaphyses in the popliteal
region. It is much rounder than in man. The planum poplitewm is
therefore less extensive and more convex, so that exactly in its middle
a kind of swelling extends as far as the neighborhood of the condyles.
In the human femur the most projecting portion of the popliteal region
is in the neighborhood of the lateral lip of the linea aspera. In the
fossil femur, on the contrary, that lip is situated more on the lateral
surface of the shaft. :

After examining hundreds of human femora, Manouvrier could find
only two that had a somewhat similar shape. It is therefore a very
rare form in man. With the gibbon a similar form normally oceurs,
the median convexity in this species being, however, somewhat higher.
This may be explained by the peculiar insertion of the femoral head of
the biceps femoris that occurs in this species, it being attached in the
middle line below the adductor magnus in close connection with the
vastus internus. An extension of these conditions might, as Dr. Hep-
burn has pointed out to me, produce the median convexity of the entire
popliteal region which we find in the fossil femur. In man the popliteal
space becomes flattened by reason of the wide separation of the medial
and lateral muscles in this region. In those isolated cases of a similar
formation, found in an examination of hundreds of femora, there may
have been a simian form of muscular attachment.

The exostosis of the fossil bone—considered by me as the result of
a traumatic periostitis, and by Virchow as caused by a psoas abscess
that had descended from along the spinal column—appears as a
so-called tendinous or aponeurotic deposit of osseous tissue. such as
occurs not very infrequently in man and is also to be seen, though in a
less degree, on the humerus of the skeleton of an orang-outang in the
Dresden Museum. This pathological formation has no significance as
regards the systematic determination of the bones.

It has been generally allowed by everyone that the femur must have
belonged to an animal that walked erect. The circumstances under
which it was found, in the neighborhood of the skullcap, make it very
highly probable that both belonged to the same individual; and now,
Since we have shown that the anthropoid skullcap may not have
belonged to an ape, but possibly to a being that walked upright; this
probability increases quite to certainty, for this reduces the deficiency
in human characters which the skullcap showed when compared with
the femur. The femur is not human in the usual sense, for it, as we
have seen, shows features that occur only very seldom in human
femora. Besides, the similarity of form may, as before stated, be suf-
ficiently explained by a similarity of function, so that an entirely
human form of femur need not nccessarily have belonged to a man,
458 PITHECANTHROPUS ERKECTUS.

but be found likewise in some other genus. Only an examination of
the entire skeleton could give a complete solution to this question.
According to the relative proportions of these parts they can not both
have belonged to an ape. For an ape with such a cranial capacity
would, as we have seen, have been a giant, whose femur would certainly
have been much larger than twice the size of that of asiamang. Buta
man with a cranial capacity of 900 c.cm. would have a shorter femur;
for all men, except microcephali, that have so low a capacity as this
have a much smaller stature than that of 165 to 170 cm., which is the
height of the individual, as calculated from the length of this femur
according to human proportions. This is again an evidence that the

individual in question was, in the anatomical sense, neither an ape nor
a man.

With the lengch and breadth measurements of the skull, however, the
length of the femur agrees very well, both from a human and anthro-
poid point of view. A man with a skulleap of these dimensions could
well have had a femur of that size, and if we conceive the proportions
of a siamang to be doubled, the length and breadth of the skull and the
length and breadth of the femur will exactly correspond with that of
Pithecanthropus.

Nothing contradicts the view that the possessor of this cranium had
a body to which this femur belonged. The skull requires exactly such
a femur and no other.

As, therefore, from different points of view, probability speaks most
strongly in favor of the common origin of these fragments, it is carry-
ing skepticism too far to longer doubt that both of them, and the teeth
as well, belonged to one skeleton.

I believe that it now hardly admits of a doubt that this upright-walk-
ing ape-man, as I have called him, and as he is really shown to be after
the most searching examination, represents a so-called transition form
between men and apes, such as paleontology has often taught us to
recognize between other families of mammals; and I do not hesitate
now, any morc than I formerly did, to regard this Pithecanthropus
erectus as the immediate progenitor of the human race. This is my
conviction after the most careful testing of the matter, and has only
become stronger after having submitted the specimens to many
anatomists.

The exact position to be assigned to the ape-man in a system is more
or less a matter of taste. According to the anatomical characters ordi-
narily used to separate the groups of mammals, we must at any rate
exclude it from the genus Homo. Unless we considerably change and
extend the characters that have hitherto been considered good for the
fainily of the Hominide, it can not even be admitted there. Quite the
same may be said of the Simiide and its species.

The relation of man and of Pithecanthropus to extinct and living apes
are here shown in the form of a family tree (fig. 4).
.PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS. 459

This tree is partly an expansion of that of the primates as given by
Haeckel.! To Dryopithecus I have, according to Gandry’s recent
view,’ given a place between the Cercopithecidw and the Simiid. As
I have already stated in my first description, I regard as the progenitor
of all anthropoid apes Protohylobates, a highly generalized hypothetical
form, which, as well as its nearest living relatives, Hylobates, retained,
along with many human peculiarities, yet many characters from its
monkey-like ancestors that came lower in the scale. As immediate

nation of the type specimen in the museum at Calcutta, are the char-
acters of Hylobates mingled with those of man. We first find in
Pithecanthropus erectus a form in which the human characters
preponderate.

ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN!

By ERNST HAECKEL.

At the close of the nineteenth century we look with just pride on
the mighty and incomparable advances which human science and cul-
ture have made during its course—the natural sciences excelling all
others. These facts are characteristically expressed by the statement
-we often hear that this is the “‘ great” century, or the ‘‘age of natural
science.” Every single science that concerns itself with the knowledge
and history of nature claims for itself that it can show the greatest
advances and excels all others, and it can also show good ground for
such an opinion. Buta nonpartisan and unprejudiced philosopher who
should survey the entire field would award the first prize of victory to
our zoology above all others; for it was in her bosom that was born
_evolution, or the theory of descent, that powerful branch of the theory
of development for which John Lamarck, in 1809, laid the founda-
tion, and which fifty years later Charles Darwin brought to general
attention.

It is not my task to lay before you now the fundamental significance
and the priceless worth of the theory of descent. Indeed, the entire
science of biology is to-day interpenetrated with it. No great and gen-
eral question in zoology and botany, in anatomy and physiology, can
be discussed and solved without the question of origins, ‘“‘ the genesis
of the generated,” presenting itself before everything else. This ques-
tion was, however, quite unknown when Charles Darwin, the great
reformer of biology, began his academic studies in Cambridge, and,
indeed, as a student of divinity. This occurred in that memorable year,
1828, in which Carl Ernst von Baer published in Germany his classical
“ History of the development of animals,” the first successful attempt
to explain by “observation and reflection” the genesis of the animal
body, and to investigate the ‘history of the growing individual in
every relation,” from the simplest germ throughout the completed cycle.
Darwin knew nothing of these mighty advances, and he could have had
no presentiment that this history of germs, embryology, or ontogeny,

was, fifty years later, to be the most important basis of the work upon
which he was to spend his life, the most secure support of that doctrine
of descent which was founded by Lamarck in the very year of. Darwin’s
birth, and which was at that time received with warm approbation by
his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin.

Of all the naturalists of the nineteenth century Charles Darwin has
certainly had the greatest success and the most powerful influence.
We often, indeed, call the last forty years the ‘‘ Darwinian age.” And
if we investigate more closely the causes of this unexampled success we
will see, as I have repeatedly said, that they depend upon three impor-
tant services rendered: (1) The total reform of the theory of descent or
doctrine of Lamarck; (2) the founding of the new theory of natural
selection, the special Darwinian theory; and (3) the development of the
science of the evolution of man, that most important deduction from
the theory of descent, which far exceeds in significance all other prob-
lems of the doctrine of evolution.

I shall to-day, before this zoological congress, speak only of the last-
named service of Darwin, and do this for the especial purpose of showing
critically the certainty to which we have attained in our present knowl-
edge of the origin of man and of the various branches of his genealogical
tree. That this is one of the most important of all scientific questions
is to-day no longer disputed. For all other problems which the human’
mind can investigate and understand are conditioned chiefly by the
psychological theory of perception, and this again depends upon the
animal nature of man, upon his origin, his development, and his mental
powers. With good reason, then, did the greatest zoologist of our
century, Thomas Huxley, characterize this problem as the “question of
questions for mankind,” as the “ problem which underlies all others and
is more deeply interesting than any other.” This was done in 1863 in
the second of those three masterly essays which for the first time
thoroughly examined the “ Evidence as to man’s place in nature” in
the light of the Darwinian theory; the first, treating of the anthropoid
apes, the second of the relations of man to the next lower animaJs, the
third of some fossil human remains. Darwin himself, in 1859, in his
principal work, On the Origin of Species, had purposely avoided referring
to these consequences of his doctrine except in a brief, significant,
passing allusion that, by its means, light would be thrown on the origin
of man and his history. Later (1871) in his famous work on The Descent
of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin brought forward in a
most able manner, both the morphological and the historical as well as
the physiological and psychological side of this problem.

I had myself, in 1886, in my Generelle Morphologie, estimated the
importance of the “history of the development of organisms as bearing
upon anthropelogy,” and especially remarked that the fundamental
biogenetic law held good for man also; with him, as with all other
organisms, there is the most intimate causal connection between
—

ontogeny aud phylogeny founded upon progressive inheritance, between
the history of the development of the germ of the individual and the
history of the development of his ancestral stock. In the latter, I, at
that time, distinguished ten different principal degrees within the
vertebrate stock. I dwelt especially, however, upon the logical con-
nection between the evolution of man and the theory of modification by
descent; if the latter is true it gives absolute validity to the former.
“The proposition that man has developed from the lower vertebrates
and, indeed, immediately from the true apes is a special deduction
which must necessarily result from the general induction made by the
law of the theory of descent.” I showed the further development and
results of this conception in the various editions of my Naturliche
Schopfungs-Geschichte (first edition, 1868; ninth edition, 1898), and my
Anthropogenie (first edition, 1874; fourth edition, 1891), its firm founda-
tion was shown in the third part of my Systematische Phylogenie (1895).

It is well known that in the course of the forty years which have
passed since the first publication of Darwin’s theory an extensive
polemical literature has appeared, relating to both its general signifi-
cance and to the evolution of man, its most important result. That
the latter is indissolubly connected with the former is now generally
recognized, and it is exactly this intimate connection that explains the
stubborn resistance that has been shown to the entire theory of evolu-
tion by all mystical and orthodox schools, by all men who have not
been able to free themselves from the traditional anthropocentric
Superstition. In the sharp fight that has ensned on this subject the
most varied weapons have been used. We can refer here only to cer-
tain exceptions based upon empirical biological grounds; we must
disregard all those numerous assaults based upon metaphysical and
mystical speculations made by those ignorant of the empirical but well
established facts of biology. The most important part of our task
will. therefore, be the critical examination of the three evidential
sciences which we place at the base of all phylogenetic researches:

paleontology, comparative anatomy, and ontogeny. We must cast a

glance upon the advances made during the last ten years in these three
auxiliaries of the science of the evolution of man and thus ascertain
the degree of certainty to which a knowledge of his origin has attained
by reason of these advances.

Tirst, we have to examine the position which modern zoology, sup-
ported by comparative anatomy, gives to man in the natural system
of the animal kingdom. For the aim of the natural system itself is to
establish the hypothetical family tree and all the single groups, greater
or smaller, which we distinguish as classes, legions, orders, families,

‘genera, and species in the same stock are only different twigs and

branches of this tree. Now, the systematic place which should be
assigned to man in consideration of all the details of his bodily struc-
ture remained for a long time doubtful. When the great Lamarck, at
464 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

the beginning of this century, grouped together as vertebrates the
four higher of the six classes of animals, he immediately assigned to
man a position at their head. Linnwus himself had already, in 1735,
in his fundamental ‘‘Systema Nature,” placed man at the head of the
mammals, grouping him with the apes and the lemurs in the “‘ Anthropo-
morpha,” or man-like creatures; later he called these dominant animals,
or ‘‘ Primates,” the ‘‘lords of creation.”

Man possesses in his bodily structure all the marks by which mam-
mals are separated from other vertebrates, and there has, therefore,
never been any controversy about his belonging to this class. On the
contrary, there are, even to this day, differences of opinion as to the
place to which man should be assigned in one of the orders of mam-
mals. Cuvier, when he made a new scientific classification of animals
(1817), followed the precedent of Blumenbach and created for man the
special order Limana, or two-handed animals, in opposition to the apes
and lemurs, who were known as the Quadrumana, or four-handed
animals. This arrangement was retained for half a century in most
text-books. It first became untenable when Huxley showed, in 1863,
that it was based upon an anatomical error, and that tiie apes were in
truth as much two-handed as man. Thereupon the order of Primates
in the Linnean sense was again restored.

Most authors in the last thirty years have separated the Primates
into three suborders: (1) the lemurs (Prosimie); (2) the apes (Simic),
and (3) men (Anthropi). Again, other zoologists assign to man only
the rank of another family in the order of apes. The polymorphic
group of true apes (Simic or Pitheca) falls into two natural divisions
that are geographically quite distinct and have developed entirely
independent of each other in the western and the eastern hemispheres.
The American or western apes (Hesperopitheca) are distinguished by a
short, bony, auditory passage and a broad nasal septum. They are
therefore called the flat-nosed apes (Platyrrhinw). On the contrary, the
apes that inhabit Asia and Africa (in early times Europe also) have, like
man, a long auditory passage and a narrow nasal septum. They are
therefore called Old-World apes (Hopitheca), or also narrow-nosed apes
(Catarrhine). As man has in the rest of his bodily structure the mor-
phological characters of the Old-World apes and is, like them, thus
distinguished from the apes of the New World, certain zoologists have
assigned to him a situation within the former group. Undoubtedly
this suborder of the catarrhines is an entirely natural division, whose
numerous living and extinct species are clearly united by many
important characters of bodily structure, but it embraces, nevertheless, .
a long series of very different structural stages. The lowest dog-apes
(Cynopitheca), especially the baboons (Papiomorpha), appear like a
repulsive caricature of the noble human form. They remain at a very
low stage of development and are allied to the older platyrrhines and
prosimians. On the other hand, the tailless apes (Anthropomorpha)
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 465

rise to a height of organization that makes clear as day the immediate
transition to the human form. For that reason one of the most pro-
found students of the anatomy of primates, Robert Hartmann, went
so far as to separate the entire order of primates into three families:
(1) Primarii (man and the anthropoid apes); (2) Simi, or apes proper
(catarrhines and platyrrhines); (3) Prosimie (lemurs). This arrange-

_Inent seems justified by the interesting statement made by Selenka

(1890) that the quite peculiar formation of the piacenta of man is found
in the anthropoids, but not in the other apes.

Decisive for the question as to which of these various classifications
we should prefer was the proposition advanced by Huxley, in 1863,
after a careful and critical examination of all the anatomical relations
within the order of primates, and which I have called in his honor
“ Huxley’s law,” or Huxley’s pithecometric proposition: ‘* Whatever
system of organs be studied, the comparison of their modifications in
the ape series leads us to one and the same result—that the structural
differences which separate man from the gorilla and the chimpanzee
are not so great as those which separate the gorilla from the lower
apes.” Thereupon it becomes necessary for every unprejudiced tax-
onomist to give man a systematic piace within the order of the apes.
By the most conscientious testing of each difference, and by the most
severe logical inference, we can, however, go a step further and
instead of using the wider term apes (Simic), use the more restricted
one of Old-World apes (Catarrhine). The standard pithecometric
proposition would then be worded in this more exact way: ‘‘ The com-
parative anatomy of all organs within the catarrhine group leads us to
one and the same result—the morphological differences between man
and the anthropomorphous Old-World apes are not so great as those
which separate these anthropoids from the papiomorphous baboons,
the lowest of the catarrhines.”

We can now immediately utilize this incontestable pithecometric
proposition, both for firmly establishing the basis of the systematic
classification of the primates and for the genealogy of man. For the
natural system is, within the order of the primates, an expression of
genealogical relationship, just as it is in every other group of the ani-
mal and vegetable kingdoms. Hence result the following important
inferences as to the genealogical tree of man: (1) The primates form a
natural monophyletic group; all “dominant animals,” lemurs, apes,
and man himself sprang from a common original stem form, a hypo-
thetical Archiprimas. (2) Of the two orders of the legion of the pri-
mates the lemurs are the lowest and oldest; from them, later, the true
apes (Simic) first developed. (3) Among these latter the Old-World
apes form a natural monophyletic group; their common hypothetical
stem form (Archipithecus) is, directly or indirectly, derived from a
branch of the lemurs, no matter what relation they may be assumed
to have to the New-World apes. (4) Man is descended from a series

sm 98-30
466 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

of extinet Old-World apes; the more recent ancestors of this series
belonged to the group of tailless anthropoid apes with five sacral ver-
tebree (Anthropoides), the older ancestors to the group of the tailed
baboons with three or four sacral vertebrie (Cynopitheca). These four
propositions are, according to our conviction, unalterably settled, no
matter what further anatomical or paleontological discoveries may -
later do to clear up the particulars of the many steps of the phyletic
evolution of man.

Comparative anatomy, which, with critical penetration, examines
analytically on the one hand the structural differences of separate
species of animals, and on the other systematically groups them in
natural order according to their common characters, has completely
demonstrated the validity of our pithecometric proposition and its
significant inferences. Not less important than these morphological
considerations are the physiological ones that are taught us by that
instructive but hitherto, alas! too much neglected science, compara-
tive physiology. For an unprejudiced comparison of all the activitiés
of life teaches us that in this department also there is nowhere any
radical distinction between man and apes. Our entire nutrition, secre-
tion and circulation, breathing and digestion, are performed by the
same physical and chemical processes as with the anthropoid apes. It
is the same with the isolated processes of sexual activities and propa-
gation. Itis the same also for the animal functions of movement and
sensation. Our mental ability results from the same physical and
chemical laws as does that of the apes. The mechanics of our bony
frame and the movements our muscles impart to this arrangement of
levers are in no way different in man and the anthropoid apes. It was
formeriy thought that walking erect was a special attribute of man.
We now know that this can sometimes be done by the gorilla and the
chimpanzee, and especially by the gibbon.

It is quite the same with human speech. The various sounds by
which apes express their sensations and their wishes, their affection,
and aversion must by comparative physiology be considered as speech,
just as much as are the similarly imperfect sounds that children make
when learning to talk, and as the manifold tones by means of which
social mammals and birds impart to each other their ideas. The mod-
ulated song of the singing bird belongs to speech just as much as the
Similar song of man. Besides, there exists « musical anthropoid. The
singing gibbon or siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) begins with the fun-
damental tone E and goes upward through the entire chromatic scale,
a full octave, in pure and sonorous half tones. The old doctrine that
only man is endowed with speech and reason is still to-day held by
some authoritative philologists, as, for example, Max Miiller at Oxford.
It is high time that this erroneous impression, resting on a lack of
zoological information, should be abandoned.

Our pithecometric proposition met with the greatest difficulties and
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 467

the most violent opposition in an isolated department of neuro-
physiology, namely, that of psychology. The wonderful “‘soul of man”
was thought to be a peculiar ‘‘being,” and it to-day seems to many
impossible that it should have been historically developed from the
“soul of the ape.” But in the first place the wonderful discoveries of
comparative anatomy during the last ten years inform us for the first
time that the minute as well as the gross structure of the brain of man
is the same as that of the anthropoid apes, the unimportant difference
in shape and size of single parts that exists between the two being less
than the corresponding difference between the anthropoid and the low-
est. apes of the Old World, especially such as the baboons. Secondly,
comparative ontogeny teaches us that the very highly complex brain
of man has developed out of the same rudimentary form as that of all
other vertebrate animals—out of five cerebral vesicles of the embryo
that lie one behind the other. The special way and method by which
the peculiar form of the primate brain is developed out of this extremely
simple rudiment is found to be exactly the same in man as in the

-anthropoid apes. Thirdly, comparative physiology shows us by obser-

vation and experiment that the total functions of the brain, even con-
sciousness and the so-called higher mental faculties, together with reflex
acts, are in man preceded by the same physical and chemical phenomena
as in all other mammals. Fourthly and lastly, we learn through com-
parative pathology that all so-called ‘‘mental diseases” in man are
determined by material changes in the material of the brain, just as
they are in the nearest related mammals.

An unprejudiced critical comparison confirms here also Huxley’s
law: the psychological differences between man and the anthropoid
apes are less than the corresponding differences between the anthro-
poid and the lowest apes. And this physiological fact corresponds
exactly with the results of an anatomical examination of the differences
found in the structure of the cortex of the brain, the most important
“organ of the soul.” The deep significance of this information will be
clearer to us when we consider the extraordinary differences in mental
capacity that exist within the human species itself. There we see, high
above, a Goethe and a Shakespeare, a Darwin and a Lamarck, a
Spinoza and an Aristotle, and then, far below, a Veddah and an Akkah,
a Bushman and a Patagonian. The enormous difference in mental
capacity between these highest and lowest representatives of the
human race is much greater than between the latter and the anthropoid
apes.

Since, in spite of this, we find that the soul of man is to-day regarded
in the widest circles as an especial “being” and as the most important
witness against the decried doctrine of the descent of man from apes,
we explain it on the one hand by the wretched condition of the so-called
“psychology,” on the other by the widespread superstition concerning
the immortality of the soul. The science which to-day in most text-
A68 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

books and from most academic chairs is taught as ‘‘psychology” is not
a true empirical science of the mind, not the physiology of the mental
organs, but rather a fantastic metaphysics, compounded of one-sided
introspective observation of self and of uncritical comparisons, of mis-
understood data and incomplete experiments, of speculative errors and
religious dogmas. Most of the so-called psychologists know nothing
at ali of the brain and organs of special sense, that wonderful and
incomparably complex apparatus which solely and alone is the organ
of the mental faculties in man and in animals. Most psychologists
possess today no knowledge of the significant problems of modern
experimental physiology and psychiatry, or they purposely ignore
them; indeed, they know nothing at all of the actual localization of the
separate mental faculties or their concurrence in the normal workings
of the single portions of the brain.

The surprising disclosures which the minute anatomy and ontogeny
of the human brain, assisted by experimental physiology and pathol-
ogy, have made during the last four years are among the most impor-
tant discoveries of the nineteenth century. Indeed, these have not
hitherto been widely known, which is explained on the one hand by
the great difficulty of the subject which deals with the extremely com-
plicated structure of our brain, and on the other hand by the passive
stiffnecked resistance of the dominant school of psychology. The
localization of the higher mental faculties upon the cortex of the brain
was effected ten years ago by the suggestive researches of Goltz,
Munk, Wernicke, Edinger, and others. But recently (1894) Paul
Flechsig has succeeded in marking out the single parts of this region in
a definite manner; he has pointed out that in the gray cortical zone of
the brain mantle there are four clearly defined regions for the central
sense organs, or four ‘sensory spheres”—the sphere for general bodily
sensibility, in the parietal lobe; the sphere for smell, in the frontal lobe;
that for vision, in the occipital lobe, and that for hearing, in the temporal
lobe. Between these four “seats of sensation” lie the four great seats of
thought or ‘‘association centers”—the real organs of intellectual life.
They are the highest apparatus of the mental faculty, on which thought
and consciousness depend. In front the frontal brain, or ‘‘ frontal asso-
ciation center ;” behind and above the parietal brain or ‘‘ parietal associ-
ation center ;” behind and below the principal brain, or “‘ great oceipito-
temporal association center” (the most important of all), and finally,
deep underneath, in the interior, is placed the insula brain, or ‘‘island
of Reil,” the ‘‘insular association center.” These four seats of thought,
distinguished by peculiar and highly complicated nerve structure from
the intermediate seats of sensation, are the real ‘organs of thought,”
the only true apparatus of our mental life. * * *

The next question now is, What has paleontology to say regarding
these important results of comparative anatomy and their application
to the system of the primates and to phylogeny? Yor it is the petri-

factions that are the true “ footprints of the Creator,” the immediate
testimonials of the historical succession of the numerous groups of forms
which have peopled this earthly ball for so many millions of years.
Do petrifactions of the primates give.us any determinate points of sup-
port for the above-mentioned pithecometric law? Do they directly
confirm the much-disputed ‘descent of man from apes”? According
to our view, this question must be undoubtedly answered in the affirm-
ative. Certainly the negative gaps which we here, as elsewhere, find
in paleontological knowledge are very much to be regretted, and
immediately in the primate stem they are, since most of these animals
lived upon trees, greater than in any other groups of animals. But to
offset these wide, empty spaces we have on the other hand a continu-
ally increasing number of positive facts, and these recently discovered
petrifactions have a phylogenetic value that can not be overestimated.
The most important and interesting of these petrifactions of the pri-
mates is the renowned Pithecanthropus erectus, which Kugéne Dubois
found in Java in 1894. As this pliocene ape-man brought out a lively
discussion at the last zoological congress held three years ago at Ley-
den, I may be permitted to say a few words in criticism of it.

From the proceedings of the congress at Leyden (at which I was not
present), I learn that the most distinguished anatomists and zoologists
expressed different views as to the nature of this remarkable Pithecan-
thropus. Its remains, a skulleap, a femur, and some teeth, were so
incomplete that it was not possible to arrive at a conclusive judgment
regarding them. ‘The final result of the long and spirited debate held
on this subject was that among twelve distinguished authorities three
declared the fossil remains to be those of a man, three that they were
those of an ape. Six or more other zoologists, on the contrary, stated
what I believe to be the real fact, that they are the fossil remains of a
form intermediate between ape and man. In fact the ordinary rules of
logic seem to me to justify this conclusion. The Pithecanthropus erectus
of Dubois is in fact a relic of that extinct group intermediate between
man and ape to which as long ago as in 1886 I gave the name of Pithe-
canthropus. He is the long-sought “ missing link” in the chain of the
highest primates.

The able discoverer of Pithecanthropus erectus, Kugene Dubois, has
not only convincingly pointed out his high significance as a “ missing
link,” but has also shown in a very acute manner the relations which
this intermediate form has on the one side to the lower races of man-
kind, on the other hand to the various known races of anthropoid apes,
as well as to the hypothetical stem form common to this entire group
of Primaria or Anthropomorpha. This common stem form Dubois calls
Protohylobates (primitive gibbon). It has essentially the same strue-
ture as we find in the gibbon of to-day (Hylobates) in southern Asia,
and as the fossil Pliopithecus, whose petrified remains have been found
in the Mid-Tertiary mountains of middle Europe (in the Upper Miocene
470 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

of France, Switzerland, and Styria). This in turn is derived from an
older, generalized ape form which lived in the older Miocene period,
and which may be regarded as the common ancestor of the Old World
apes, both the tailed Cynopithect and the tailless Anthropomorpha.
Among the latter we now recognize the two living species of the gibbon
which stand very near to Pliopithecus, as well as fossil anthropoid apes
that lead directly to Pithecanthropus. Such an intermediate stem form
is Pliopithecus sivalensis, whose skeleton was found in the early Tertiary
layers of eastern India in the Pliocene Siwalik strata.

For forming a correct judgment concerning this important Pithecan-
thropus and its immediate position between the anthropoids and man,
two features are especially valuable; first, the close resemblance of the
femur to that of man, and second, the relative size of the brain. Among
the few anthropoid apes yet living the gibbons appear to be the lowest
and oldest, standing nearest the stem-form of all the Anthropomorpha;
they are also the most generalized and appear especially adapted to
illustrate the ‘‘ transformation of apes into man.” The gibbons more
than the other anthropoids have the habit of voluntarily assuming the
upright position, whereby they walk upon the entire sole of the foot
and use their long arms as balancing poles. The other modern apes
(orang, chimpanzee, and gorilla) seek the upright position, and when
they use it do not tread upon the entire sole but upon the outer edge
of the foot; they also have in other respects more specialized charac-
ters, adapted especially to their tree climbing life. It is thus explained
why it is that it is exactly the femur, in Hylobates and Pithecanthropus,
that is much more human in form than that of the gorilla, the orale;
and the chimpanzee.

But also the skull, that ‘“ mysterious vessel” of the organ of the soul,
approaches nearest the human proportions both in Pithecanthropus and
in the gibbon in important particulars—the rough, bony crests which
the skulls of the other anthropoids show are wanting. The relative size
of the brain (in proportion to that of the entire body) is in the latter
only half as great as it is in the gibbon. The capacity of the skull of
Pithecanthropus is from 900 to 1,000 c.¢., therefore about two-thirds
the capacity of an average human skull. On the other hand, the largest.
living anthropoids show a eapacity half as high as this—500 ¢.c¢. So
the capacity of the skull and consequently the size of the brain is in
Pithecanthropus exactly midway between that of the anthropoid apes
and the lower races of mankind; and the same is also true for the char-
acteristic profile line of the face. Iu this respect compare the skuils of
the lowest and most pithecoid races of man. Among these the still
living pygmies, the little Veddahs of Ceylon and the Akkas of Central
Africa, are of great interest. An unprejudiced comparison of all these
anatomical facts Shows in no ambiguous manner the character of Pith-
ecanthropus as a true intermediate form between anthropoid apes and
man; he is the long sought for and much discussed ‘ missing link” in
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 471

the chain of our primate ancestors, by many regarded as of the highest
importance.

To this momentous interpretation, which is now accepted by nearly
all naturalists, the renowned pathologist of Berlin, Robert Virchow,
set up the most obstinate opposition. He went to Leyden for the special
purpose of contradicting the idea that the Pithecanthropus is a transi-
tional form, but met with little success. His contention that the skull
and the femur of Pithecanthropus could not have belonged together,
that the first belonged to an ape and the second to a man, was rejected
at once by the expert paleontologists present, who declared unani-
mously that, in view of the extremely careful and conscientious account
of the discovery ‘“‘there could not the slightest doubt exist that the
remains belonged to one and the same individual.” Virchow further
asserted that a pathological exostosis in the femur of Pithecanthropus
likewise testified to its human character, for only by the most careful -
attention by human hands can such disorders be cured. Immediately
thereupon the famous paleontologist Marsh showed a number of simi-
lar exostoses upon the leg bones of wild apes, who had had no ‘‘nursing
care,” and yet had recovered. LEvery great osteological collection con-
tains similar specimens; experienced hunters know that fractures and
inflammations of bones in foxes, hares, harts, roebucks, ete., are often
healed quite well, without the intervention of man, while those animals
are in a State of freedom. Finally, Virchow asserted that the deep
notch between the orbital edge and the low skullcap of Pithecanthro-
pus—a sign of a very deep conformation of the temporal fossa—were
decisive for the ape-like character of the skull, and that such a for-
mation never occurs in man. A few weeks later the paleontologist
Nehring (who from the beginning had supported the just conclusion of
Dubois) showed that exactly the same formation was presented by a
human skull from Santos, in Brazil.

Virchow had formerly the same waut of success with his “ patho-
logical significanee of the skulls of the lower races of man.” The
famous skulls of Neanderthal, of Spy, of Moulin-Quignon, of La Nau-
lette, ete.—which taken together are the interesting isolated remains
of an extinct lower race of man standing between Pithecanthropus and
the races of the present day—these were all declared by Virchow to
be pathological products; indeed, the sagacious pathologist at last made
the incredible assertion that ‘all organic variations are pathological;”
that they are only produced through disease. According to this all
our noblest cultivated products, our hunting hounds and our horses,
our noble grains and our fine table fruit, are, alas! diseased natural
objects that have arisen by pathological changes from the wild original
forms that alone a e “healthy.”

In order to make this strange assertion of Virchow intelligible, it
must be remembered that for more than thirty years he has regarded
it as his especial duty as a scientist to oppose the Darwinian theory and
472 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

the doctrine of evolution necessarily connected with it. With the great-
est obstinacy he has maintained the doctrine of the constancy of species,
which is now abandoned by all naturalists of good judgment; but in
what now consists the essential idea of a “true species” he can no more
tell than any other opponent of evolution. The most important conclu-
sion from the latter, the ‘‘ descent of man from the ape,” Virchow is well
known to attack with zeal and energy. ‘It is quite certain that man
did not descend from the apes.” This assertion of the Berlin pathol-
ogist has been for twenty years past repeated innumerable times in
religious and other periodicals—cited as the decisive judgment of the
very highest authority—not caring in the least that now almost all
experts of good judgment hold the opposite conviction. According to
Virchow the ape-man is a mere “figment of a dream;” the petrified
remains of Pithecanthropus are the palpable contradiction of such an
unfounded theoretical assertion.

How directly fruitful the great advances in paleontology for the last
thirty years also are for our pithecoid theory can best be shown by the
example of the legion of the primates itself. Cuvier, the founder of
scientific paleontology, asserted up to the time of his death (1832) that
there were no petrifactions of apes; the only fossil lemur whose skull
he described (.Adapis) he erroneously took for a hoofed animal.

The first petrified remains of apes were discovered in India, in 1836,
in 1838 the Mesopithecus penthelicus was discovered near Athens, and
in 1862 further remains of lemurs. But within the last twenty years
so numerous remains of extinct primates have become known to us
through the discoveries of Gaudry, Filhol, Schlosser, and especially
by the rich finds of the American paleontologists Marsh, Cope,
Leidy, Osborn, Ameghino, and others, that we have now obtained a
satisfactory general insight into the rich development of this highest
legion of mammals during the Tertiary period. With great admiration
I have recently seen in London the instructive series of fossil primates
which is displayed in the noble paleontological section of the museum ~
of natural history in South Kensington, in which there is a gigantic
fossil lemur which was nearly as large as a man, and which Forsyth
Major recently discovered upon the island of Madagascar (Megaladapis
madagascariensis).

Now, as in Cuvier’s time, the most important differences between the
two principal groups of true apes consists in the characters of the
teeth. Man, like the Old-World apes, possesses thirty-two teeth of
very characteristic structure and arrangement. The New-World apes
have, on the contrary, thirty-six teeth, namely, one more premolar in
each half of either jaw. Comparative odontology is authorized to state
on phylogenetic grounds that this number has arisen by reduction
from a higher dental formula, from forty-four teeth; for this typical
form of dentition (in each half jaw, above and below, three incisors,
one canine, four premolars, and three molars) is common to all those

ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 473

- older mammals of the Hocene period which we regard as stem-forms
of the principal groups of chorion animals (Placentalia) : Lemuravida,
Condylarthra, Esthonychida, and Ictopsida. These form old Tertiary
stem-forms of the primates. The wngulates, the rodents, and the carni-
vores resemble each other so much in bodily structure that we may
bring them all together as a single common stem-group of the placental
mammals, the primitive chorion animals (Prochoriata), With great
probability we may now connect with this the further monophyletic
hypothesis that all chorion or placental animals—from the lowest
Prochoriata up to man—arose from a common unknown stem-form in
the Cretaceous period, and that this oldest of the chorion animals
arose from a marsupial group living in the Jurassic period.

But in fact we now possess among those numerous fossil lemurs that
have been found for the first time during the last twenty years all
the intermediate forms desired, all the “missing links” that are
required by phyletic odontology. The oldest Prosimia of the Tertiary
period, the pachylemurs (or Hyopsodines) of the old Eocene, have yet
the original forty-four teeth of the placental stem-group; in every half
jaw, above and below, three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and
three molars. The necrolemurs (or Adapides) with forty teeth followed
them; they have lost an incisor on each side above and below. Next
come the younger autolemurs (or Stenopides) with thirty-six teeth (one
premolar less); they have therefore already the same dental formula as
the platyrrhines or American apes. The dentition of the catarrhines
has arisen from this through loss of a second premolar. These rela-
tions are so clear and go so evidently hand in hand with the formation
of the entire skull and the stronger development of the typical primate
form that we may say: The general elementary features of the primate
genealogical tree from the oldest EKocene lemur up to man lie clearly
before our eyes within the Tertiary age; there is no longer any “missing
link.” The phyletic unity of the primate stock from the oldest lemur
up to man is now an historical fact.

It is quite different, however, when we leave the Tertiary and in the
Mesozoic period attempt to discover the oldest ancestral series of the
mammals. There we meet everywhere with painful gaps in our pale-
ontological record, and the comparatively few remains of Mesozoic
mammals (especially scanty in the chalk) are insufficient to enable
us to form any definite conclusions as to the systematic placing of the
mamimalia in question. However, comparative anatomy and ontogeny
compel us to the conclusion that. the Cretaceous Placentalia arose from
Jurassic marsupials, and these from Triassic monotremes. We may
also further suppose that among the unknown Placentalia of the chalk
there were found Lemuravida and other Prochoriata; that the Amphi-
theriide of the Jurassic were ancestors of the marsupials, and that the
monotreme ancestors of the latter are to be sought among the Panto-
theria of the Trias. But paleontology does not at this time offer us
A74 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

any secure foundation for these phyletic hypotheses. Only one impor-
tant piece of information is given us, that the oldest mammals of the
Mesozoic age, the Pantotherta and Allotheria of the Trias, were small,
lowly organized, for the most part insect-eating animals that represent
the derivation from older vertebrates, reptiles or amphibia. There is
nothing in this to contradict the idea that the entire class of mammals,
from the oldest monotremes to man, is monophyletic; that all members
of it can be traced back to a single common stem-form.

This positive conviction of the phyletic unity of the class of mam-
mals, because of its common origin from a single extinct stem-group,
is now shared by all expert zoologists, and I hold it to be one of the
greatestadvances of modern zoology. Nomatter what system of organs
we compare in the various mammalian orders, we everywhere find this
typical agreement in the essential characters of their structure, both
minute and gross. Only among mammals is the skin covered with true
hairs, from which fact Oken named this class the “ hairy animals.”
Only in this class is generally found that remarkable kind of nurture,
the nourishment of the newborn child with the milk of the mother. ©
Here lies the physiological source of that highest form of maternal
love which has exercised such a significant influence upon the family
life of various mammals, as well as upon the culture and higher men-
tal life of man. The poet Chamisso justly says of this:

Only the loving mother, only she
Who nurtures from its birth the child she bears,
Knows the true joy that we call happiness,
Created by the love she never spares.

If the Madonna seems to us the most sublime and pure prototype of
this human maternal love, yet we perceive on the other hand in the
‘‘ape love,” in the excessive tenderness of the ape mother, the counter-
part of the same maternal instinct. The slow development of this, in
the course of many millions of years, from the Trias period to the pres-
ent, goes hand in hand with an important series of transformations.
For the adaptation of the new-born mammal to suckling involved a
series of changes not only in its own body but in that of its mother.
While in the skin of the mother the mammary glands developed
through the irritation and differentiation of a group of ordinary skin
glands, there was formed in the mouth of the child, by the act of suck-
ing, the soft palate and afterwards the epiglottis—two organs of the
throat that occur onlyin mammals. In connection with this the mech-
anism of breathing was changed; this is shown not only in the minute
structure of the lungs, but also in the formation of a complete dia-
phragm. Only in mammals does the muscular diaphragm form a
complete partition between the throax and the abdomen. In all other
vertebrates the two cavities remain openly connected. Also in the
bony framework of the body, and especially in the skull, do we find
results of these important transformations. Much the most important
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 475

of these is the transformation of the articulation of the mandible or
lower jaw, which in mammals is quite strikingly different from that of
all other vertebrates. This joint, by which the lower jaw moves upon
the temporal bone, is in mammals a temporal joint, while the original
joint of its reptilian and amphibian ancestors was a quadrate joint.
The latter is, in the mammalia, taken up into the tympanic cavity and
there represented by the articulation of two of the special bones of the
ear, the malleus and the incus; the malleus was formed from the origi-
nal joint piece of the lower jaw, while the incus is the quadrate bone or
jaw pedicel of the reptilian ancestors.

But apart from these and other anatomical peculiarities which all
mammals have in common, and which elevate them above all other
vertebrates, in order to recognize their difference it will only be nece-
essary to look at a single drop of blood under a microscope. ‘+ Blood
is a very peculiar juice.” The small red-blood corpuscles which, heaped
up by millions, occasion the red color of the blood of vertebrates were
all originally elliptical disks, thicker in the middle (biconvex), as it
was here that the nucleus lay. Only in the mammals have these lost
their nucleus, then appearing thinner in the middle (biconcave), as
small circular disks. These and other important peculiarities oceur,
without exception, among all mammals, and separate them from all
other vertebrates. From their peculiar combination and mutual rela-
tions they can only have been acquired once in the course of descent,
and only from one stem-form can they have been transmitted by inher-
itance to all members of the class.

The older portion of the genealogical history of the human species
leads us still farther back into the domain of the lower vertebrates,
into that dark, immeasurably long age of the Paleozoic era, which
with its uncounted millions of years (according to recent estimations,
at least a thousand) was certainly much longer than the succeeding
Mesozoic age. Here we first come upon the important fact that in the
earliest portion of the Paleozoic period, in the Permian age, no mammals
yet existed, but instead lung-breathing reptiles, as the oldest amnion
animals. They belong partly to the Tocosauria, the oldest and lowest
group of reptiles, partly to the strange Theromera, which by many
characters approach the mammals. These reptiles are preceded in the
lower Carboniferous period by true amphibia, such as the armored
Stegocephali. Such Carboniferous armored amphibia, like small croco-
diles, are the oldest vertebrates, who by their creeping method of loco-
motion adapted themselves to the firm ground, and in whom the fins of
Swimming fishes and the paddles of swimming amphibians (Dipneusta)
had been modified into the typical five-fingered extremity of a four-
footed animal (Tetrapoda or Quadrupeda).

We only need to compare carefully the skeleton of the four legs of
our salamanders and frogs with the bony framework of our own four
limbs to convince ourselves that with these amphibians the same char-
476 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

acteristic and peculiar structure had arisen as they handed down
by inheritance to all the sauropsida and mammalia; there is the
same shoulder girdle and pelvie girdle, the same simple hollow bones
in the upper arm and upper leg, the same pair of bones in the forearm
and lower leg, the same complicated union of bones in the wrist and
ankle, the same typical arrangement of five fingers and five toes. This
striking agreement in the assembling of the bony framework in all the
higher tour-footed vertebrates struck many thoughtful observers more
than a hundred years ago; among others it led our greatest poet and
thinker, Goethe, to those remarkable observations on the morphology
of animals that we may consider the direct precursors of the modern
ideas of Darwin.

We can, in fact, show, as a certain sign of the derivation of man from
the oldest five-toed or pentadactylate amphibians, the fact that we
possess to-day on our hand five fingers and on our foot five toes. Man
and most primates (not all) show in this and in other respects that
through conservative inheritance they have preserved the original plan
of structure much more closely than have the majority of other mammals,
especially the ungulates. Among others the one-toed horse on the one
side and the two-toed ruminants on the other, are much more modified
and specialized than are the primates.

The oldest amphibia of the Carboniferous period, the armored Stego-
cephali (and especially the remarkable Branchiosauria discovered by
Credner), are now quite justly considered by all discriminating zoolo-
gists as the undoubted common stem group whence were derived all
four-footed animals ( Tetrapoda or Quadrupeda), all amphibia and amni-
ota. But what was the origin of this important group itself? To this
question also the great advances of paleontology afford a satisfactory
answer which harmonizes excellently with the older solutions given by
comparative anatomy and ontogeny. Already in Jena, forty-four years
ago, the first master of comparative anatomy, Carl Gegenbaur, in a
series of classical essays, pointed out that the most important parts in
the vertebrate skeleton, particularly the skull and the bones of the
limbs, reveal to us to-day, in the succession of classes of living verte-
brates, a coherent scale of phyletic steps of development. Apart from
the more lowly organized Cyclostomata it is especially the true fishes,
and amoug them again the primitive fishes or Selachians (sharks and
rays), which have proved most constant to the original form in the
essential relations of their bodily structure. To the Selachians are
closely allied the ganoids or enamel fishes, especially the Crossopterygu
which take us farther back to the Dipneusta. Among these last the
Australian fish Ceratodus has recently become of great interest, its
anatomy and ontology having been carefully investigated by Giinther
and Sémon. By this transition group of Dipneusta or amphibious
fishes—that is to say, fishes with lungs, but also with fins, with penta-
dactylate limbs—is the morphological bridge to the early amphibians
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN. 477

easy to find. But this anatomical chain corresponds exactly with the
paleontological facts; selachians and ganoids are already found in the
Silurian formations, dipneusta in the Devonian, amphibia in the Car-
boniferous, reptiles in the Permian, mammalia in the Trias.

These are historical facts of the first rank. They attest in the most
gratifying manner the successive steps of the development of verte-
brates, as they have been made out by the comparative researches of
Cuvier and Meckel, of Johannes Miiller and Gegenbaur, of Owen, Hux-
ley, and Flower. The historical succession of the principal steps in the
vertebrate stock is thereby definitely established, and this success is
much more important for an understanding of the human family tree
than if we had succeeded in placing, in a hundred fossil skeletons of
lemurs and apes, the entire series of our Tertiary primate ancestors in
coherent succession before our eyes.

Much more difficult and dark is the oldest history of our stock, the
derivation of a vertebrate stem from an invertebrate ancestry. As
noie of these possessed any hard and petrifiable parts of the skeleton
(resembling in this respect the lowest vertebrates, the cyclostomata and
acrania) the evidence of paleontology entirely fails us here; we must
rely alone upon the other two records of our family history, upon com-
parative anatomy and ontogeny. ‘To be sure, their value is here so
ereat in many respects that for every expert and discriminating zoolo-
gist they throw the clearest light upon many great features of our older
phylogeny. Of the greatest value are these far-reaching inferences
which modern comparative ontogeny has drawn during the last thirty
years by the aid of the fundamental biogenetic law. Already the older
embryology has made clear the elements of vertebrate development by
the thorough work of Baer and of Bischoff, of Remak and Kolliker.
Then, in 1866, came the important discoveries of Kowalevsky, which
confirmed the suspicion of Goodsir and pointed to the close relation-
ship of vertebrates and tunicates; the comparative anatomy of Aimphi-
oxus and of the ascidians has since that time been the constant starting
point for all further investigations concerning our invertebrate prede-
CeSSOrs.

Five years investigation of the structure and development of the
chalk-sponges (1867-1872) had led me at that time to a reform of the
theory of the germinal layers and to advance the gastrwa theory. It
first appeared in 1872 in my monograph on the chalk-sponges or Calci-
spongide. These views obtained the most earnest support and the most
fruitful development by the excellent comparative researches of many
other embryologists, especially those of EH. Ray-Lankester and Francis
Balfour, as well as those of the brothers Oscar and Richard Hertwig. I
had already then concluded from these comparative researches that the
first step of development in all Metazoa, or tissue-building animals, is
essentially the same, and that we may from this obtain definite insight
into the common origin and the older ancestral series of the same. The
478 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

unicellular ovum repeats the unicellular condition of our protozoan
ancestors. The blastula germ form corresponds to a Volvox or Mago-
sphera, a similar ancestral form; the Gastrula is the inherited repeti-
tion of the Gastrea, the common stem form of the entire series of
Metazoa. All these typical ancestral forms man shares with all the
other Metazoa, that is to say with all other animals except the unicellu-
lar Protozoa. Every man, without exception, begins his individual
existence in the form of a spherical egg-cell, barely visible to the naked
eye, aS a very small dot, and the special characters of this egg-cell are
exactly the same in man as in all other mammals.

The most obscure portion of the genealogical history of man is that
part which lies between Gastrea and amphioxus. Amphioxus itself,
that famous lancelet, or lancet animal, whose fundamental significance
had already been recognized by its first exact describer, the great
Johannes Miiller, is the most precious document ot vertebrate phylogeny.
We should not indeed consider it as a stem ancestor to vertebrates, but
rather as a near relation to such, and as a unique living relic of the
class of acrania. Had the amphioxus accidentally perished, like so
many other links in our ancestral chain, we would hardly be in a posi-
tion to obtain any satisfactory insight into the older steps that led to
the formation of vertebrates. Above amphioxus stand its near relations,
the Cyclostomata or round-mouths. These are the oldest Craniota or
skulled animals, the first vertebrates that succeeded in obtaining a
skull and brain. These Cyclostomata (among whom the well-known
lamprey, Petromyzon, belongs) are, at the same time, the presilurian
forerunners of fishes. Below amphioxus we find that the agreement
between the ontogeny of amphioxus and the ascidians points to an
unknown older group of chorda animals, the Prochordonia, from which
have developed on the one hand the tunicates, on the other the verte-
brates. We may derive these prochordonia, or primitive chorda animals,
from the Frontonia, a twig of the Vermalia, or true worms. ‘The iso-
lated Balanoglossus and the old Nemertina are probably closely related
to these. There certainly existed, in the Cambrian and Laurentian
periods, between these worms and the stem group of the Gastreades, a
long series of intermediate forms, and we suppose that the older Rota-
toria and Turbellaria belonged in this series. But we can not at this —
time form any well-grounded hypothesis on this point, and there is
indeed here a wide empty space in our genealogical history.

But contrasted with these and other obscure portions of our family
history stand out clearly and significantly the conclusions which the
rich results of comparative anatomy, ontogeny, and paleontology have
given in the investigation of the vertebrate stock, and especially of that
of its highest class of mammals. All reliable recent researches have
here unanimously confirmed the proposition which Lamarek, Darwin,
and Huxley declared to be the most important result of the theory of
evolutiou—the proposition that the immediate placental ancestors of
ae

man were a Series of tertiary primates, and the next nearest were the
anthropoid apes, the anthropomorphous catarrhines. The careful criti-
cal comparisons which the two zoologists, Paul and Fritz Sarasin, have
accomplished in their fine work. Jesearches in Ceylon (1893) shows
that the Veddahs of to-day, the dwarfish aborigines of Ceylon, approach
nearest to the anthropoid apes in the primitive relations of their bodily
structure, and that among the latter the chimpanzee on the one side
and the gorilla on the other stand nearest to man. The g.bbon again,
as a lower and less specialized form, shows the closest agreement with
the common miocene ancestors of all the Anthropomorpha. This direct
family relationship is much clearer and easier to settle than that of any
other mammal. [ar more obscure and enigmatical is, for example, that
of the elephants, the sirenia, the cetacea, the edentates (armadillos and
pangolins) in both hemispheres. Not only in his pentadactylate hands
and feet, but also in other anatomical features does man show the charac-
teristic inherited features of his stock more clearly than many other
mammals, as, for example, ungulates, cetaceans, and bats.

The immeasurable significance which this secure knowledge of the
primate origin of man possesses for the entire range of human science
lies clear before the eyes of every unprejudiced and logical thinker.
No one among the philosophers has more thoroughly based his authori-
tative influence upon a contemplation of the entire universe than has
the great English thinker Herbert Spencer, one of the few learned men
of the present day who unites the most profound scientific training
with the deepest philosophical speculation. Spencer belongs t» those
older nature philosophers who already before Darwin recognized in the
monistic theory of evolution the magic key which would unlock the
riddle of the world. He belongs also to those evolutionists who justly
lay the greatest stress upon progressive inheritance, upon the ‘ trans-
mission of acquired characters.” Like myself, Spencer has, from the
beginning, fought in the most resolute manner the germ-plasm theory
of Weismann, which denies the most important factor in the theory of
descent and wishes to explain the same chiefly through the omnipotence
of natural selection.

In England the theory of Weismann has been received with much
approval, and is also known as neo-Darwinism, in opposition to older
views which are known as neo-Lamarckism. This designation is
entirely incorrect, for Charles Darwin was just as firmly convinced of
the fundamental significance of progressive inheritance as was his great
predecessor Jean Lamarck and as is Herbert Spencer.

I had three times the pleasure of visiting Darwin at Down, and each
time we discussed this important question upon which we completely
agreed. I share the conviction of Herbert Spencer that progressive
inheritance is an indispensable factor of the monistic theory of evolu-
tion and one of its most important elements. To deny it, as Weismann
does, is to fly to mysticism, and it is better to accept the mysterious
480 ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN.

creations of separate species. The genesis of man affords innumerable
illustrations of if.

When we regard the science of the genesis of man from the most
general point of view, and bring together all the empirical arguments
for it, then we may say to-day with perfect justice that the descent of
man from an extinct tertiary primate chain is no longer a vague
hypothesis, but an historical fact. Naturally this fact can not be exactly
demonstrated; we can not point out the innumerable physical and
chemical processes which in the course of a hundred million years have
gradually led up from the simplest moner and the unicellular egg-form
to the gorilla and to man. But the same thing is true of all other
historical facts. We all believe that Linneus and Laplace, Newton,
and Luther, Malpighi and Aristotle once lived, although this can not be
exactly demonstrated in the sense of modern physical science. We
firmly believe in the existence of these and of many other heroic minds
because we know the works they have left behind, and because we see
the powerful influence they have had upon the history of civilization.
But these indirect arguments have no more conclusive force than those
which we have put forward for the vertebrate history of man.

Of many Mesozoic animals of the Jurassic period we know buta single
bone, the under jaw, and Huxley has very finely explained the cause of
this strange phenomenon. We allconsider it settled that these animals
had also upper jaws as well as other bones, although wecan not certainly
demonstrate it. Yet the ‘exact school,” which considers the evolution
of species as an undemonstrated hypothesis, must regard the lower jaw
as the only bone in the body of these remarkable animals.

Let us now in conclusion take a hasty glance into the immediate
future. I am entirely convinced that the science of the twentieth
century will not only accept our doctrine of development, but will cele-
brate itas the most significant intellectual achievement of our time, for
the illuminating beams of this sun have scattered the heavy clouds of
ignorance and superstition which hitherto shrouded in impenetrable
darkness the most important of all scientific problems, that of the
origin of man, of his true essence,and of his place in nature. The
incalculable influence of the science of the development of man upon
all other branches of science, and especially upon culture, will bear the
most blessed fruits. The great work which was in our century begun
by Lamarck and finished by Darwin will for all time remain one of the
most significant achievements of the human mind, and the monistic
philosophy which we found upon its theory of evolution will not only
powerfully further the perception of the truths of nature, but also their
practical worth in the service of the beautiful and the good. This
monism is, however, based upon theempirical data furnished by modern
phylogenetic zoology.
THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS:
By Capt. G. REYNAUD.

It would seem that wild animals are devoted to a wandering life, and
yet a careful observation of their habits shows that the fields, the
woods, the plains, and the air are quite equitably divided among them,
as separate districts. Each one of them lives within a domain whose
resources he uses to the best advantage, and where, fearing the com-
petition of his kind, he permits only a limited number of them to range.
Thus among animals property is communal.

The extent of the domain varies, moreover, with the resources which
it presents, the protection which it offers against every kind of danger,
and especially according to the animal’s power of locomotion.

This division of domain is in some measure a necessity of existence.
Every animal that, by reason of defective instinct or for any other rea-
son, attempts to escape from it is quickly exterminated by natural
selection; driven off by his comrades with whom he strives for daily
food, wandering haphazard in an unknown territory full of snares, he
becomes an easy prey for the enemies of his species.

The instinct of orientation, which guides an animal back to his home,
and consequently his habits, his food, his protection against danger,
plays a prominent part in his life. To it he owes his individuality, the
memory which attaches him to the past, and, up to a certain point, the
satisfaction of his needs in the present.

We propose to study the mechanism of this orientation among ani-
mals. As the principal object of our study, we have chosen the carrier
pigeon. <A great number of facts observed by us for the first time have
been grouped and classified. We have deduced, if not the law that
controls, at least a theory that accounts for them. This theory we will
now explain. Allof its propositions are founded uj:on facts rigorously
- and scrupulously established or on experiments easy to reproduce.

Just as occurrences seemingly casual, such as the distribution of bul-
lets in a target, are subject to laws of which science has given us the

482 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

secret, so in the capricious flight of a bird or the wandering course of a
wild animal chance has, as we believe, no part.

The motive which determines the actions of the animal is the instinet ~
of preservation of the individual and of the species. The animal is
capable of a spontaneous activity when he is roused by necessity; it is
very seldom that he performs an act that has no immediately useful
end. Initiative’ is not within his power, and when, in ants or bees, we
think we have observed forethought for the future, we soon see that
this supposed provision is nothing more than obedience to the momen-
tary call of instinct; the animal accomplishes an action without fore-
seeing the result.

The search for food and sleep are the two poles between which the
existence of an animal constantly gravitates. If, to utilize the resources
of his domain, he is obliged to vary his course daily, the periodic need
for rest yet brings him back to the same quarters. The lack of initi-—
ative leads him to always follow the same road to return to the same
point. This is why the animal on his domain makes a number of trails
which are interwoven in every direction; he acquires in this way a very
complete knowledge of the locality; in the region where every little
irregularity is familiar to him he is ready to move in every direction.

Necessity may force the inhabitant of one region to overstep its limits,
in time of drought or famine, for example. Then he makes a rapid
incursion into the neighboring territory, delays not a moment, but as
soon as he has quenched his thirst or appeased his hunger returns in
all haste to his home. In this second region, seldom fully explored,
the animal knows but a limited number of trails, usualiy straight ones.
If he is surprised there by a danger of any kind, he is much more
exposed than in his own territory.

One example will show plainly the essential difference existing
between these two zones. When a stag is attacked in his own domain
by hunters, he begins by doubling, makes a thousand turns, and for a
time throws his adversaries off the track. Soon again discovered, he
sets out anew; pursued from shelter to shelter he finally ‘‘ gets away”
and plunges into the second zone, where the trails are straight. The
chase then changes its character, and takes on a rapid pace which it
did not have in its first phase.

The stag soon reaches the limits of the known territory and tries to
return on his tracks and regain his own domain. Constantly driven
back, pressed closely by the dogs, he again sets out, crosses the second
zone, and then, entering the unknown territory, he is ‘‘off,” running
straight forward until he falls.

It is interesting to see how a stag acts who has been carried some
distance in a cage and then set at liberty before a hunting party to be
chased. The animal, cast on an unknown ground, does not try to

'An animal is by nature a slave to rontiiie; when surprised by the hunter he does
not invent a plan of flight, but makes use of trails over which he formerly passed.
THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. 483

double, but springs before the dogs and is off immediately. The chase
presents none of the evolutions which we described above; it is nothing
but a race between the herbivorous animal, who has on his side speed,
and the carnivorous animal, who has endurance. From the condition of
the animal and the speed of the hunting party one can determine before-
hand the duration of the chase. We will not dwell longer on these
facts so well known to hunters. It is, in fact, sufficient to go through
a wood in Sologne, or in any other country abounding in game, to be
convinced that the ground is traversed in every direction by trails
which do not escape the experienced eyes of the poacher.

Birds also follow through the air roads invisible to our eyes, but
which can be revealed by observation. The bird, like the quadruped,
contracts the habit of always returning to the same point by the same
route. We have watched for some time a group of pigeons that returned
every day to the fields at the same time. In going, as in coming, they
undeviatingly followed a line which we had marked out on the neigh-
boring ground. We have observed the saine regularity of route in the
coming and going of two birds of prey.

The peasants know very exactly the points which mark the course of
the migrations of birds, and turn this knowledge to account by hunt-
ing during certain seasons.

Similar observations have been made on fishes in the sea as well as
in rivers, and the very exact information obtained is put to a daily use
by fishermen.

We will not put further stress on an array of facts long since observed
and known. We will limit ourselves to deducing from them a primary
conclusion. In the air, on land, or in the water all animals follow routes
definitely determined; their movements seem, therefore, to be subject to
other laws than those of caprice or chance.

II.

The actions of animals are all dictated by a single law, which each
one of them obeys in a different way. The animal is controlled by his
environment. If he finds around his home an abundance of the neces-
Sities of life, he moves about but little and his existence is passed in a
very restricted domain. In the opposite case he lives a very active
life, traversing his domain unceasingly, extending its limits as far as
possible and sometimes going beyond them. JHach animal is thus led
to contract habits which become peculiar to him and which constitute
his individuality. He obeys the call of instinct, but he seems to have
the choice of the means of execution, a certain liberty, while he is sim-
ply under the influence of his surroundings. It is necessary to bear
this in mind before fixing those general laws to which the movements
of the individuals of each species are subject.

It is a fact known by experiment for some time that an animal movy-
ing about in a territory familiar to him is guided in finding his way back
484 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

to his home by all five senses working together. Always, in every
species, one of the senses is more developed than the rest, and therefore
plays a more prominent part in the act of orientation—sight for the
bird, scent for the dog, ete.

If orientation within restricted limits is easily explained by the com-
bined play of the five senses, it is not so as regards orientation in an
unknown and distant territory. Let us cite an example: In order to lose
a cat you put him in a bag and carry him by railroad a distance of 80
kilometers. Set at liberty he returns to his home. Though his sight
and his local knowledge guided him constantly back to his home after
his daily wanderings, he yet will not know how to make the same use
of them on this occasion. His sight, were it excellent, could not be a
ereat help to him, as the slightest obstacle, the most insignificant rise
in the ground, would be sufficient to hide the familiar landscape. Is it,
then, his sense of smell that guides him? In this case precautions seem
to have been carefully taken to put this sense at fault. One fact, how-
ever, remains—we are going to try to le it—the cat has easily
reitnnied to his home.

Let.us take another example: The pigeon fanciers of Brussels every
year let loose pigeons at Bordeaux. In preparation for this they make ©
three successive releases, at increasing distances, between Brussels and
Orleans, consequently towards Bordeaux, then after the release effected
at Orleans, without further preparation, the pigeons are set at liberty
at Bordeaux and they return to Brussels. Can we attribute their return
to a memory of the locality, to a piercing vision? Let us admit that in
the three preparatory flights the pigeons may have remarked certain
prominent landmarks between Brussels and Orleans. At the time when
they were let loose at Bordeaux, the elevation of the land, the rotundity
of the earth, set limits to their vision, however piercing it might be.
To see Orleans from Bordeaux the pigeon would have to rise several
kilometers above the earth, which would be physically impossible.!

Let us cite another case: Some pigeons belonging to a pigeon fancier
in Orleans had traveled in the direction of Reims. Some one conceived
the idea of releasing them 500 kilometers out to sea beyond Nantes,
without any preparation, and they almost all returned. In this
example, as in those preceding, the return can not be explained by the
working of any one of the five senses. It is therefore necessary to
acknowledge the intervention of a distinct organ serving for orientation
from a distance. Since the function exists, we are not illogical in sup-
posing that there is, corresponding to that function, an organ which we
will call the sense of direction.

We therefore admit that orientation near at hand is easily explained
as the use of the five senses, and that orientation from a distance rests
sorely on the working of a sein sense.

THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. 485

It has been objected that orientation from a distance or near at hand
is always the same act, and that it is illogical, contrary to the estab-
lished order of things, to see the same functions carried on by two dis-
tinet organs. But this objection is not well taken. It is quite frequent
to see in nature the same function accomplished by very different organs.

The strawberry, for instance, is reproduced by means of the seeds
formed by the foundation of the flower. It is also reproduced by means
of runners that grow out from the plant, take root in their turn and
abandon the fragile thread that holds them to the mother plant.' Close
observation will enable us to cite many examples of the same sort. The
hypothesis that a special sense comes in to take the place of the five
original senses, whose range is limited, has in it nothing illogical.

III.

We will now study a number of interesting cases, seeking to deduce
from them the mechanism of orientation from a distance.

First. During a hunt with greyhounds that took place in the forest
of Orleans, a stag, not the animal hunted, was followed by some dogs;
cornered in an angle of the forest he ‘“ went away;” the master of the
hunt, seeing the mistake made, recalled his dogs and set them on the
right track. But a poacher who had seen the stay leave the forest
noted exactly the place where he passed out and lay in wait for him,
feeling certain that the animal when he no longer thought himself
threatened would return, by the next morning at the latest, and over
exactly the same path by which he had made his exit. The result
proved him right. The poacher had made use of the fact well known to
the charcoal burners who live in the forest of Orleans. The stags and
roebuck, finding almost everything they need for food in the forest,
almost never leave it. When for any reason whatever they go out into
the adjoining land they follow in return the same road they used in
going.

The art of setting snares is founded on this observation. The snare
prepared in the woods at a point presumably on the track of an animal,
or even exactly at the spot where the animal has passed, does not
necessarily entrap him. He wanders throughout the whole extent of
his domain, often leaving one track to try new ones; while an animal
which has ventured into strange territory will surely return shortly and
pass at the same point at which he went out. If the snare be set ata
point where his departure was observed he will smely be taken.

Second. The horse which passes twenty-two or twenty hours every
day in the stable in semi-obscurity, his nose against the wall, can not
be endowed with much instinet. All voluntary action is forbidden him,
since he can only act in obedience to hismaster. His instinct is, if not
atrophied, at least exceedingly diminished.

The stable is a permanent center of attraction to the horse, who finds

486 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

there food and rest. When set at liberty he finds his way back to it
with the constancy of the magnetic needle turning to the pole.

The horse knows perfectly the road back to his home. If in the
course of a drive the reins are let to fall loose on his neck he will take
this opportunity of returning to his stable. With the help of an excel-
lent memory he knows the comparative length of the roads to be fol-
lowed, and chooses without hesitation the shortest.

Suppose that the same horse is taken into a country of which he is
ignorant. After a stay of some hours in a stable he develops the same
attachment for his new home which he showed for the former. If in
the first drive he is left to his instinct to find his way back it has been
ascertained that he will follow the same road, reversed, by which he
came, even if it is not the shortest.

Third. The carrier pigeon when set loose within a short radius of its
home will return to its cote by the shortest way. If it is set at liberty
some hundreds of miles from its home it follows in its return very
exactly the line of the railroad by which it came. We need no further
proof of this than the following fact.

In the season of the conventions of pigeon fanciers the inhabitants
of Bapaume remarked the flight every Sunday of numerous bands of
pigeons returning to their homes in the north of France, or in Belgium.
We can not claim that Bapaume is exactly on the straight line that
connects the different points from which the pigeons were let loose to
their dovecotes scattered throughout the region of the north, from
Dunkerque to Mézieres. It was not merely choice that thousands of
pigeons should pass every Sunday over the little city. Bapaume is
only an insignificant point in the very extended zone which separates
Belgium from the center of France. Moreover, from similar observa-
tions made at Amiens, at Arras, and all along the line of the route from
Paris to Brussels, it was proven that the pigeons retraced in a contrary
direction the road by which they had been taken to the place of
release.

We might cite any number of observations of the same sort. For
example, the employees of the Orleans railway have often told us of the |
passage to Arthenay, to Etampes, or to Juvisy of Belgian pigeons
released at Poitiers, Angouléme, and Bordeaux.

We have deduced from these facts the following hypothesis, which
we will call the “law of retracement.” The instinct of orientation from
a distance is a faculty which al! animals possess in different degrees, of
retracing a route over which they have once passed.

LV;

In the study of mathematics the method is often employed of con-
sidering a proposition as demonstrated, then stating it in the form of a
problem and studying out the consequences. We will use this method
here. Lev us adinit that the hypothetical law stated above has been
THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. A487

sufficiently proven and let us make use of it to explain certain facts,
inexplicable by any other means. Let us imagine that we are present
at arelease of pigeons. Many hundreds of birds coming from cotes in
the same region are set at liberty at the same time. They set out

. together, separate to travel in two or three groups. Then as soon as

they reach the horizon to which they are accustomed each flies straight
to its own home.

A certain number of pigeons do not return, others come in on the
following days. The owner merely registers the losses and notes the
tardy ones without trying to discover the cause of the failure in instinct.
In truth, how can we ask for the secret of a bird which, with one stroke
of its wing disappears from our view. Itsinstinct is at fault; the bird
must then wander at will, counting on chance to find its way home.

We can not agree to this proposition for the following reasons: The
bird that has gone astray through a defect of instinct is still, neverthe-
less, not beyond the control of that general law of self-preservation
which guides all its actions. On the contrary, it feels strongly the call
of instinet which incites it to return to its own cote. It sees clearly
the end, but the means of attaining it are for the moment at fault. It
displays then all the voluntary activity of which it is capable, trying
path after path successively. The law of retracement will permit us to
follow it in its wandering course and to retrace its journey. When we
have found out the secret of the lost pigeon we shall realize again that
chance plays a very small part in the decisions of animals.

In 1896 we were present at Orleans when a number of pigeons from
the cotes at Mons and Charleroi were released. The two bands of pig-
eons having by chance been set free at the same time, at two different

- points in the freight station, joined each other in the air and formed at

their departure a single group. The weather was extremely unfavor-
able. Fog, rain, and contrary wind contributed to delay the return of
the winged voyagers. One first mistake in instinct, easy to explain,
was made at the outset. Two pigeons from Mons were taken in at
Charleroi and three from Charleroi were received at Mons. Besides
about forty pigeons did not return home on the evening of their release.
They had, however, left Orleans together. The birds which first returned
had pointed out to their companions the proper road and some of the
latter had followed their guides blindly, even so far as to enter strange
cotes.

But in Orleans an observer remarked that between 3 o’clock in the
afternoon and 7 in the evening about thirty pigeons flew up and rested
on the roof of the station. When night came we succeeded in captur-
ing nine; five were from Charleroi and four from Mons. ‘They were
again set at liberty. This observation leads us to suppose that the
thirty-two pigeons that returned to Orleans had all gone astray from
the group released that morning. The next morning between 5 and 7
o’clock they all disappeared one after another toward the north; about
488 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

thirty late returns were noted at Charleroi and at Mons on the same
day. These goings and comings are all naturally explained by the law
of retracement. Our winged travelers, although they formed a single
band at their departure from Orleans, doubtless soon broke up into sey-
eral groups; we have already observed that it was necessary for them
to battle against rough weather. Now the carrier pigeons are not all
in this respect equally provided. The little pigeon of Liege flies with
extraordinary swiftness in ordinary weather. The full-plumed pigeons
of Antwerp, endowed with considerable muscular strength, while they
cannot vie with the Liege pigeons in ordinary weather, can, however,
battle witha strong wind. Itis then quite natural that our pigeons of
different powers starting out together should divide up along the route
according to their comparative strength. A pigeon from Mons, finding
himself in the midst of a band of birds seeking Charleroi, follows them
to their destination; then, having seen them scatter to their different
homes he remains alone, lost on the roofs of a strange city. Mons is
not far distant from Charleroi and the lost one need only rise into the
air to see his own home. But he does not do so, for he has in previous
journeys become accustomed to using only the sense of direction to find
his way home from a distance; it never occurs to him to use his sense
of sight. Retracing the road taken to reach Charleroi, he flies to the
point in Orleans where he was set at liberty in the morning. Tired by
the long journey he has made he rests for one night. The next morn-
ing he gets his bearings, finally finds the reverse of the journey taken
two days before by the railroad and returns to Mons. The thirty-two
pigeons who returned to Orleans on the evening of their release and the
next day disappeared had very probably gone through an experience
similar to this.

The example we have just cited is certainly very interesting. We
have established our position with facts, and, when facts were lacking,
with simple conjectures in order to explain the goings and comings of
the pigeons. We have therefore in our conclusion, if not certitude, at
least great probability. But we will now give a few cases more con-
clusive than the first.

A pigeon belonging to a fancier in Grand-Couronne fell into the gar-
den of General M , at Evreux. On the same day we had to go to
Rouen. Wetook the lost pigeon with us and set him free in the station at
Grand-Couronne, near his own cote. The pigeon took his bearings and
flew off to Evreux, to the house of General M——. Again captured he
was this time sent back to his owner by post. When released at his
cote he no longer tried to return to Evreux. The pigeon, stopping to
rest a minute and eat near the house of General M , did not for an
instant think of this unknown house as a new home. It meant for him.
only a point in the journey previously made and to be therefore the
point of departure for his further flight. After some hours of rest he

1
7s :

THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. A489

would have left to return again over the aerial path which had brought
him to Evreux. He only thought of finding his lost cote.

We carried him to Grand-Couronne and set him free a few steps from
his cote. But the sense of orientation from a distance, the sixth sense,
was acting almost to the exclusion of the other five. The bird made
his way back again, passed, as if hypnotized, in sight of his home—with-
out seeing it,! and reached Evreux the point in the itinerary which he
sought to reestablish.

His calculation was foiled, when led to the home of his owner and set
at liberty he then knew where he was. The five senses, reawakened
by stronger stimuli, rose supreme, and the sixth sense, having become
useless, refused to act.

There is at Orleans a depot for pigeons where the birds are kept
indoors. The pigeons which are shut in here and which come from the
cotes of Paris and the north, live in a semi-obscurity and in absolute
ignorance of what passesoutside. When,after a month or two of confine-
ment, they are to be released, the precaution is taken to carry them some
miles from this transitory home, to which, moreover, no pleasant mem-
ory can atiract them. We have ascertained that very often the pigeons
know how to return to this house to which they do not even know the
approaches. They come and rest on the roof, then after a very brief
stay, take their bearings and disappear on the way back to their own
home.

The law of retracement enables us to explain the action. Taken to
the station of Aubrais, for instance, and released there, he will retrace
his way and come to hover over the depot which represents for him the
terminus of the road by which he was brought to Orleans. It is, then,
from there that he will depart to reverse that journey whose memory
has remained deeply graven on his mind.

We might cite a great many examples of the same sort to show that
a lost pigeon always returns to the point where it was released. To
convince ourselves of this it is sufficient to glance at the roofs of the
stations of Paris, Orleans, Blois, Tours, Poitiers, Bordeaux, ete.,

where every Sunday, in good weather, hundreds, and sometimes thou-

sands, of pigeons are set free. On Monday numbers of pigeons, lost the
day before, return here. Having been unsuccessful in their first attempt
to return to their homes, they will make a second and even a third.

attempt to find the right road.

When set free the day before, the pigeon took his flight, he flew as
fast as possible from the place where he was released, a spot to which

490 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

apparently no memory, no interest attracted him. If strong on the
wing, he covered 400 or 500 kilometers, perhaps more, in the wrong
direction—perceiving his mistake he knew, by some mysterious instinct,
how to retrace his path and find again the point of his departure, the
spot of his release, which he had hardly noticed in the morning. The
combined work of the five senses can not explain such a return.

A lost dog behaves in exactly the same way. When, having been
brought by rail to a hunting ground entirely unknown to him, and, hav-
ing lost his way, he returns to the place where he last saw his master,
and stations himself there to wait until someone comes to find him; or,
even further retracing his way, he will follow back again the way by
which he was brought and return to his home.

Let us cite one of a number of instances of this sort which have been
reported to us by a trustworthy witness.

A young dog belonging to Mr. D , a proprietor at Pont-Audemer,
was carried to the station at Beaumont-le-Roger, and from there to a
hunting ground situated between Goupilliceres and Fumechon. He dis-
appeared during the hunt and in the evening returned to Pont-Audemer.
Since he was by chance observed by certain railroad employees and
gate keepers, who saw him pass, it has been possible to trace the road
which he took. The dog returned first to the station at Beaumont-le-
Roger, and then walked along the railroad to Pont-Audemer, passing
Serquigny. ‘To reach the station he had to walk away from home; he
then walked along a road which made a considerable detour, several
times crossing the Rille, while from Fumechon he could have reached
Pont-Audemer directly by a much shorter route.!

The migrations of birds have been the subject of observations too
well known for us to relate them. We will limit ourselves to explaining,
with the aid of our theory, facts which have long been known.

The migratory bird is subject, like those of its kind that remain
always in the same region, to the law of the domain. Only it has two
domains, a summer and a winter one. It has been ascertained that the
same swallows come every year to occupy the same nest, and the same
region. The same observation has been made upon storks and upon
many other birds.

When the time for departure is come, birds of the same species,
inhabiting the same region, come together for the journey. Those that
have already made the voyage take the lead and retrace the path by
which they came. The younger birds, born since the last journey, con-
fine themselves to following their elders, and when, some months later,
it becomes time to return, these are able in their turn to follow in a
reverse direction the journey previously made.

When the migratory bird, born in our country, who has never made

a journey, is for any reason not present at the departure of his com-
panions, he does not go away. This is why woodcocks, wounded, and
consequently unfit to undertake a long journey, resign themselves to
remaining in our country another year. The same thing has been
noticed of plovers, of curlews, of storks, and of swallows held in cap-
tivity at the time of the departure of their companions. Some of these
birds endure the inclemencies of the winter climate; others, especially
the swallows, succumb to them.

Thus, then, it is by means of a sort of tradition that the migratory
birds transmit to each other from generation to generation the knowl-
edge of the airy paths they follow. These paths once laid out are
unchangeable.

The path of the quail that come to Provence from Africa, or of the
woodcocks that alight in Jersey, is well known to the peasants, who
capture them by thousands. ‘To baffle their enemies it would be suffi-
cient for the poor birds to change their path only a few kilometers.
But they ean not do it; they are fatally bound to this aerial route fol-
lowed in their last journey, and they can not deviate from it or they
will be lost.

Like other animals, fish also are districted; certain of them have,
like migratory birds, two or three dominions which they successively
occupy. ‘To go from one to the other they emigrate en masse, following
routes subject to the same rules as those we have explained for the
migration of birds. The desperate war waged against them by fishers
who know their habits has never decided them to change their route.

Our theory of orientation seems therefore applicable to animals of
every Species; it enables us to arrange properly and satisfactorily a
number of facts observed and known for some time.

Vi:

We have demonstrated that the combined play of the five senses,
whose range is limited, is not sufficient to explain orientation from a
distance. This faculty is governed by a distinct organ, which we have
called the sense of direction. The sense has its seat in the semicircular
canals of the ear. Numerous experiments have, in fact, proved that
any lesion which injures this organ results in immediate impairment of
the faculty of orientation in the patient.

The semicircular canals of vertebrates are formed of three little
membranous passages filled with a fluid called endolymph. They are
independent of one another except at one point, where they have a
common cavity, and open into a little sac called the utricle. They are
situated, generally speaking, in three mutually perpendicular planes.

After the remarkable experiments of Flourens in 1834 and the
autopsies of Méniere, their working was studied by Czermak, Harless,
Brown-Séquard, Vulpian, Boetticher, Goltz, Cyon, Crum-Brown, Brewer,
Mach, Exner, Bazinsky, Munck, Steiner, Ewald, Kreidl, and Pierre
492 - THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

Bonnier. To-day it is known that their function is directly connected
with the faculty of equilibration and is entirely independent of audition.
M. P. Bonnier, after having studied throughout the entire animal
series the functions of the labyrinth and those organs which precede it,
by comparing the data of comparative anatomy and physiology and
verifying them by clinical observations, has been able to show that
these organs subserve directly what he calls the ‘‘sense of altitudes,”
which furnishes the images of position, of distribution, and consequently
of movement and of displacement in space.!

It is not yet exactly known what is the physiological excitant which
puts in action the semicircular canals; awaiting further researches for
the settlement of this interesting point, we will try to determine the
method of action of the sense of direction. This way of procedure is
moreover in no way illogical—in natural sciences, as in others, the
knowledge of the effect usually precedes the knowledge of the cause.

An animal wandering in a strange territory follows on his return
the reverse of the road, more or less winding, by which he came.
When he reaches known territory he moves in a straight line to his
destination.

The carrier pigeon, set at liberty at a distance of some 500 kilometers
from its home, follows, in returning, the railroad which brought it;
itis now guided by its sixth sense. Having in this way reached the
known horizon, say 80 kilometers from its home, it no longer depends
on its sixth sense, but goes by its sight straight homeward.

-At other times when it reaches known regions the pigeon does not
think of making use of its five senses, but follows its former path
back to its cote. Sometimes it goes past it; thus we have seen
pigeons returning from a long’ journey pass within 40 or 50 meters of
the cote, go on and only return after an hour or two, having covered in
this way, perhaps from 30 to 60 kilometers in the wrong direction.

If a common pigeon, accustomed to using almost exclusively its five
senses, and acarrier pigeon broken to long voyages, are carried about
10 kilometers away from the cote, when they are successively released
an interesting fact is noticeable—the ordinary pigeon, going by sight,
will usually make its way much more rapidly than the carrier pigeon,
who will find its way back carefully with the aid of its sense of
direction.

From this fact we may conclude that the sense of direction does not
combine its action with that of the five others. It begins to act ina
zone where the other senses are inactive, and often continues to act in
the known region to the exclusion of the other five senses.

It seems that it is not actuated by impressions received from the
path followed and that it is in some degree a subjective organ. We

THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. 493

have made on this subject a very curious observation. When a basket
of pigeons which have already performed journeys is carried by rail-
road, they manifest great agitation when they reach a station whence
they have formerly been released, although they remained indifferent
whenever they stopped at previous stations. Now, it will certainly be
admitted that a pigeon inclosed in a basket, which in turn is shut up in
a dark carriage, can not, from the noise alone, distinguish one station
from another. Its sight and its other senses are of no use to it, since
it is aS completely as possible isolated from whatever passes outside,
and yet it knows exactly where it is in respect to the point of its
departure. We were right, then, in saying that an animal carried to a
a distance possesses an entirely subjective idea of his situation inde-
pendent of the surroundings through which he is for the moment
passing.

Mythology relates how Theseus, penetrating the mazes of the laby-
rinth, held in his hand the thread given him by Ariadne. He could in
this way go back on his own track and reach the entrance to the chasm.
Does it not seem that the animal possesses likewise the thread of
Ariadne, and unrolls it whenever he enters unknown regions?

Before we pass to a new course of thought, let us stop for an instant
to consider an objection which naturally occurs to us. We have cited
in support of our last deduction some observations made on the carrier
pigeon. Since the organ of distant orientation has been developed by
a wise selection in this interesting messenger, can we generalize and
apply to other animals the remarks which concern it? We do not
hesitate to answer such a question affirmatively. By selection man
develops a certain faculty abnormally to the detriment of some other;
he deforms the primitive type, often destroys the equilibrium of nature
for his own profit. He can not, however, develop a new faculty; he
must limit himself to only modifying the existing ones. Variation and
heredity are, in fact, the only means which he can use to accomplish
his purpose. We can not, therefore, discover in the carrier pigeon any
trait which did not exist in the germ in its wild ancestor.

If a new example seems, nevertheless, necessary to confirm this the-
ory, we will cite another interesting fact from the history of migratory
birds. In 1883, on a dark night during a heavy squall, a flock of wild
geese alighted at Clermont-Ferrand on the church of St. Eutrope and
the neighboring houses. After a stay of two hours, the wind having
lulled, the birds took up their interrupted journey through the air.
Some of them, however, who had descended into the gardens or into
the courts, did not succeed in taking flight. They struck against the
walls or got entangled in the trees. Some were killed and others so
badly wounded that they were picked up the next morning by the
people.

The wild goose has not an eye formed like that of nocturnal birds.
Deprived of sight by exceptional darkness, these birds did not, how-
A494 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

ever, hesitate to set out on their journey, guided only by the organ of
distant orientation. The sense of direction, a subjective organ, gave
them the direction to be followed, pointed out the reverse of the path
of the preceding season. Sight, an objective organ, would have put
them on guard against obstacles; in the present instance it was of no
use to them. This is why the birds on thechurch and on the roofs took
up their way through the air without difficulty, while their companions,
lost in a labyrinth of trees, walls, and houses, did not succeed in freeing
themselves from these obstacles.

Val

We have shown that an animal is restricted to a domain where he
finds everything that is demanded for the preservation of himself and
of his species. This domain, more or less extensive for the wild beast,
is restricted for the pigeon, for example, to the four walls of his cote.
_ In truth does he not find there, to use the apt expression of the fabulist,
““good food, a good bed, and everything else?” On the other hand, if
it is true that a knowledge of his locality is not absolutely indispensable
to insure his return home, and the sense of distant orientation suffices to
guide the animal, it will without doubt be admitted that it is possible
to make a pigeon house movable and to teach its inhabitants to lead a
wandering life.

Let us suppose that a cote is transported into entirely new surround-
ings without the least disturbance being made in the life of its inhabi-
tants. They, set at liberty on their arrival, will perhaps wander away,
but the law of retracement will insure their return. We have remarked
above that a lost pigeon knows how to return to the point of his release
which he has hardly noticed in the morning and to which apparently
no pleasant memory, no interest, attracts him. For still greater reason
the dweller in a movable pigeon house would attempt to retrace his
journey. If he is taken to some distance and then released, he will go
to find his home just where he left it. The movable pigeon house which
comes into a new region will therefore render, to some extent, almost
immediate service in the locality.

This new way of using the carrier pigeon, impracticable according to
the ideas which have hitherto been held with respect to orientation, is
only the strict application of our theory.

Interesting experiments have proved conclusively that faithfulness
to his native cote can be reconciled with wandering life. A certain
number of pigeons were born and raised in a wagon used as a pigeon
house. They had no other home than this moving house. It was of
little consequence to one of these pigeons whether ifs house stopped
to-day in the bottom of a valley, to-morrow sought shelter in a forest, or
stopped for a little while in the maze of houses forming a large city.
If it were taken away from its cote to be released, it would not be
guided on its return by the necessarily slight knowledge of the region
THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. 495

around its carriage, but by the sense of direction, which would give it
a subjective idea of its position in respect to its home.

Practice has in every case confirmed our theory. We have had occa-
sions to make some interesting observations, and we will now cite
certain facts which relate directly to our discussion.!

A pigeon carriage was stationed for twenty-four hours at Epernay.
Its inhabitants were not set at liberty, while the pigeons of the neigh-
boring wagons, after remaining quiet for two hours, were taken to some
distance to be released.

The next morning the carriages were taken to Chalons, with the
exception of the carriage from which the pigeons had not flown at
Epernay. Those pigeons were distributed among the other carriages,
which were exactly like the first in pattern. At Chalons the cotes
were opened and these pigeons set free. Some of those which had
made the journey from Epernay to Chalons in a strange wagon left for
Bpernay, and there found their wandering home. How did they sue-
ceed in tracing their way back from Epernay to Chalons, and in find-
ing their carriage in a place of which they could know nothing? Only
the law of retracement can explain this action. We have, moreover,
repeated this curious experiment many times.

While a pigeon carriage was stationed at the Chateau of Morchies
two pigeons went astray. They were found again at Bapaume, the
last stopping place of thecarriage. One was taken, the other escaped.
Its course of flight was reported to us from all the places where its
earriage had stopped. It arrived in this way at Houdain. From
there it left for Evreux, taking up the reverse of a journey made
some days before on the railroad. At Evreux, where the carriage had
stopped for some months, we succeeded in capturing it. Is not the
retracing of this journey step by step the best proof which could be
given in support of our theory? By means of the law of retracement
we can almost always determine the exact point at which to find our
lost pigeon. We thus succeed in decreasing the number of losses which
would otherwise be numerous and difficult to repair.

The return of a pigeon to a moving home is not an exceptional thing;
we might cite many examples of the same sort borrowed from the
history of birds.

The birds of prey which live in the forests of Argonne and of Ardennes-
or even in the solitudes of the Alps, find in spring in their native region
everything that is necessary to their subsistence—young broods and
game in abundance. But when autumn comes, when the game has
grown strong and has learned to escape by flight from the pursuer, he

'Our experiments have settled one interesting point. According to M. Daresre,
egos shaken with some violence for a considerable time will not hatch out. We
have proved that rolling over roads, over a pavement, or ona railroad, when the
egos are shipped, in no way alters the conditions of hatching. We may say with
certainty that in a movable cote the pigeons hatch with the same regularity as
their kindred in ordinary cote,
496 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

finds himself forced to abandon the domain which he has devastated;
he emigrates to the plains and leads a wandering life, settling tempo-
rarily in such regions as offer abundant game. He picks out in the
center of his hunting ground temporary shelters, to which he returns
every evening until spring brings him back to the solitudes, where he
builds his nest. What guides the bird of prey in this long expedition?
Undoubtedly the sense of direction. Wecan not admit that the bird
has a memory sufficiently lasting to retain for many months the recol-
lection of all the irregularities of the ground which mark a course of
many thousands of kilometers. All the bird’s power of observation is
in fact concentrated on one object—the chase. Topography is of no
consequence to him. Like a registering machine set going at the
moment of departure, the sense of direction notes automatically all
the road covered by the bird in his pursuit of prey.

The cormorant and many of the fishing birds sometimes follow for
many months the long routes of migrating fishes. Though lost in the
midst of the sea, they know well how to return to their homes when
their fishing 1s over.

Naturalists who have studied orientation have very wrongly noticed
only one fact—the return to a single home. They have usually attrib-
uted this to a knowledge of the locality, founded on long observation.
Such a theory gives no explanation of the facts we have just cited.
Have we not shown that the law of retracement guides the animal
when it wanders away from the known territory, brings him back to a
temporary home, and sometimes, after an absence of many months,
leads him back to his native region?

Wir

It would be interesting to know whether the theory we have just
explained is applicable to man.

An animal’s movements are regulated by the law of preservation,
which assigns to him an imperative purpose, leaving him a restricted
liberty in the choice of means. Man is actuated by the same law, but
instinct is not the only determining cause of his action; he is also
endowed with reason. While instinct points out to the animal only
one course, reason points out to man many solutions; he chooses freely
whichever seems best to him. He can even consider the promptings
of instinct of no consequence; thus by suicide and Malthusian prac-
tices he may set himself in revolt against the law of preservation of
himself and his kind.

We have attempted to prove that the action of orientation from a
distance depends solely on the function of one organ—the sense of
direction—which acts to some extent automatically. If a man who is
trying to orient himself calls to his aid both reason and observation,
the sense of direction, through lack of exercise, becomes atrophied.
This is why a well-informed man, who estimates everything that he
aaa -

THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS. AQT

does, often finds his direction less accurately than a man whose intel-

lectual culture is limited; he makes an act which should be in some
measure mechanical and impulsive an act of reason. As a result of
these considerations, savages, deprived of improved instruments and
possessed of sharpened senses, can furnish us with more interesting
facts than can civilized peoples.

A former military attaché at Pekin told us that when undertaking
long hunting expeditions he took with him two Mongolians, who, after
many days’ journey, would lead him back to the point of departure.
The confidence which he reposed in these guides was never deceived;
they found again in the return the path followed in going. American
Indians also seem to make use of the law of retracement when, after
many weeks of absence, hunting in very distant regions, they return
to their home. The nomads of Africa and Asia follow in their wander-
ings laws based to some extent on those which govern the migrations
of animals.

These facts are certainly very curious, but one must not draw too
strict conclusions from them; the primitive nan knows, in spite of his
intellectual inferiority, how to reason out what he shall do. It is con-
sequently very difficult in analyzing an act of orientation to discern in
it the part played by reason.

7 Os

We have vainly sought in the works of naturalists a theory which
might explain satisfactorily the acts of orientation performed by ani-
mals. Many very interesting notes have been made on their habits;
the life of certain ones has no further secrets for us. But when it
becomes necessary to pass from effect to cause the observer usually
takes the wrong side. Erroneously taking himself as a term of com-
parison, he asks what he would do to accomplish such and such an

action proved instinctive in an animal. However, if an animal has not

reasoning power he possesses senses whose power surpasses anything
that we can imagine.

We know the famous experiment of the female peacock moth shut up
in a box and set out at night on a balcony in Paris where representa-
tives of its species were very seldom found. The next morning there
were four males, doubtless from the neighboring forest, settled on the
box. How did they know that 20 kilometers away they would find a
female in the midst of Paris, where they had never before ventured?

When in the Pyrenees the hunters run down an ibex, it is useless for
them to hide the entrails under a bush or in a hole; vultures appear
from every direction, although but a few minutes before not one was
visible on the horizon.

Such facts as these are inexplicable from what we know of the senses—
of our own especially. The acts of orientation are not less extraordi-
nary; therefore the observers who have remarked these things have

sm 98 32

498 THE LAWS OF ORIENTATION AMONG ANIMALS.

tried to explain them by endowing the beast with the calculation and
reasoning powers which we would use if we were in his position.

It is in this way that some pigeon fanciers attribute the return of the
pigeons to a wonderful memory of the locality. In his daily sport the
bird rising above his home will note the landmarks of the country, study
their relative position, and will notice them in relation to his home,
thus making a veritable triangulation of the country where he dwells.
According to others, the bird does in time acquire a profound knowledge
of the local magnetic currents. Such an hypothesis explains a mysteri-
ous fact by means of others still more mysterious. It has even been
seriously suggested that a pigeon orients himself by the course of the
stars.

We think that these fantastic theories should be rejected; an animal
can not be a mathematician, a geometrician, an electrician, or an astron-
omer; and observers have been wrong to attribute any intellectual man-
ifestation to a material action which only puts to use a very perfect
organ. The animals most highly gifted in the art of orientation at a
distance are not, in fact, the most intelligent, but those which possess
the most powerful means of locomotion.

Such is the idea which has inspired us in the study of the mechanism
of orientation. We have formulated a series of very simple propositions
founded on observation and explaining a number of facts long known.
It has been possible to draw from our theory many interesting infer-
ences which experiment has confirmed. In expressing our opinion of
this much disputed subject we hope to arouse discussion and incite to
new researches which will doubtless lead us to a complete knowledge
of the truth.
THE FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE
WORLD.'

By HENRY B. WARD.

Away back at the beginning of the investigation of minute forms of
life, which followed upon the invention of the microscope, or shall I
say discovery, for it seems to have been historically an accident, the
early students searched the ditches and ponds and lakes for the organ-
isms which constituted the objects of their study. Anton von Leeu-
wenhoek, whose name is familiar to you as one of the most zealous
early workers among microscopic objects, enriched science by a long
series of new organisms of this character. Roesel von Rosenhof, whose
careful investigations on various fresh-water animals, published under
the title of Insect Diversions, are still standard sources of information
concerning the habits and structure of these forms, together with
Swammerdam, Trembley, O. F. Miiller, and a whole host of others
devoted their attention almost exclusively to the fresh-water fauna.
But this movement seems to have culminated with the appearance in
1838 of Ehrenberg’s famous volume The Infusion Animalcules as Com-
plete Organisms.

Extended investigations had already impressed zoologists with the
richness of the marine fauna. Numerous animal groups of common
occurrence in the sea were apparently entirely wanting in fresh water
and the astounding richness of the subtropical and tropical oceans
with which the Kuropean investigators came early in contact on the
shores of the Mediterranean and in the expeditions to the new lands
of the Tropics entirely overshadowed the life that had hitherto been
found in pond or ditch. It is in my opinion also no small factor that
many of the marine forms which were brought to the attention of
scientists were dazzling in their beauty of form and in the brilliancy
of their coloring. The quieter, more unassuming forms of lacustrine
life in temperate regions could make no corresponding impress on the
minds of the observers. So the scientific world went to the seashore
for study and everywhere along the coast of Europe, and even in
the islands of the Tropics were to be found the vacation resorts of
scientists.

Lincoln, November 25, 1898. Printed in Science, April 7, 1899, Vol. 1X, No. 223.

500 ¥FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

This diversion of attention from the study of fresh-water life was
undoubtedly aided by the fact that fifty years ago all centers of educa-
tion and investigation were comparatively close to the ocean, and so it
was easy for the scientist to reach the point where, as he had learned
from the reports of others, life was most abundant and varied and at
the same time appealed to his esthetic sensibility as nothing did that he
saw about him. The concentration of interest on the life of the sea led
to the foundation of marine stations, among which that at Naples was
the first in point of time, as it always has been and is to-day first in
point of strength. But the development of educational institutions
through the large continental areas and the limitations which their
location imposed upon investigators connected with these institutions,
together with the natural efforts of man to find a field for investigation
which should afford him a better chance than already overcrowded ter-
ritory, have led again to the investigation of fresh-water life. So it
was that Fritsch, in Bohemia, entered upon lacustrine investigation as
early as 1871, while about the same time Forel, in Switzerland, was
carrying on those studies published between 1874 and 1879 in a series
of papers on the Fauna of the Swiss Lakes, culminating in the crowned
memoir of the Academy of Sciences on the Abyssal Fauna of the
Swiss Lakes, that brought to the knowledge of the scientific world a
hitherto unsuspected type of existence and offered a new and enticing
field for investigation.

It was also in the same year, 1871, that Stimpson, one of the enthu-
silastic members of the old Chicago Academy of Sciences, conducted
some dredging expeditions in the deep water of Lake Michigan,
while about the same time Hoy, Milner, and Forbes entered upon
investigations at other points on these same lakes. ‘The Chicago Acad-
emy and its collections, together with valuable manuscripts of Stimpson,
were destroyed in the great fire. The United States Fish Commission,
under whose auspices the work of Hoy and Milner was inaugurated, did
not pursue further the investigations of the lakes, and for years Forbes
was the only investigator who occupied himself in this country with
the study of lacustrine life. To his work and influence we owe beyond
a doubt in our own country the awakened interest in limnobiology,
and under his direction also was established the first general fresh-
water biological station on this continent, of which more in another —
connection.

The impulse toward the investigation of fresh-water life which was
inaugurated by these men gradually attracted to itself workers, slowly
at first, but approximately a decade ago with a sudden start the ranks
of such were rapidly filled up. An enormous number of ponds and
lakes, large and smail, scattered over the surface of the continents,
afforded an almost unlimited field for investigation, and many early
studies were, to say the least, decidedly desultory. There were few
workers who were content to confine themselves to a single locality, or
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 501

to a well-defined problem. A scanty collection was made to serve as
the basis of a faunal list supposed to characterize the body of water in
question, and the enumeration of species was regarded as the ne plus
ultra of many investigators.

Like the spiritless systematic zoology, which, in the work of many
minor investigators, followed upon the example set by the great Lin-
nus, so lacustrine investigators in considerable number were appar-
ently satisfied to describe, as the results of brief sojourns, the fauna of
a lake or lake region, or, perhaps, even from a couple of vials of material
collected by some rich patron in the course of a journey around the
world, to discuss monographically the fresh-water fauna of the Fiji
Islands, for instance. Under such circumstances there could be no
biological study. ‘The chief aim seemed to be to cover as much ground
as possible in a short time. And what Lauterborn said five years ago
is even truer to-day in the light of our more extended experience: ‘For
the question as to the distribution of organisms, the methods so cher-
ished even up to the present day of fishing in the greatest possible
number of lakes (which recalls, in many respects, the chase after new
summits on the part of our modern high eclimbers—Hochtouristen!)
really have only limited claim to scientific value, since through them
but a very incomplete picture of the faunal character of a water basin
can be obtained.”

The earlier investigators whose work has already been mentioned,
Fritsch in Bohemia, and Forel in Switzerland, had been pursuing a
single problem or investigating a limited locality for nearly twenty
years, and they were among the first to emphasize the necessity of a
modification of the prevalent tendency and of a more formal character
for lacustrine work, if valuable scientific results were to be expected
from it. Iorel was the first to publish, in outline, a plan for the precise
formal investigation of a body of water, in which emphasis was laid
upon the necessity also of continuous and extended investigation
before satisfactory conclusions could be hoped for. This programme
has suffered some inodification in detail at the hands of various stu-
dents, but in its general features remains the aim and desire of work-
ers everywhere. With the appreciation that such work must needs be
formal, continuous, and extended, came naturally the desire that sta-
tions of a permanent character should be established at various points
for the realization of the idea. And the first of these that were founded
were of a general character, concerned with the biological investigation
of water as a problem of general scientific interest and importance.

But almost immediately other influences made themselves felt which
have led to the extension of the general idea along particular lines of
economic importance. Improved methods of fish catching and larger
demands for fish food had brought various countries to the point where
the drain on this kind of food supply was becoming very evident. The
fish were being destroyed more rapidly than natural means could
502 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

restore their numbers, and it was felt that something must be done by
governmental agency to replenish the depleted waters. The first
expedient of collecting and keeping under satisfactory conditions large
numbers of fish eggs until they should be hatched and the young fry
distributed through the waters was not so successful as had been hoped.
The problem was too large to be attacked in such a superficial manner,
and the further knowledge, which it became clear was absolutely neces-
sary for proper handling of the question, must needs be sought through
some means for the investigation of the conditions and determination
of the steps necessary for the solution of the problem, and for carrying
into effect the measures which might afford the desired relief. This
led first in EKurope, to be sure, in connection with private enterprises
for fish culture, to the establishment of biological experiment stations
with the fish hatcheries, very much as chemical laboratories are now
necessary adjuncts of various manufacturing interests, or agricultural
experiment stations are connected with the higher development of agri-
cultural possibilities. There is, however, a still further demand which
has led to the formation of institutions of the general type which we
are considering. The water supply of our cities has always been a
serious problem and one of increasing interest in connection with
crowded conditions in the more thickly settled countries of the world,
and the biological examination of the water, undertaken of necessity,
has led to the organization of biological laboratories connected with
the water systems of great cities, both on the Continent and in our own
country.

Having thus discussed the causes which have led to the establish-
ment of limnobiological stations, we may now consider, briefly, the types
which they present, and the particular results which may be expected
from a given sort. Of course all probable variations may be found, and
it is difficult to make any classification which is complete or even just,
and yet for convenience we may divide these enterprises into a few
great groups, recognizing the fact that certain of them do not belong
singly to any one class, but combine features of different types. But
before outlining this classification, let me say that I do not regard the
existence or nonexistence of a building or structure devoted to the
purpose of investigation as a necessary mark of a biological station.
Some of the most valuable contributions to general and special ques-
tions in this field have come from investigators or groups of investi-
gators who have had no abiding place, while, on the other hand, stations
well equipped with buildings and apparatus have in some instances, so
far as can be ascertained, contributed nothing even after several years’
existence, to the progress of scientific knowledge. Material equipment
_is valuable, and in general, conduces to better results, and yet itis the
results themselves which finally determine the character of any enter-
prise and the position which it should hold it the esteem of the world.

For the purposes of this discussion I propose dividing biological sta-
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 503

tions into, first, individual resorts; second, periodic resorts, and third,
permanent stations. Individual resorts are such as are characterized
by the work of one or more individual investigators, working for the
most part independently, and solving their problems by virtue of their
individual investigations. There are, of course, a large number of such
places where some investigator has made sporadic or single efforts at
the determination of the faunal character of a water basin, or has paid
a number of occasional visits to such a locality for the same purpose.
On the whole, these stations have accomplished comparatively little,
although we find striking contradictions of the general statement.

They may be, however, of a more regular and definite character, and
some of these personal investigations have been most valuable in
extending our present knowledge of fresh-water life. It may be noted
here that the permanence or regularity which contributes to the success
may be either in the location of the point at which the investigations
are carried out or in the definiteness of the purpose which is followed;
thus Imhof’s studies on the pelagic fauna of the Swiss lakes were per-
manent in their value, and Zschokke’s investigation of the biological
character of elevated lakes carried on at numerous points in the Alpine
chain has resulted in fundamentally important contributions to the
lacustrine fauna of high altitudes. Yet neither of these was at all con-
fined to a single locality, though limited by a definite purpose.

Periodic resorts are those to which groups of individuals are accus-
tomed to go for a certain portion or season of the year, most commonly
for a vacation period, in accordance with which they are denominated
summer or winter laboratories. The larger number of the investigators
tends toward securing a more complete idea of the biological problem
as a whole, so that the results obtained from such stations are of evi-
dent value. Yet at the same time it must be noted that they are dis-
tinetly inferior even to many individual resorts, since during the larger
portion of the year no investigations are carried on and the results
obtained are necessarily partial and incomplete in their character, and
hence unavailable for the decision of the broader and more fundamental
biological questions.

Permanent stations are those at which operations are conducted
throughout the entire year by a definite corps of observers. The con-
tinuity of their work renders their results valuable for the decision of
general biological problems, and at the same time the permanent force
which, in part at least, is indispensable in such an institution implies
that the undivided attention of the observer is devoted to these prob-
lems; from this we may then expect justly that greater results will be
obtained than in the case even of the best of individual resorts, since
the investigators who are carrying on operations at these are, so far as
I know, without exception connected with educational or scientific
institutions which demand at least a part of their time, and to that
extent divide their interest and their energy.
504 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

It is furthermore clear, from what has been previously said, that such
permanent stations are of two distinct classes. First, those which may
be denominated general, even though their work is of the greatest
value for special purposes, and, second, those which are distinctively
technical by virtue of their association with specific enterprises.

It is but natural that the different continents are very unequally
represented with regard to the number of stations that have been
established upon them, and with respect to the knowledge that has
been gained in reference to their fresh-water fauna and flora. Thus,
our knowledge of the Australian fresh-water fauna is confined at present
to the report of collections made by travelers, and to the investigation
of specimens raised by Sars from dry mud which had been sent to him.
Of Africa we know that fifteen years ago an expedition brought word
from Lake Tanganyika that while rowing across its waters they encoun-
tered swarms of jelly-fish, while many of the gastropod shells which
were brought back with them showed in an equally striking way their
marine character. These reports have been confirmed by an expedition
that has just returned, and the strikingly marine complexion of the
fauna of the lake can hardly be doubted. This appears all the more
strange since collections made at Lake Nyassa, which lies decidedly
nearer the sea, show nothing but what is specifically lacustrine. Such
facts point, of course, to the importance of the African fresh-water
stations of the future.

From various lakes of Asia, all the way from Ceylon to Siberia,
numerous more or less extensive collections have been made by tray-
elers, though there is hardly anything sufficiently extended to warrant
the statement that a station has been located, even for a limited time,
at any point, especially since most of the collections have not been
investigated by men who had made them, but have been turned over as
alcoholic material to Huropean investigators for study. We do know,
however, that Lake Baikal, which is situated almost in the center of the
continent, harbors a rich molluscan and crustacean fauna that is char-
acteristically marine in its form, and is further distinguished by posses-
sing many sponges clearly of marine type, and at least one species of seal
(Phoca), a genus which is typically oceanic. A discussion on the mean-
ing of these features lies far from the purpose of the present paper, but
certainly such facts do point out most strikingly that the field of limno-
biological investigation is not lacking in topics of extreme interest.

From South America reports concerning the fresh-water fauna are
perhaps most scanty of all. Frenzel, a German investigator, who lived
many years in Argentina, has published some interesting studies made
while there on the Protozoa; a few isolated notices of the lacustrine
fauna from various regions complete the list.

From these statements it is apparent that the work done thus far
outside of Europe and North America is exceedingly limited, and that
for our judgment of the results in forn:al limnobiological investigations
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 505

we must look to the laboratories of these two continents. Among all
European countries, Switzerland has furnished perhaps the greatest
number of investigators and stations for limnobiology, together with
the most extended and valuable results, although even yet there is not
in that country, so far as I can ascertain, a building exclusively devoted
to the purposes of this investigation. First and foremost among these
investigators may be mentioned Forel, of the University of Lausanne,!
to whom reference. has already been made. His investigations have
been carried on for more than thirty years on Lake Geneva; to him we
are indebted for the first knowledge of the abyssal fauna of a fresh-water
lake, for the first extended programme and plan for the investigation of
such a lake, and for the first effort toward the realization of such a plan,
which finds its full expression in his ‘“‘ Lac Léman,” a monograph at
present in the course of publication; the volumes which have appeared
thus far treat of physical, chemical, and meteorological conditions on
the lake, and are to be followed by others which will complete, with the
flora and fauna, the entire limnologic investigation. The series will
make a magnificent and permanent contribution to lacustrine investi-
gation, and will serve as a model for the work of all times.

The work of Zschokke, professor at the University of Basel, has been
directed, as already mentioned, toward the elucidation of the faunal
aspect of elevated lakes. It has been carried on through many years
at different points, including the lakes of the Jura to the westward, as
well as those in various regions of the Alps proper, and his papers on
the fauna of elevated lakes contain the only general statement of the
problem, as well as of the characteristic features of such localities, that
has yet appeared.

Lake Constance has been the scene in recent years of the work of
numerous investigators under the guidance of an association for the
investigation of the lake, which has its headquarters at Lindau. The
published accounts of these investigations have thus far been prelimi-
nary in character, and I am unable to learn whether there is a build-
ing devoted to the purposes of investigation and whether the work is
carried on throughout the entire year. This lake was the scene of
early investigations by Weismann in 1877, and the present work, which
was inaugurated about 1893, is under the direction of Hofer, of the
University of Munich.

_ At present Switzerland is the scene of the most extensive scheme
for lake investigation which has been entered upon anywhere. Under
the leadership of the Limnological Commission appointed by the Swiss
Natural History Society all efforts in lacustrine work are to be directed
and unified; methods, problems, and localities are to be studied in the
most thorough manner and the results are to be published by the

lake, is the building of the station, as in Wisconsin, mentioned below.
506 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

society. The work on Lake Lucerne and Lake Constance is already
far advanced, and other lakes are under preliminary examination.

To Bohemia belongs the honor of having had the first definite build-
ing for lacustrine investigations in the form of the Bohemian Portable
Laboratory, which was constructed in 1888, under the direction of Pro-
fessor Fritsch, of the University of Prague. Reference has already
been made to the early work of this investigator, who, in 1871, reported
to the Academy of Sciences in Prague the results of his investigations on
Black Lake, a small body of water in the Bohemian forest, with reference
to the distribution of animals according to the depth of the water and
their relation to the shore. These investigations, which were extended
to other lakes in the same year, are, I believe, the first, at least to be
recorded, that were carried out in this way. It was, however, in 1888
before Fritsch succeeded in obtaining funds for a small portable zoolog-
ical laboratory having some 12 square meters of floor surface. The
station remained at its first location four years, and was replaced by a
permanent structure, when it was removed to another locality. This
portable laboratory has been regularly visited at brief intervals of time
by the director and his associates in the three localities at which it has
been situated during the last ten years, and the contributions from this
work constitute most valuable studies on the lacustrine biology of
Bohemia.

In Finiand there exists the laboratory of Esbo-Lo6fo, on one of the
small islands which, though primarily a marine station, is so favorably
located with reference to bodies of fresh water that it has devoted a
considerable portion of its energy to the investigation of the fresh-water
fauna with valuable results. This laboratory, which is closely allied
with the zoological museum of the University of Helsingfors, has been
maintained since 1889 under the direction of Dr. K. M. Levander. Its
contributions are published in the Acta Societatis pro Fauna et Flora
Fennica. One of its workers, Dr. Stenroos, has for several years indi-
vidually visited Lake Nurmijirvi, one of the small inland lakes with
which Finland is so plentifully supplied; it is a body of water which,
though it is about 2.5 kilometers in length by 1 in width, has a maxi-
mum depth of only 1 meter. He has given us a very complete faunistic
and biologic study of its life.

Russia has recently established a station on Glubokoe Osero, or Deep
Lake, in the province of Moscow, under the patronage of the Imperial
Russian Society for Fish Culture. The station is under the direction
of Professor Zograf, of Moscow University, whose contributions to
lacustrine investigation have been made known, especially in a paper
on the lake regions of Russia, from the biologic standpoint, which was
read before the International Zoological Congress in 1893. I infer that
the station is a permanent one, and probably of a technical character,
although precise information on these points has not been obtained.
Hungary has maintained for some years a lacustrine station on Lake
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 507

Balaton, one of the largest fresh-water bodies of Europe, having an
area of over 266 square miles, though its maximum depth appears to be
only 11 meters. Itis surrounded by enormous marshy areas, which give
thus varied conditions for the development of life. Several parts of
the report on these investigations have already been published.

In France there exists a lacustrine laboratory near Clermont-Ferrand,
which was organized in connection with the zoological laboratory of the
university of that name in 1895. The reports from the station are
recorded in the Revue d’Auvergne. At Paris, Drs. Richard and de
Guerne have investigated collections from a large number of lakes not
only in France and neighboring countries, but even from Algeria,
Syria, the Azores, and other points, and have published valuable con-
tributions on the distribution of fresh-water crustacea, as well as sys-
tematic monographs of various groups.

In Germany all types of stations are represented, as might be
expected from the importance of scientific study in that nation. Indi-
vidual investigators, not a few, have examined various lakes or lake
regions, most prominent among them being undoubtedly Apstein,
whose studies on Holstein lakes have extended over many years, and
whose work on fresh-water plankton is the first general statement of
the problems and of the methods used by Hensen in the investigation
of marine life with such success, and by Apstein first applied to
lacustrine investigation. Probably the best known fresh-water station
in the world is that on Lake Ploén, also in Holstein. This was the first
permanent general fresh-water station to be established in the world.
It owes its inception to the energy of its present director, Dr. Zacharias,
whose plan was to establish for fresh water an institution similar to the
Naples Marine Biological Station. The station opened in 1891, and
since that time it has been in continuous operation, and has afforded
opportunities for investigation to a large number of scientific workers,
both German and foreign. It is the most pretentious of all fresh-water
Stations, having a building two stories in height, with numerous labo-
ratory rooms, and is equipped with abundant apparatus for collecting:
and investigating. From it has been published yearly since 1893 a
volume of studies, and the director has also contributed largely to other
journals on limnologic problems. Two other stations in Germany owe
their inception to the fishery problem, and have for their purpose more
particularly the investigation of those limnologic questions which deal
particularly with the life of the fishes. One ot these is located at Miig-
gelsee, near Berlin, and is conducted under the auspices of the German
Fishery Association. The other, at Trachenberg, is under the auspices
of the Silesian Fisheries Association. Both have made important con-
tributions to the biological questions concerned in fish culture. A
portable station has also been maintained since 1886 by the University
of Konigsberg.

All the North American stations which are known to me lie within
508 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

the limits of the United States, and they represent all the various types
of such institutions. A considerable number of workers have reported
isolated investigations of lakes in all parts of the country from Maine to
California. Among the most important of these occasional observations
are those made by Forbes on the fauna of elevated lakes in the Rocky
Mountains. The observations which he has recorded were made in the
course of a preliminary investigation of these lakes by the United
States Fish Commission, and constitute the only information on record
with reference to the lakes of the country west of the Missouri River.
There are but two localities which may be listed, however, as individual
resorts sufficiently regularly visited to entitle them to more particular
mention in this place. Green Lake, in Wisconsin, has been carefully
studied by Professor Marsh, of Ripon College, and his work has yielded
valuable information with reference to the vertical distribution of the
crustacea and with regard to the deep-water fauna of the lake. Here
he was able to confirm the observation of Stimpson, on Lake Michigan,
that there are found in the deep waters of our large lakes crustacea of
a purely marine type. At Lake Mendota, in Wisconsin, on the shores
of which is located the State University a careful investigation, extend-
ing over a very considerable number of years, has been carried on by
Professor Birge, of the university. The results which he has obtained
with reference to the distribution, both vertical and seasonal, have
been published by the Wisconsin Academy and are not only the most
extensive, but beyond all comparison the most precise investigation
which has been made on this problem. Of course. in one sense, this
station has no building, but the scientific laboratory of the university,
standing within a stone’s throw of the shore of the lake, affords oppor-
tunities which are not surpassed at any fresh-water station in the
world.

The lake laboratory, founded in 1886 at Milwaukee, Wis., owed its
inception and support to the liberality of E. P. Allis, jr.; it was unique
in that a group of investigators were kept at work for years under an
environment ideal in equipment and opportunity, and were afforded
every advantage for the prosecution of their investigations, so that it
combined the advantages of the individual resort with those of the
permanent station. One need only mention the work of the founder on
the lateral line of fishes, and the papers of Ayers, Patten, Whitman, and
others, to show the influenee it has exercised on the development of
biological work in our country. And it should not be forgotten also
that we owe the foundation of the Journal of Morphology and much of
its support for years to the same generous patron. The lake laboratory
has been temporarily closed during the illness and absence from this
country of its founder; there is a general hope that it may soon be
reopened.

Quite a number of periodic resorts of the type of summer laboratories
are to be found in various parts of the country. Some of these are
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WorRLp. 509

merely summer schools, such as'the Biological Laboratory of the Chau-
tauqua College of Liberal Arts, on Lake Chautauqua. Others are both
for teaching and for investigation, while only a small number are
exclusively devoted to the investigation of limnologic problems from
one standpoint or another. The University of Minnesota maintained
in 1893 at Gull Lake, near the center of the State, a laboratory for
Summer work by members of the university, and for the prosecution of
the natural history survey of the State under the direction of Professor
Nachtrieb, of the university. The State University of Ohio has con-
ducted, since 1896, a lake laboratory at Sandusky, on Lake Erie.
It occupies one of the State fish hatcheries, and is supplied with the
necessary apparatus by joint action of the university and State fish
commission. Its purpose is to afford a convenient point of work for
the members of the university, and also to aid in the prosecution of
the State biological survey, which is being carried on by the Ohio Acad-
emy of Sciences. The immense stretches of shallow water, marshy
regions, and protected areas, together with the varied character of
shore and the open lake within easy reaching distance, serve to make
Sandusky perhaps the most favorable place on Lake Erie for the study
of the fresh-water fauna and flora. The station was closed a year ago,
owing to the death of the director, Professor Kellicott, but has since
then been reopened under the charge of Prof. Herbert Osborn.

In 1895 the University of Indiana opened a biological station on the
shore of Turkey Lake, in the northern part of the State, under the
direction of Professor EKigenmann, of the university. A constantly
increasing number of students has visited the station each summer.
The majority of them have been teachers of the State engaged in the
prosecution of work to equip them for their teaching, but others have
also assisted in carrying out a general survey of the lake fauna and in
the collection of material to illustrate annual variation and associated
problems. For comparison, collections have been made from adjacent
lakes connected with other water basins. In the coming year the sta-
tion is to be moved to the shores of Winona Lake, some 18 miles from
the present location, where two buildings are to be constructed for its
use by the Winona Assembly. The contributions from the laboratory
have been published in the proceedings of the Indiana Academy.

For a number of years the Michigan fish commission maintained a
force of a few scientific investigators and assistants in conducting a
biological examination of the inland lakes of the State, under the direc-
tion of Professor Reighard, of the University of Michigan. In 1893 it
was determined to transfer the seat of operations from inland waters to
one of the Great Lakes, and by virtue both of its convenient location
and of its importance as a famous spawning ground of the lake fish,
which had, however, almost ceased to visit it, Lake St. Clair was decided
upon as the locality for the first year, and the laboratory was located
on a small bay at the northwest shore of the lake. The party consisted
510 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

of half a dozen scientific workers, whose attention was exclusively
devoted each to his particular field, and the results of the survey were
published in bulletins of the Michigan fish commission. In 1894 the
station was moved to Charlevoix, a famous fishing region on the eastern
shore of Lake Michigan, and owing to the absence of Professor Reig-
hardin Europe I was requested to take charge of the work. The sci-
entific force and the methods of work were similar to those of the pre-
ceding year, but the location brought us in contact not only with shallow
waters, but also with the deeper regions of Lake Michigan, and the
party made investigations and collections of a precise character in the
deepest fresh water which has as yet been investigated by such methods.
The results of the summer’s work were published in a bulletin of the
commission. Unfavorable financial conditions compelled the suspen-
sion of the work on the part of the Michigan fish commission, but
American investigators owe much to the impetus which has been given
to such work through their agency.

For many years the United States Fish Commission has been urged
to establish on the Great Lakes a biological station similar to that
which has long been maintained on the ocean, at Woods Hole, Massa-
chusetts. Finally, a year ago a preliminary survey was undertaken
with a view to deciding the advisability of such a movement, and Pro-
fessor Reighard was requested to assume the leadership of the enter-
prise. The United States Fish Hatchery at Put-in Bay, a small island
in the center of the west end of Lake Erie, was selected as the seat of
operations, and a party of scientific workers spent two months in study-
ing the fauna and flora of the adjacent waters. It is to be hoped that
this work may develop into a permanent experiment station on the
Great Lakes.

Among permanent American stations of a technical character the
Experimental Filter Station of the Massachusetts board of health,
- located at Lawrence, is the best known, as it is also perhaps the most
famous of its kind in the world. It has been in continuous operation
since 1887, and has conducted extended experiments on the biological
examination of drinking waters. The methods worked out in connec-
tion with them are now standard for such purposes. Similar technical
laboratories are in operation in Boston, Lynn, Worcester, and other
cities; but in most of them the biological examination of waters is only
a secondary function. The Mount Prospect Laboratory, organized.
recently in connection with the Brooklyn waterworks, and placed
under the direction of Mr. G. C. Whipple, whose contributions to lim-
nobiologic questions are well known, is more particularly devoted to
the investigation of questions connected with the character of the
water supply. Numerous samples taken from all the sources of the
city’s supply are subjected each week to physical, chemical, microscop-
ical, and bacteriological examinations, and the quality of the water
controlled thereby, since the reports made to the chief engineer serve
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 511

to guide him in the choice of the sources from which the water is
drawn. The results of such studies are also of great importance in
general limnologic questions.

The University of Illinois was extremely fortunate in having asso-
ciated with it, by statute, a State laboratory of natural history, which
has been engaged for many years in a natural-history survey of the
State. Under the direction of Professor Forbes, whose pioneer work
-on the lake fauna has already been noted, particular attention was
paid to such questions as the food of fresh-water fishes and the dis-
tribution of various groups of fresh-water organisms, so that both by
preliminary work and in the person of its director the State jabora-
tory was peculiarly fitted for the successful inauguration of an Illinois
biological station, which became possible under State grant in 1894.
The laboratory secured a permanent superintendent in the person of
Dr. Kofoid a year later, and work has been carried on continuously by
a permanent force since that date. The laboratory was unique in its
inception, since the director, Dr. Forbes, conceived the idea of locating
it on a river system rather than, as all previous stations, on a lake, and
it was not only the first in the world, but is yet the only station which
has peculiarly attacked the problems of such a system.

The Illinois River and its dependent waters were selected as the
field of operations and Havana, Ill., as the center of work. The
river here presents in its cut-offs, bayous, shallow, marshy tracts, sandy
areas with wooded margins and regions cf spring-fed waters, and with
the enormous extent of land covered at high water, a variety of condi-
tions which it must be confessed could not be surpassed and hardly
equaled elsewhere. The abundance and variety of the flora and fauna,
both in the higher and lower forms of life, demonstrate the good judgment
exercised in the choice of locality. A noteworthy feature in the equip-
ment of thisstation, and, so far as I know, onethatis unique, is the floating
laboratory, which enables an easy transfer of operations to other points,
where work can be carried on for comparison or contrast, with equip-
ment and environment as satisfactory as that which exists in a perma-
nent building, but with the flexibility and facility of movement which
~ characterizes field studies. The work has been conducted uninterrupt-
edly for more than three years, and the results include studies on the
insects and their development, on the earthworms, on the Protozoa
and rotifers, on various groups of crustaceans and general investiga-
tions on plankton methods, and on the distribution of the plankton,
while some work has also been done on the plant life of water. These
studies have been published in the Bulletin of the Illinois State Lab-
oratory of Natural History. é

Let us consider, in conclusion, the function and future development
of these institutions. It is perfectly clear that the work of the differ-
ent types of fresh-water stations will vary somewhat with the class,
and Zacharias has outlined carefully the differences in the work of the
512 FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD.

fixed and of the movable stations. But these are, after all, minor dif-
ferences. All stations, whether fixed or movable, have really three
objects—teaching, investigating, experimenting—objects which may be
subserved directly or indirectly, or in both ways, by each one of them.
It is unquestionably true that the tendency within recent years has
been to make the university-trained scientist a laboratory man, unac-
quainted with work out of doors and among living things. This has
reacted unfavorably upon his teaching powers, and thus indirectly upon
the entire school system. Not that subjects in natural history are not
better taught in our secondary schools than they were twenty years
ago, when, in truth, they were hardly taught at all, but that the
naturalist to-day is not trained as an outdoor observer and is little
capable of handling himself and his work in a new environment. As
Forbes says, ‘‘It is, in fact, the biological station, wisely and liberally
managed, which is to restore to us what is best in the naturalist of the
old school united to what is best in the laboratory student of the new.”
Thus, both through the influence of the investigators in the case of ©
those stations which do not carry on directly any educational work
and through the teaching of those which do conduct summer instruc-
tional courses, new life will be instilled into the teaching of natural
history throughout our country.

In the second place, the fresh-water station is a center of investiga-
tion with all its stimulating effects on the individual thus brought in
contact with problems of nature and efforts for their solution, and in
the contributions to the advancement of knowledge which are the fruits
of a careful work on the part of its attachés. AJ] that has been said
cf the advantages of marine stations applies equally well to fresh-
water laboratories, together with the added advantages that their
accessibility brings these advantages to considerable regions which
would otherwise be entirely without them by virtue of their distance
from the sea. It is unnecessary that I should emphasize further this
phase of the question or dwell upon the greater simplicity of biological
conditions in fresh water over those which exist in the ocean. These
factors have been forcibly presented by many writers.

Finally, the fresh-water station should be above all things an exper-
imental one, and in this direction the most valuable results are to be
looked for, both from the general scientific and from the technical
standpoint. To the scientist, this needs no demonstration; but it is
essential that the importance of such work, especially for fish culture,
be more widely understood. The advance in agricultural methods in
the United States is unquestionably due in large part to the develop-
ment of a splendid series of agricultural experiment stations in which
agricultural problems have been subjected to intensive experimenta-
tion. Contrasted with this, conditions in fish culture present almost -
the opposite extreme. Fish eggs have been hatched in enormous num-
bers, but what is known of their subsequent history or what has been
FRESH-WATER BIOLOGICAL STATIONS OF THE WORLD. 513

done to insure the safe development to maturity of the fish? Present

- methods have reached their limit and the subject must be attacked

from a different standpoint. Fish culture should receive by the liber-
ality of State and nation the same favors that have been extended to
agriculture, the use of permanent and well-equipped experiment sta-
tions, where trained workers shall devote their time and energy to the
solution of its problems. Thoroughness and continuity are essential,
for these problems really deal with all conditions of existence in the
water. Of what does the food of each fish consist, where is it found
and in what amount, how may it be increased and improved; to what
extent and how can the number of fish be multiplied, and how far is
this profitable; what are the best kinds of fish and what new varieties
can be produced? ‘These are a few of the many questions to be solved.

The problems outlined are indeed vast, and yet we may be confident
that their solution lies easily within the power of the human intellect,
for they are all paralleled in the history of the agricultural development
of the race; and man, relying upon his success in the past, may go
forward with supreme confidence to the attainment of their solution in
this new field.

THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION|.!

By A. DASTRE.

I.—GENERAL DISCUSSION OF ENERGY.’

A new term, that of energy, was introduced in the natural sciences
some years ago, and its significance has continually increased in impor-
tance. The English physicists, and especially the English electricians,
have had most to do in bringing this new expression into scientific tech-
nology. Theidea which it conveys is of the highest utility in its indus-
trial applications, and it was from an industrial origin that the term has
been expanded and generalized. It is now, however, not merely of
practical signification, but a theoretical conception of capital impor-
tancein pure science. It has indeed come to the point of being in itself
a science—energetics, so called. Although born but yesterday, this
new comer claims to embrace and fuse together in itself all the other
natural sciences, both physical and pertaining to life, which only the
imperfect condition of our knowledge had till now kept separate and
distinct.

At the threshold of this new science we must inscribe the principle
of the conservation of energy, of which it may well be said that it
dominates natural philosophy. The discovery of this principle has
marked a new era and accomplished a profound revolution in our con-
ception of the universe. It is due to a physician, Robert Mayer, who
practiced his art in a small village of Wiirtemberg. He formulated
the new principle in 1842, and successively developed its consequences
in aseries of publications which appeared between 1845and 1851. These

in such a light as to lend them the importance they deserved. From
that moment the name of the modest physician of Heilbronn has taken
rank among the most illustrious scientists.

As to the science of energetics, of which thermodynamics is but a
single section, it must be admitted that even if it does not already
absorb mechanics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, and physiology, and
constitute the general and, for the future, unique natural science, still
it constitutes a preliminary movement toward that ideal state and a
long step in the pathway of progress.

We propose to illustrate these new ideas, first in their general bear-
ing and then with special reference to their application to physiology,
or, in other words, their influence on the phenomena of life.

I.

According to most physicists the phenomena of the universe call
into play two, and only two, elementary and fundamental things, to
wit, matter and energy. All that we see consists in changes in the
one or the other of these two forms. This is, one might say, the postu-
late of experimental science.

To be sure, it is difficult to give a definition to the conception of
matter satisfactory to the metaphysicists. It will always be admissible
to discuss or even to deny its existence. Hven the physicist or physi-
ologist, convinced that man knows nothing except through his own
sensations, and that he makes nothing of them except he first objectiv-
ize or project them from himself by some sort of hereditary illusion,
may hesitate in ascribing an objective character to matter.. Another
difficulty presents itself even after this one is gotten over and matter
comes to be defined as that which has extension or weight or mass.
For, as regards weight as the characteristic of matter, physicists
recognize a certain imponderable kind of matter, the ether, which has
only a sort of logical existence, founded on the necessity of a medium
for the propagation of heat, light, and electricity. As regards mass— ~
that is, the mechanical parameter—it is necessary to introduce the term
energy, or the allied term, force, in order to define mass, so that we
should consequently be defining matter in terms of energy. Thus there
appears to be some reason to think the two fundamental elements not
irreducible.

It is necessary to avoid these difficulties. The physicist neglects
them provisionally; that is to say, he defers their consideration. Asa
first approximation matter may be considered as that which has
weight. Through chemistry we learn that matter has many forms.
There are simple substances, classed as metals and metalloids, and
compounds, either organic or inorganic. Chemistry may be called the
history of the mutations of matter. From the time of Lavoisier its
transformations have been followed, balance in hand, and it has been
shown that they all take place without change of weight. If we
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 517

imagine a system of bodies inclosed in a tight receptacle and placed
upon the pan of a balance, all the chemical reactions which could take
place, though they profoundly modified the form and state of the sub-
stances, would not be able to affect the equilibrium of the balance.
The total weight remains unchanged. It is this equality of weight
which is expressed by all the chemical equations. From a more ele-
vated point of view we see here the verification of one of the greatest
laws of nature, the law of Lavoisier, or the law of the conservation
of matter, or, still again, the law of the indestructibility of matter:
‘Nothing is lost; nothing is created; everything is transformed.”

The conception of energy is not less clear than that of matter; it is
only more novel. Its conception requires us to habituate ourselves to
the thought that there are no isolated phenomena. The older natural
philosophy had but a limited view of things, and considered them as
independent of each other. Phenomena were classed for purposes of
analysis into distinct groups, such as weight, heat, electricity, magnet-
ism, and light. Kach phenomenon was considered apart without
reference to what preceded or followed after it. Nothing could be more
artificial than such a method. In reality every manifestation is linked
to some other. There is a metamorphosis from one state of things to
another—a mutation. A bond of union connects the state which is
anterior to that which follows—the new form which appears with the
old form which vanishes. The science of energy shows us that some-
thing has passed from the one condition to the other, only covering
itself with a new investiture; that in the passage from one state to the
other there was something both permanent and active, and that the
change is but in aspect.

The thing which remains constant under the vicissitudes of form,
and which connects in a definite manner the antecedent to the phenom-
ena which follows, is energy. This gives us, however, but a vague and
seemingly arbitrary view of energy. It is to be rendered precise only
by the study of examples in mechanical, chemical, thermal, and elec-
trical phenomena. Energy takes on corresponding forms throughout
these diverse modes.

Mechanical energy is the most simple and the earliest known of these
various forms. Mechanical phenomena may be known through two
fundamental conditions, space and time, which are of logical origin;
and to these is joined a third, which is solely the result of experiment
(its origin being in our outward sensation), which is known either as
force, as work, or as power.

Our ideas of force, work, and power have their source in the muscu-
lar activity of man. In their definition and development they have
employed the genius of the greatest mathematicians from Descartes to
Leibnitz. ‘

A man supports a burden without stooping or bending. It is a
weight—that is, a body or mass under the influence of the force of grav-
518 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD-

ity—which is opposing his efforts, and the man exerts a force sufficient
to destroy the effect of the weight. This effect, which is nullified by
the effort of the man, would be to cause the body to fall. The man’s
effort is in equilibrium with the weight and is equal and opposite to it.
It gives him the sensation of exerting force, that is to say, the action
which is able to produce or prevent motion.

The muscular activity of man may be called out in another way.
When workmen are employed, as Carnot has said in his essay upon
equilibrium and motion, it is of no consequence “ to know what burdens
they can reasonably support,” but only those which they can carry.
“This is the meaning attached to the word force when it is said that
the horse has the force of seven men. It is not meant that if the horse
pulls one way and seven men the other, their efforts will be in equi-
librium, but that in a piece of work the horse, for example, could raise
as much weight to a given height in a given time as seven men.” Here
we are concerned with the second form of muscular activity, which is
called in mechanics work, if we do not lay particular stress on the
words ‘in a given time,” and think only of employing muscular activ-
ity with reference solely to its final result. Mechanical work may be
expressed in terms of raising a weight; and it is measured by the prod-
uct of the force (used in the usual sense, that is, meaning the cause of
motion or the hindrance to motion) by the distance through which it
causes motion. The unit of work is the kilogram-meter, or the work

required to raise a weight of a kilogram to the height of a meter.

Time does not enter into the estimation of work; for this conception
is entirely free from considerations of time or velocity. ‘The greater
or less rapidity with which we execute a piece of work can not serve as
a measure of its amount, any more than the number of years that a
man spends in growing rich or in ruining himself indicates the rise or
decline of his fortune.”

To revert to the comparison of Carnot, a farmer who employed
laborers only by the job, and who would care only for the quality of
work irrespective of the time it occupied, would be at the same point
of view as those who discuss the theory of mechanics. M. Bouasse,
whom we follow here, remarks that this idea of work is due to
Descartes. His predecessors, and particularly Galileo, had an entirely
different method of measuring mechanical activity, and the same is true
of his successors, the mathematicians of the eighteenth century.
Leibnitz and still later Jean Bernouilli were almost alone in adopting
this view.

It is precisely this idea of work that constitutes the conception of
mechanical energy. It represents the durable effect of mechanical ac-
tivity independent of all the circumstances of its execution. The same
work may be done under very different conditions as regards the time,
velocity, and force applied in its accomplishment. Energy is therefore
the constant element in the midst of the variety of mechanical aspect.
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 519

It is that, for instance, which in the collision of bodies remains to effect
the rebound. We say that the energy is conserved invariable amid all
mechanical transformations.

In the history of mechanics we learn with what difficulty the ideas
of force and work (now known as mechanical energy) have been dis-
tinguished. Force has no objective existence, no duration, no perma-
nence. It is measured by its effect, the motion which it produces.
When, for example, an hydraulic press is put in operation, there is
exerted upon the platform exactly the same work which is expended
at the piston. The machine only produces a change in the manner of
doing work. But, on the other hand, the force is multiplied indefinitely.
The whole surface at the platform may be considered as made up of
small areas each equal to that of the small piston and, by Pascal’s
principle, each acted upon by the same pressure applied at the piston.
The moment this pressure ceases, the relatively infinite pressure at the
platform falls to zero. What real thing can fall instantly from infinity
to zero? Work and force belong to different orders of things; they
can not have the same expression. TJ orce is a vector quantity; that is,
it includes the idea of direction. Work is a scaler quantity, which
admits of the opposition of senses involved in the terms plus and
minus. Hnergy, and in this only it differs from work, is a quantity
admitting not even opposition of sign. We shall see a little further on,
however, that a very eminent physiologist, M. Chauveau, has proposed
the same term, ‘‘ the energy of contraction,” for the two phenomena of
effort and of work. It might seem from the point of view of the ex-
penditure of the organism that these two modes of activity, the con-
traction static and the contraction dynamic, are really comparable.
But although this way of regarding the matter may be perfectly
exact and of value, the author’s persistence in using nomenclature
contrary to the received usage has prevented the acceptance of very
useful facts by physicists and even by some physiologists.

The idea of mechanical power differs from either that of force or of
work. It includes the idea of time. In describing a mechanical oper-
ation it is not sufficient to give the amount of work done, for the time
occupied is an important factor. This is especially the case when the
conditions of accomplishment are being considered, as in comparing
machines. The one which does the work in the shortest time is called
the most powerful. The unit of power is that of a machine which exe-
cutes 1 kilogram-meter in a second. For industrial purposes a unit 75
times as great as this, called the cheval-vapeur, is frequently employed.
It is the power of a machine which does 75 kilogram-meters per second.
In electrical industries power is reckoned in kilowatts (equal to 36
cheval-vapeur) or in watts, a unit one-thousandth as great.

It is useless to attempt to determine the power of the human machine
relative to industrial machines; for experiment has shown that the
mechanical power of living beings depends upon the nature of the work
520 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

done. Very interesting researches upon this matter were communi-
cated by the celebrated physicist, Coulomb, to the institute in the year
1797. A man of 70 kilograms average weight was occupied with as-
cending the stairs of a house 20 meters high. He made the ascension
at the rate of 14 meters a minute and kept up this rate effectively for
four hours. The work thus done was equivalent to 235,000 kilogram-
meters. But when instead of mounting without load the man was made
to carry a weight, the result was quite different. Coulomb’s laborer
carried up 6 loads of wood in a day to a height of 12 meters in 66
trips. This would correspond to a maximum work of 109,000 kilogram-
meters, instead of 235,000.

Energy, or mechanical work, may be discovered in two forms—actual
or kinetic energy, corresponding to a mechanical action being actually
performed, and potential energy, or energy in reserve.

A body when raised to a certain height develops in its fall an
amount of work in kilogram-meters equal to the product of its weight
by the distance through which it falls. his work may be applied in
various ways. In this way, for example, public clocks are driven. Now,
when the weight is being wound up, when the works are lax, and no
motion occurs, the ancient physics would say that there was nothing
to consider. The phenomenon is the fall. That will take place, but
for the moment there is nothing occurring. —

In energetics the reasoning is different. The body is said to possess
a capacity for work which it manifests upon a suitable occasion; it has
stored-up energy, the power of exerting energy, or potential energy.
When the body falls, this potential energy becomes transformed into
actual or kinetic energy. The work done by the weight in falling is
exactly equal and opposite to that done in winding the clock. This is
the source of the energy gradually expended in eight or fifteen days
in the regular movement of the hands and the striking of tie hours.
The fall is the counterpart of the elevation. There is recovered in
the second phase of the phenomenon exactly the amount of energy
expended in the first. Between the two phases may intervene as long
a time as one pleases, during which the energy slumbers, as it were,
and of which we speak as a period of potential energy. Thus the con-
necting link between the phenomena is maintained ever present, and
the energy, never lost sight of in these conceptions, is not a new thing
when it reappears. Thus we conceive of energy as something real,
indestructible, and eternal, having an objective existence; sometimes
revealing itself, sometimes slumbering; now manifest, now latent.

Similarly the flow of a torrent of water in a mountainous region may
be utilized to drive the water wheels and turbines of the mills in the
valley. The fall of the water produces mechanical work which would
be a creation ex nihilo if the antecedent phenomena were not taken
account of. It can be shown that this is but a case of restitution, for
the water was taken from the place to which it now returns, and raised
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 521

by the action of natural forces. Thus it was evaporated by the heat of
the sun, formed into clouds, transferred by the winds, etc. Here, then,
is but an example of a complex energy transformation, first from actual
to potential energy, and then back again, with neither loss nor gain.

There are aS many forms of energy as of distinct varieties of phe-
nomena. Physicists distinguish two species of mechanical energy—the
energy of position and energy of motion. There are several varieties
of the former species, including distance energy or force, of which we
have already spoken; surface energy, corresponding to the phenomena
of surface tension, and volume energy, which corresponds to the phe-
nomena of pressure. It would be useless for the purposes we have in
view to discuss mechanical energy at great length. It is more impor-
tant to show briefly that the various known forms of energy may be
transformed, the one into the other. These forms are heat, electrical,
magnetic, chemical, and radient energies.

It is taught nowadays in all elementary treatises on physics that
mechanical work may be transformed into heat and reciprocally heat into
mechanical work. Friction, collision and percussion, compression and
expansion, destroy or annihilate the mechanical energy communicated
to a body or to the parts of a machine. At the same time that the
motion. disappears heat appears. Examples are abundant. There is
the box of the wheel heated by the friction of the spindle; the ignition
of particles of steel broken off in breaking the stone; the melting of
two pieces of ice by Davy by rubbing them together, although sur-
rounded by objects below the freezing point; the boiling of water by
drilling, as observed by Rumford in the boring of bronze cannon in 1790;
the ignition of particles of metal in beating upon the anvil; the rise of
temperature even to the point of fusion in lead balls fired against a
resisting obstacle, and, finally, the origin of fire in the fable of Prome-
theus by means of rubbing pieces of wood together in the way still
called by the Hindoos pra mantha. There is a constant correlation
between the phenomena of heat and motion, a correlation which has
become so well known that observers have ceased to verify it by indi-
vidual cases. There is no destruction in the true sense of the word.
That which is lost in one form reappears under another, giving the
impression of something indestructible, which manifests itself in suc-
cessive disguises. This impression is translated into words in saying
that mechanical energy is metamorphosed into thermal energy.

This interpretation takes on a character of startling precision when
these mutations are examined with the almost absolute accuracy of
physical measurement. It is then shown that the rate of the exchange
iS invariable. The transformations of heat into motion and vice versa
are accomplished in accordance with a vigorous numerical law, which
fixes the quantity of energy of the one kind transformed into the other.
The mechanical effect is evaluated, as we have said, in work; that is, in
kilogram-meters. Heat is measured in calories, the calorie being the
522 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

amount of heat required to raise the temperature 1 degree of a kilogram
of water (large calorie) or 1 gram of water (small calorie). It has been
shown that whatever be the phenomena which serve in an intermediary
manner to accomplish the transformation, it always requires 425 kilo-
gram-meters to create 1 calorie, or 0.00234 calorie to create 1 kilogram-
meter. The number 425 is the mechanical equivalent of the calorie, or,
aS it is inaccurately said, of heat. This fact constitutes the principle
of the equivalence of heat and mechanical work.

Chemical activity has not as yet been measured directly. But it has
been shown that chemical activity can engender all the other kinds of
energy. It is, indeed, the commonest source of them all, and is prin-
cipally utilized to obtain heat, electricity, and mechanical energy. In
the steam engine, for example, the power is derived from the com-
bustion of carbon by oxygen of the air, which produces the heat
required to vaporize the water, develop the force of vapor, and finally
to drive the piston. The theory of the steam engine may be reduced
to two propositions: Chemical activity engenders heat, heat engenders
motion. Or to employ language to which no doubt the reader is accus-
tomed, chemical energy is transformed into heat energy, and the latter
into mechanical energy. The transformations are all governed by fixed
numerical rules.

Our knowledge of chemical energy is less advanced than that of heat
and mechanical motion. There have been as yet no applications to its
transformations of processes of measurement suitable for direct numer-
ical verification. It can only be affirmed, not quantitatively demon-
strated, that chemical and heat energies are equivalent, for in the pres-
ent state of science it is impossible to measure chemical energy. The
known forms of energy may be expressed as the product of two factors.
Thus mechanical energy of motion is measured by the product of the
mass by the velocity; heat energy by the product of the temperature
and the specific heat; electrical energy by the product of the quantity
of electricity by the electro-motive force. As regards chemical energy,
it is Suspected that it may be directly measured according to the sys-
tem of Berthollet as revised by the Norwegian chemists, Guldberg and
Waage, by the product of the mass by a force or coefficient of affinity,
which depends on the nature of the substance taken, the temperature,
and other physical conditions of the reaction. In another direction
the admirable researches of M. Berthelot have enabled us to make an
indirect evaluation in a majority of cases through the heat equivalent
of reactions. .

It is interesting to note that chemical energy also appears on the
face of things to have two states, of potential and real energy. The
union of carbon and oxygen in their combustion in the furnace of a
steam engine must first be started by a preliminary lighting, just as a
weight raised and left stationary at a certain height must be detached
from its support by a small expenditure of work. This condition of
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 523

energy is much in evidence. We shall admit the existence of a latent
state, or state of potential chemical energy. In the example just given,
the carbon under the preliminary excitation combines with oxygen and
forms carbonic acid gas. The potential energy becomes actual energy
and immediately is transformed into heat. A very incomplete and
fragmentary conception of the matter would be formed if the
phenomenon of combustion solely were regarded and it was neglected
to inquire after the source of the energy thus dissipated. The ante-
cedent fact is the action of the sun upon growing vegetation. The
carbon which burns in the furnace of the engine comes from a mine
where it was accumulated. in the state of coal, a primitive vegetable
product which was formed indirectly from the carbonic acid of the air.
By the aid of the solar energy the plant had separated the carbon
from the oxygen to which it was united in the carbonic acid of the
atmosphere and had created potential chemical energy, which through
the lapse of ages awaited its utilization. Combustion dissipated this
energy in re-forming carbonic acid.

The fecundity of the conception of energy is seen from these examples
to lie in the connection which it establishes between the phenomena of
nature, and that it thus reestablishes a proper articulation, necessarily
broken in the ancient analytical view of the sciences. We are led to
see in the phenomena of the world nothing but the mutations of energy.
In these mutations themselves we see the circulation of an indestructible
agent, which passes from one form to another as if it but changed into
disguise. If our intellects required images or symbols to embrace the
facts and seize upon their import they are at hand. They materialize
energy, making of it a sort of imaginary being and conferring upon it
a real objectivity. It then becomes for the mind, on condition that the
latter does not become the dupe of a phantom itself has raised, an
artifice eminently comprehensive, and capable of rendering the greatest
assistance in grasping the relation and affiliation of phenomena.

The world then appears, as we said at the beginning, to be con-
structed with singular symmetry. It offers us nothing but mutations
of matter and mutations of energy. These two kinds of metamorphoses
are governed by two laws similar and necessary, the conservation of
matter and the conservation of energy, which these maintain, the first,
that matter is indestructible and passes from one phenomena to another
in integrity and equality of weight; the second, that energy is inde-
structible, and that it passes from one phenomena to the other in rigid
equivalence numerically determined by the researches of physicists.

The first problem of energetics is to examine the different forms of
energy, to consider them in their relation to each other, to determine
if their mutual transformations can be directly realized, and if so to
follow this means to determine their quantitative equivalence. This is
a laborious task, which extends over the whole field of physics.

Such an examination suffices to show that mechanical energy may be
524 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

transformed into all the other forms and all the other forms into it,
with one exception, that of chemical energy. Our knowledge of the
role of pressure in dissociation reactions seems at first to abolish this
restriction. But this appearance is deceptive. The pressure does not
enter into this operation except as a preliminary condition or incentive,
merely putting the bodies in such a state relative to each other that
chemical affinity can come into play.

In connection with the calorific and luminous forms of radiant energy
it should be noted that they are not as distinct as was believed by
the older physicists. To consider the matter objectively, there is no
light without heat. It is the same agent which at a certain interval in
its scale differently impresses the skin and the retina of men and ani-
mals. The difference in sensation is to be imputed to the diversity of
the organ, not to the diversity of the agent. At lesser degrees of
activity this agent exercises no effect either on the terminations of the
thermal nerves of the skin or on the retina. As its degree of activity
augments (infra-red heating) the thermal nerves are first impressed,
and quite to the exclusion of the nerves of vision. Next both are
impressed (sensation of light), and finally the sight only is affected.
The transformation of energy therefore reduces itself in this case to
the possibility of intensifying or diminishing the action of the common
agent to such conditions as suit the passage from one state to another,
and this may easily be brought about.

It may be remarked that this form of energy of which we have been
speaking can not be transformed directly into chemical energy. ‘To be
sure, radiant energy favors and determines many chemical reactions,
but if we go down into the root of the thing we must admit that the
radiation serves only to incite the phenomena, to prepare for the
chemical reaction, to put the bodies into such a state (liquid, perhaps,
or vapor) or temperature (400 for instance in the combination of oxygen
and hydrogen) as suits the entrance upon the scene of chemical affinity.
On the contrary, chemical energy may be transformed into heat and
radiant energy, as could be illustrated by numerous examples in which
no other forms of energy are present, and by others where, as in the
combustion of hydrogen and carbon, or in explosive decompositions,
reactions continue of themselves when once initiated.

Other restrictions appear in studying the laws which govern the
transformations and transference of heat energy, the most important
of which maintains the impossibility of heat transfer from a body at a
lower to a body at a higher temperature. As the result of all these
restrictions heat is an imperfect form of the universal energy, or, as it
is expressed by the English, a degraded form.

On the other hand, electrical energy represents a perfect and highly
advantageous form of this universal energy, and this explains the
immense development which has taken place in its industrial applica-
tion within less than a century. Not that it is better known than the
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 525

others in its essence and in the last analysis of its actions; quite the
contrary! Its nature is still discussed. Some, in consideration of its
immense velocity of transmission and its similarity to light, have con-
sidered it to be a veritable flow of the ether, like Father Secchi, who
assimilated it with the flow of water in a conduit. According to this
view, electrical work is comparable with that done by water pressure
in the hydraulic motor. Thus, eléctricity itself would not be a form of
energy, but only a vehicle for energy. However, most physicists follow
the view of Clausius and more recently of Hertz, who held that it is not
energy itself which is thus propagated, but a vibratory motion. Be
that as it may, the most characteristic property of electrical energy and
that which renders it of the greatest value is its extraordinary capac-
ity for transformation. AlIl other known forms of energy may be con-
verted into electrical energy and conversely with the greatest facility.
This extreme docility assigns to electricity the role of intermediary in
the transformation of the other less tractable agents. Mechanical
energy, for example, is not readily transformed into radiant energy.
A fall of water can not be directly utilized for lighting purposes, but
in the installation of industrial lighting plants; the water power is first
caused to drive a dynamo, which then feeds the incandescent or are
lights. Otherwise unavailable mechanical work is constantly being
turned into electrical energy, and the latter into heat and light. Elec-
tricity has taken up the post of an intermediary agent.

And now if we wish to develop the programme of the science of
energy it is necessary to indicate the second great principle, that which
according to Robert Mayer controls all its transformations, the princi-
ple of Carnot. Next it should be shown by some numerical example,
some concrete illustration, how contemporary science has taken account
of the nature and the transformations of energy. [Following this the
kinetic theory should be expounded. The universe of matter according
to this theory is conceived as animated by two kinds of motions, the
visible and the molecular. An historical treatment should be followed
of the manner in which this hypothesis was introduced in physical
science owing to the necessity of taking account of the phenomena of
the propagation of light; how it was formed in the study of heat; how
made precise, thanks to Clausius and Maxwell, in the case of gases,
and how, finally, it has been extended to the manifestations of elec-
tricity and magnetism. We can not undertake this task here for two
reasons. The first is that the kinetic theory, which has scarcely yet,
through infinite pains, arrived at its full elaboration, already shows
signs of decadence and ruin. Physical theorists of one school already
express doubt of the existence of the ether, the medium necessary for
the propagation of the radiant energy, and they deny that electricity
is a mode of motion or even that heat and dight are such. ‘They deign
to erect nothing upon the ruins of this theory, which has become so
firmly rooted upon the contemporary mind that it is in some sort a part

of the ambient mentality. To a generation reared in admiration and
respect of the efforts of genius which have compassed the creation
of this system, they propose contempt for all its images, the symbols
or the material representations of scientific truth. They offer us, to
explain the natural phenomena, systems of three or six differential
equations, which to them contain no hypotheses. Whether the future
will sustain or condemn them we are not competent to prophesy. But
the main reason which deters us from the task, doubtless beyond our
powers of tracing the kinetic hypothesis, is that it is not essential for
our purpose. We merely propose to show in what follows how the
consideration of energy and of its first fundamental principle, that of
its conservation, have transformed the point of view of physiology on
three great questions, the conception of the vital phenomena in their
relation to the general phenomena of nature, the theory of alimenta-
tion, and finally the origin of muscular force.

IIl.—THE ENERGY OF LIFE.!
Te

Despite the efforts of a small number of experimenters from Harvey to
Magendie, the science of life has been outstripped in the progress of the
other natural sciences. Itremained along time embalmed in scholastics
and incumbered by such systems as animism and vitalism, according to
which vital phenomena were governed by a principle distinct from the
physical forces, and thus their difference from other natural phenomena
was accentuated.

These systems were dominant in the schools of the time of Lavoisier,
and still acted as a check on the experimental method in the time of
Claude Bernard. They have scarcely disappeared entirely even in our
day. In 1878 an eminent physician, who occupied one of the highest
positions of instruction, EK. Chauffard, attempted to restore the animism
of Stahl. Still more recently we have seen discoveries of two foreign
scientists of legitimate reputation, Heidenhain, of Breslau, and Ch.
Bohr of Copenhagen, serving to resuscitate the name ‘‘neo-vitalism,” a
doctrine much preached by those who in the last century supported
Bordeu and Barthez. The contemporaneous neo-vitalism borrowed
from its forerunner its fundamental principle, the unique character, not
only in form but in essence, of vitality, and its absolute irreducibility to
anything physical. ‘To be sure this was coupled in the ancient vitalism
with another notion which the progress of ideas did not permit to be
revived in our time. It considered physiological phenomena to be the
immediate effect of a special cause, an agent of some sort personified,

THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 527

the vital principle exterior to the living being, independent of its sub-

stance, bonded to it temporarily, working, it might be said, with human
hands, and accomplishing the deeds and actions of life, and at last
quitting the body which had served as its hostelry, not perhaps under
the form of a butterfly, the graceful genius of the Greeks, but in a man-
ner equally real if less visible. The vitalists of the middle ages, like
Paracelsus and Van Helmont, had divided up this principle of life into
subordinate principles, and multiplied these personifications under the
name of arches. Some trace of them may be discovered in the vital
properties of Bichat and others of the moderns, phantoms which Cl.
Bernard loved to compare to the nymphs, dryads, and sylvans of
mythology.

In the face of physicians and philosophers who explained the phe-
nomena of life as the liberated activity of a vital principle, distinct or
not from the thinking soul, arose an adverse system, the mechanical.
The scientific spirit has evinced in all epochs a lively predilection for
this doctrine, and in our day it has finished by adopting it and con-
founding the other. A single order of things now embraces life and
the physical phenomena, for all the phenomena of the universe reduce
to an identical mechanism, and are represented by the atoms and their
motion. This conception of the world which the philosophers of the
Ionic school had originated in remote antiquity, and which Descartes
and Leibnitz later had modified, has come down to us under the name
of the kinetic theory. The mechanism of atoms, ponderable or impon-
derable, contains the explanation of all phenomena. Physical properties |
and the manifestations of life, the whole world even, offers nothing in the
last analysis but motion. AJ] phenomena are expressed by an atomic
integral, and in this we find the majestic unity which dominates modern
physies. The forces of life can not be distinguished in their ultimate
examination from other natural forces; all are confounded in molecular
mechanics.

Without arguing the philosophical value of this doctrine, which
indeed has justified its sway over physical sciences by the discoveries
to which it has given rise, it may be observed that if has been of small
aid in biology. It is precisely because it descends too profoundly to
the root of the thing and that itis analytic to the last degree that it
ceases to explain. The step is too far from the hypothetical atom to
the apparent and concrete facts for the former to assist in accounting
for the latter. The tangible vital phenomena lose their proper appear-
ance, and can no longer be recognized in their traits, either specific or
universal,

On the other hand, the theory of energy conduces to a conception
quite as general, but at the same time more sure, more comprehensive,
and sufficiently near the reality to be translated into facts, and contin-
ually to acquire new vigor. Its introduction in biology dates but from
yesterday as it were, but it has already taken a considerable place and
528 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

rendered valuable service. It has inspired researches replete with
interest, and has renovated the appearance of certain branches of
physiology.

It begins to have a place in the courses of higher instruction in the
universities of Germany, America, and France. M. Chauveau is the
foremost exponent of these new tendencies among us; his works and
those of his students form the most important contribution (of our time)
to the constitution of physiological energetics.

II.

The doctrine of energy was first conceived in physiology before it
was taken up in the department of physics with such extraordinary
acceptation. Robert Mayer was a naturalist and a physician. Helm-
holtz was a physiologist before he became a physicist. Both saw in
the new idea a powerful instrument for physiological investigation.
The publication in which Mayer set forth in 1845 his remarkable views
on the movements of organisms in their relation to nutrition and the
commentary of Helmholtz dispel all doubt in respect to their positions
in this regard. The ‘Remarks upon the mechanical equivalent of
heat” were published about six years after this first work.

The doctrine of energy is in our day but returning to the science
which was its cradle. It returns, sanctioned by the demonstrations
of physics, as the most general doctrine which has ever been proposed
in natural philosophy, and is the one least weighted by hypotheses.
It reduces to two fundamental principles the multitude of minor prin-
ciples and the smaller number previously recognized as general which
had dominated the sciences of nature. It can be shown without great
difficulty that the principle of Robert Mayer, suitably extended, con-
tains the principle of the inertia of matter stated by Galileo and
Descartes; that of the quality of action and reaction ascribed to New-
ton; even that of the conservation of matter (or rather of mass) due to
Lavoisier, and finally the experimental law of equivalence which is
associated with the name of the distinguished English physicist Joule
and from which is derived the principle of Hess, and the principle of
“initial and final states” of Berthelot.

Similarly Carnot’s principle, as extended in a large and comprehen-
sive fashion by contemporary theorists, such as William Thomson (Lord
Kelvin), Le Chatelier, and others, may be considered as the universal
law of mechanical, physical, and chemical equilibrium. It ineludes, as
G. Robin has shown, d’Alembert’s principle of virtual velocities, and,
according to some physicists, the special laws of chemical and physico-
chemical equilibrium.

These two principles, then, contain the essence of all natural sciences.
Since the true significance of these laws is to express the necessary
relations of all the phenomena of the universe, they impart a real
homogeneity to apparent diversity, and hence they may be made to
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 529

follow from the ‘“‘idea of continuity” of nature as opposed to ‘‘ physical
discontinuity.” The unity in the world, the diversity in the spirit, is
the fundamental doctrine of E. Kant. Thus the natural philosophy of
our tine is personified in the names of Kant, R. Mayer, and Carnot.
It would be derogatory to doctrines so universal and so thoroughly
verified in the physical world should they be confined here and remain
without value in the science of life. Such a supposition would be con-
trary to that spirit of generalization which is essentially the scientific
spirit, and which consists in a belief in the existence, the constancy,
and the extension of elementary laws.

Scientists have always proceeded in one way under such cireum-
stances. They have applied the most general laws of contemporary
physics to the phenomena of life, a procedure which has been found
legitimate and productive of results abundantly verified by experi-
mental data when applied to really fundamental laws, but most unfor-
-tunate and attended with a still more gross materialism when falsely
carried on. For Descartes, the body was a machine functionally sup-
plied according to the laws of natural philosophy; but he carried this
view too far in descending to particulars, and considering the body
solely as a combination of springs, levers, presses, sieves, pipes, retorts,
and alembics. Liebnitz, on the other hand, was clearly within reason-
ble bounds when he said ‘“‘The body develops itself mechanically, and
the laws of mechanics are never violated in the natural movements.”
Claude Bernard was also reasonable in applying the general principles
of Galileo on the inertia of matter to living beings when he affirmed
that the apparent spontaneity of vital actions was only an appearance
and illusion; that the vital phenomena were always adequately caused ;
that they were the response to an exterior stimulation and the result
of conflict between living matter and the physical and chemical agents
which are incentive to the action, but which are always foreign to it,
even though contained within the boundaries of the organism.

Thus in applying to life the general laws of energetics we follow in
the path of science and conform to the traditional method. It can not
be doubted that such application is legitimate and that experiment
will justify the application a posteriori. Such, indeed, has been the
outcome. -

The living, like the inanimate world, offers us then nothing but muta-
tions of matter and energy. The varied manifestations of activity in
the living being, corresponding te transformations of the species and
varieties of energy, conform to the rules of equivalence determined by
physicists. In the physical world the specific forms of energy are less
numerous. When we have enumerated mechanical, chemical, radiant,
thermal, luminous, and electrical energy (the latter with its attendant
magnetic energy) we have exhausted the list of actors which occupy
the scene in the material world, at least so far as we know.

Can we, then, say that the lists are closed and that science will never

SM 98——34
530 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

discover other forms and specific varieties of energy? Notatall. Such
an affirmation would be at once as ambitious as imprudent. The his-
tory of the physical sciences ought to render us more circumspect. It
teaches us that little more than a century has passed since electrical
energy has made its entrance upon the scene, and we have commenced
to know this form of energy. Such a discovery as this, right under our
eyes, of an agent playing such an important part in nature should leave
the door open in the future for other surprises.

This reservation is of great importance from the point of view of the
arrangement of the phenomena of life in the universal science of ener-
getics. It allows us to admit that in addition to those forms of energy
which are common in the physical world, other varieties may be met
with in the living organism such as are peculiar to it. These are still
too little known to be sought out elsewhere; but doubtless they exist
also in the physical world, and will come to light when our means of
investigation shall have become sufficiently advanced. At present we
must admit their possibility to account for the peculiarity of some of
the phenomena of life which are quite special and different from those
of physics. With this precaution we recognize at once wherein the
vital phenomena reduce themselves to the domain of universal physics,
and wherein a provisional separation still remains. We thus escape
the charge of gross materialism incurred by Descartes and Boerhave,
those uncompromising scientists who thought to discover in the actual
instruments of our laboratories the model of all mechanisms, even the
most complex, of animal life; a proposition as vain as it would have
been for an iatro-mechanician to have tried to explain before the time
of Lavoisier the elementary phenomena of respiration or the phenom-
ena of the excitation of the nerves before Volta.

But on the other hand we must recognize the profound truth lying
behind this extreme and unfertunate realism, which, acting through an
obscure and common instinct, has constrained the biologists of all
times to attempt to bring the phenomena of life under the empire of
general physics.

We now know with certainty that many forms of energy are common
to the living and physical worlds, and these energies—chemical, ther-
mal, and mechanical—retain their character of mutability, their scale
of equivalence, and their states of being, actuai and potential.

If it shall happen again, as it happened in the last century in regard
to electricity, that some unrecognized form of energy is suggested by
physiological researches, we can affirm in all confidence that this new
energy will obey no new laws. It will be governed in its transforma-
tion into the known forms by the rules already determined; it will
appertain to the universal order as well as to life, and it will be a con-
quest for general physics as well as for biology. It can easily be —
understood after these explanations of the significance and portent of
that affirmation, which is the foundation of biological energetics, that
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 531

the phenomena of life are energetic metamorphoses in the same sense
as the phenomena of nature.

The science which has been christened the “energetics of biology”
isnot new. It is none other than the general physiology to which no
one in any country has contributed more for its foundation and enrich-
ment than Claude Bernard. It must be recognized, however, that
R. Mayer and Helmholtz have more distinctively characterized and
limited the field in defining it as ‘“‘the study of the phenomena of life
from the standpoint of energy.”

A school of experimental zoologists, arisen within the last few years
in Germany, has attempted to monopolize and distort general physi-
ology by designating it simply as the study of cellular life. They have
affected to believe that physiology from the time of Galen down has
had no interest except in the working of the organs, aud they oppose to
this “physiology of organs” their ‘physiology of cells.” A qualified
scientist, J. Loeb, scarcely does justice to these pretensions. He shows
that “cellular structure” is in most cases a matter as completely of
indifference as the “structure of organs” in the action of vital forces;
and that it is necessary to banish this morphological notion of the phy-
sics of living matter as being nothing more to general physiology than
the physics of inanimate bodies. The determination of the vital energy
of plants and animals, the direct transformation of chemical energy of
nutrition into animal heat or into muscular energy, the chemical evolu-
tion of the aliment, and the study of the soluble ferments—these are
the things which in his view are likely to increase our knowledge of the
mechanism of life. It is these things which are most advanced by the
study of biological energetics.

III.

The equivalence or identity of the energies developed in the animal
with the universal forms of energy in nature has furnished the point
of departure for this doctrine. Two other principles go with this to
lay the foundation, to wit: That vital energy has its origin in some
form of external energy, and not in all the forms as might be supposed
—but in one of them exclusively, chemical energy. This energy is
finally converted and issues forth in a few other well-determined forms.

This is the importation, more precisely expressed in terms of energy,
of an idea similar to the vital vortex of Cuvier and the naturalists
in the order of matter. This idea of Cuvier defines life by its most
constant property, nutrition; that is, by the existence of a current of
matter which the organism gathers from without by alimentation,
rejects by excretion; a current the complete interruption of which
even for a moment would be the signal of death. The circulation of
energy is the exact counterpart of this conception of the circulation of
matter.

The second principle drawn from experience and made use of by
532 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

general physiology may be thus enunciated: The maintenance of life
consumes no energy peculiar to and originating with the living being.
It borrows from the external world in the form of chemical potential
all that it requires. Such is a translation into the language of ener-
getics of results acquired in animal physiology within the last fifty
years. It is unnecessary for the commentator to emphasize the impor-
tance of such a principle; for it reveals the origin of animal activity—
the source from which proceeds the energy which at one point in its —
transformation becomes the vital energy.

The primum movens of vital activity is then, according to these
principles, the chemical energy stored up in the material composing
the organism. ;

To attempt to follow out the movement it is necessary to be precise.
Let us suppose our attention concentrated upon a limited portion of
the organism—a certain tissue. We will come upon it in the uninter-
rupted course of its life at the given moment, and from this time on
examine its functions. The first effect we notice will be the liberation
of a portion of the potential energy lying concealed in the materials
put in reserve in the tissues. This disengaged material furnishes the
energy required for the continuance of the vital function of the tissues.
There is, then, at the beginning of its functional process, and as a neces-
sary part of this process, a liberation of chemical energy which can not
be brought about except by a decomposition of the immediate con-
stituents of the tissues or, following a customary expression, by the
destruction of organic material. Claude Bernard has stringently insisted
upon this consideration that vital activity is accompanied by a destruc-
tion of organic material. ‘‘When a movement takes place or a muscle
contracts, when the will or the emotions are excited, or the brain exer-
cised, or when the glands secrete, the substance of the muscles, the
nerves, the brain, or the granular tissue is decomposed, destroyed, and
consumed.” The real reason of this coincidence between chemical
decomposition and functional activity, of which Claude Bernard had
an intuition, has been made clear to us by energetics. A portion of the
organic material being decomposed descends in the scale of chemical
complexity, and in so doing gives up its chemical potential energy.
In this store of energy lies the means for vital activity.

It is obvious that the store of reserve energy thus drawn upon must
‘be replenished if the organism is to preserve its equilibrium. Alimen-
tation provides for this by furnishing the materials. The action of the
digestive apparatus prepares them for assimilation; that is, it reduces
them to a convenient form to be incorporated in the reserve. This
replenishing of the reserves is not a chemical synthesis; it is, as Claude
Bernard has termed it, “synthesis of the organism.” ‘The synthesis
of the organism,” he says ‘remains hidden silent within, assembling
noiselessly the materials which it dispenses.”

This great physiologist divided the phenomena of animal life into
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 533

two categories. The first contains the destruction of reserves which
accompanies functional activity; that is, increased expenditure of
energy. The second contains the plastic phenomena of the replen
ishing of the reserves; in other words, organic reorganization, which
corresponds to functional repose, and is associated with decreased
expenditure and rehabilitation of energy.

If these are not the exact terms employed by Cl. Bernard in formu-
lating his fertile conception, they are those in which his followers have
interpreted his thoughts. They have added nothing except precision
to his idea. Applying more rigorously than the eminent physiologist,
the distinction which he had created between really active living pro-
toplasms and the reserves which these prepare, they recognize that it
was necessary to attribute solely to these latter the functions which
Bernard deemed to distribute between them.

All that Cl. Bernard held is rigorously true of the reserves. It is
easy in these days to criticise the inexactness of expression in which
he stated his ideas. The old adage: Obscuritate rerum verba obseu-
rantur, may be his apology. In the darkness of night he had the light
of genius. Doubtless he did not find the most definite and polished
expression of his thought, but there is no reason for a grammatical
quarrel.

If then, there is incontestably a destruction of reserves when vital
activity takes place, what happens to the active living matter? Is it
the same with it, or does it follow a different course? We do not
know. Le Dantec affirms that the living matter is increased rather

_ than destroyed. He gives to this assertion the title of the ‘Law of

functional assimilation,” and draws very important conclusions from
it. But in reality there is not one of the arguments which he draws to
its support which is conclusive. The objections are no more decisive.

- It is alike vain to attempt in the present state of science either to es-

tablish or disprove this proposition by experiment or argument. The

cause of this indeterminateness lies in the great number of unknown

quantities which enter into the solution of the problem. It is sufficient
to enumerate them: the two substances existing in the anatomic
element to which we ascribe opposite characteristics; the two condi-
tions which are attributed to them of latent and actual activity; the
faculty of either of these to exist for an indefinite time and to encroach
upon its protagonist when the other has ceased to be. Here are enough
unknown elements to vitiate all the results positive or negative which
may be obtained. The proposition, then, can not be demonstrated, but
may be accepted without too close examination, like the pills of which
Hobbs speaks, which must be taken without chewing.

Energetics leaves this question undecided but inclines nevertheless
tothe affirmative. The functional assimilation of the protoplasm is not,
like the organization of the reserves, a phenomenon approximately
without influence on the balance of energy. There is here the consti-
534 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

tution of a substance, the active protoplasm, which attains a higher
degree of complexity, and whose formation consequently requires an
appreciable quantity of energy. Assimilation, in order to be realized,
requires the absorption of energy. Now at this same moment the
destruction or simplification of the reserve, in consequence of activity,
liberates energy which might be applied to this very purpose. If the
protoplasm does in reality make use of it its role would be the coun-
terpart of that of the reserves. But if it is uncertain whether the
active protoplasm behaves according to the view of Le Dantee, it is
certain that the reserves follow the law of Claude Bernard, and the
essential part in the energetic changes belongs to them.

IV.

The third principle of the energetics of biology is similarly the result
of experiment. It relates not only to the point of departure in the
eycle of animal energy but to its terms.

It is here that the greatest novelty of the doctrine lies, and here we
may Say that it is less understood by physiologists themselves. Energy
derived from the chemical potential of the aliment, after having trav-
ersed the organisms (or simply the organ which is considered to be in
action), and having given rise to more or less diversified phenomena
comprising the manifestations proper to, or in some cases still irreduci-
ble to, vitality, finally returns to the physical world. This return is
made (with some well-known exceptions) under the ultimate form of
thermal energy.

The truly vital phenomena are therefore to be classed between the
chemical energy which gives birth to them, and the thermal phenomena
which they engender in their turn. The place of vital activity in the
cycle of universal energy is thus perfectly determined. This is a con-
clusion of the first importance for biology. We can express this
deduction in concise language as follows: Vital energy is ultimately
the transformation of chemical energy into heat.

This assertion requires the condition that the animal contents himself
with merely living without performing external work.

The founders of animal energetics, and especially M. Chauvean, have
attempted to give more precision to this very vague conception, vital
energy. The same is true of it as of the ordinary physical forms of
energy. We know how to measure it without knowing what it is.

Vital energy is that which accompanies the phenomena of the tissues,
and not actually identifiable with the known types of physical, chem-
ical, and mechanical energies. These actions are usually silent and
invisible of themselves, and only to be recognized by their effects after
the transformation into the familiar forms of energy. Vital energy is
that which acts, for instance, in the muscle prepared for contraction, in
the nerve which conducts the nervous impulse, and in the glands during
secretion. What we call here provisionally the vital property, the
THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD. 539

energy peculiar to vitality, or the living energy, M. Chauveau calls
physiological work. This we here consider as exchangeable from the
point of view of equivalence with the energies of physics, just as these
are among themselves. This is the significance of the first law of
energetics.

Knergetics teaches us that if chemical energy is the generating form
productive of vital energy, heat energy is the form of ejection, or emune-
tory form, which is spoken of as degraded by physicists. Heat is, in
the dynamical order, of the same category as urea, carbonic acid and
water, the excreta in the material order. It is, therefore, entirely
through a false interpretation of the principle of the mechanical equiva-
lence of heat, or in ignorance of Carnot’s principle, that some physiolo-
gists still speak of the transformation of heat into motion, or into
electricity, in the animal organism. Heat transforms itself into nothing
in the animal organism; it is only dissipated. Its utility comes, not
from its energetic value, but from its function in promoting chemical
reactions, aS has already been explained in speaking of the general
characteristics of chemical energy.

The consequences of these clear and general principles of physiolog-
ical energetics are of the greatest importance from a practical as well
as from a theoretical point of view.

First, they show clearly the rank of the phenomena of life in the
universe. They are necessary to the understanding of that beautiful
harmony between the animal and vegetable kingdoms which Priestly,
Ingenhousz, Senebier and the chemical school of the beginning of the
century had disclosed, and which Dumas has described with such
incomparable clearness and success. Energetics expresses the thing
thus: The animal world employs the energy which the vegetable world
accumulates. Energetics goes beyond the bounds of life and to the

- midst of cosmos. It shows how the vegetable world itself draws its

activity from the radiant energy of the sun, and how the animal life
at last restores the heat thus dissipated. The harmony between these
two kingdoms extends throughout nature. It makes a closed. system of
the whole universe.

From amore restricted point of view, and considering only the domain
of animal physiology, the laws of energetics embrace the function and
general principles of alimentation. The aliment is esse:tially a source
of energy, and only in an accessory way a source of heat. Precisely
the contrary is usually taught in our medical colleges; and this error,
though perhaps of no importance from the point of view of practice,
is, on the other hand, highly important as a matter of doctrine. The
energy which the aliment brings to the animal is the potential chemical
energy which it possesses by virtue of its chemical complexity. It is
this requirement of substances far up in the scale of chemical complexity
which links the animal to the vegetable, the latter being alone capable
of producing these syntheses. The animal activity liberates a part of
536 THE THEORY OF ENERGY AND THE LIVING WORLD.

the potential energy which the plant has formed. Chemistry enables
us to compute the quantity of energy which an aliment thus disengages.
It applies Berthelot’s principle of the initial and final state; and by
utilizing the numerical tables established by this eminent chemist with
such admirable patience, we obtain in calories the quantity of energy
which the aliment furnishes to the organism. Thus we know its dyna-
mogenic or thermal power.

This energy, whose exact amount is now known for each category of
aliments, is made use of in accordance with the third principle. It is to
be transformed following two possible types. Jn the normal type it is
transformed first into vital energy (the physiological work of Chauvean)
and subsequently either into mechanical work (the movement of the
muscles) or into thermal energy (heat which is dissipated externally).
In this normal case the aliinent has wholly accomplished its office, since
it has served to sustain the vital functions. It has been dynamogenic,
or bio-thermogenic.

On the other hand, we have the possibility of the abnormal or aber-
rant type. It may happen that, in virtue of its chemical nature, and
for reasons just beginning to be understood, the aliment in its decom-
position liberates energy which the organism is unable to make use of,
and which in consequence is not transformed into vital energy or any
kind of physiological activity, but passes directly into the thermal
state. A category of such aliments might be mentioned, or rather a
list of substances of this nature, for they scarcely merit the name ali-
ment. Alcohol and the acids which exist in fruits, such as malic, and
citric acids fall in this type. They may be called pure thermogens.
Some physiologists—and their error has its origin in the common habit
of prejudgment—still imagine that alcohol is a generator of force, dan-
gerous, to be sure, on account of its abuse, but still a source of energy
aS much as sugar or fat, and thus capable of furnishing part of the-
energy necessary to the execution of difficult tasks. This is errone-
ous. To be sure, alcohol decomposes or is consumed in the organism,
and produces heat, but that only serves to be uselessly dissipated. The
heat produced within the body is no more efficacious than that which
comes from the heat of the climate or of our fires. The pure ther-
mogens are then exclusively employed in producing internal heating.
Aliments such as we have discussed under the name of bio-thermogens
are equally as much as these a source of internal heating, but also par-
ticipate in the vital functions.

In saying that the cycle of energy which runs its course in the ani-
mal organism takes its departure in the chemical disintegration of the
aliment, physiologists employ a formula too general and not sufficiently
approximate to the truth. Hence there have arisen confusion, misun-
derstandings, and controversies, which revive continually and give to
this branch of physiology an appearance of being in an unsettled and
disordered condition, which ought not to exist. It is not the vital
activity in its generality which should be considered when one wishes
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. _ 537

to treat of the facts and applications, but a single functional act in
particular. It is then seen that the source of energy which this act
puts in play is found in the substance of the organ and in the active
tissue, and not in the aliment in the condition in which the animal
imports it from without. In other words, it is not the aliment in the
rough which is the source of energy, but the aliment digested, modi-
fied, elaborated, and incorporated as an integral part of the tissue
which employs it; in short, in the state of reserve. All the principles
of physiological energetics of which we have spoken apply to the ali-
ment as refined, and in this state only; that is, as a part of the reserves.
Are they also applicable to the aliment in the strict sense of the word?
Only in another fashion. Between the substance of the aliment and
the substance of the reserves there are differences resulting from the
various processes which have been employed from the time when the
aliment was originally introduced into the organism to that vhen it
becomes assimilated in its proper place. These preparations may be
very numerous, and they are in most cases still unknown. It\s gener-
ally admitted, however, that they are such as to use up so littl, energy
that its quantity may safely be neglected. The supposition is warranted
in certain cases, but, on the other hand, it is erroneous in a greater num-
ber. M.Chauveau has very clearly exposed this error of the theorists
on alimentation. He has been able to determine the amount of energy
so used in certain processes, by means of very ingenious experiments.

But this is not the place to discuss this matter. Nor shall we examine
the new and very interesting controversy on physiological dietetics.
We must restrict ourselves to incidentally indicating the most general
relations of the theory of alimentation with the subjects of our present
inquiry, which is to illustrate the fundamental principles of the ener-

-getices of living beings.

Ill.—THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

What is an aliment, and in what does alimentation consist? This is
a question which no one takes the trouble to answer—at least if he bea
physician, a physiologist, or a zoologist. A Frenchman who knows his
language will reply, like the dictionary, that “the term aliment is
applied to all those substances, of whatever nature, that habitually serve
or are able to serve the purposes of nutrition.” The thing is easy to
understand; it is anything used by a decent man to nourish himself.
If you want to know more, ask the cook.

That would be one solution; but there are many others. The prob-
lem of alimentation presents a thousand aspects. It is culinary and
gastronomic of course, but it is also economic and social, agricultural,
financial, hygienic, medical,and even moral. And first of all, and before
all, it is physiological. It is from this point of view that we shall dis-
cuss it here—solely and entirely that aspect which concerns the phe-
nomena of life.
538 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

It is needful to know the general composition of the aliment, and to
distinguish between substances which merit the name and those which
usurp it, in order to understand its function. We must follow its
various transformations, and fix the quantity of the ration of repose as
compared with that of the person when working actively. We must
determine the effects of inanition, of insufficient nourishment, and of
superabundant nourishment. In a word, we must examine the most
intimate and delicate reactions by which the organism exhausts itself
and repairs its wastes; and, to repeat the expression of a celebrated
physiologist we must inspect ‘the kitchen of vital phenomena.”
Neither Apicius, nor Brillat Savarin, nor Berchoux, nor the moralists,
nor the economists can serve as our guides. It will be necessary to
consult those scientists who, following the example of Lavoisier, Ber-
zelius, Regnauit, and Liebig, have applied the resources of general
science to the study of life and thus have founded the chemistry of
biology.

This branch of physiology has made very considerable progress
within the last half century, and now maintains separately its methods,
its technique, its chairs in universities, its laboratories, and its collec-
tions. Its special application is to the study of the ‘‘ material changes”
or metabolism of living beings. Two branches of this subject have
been studied: First, the composition of the materials going to make
up the organism has been determined, and second, qualitative and
quantitative analyses have been made of all the substances entering
or leaving it. This includes all that is absorbed through respiratory
and food channels on the one hand, and all excreta through the various
channels on the other. Thus the nutritive balance sheet has been made
out corresponding to various conditions of life both naturally and arti-
ficially reared. It can be said which items go to sustain and benefit,
which to exhaust and reduce, and which finally strike the balance.

We do not propose to give a detailed account of this scientific move-
ment, for that is a field for special treatises. We intend merely to
indicate here the most important results of these laborious researches,
including the general laws which have been built up and the theories
which have been sustained. This is as far as the subject belongs to
general science, and is of interest to the nonspecial reader. Matters
of detail have no lack of historians; it is far more profitable to show
the trend of ideas. The theories of alimentation present many concep-
tions of the operation of vital functions. There is so great a number
of conflicting opinions on this subject that it is not without interest to
attempt to clear it up.

Cl. Bernard remarked, in respect to life, that it is impossible to give

it a scientific definition. And this is true not only of life, but of nutri-
tion and in particular of the aliment. All the physiolegists and phy-
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 539

sicians who have attempted to define an aliment have failed. Most of
the definitions, both common and learned, have interposed the condi-
tion that the substance should be introduced through the digestive
apparatus. These definitions summarily exclude from the class of

beings sustained by alimentation all vegetables and animals not pro-

vided with an intestinal canal; and they leave out various substances
which enter the body through other channels than the stomach, which,
like the oxygen for example, participate to a large degree in the sus-
taining of life.

The distinctive feature of the aliment is the use that it may be, when
rightly employed, to the living creature. It is a substance necessary
to the maintenance of the phenomena of living organisms, and the
reparation of losses to which they are subjected, says Cl. Bernard—a
substance which carries an element essential to the constitution of the
organism or which diminishes its disintegration (conserving aliment),
according to the German physiologist Voit—a substance which con-
tributes to assure the good operation of any of the organs of a living
being, following the much too broad definition of Duclaux. All these
characterizations, however, give but an imperfect idea of it.

The introduction of the idea of energy into physiology has given a
better understanding of the true nature of the aliment. It is neces-
sary to recur to the doctrine of energetics to take into account all that
the organism requires it to furnish. The organism demands not only
matter but energy. The naturalists consider only the necessity of con-
tributing matter, and thus look upon the problem from only one point
of view. The living body presents in each of these directions an unin-
terrupted succession of tearing down and rebuilding, the materials for
which are furnished by alimentation and rejected by excretion. Cuvier
called this incessant passage of surrounding matter into and through
the vital world the ‘‘vital vortex,” and regarded it with reason as the
characteristic of nutrition, and the distinctive trait of life.

This idea of the circulation of matter has been completed in our own
time by that of the circulation of energy. All the phenomena of the
universe, and more especially those of life, are conceived as changes of
energy. They are now regarded in connection with their environment
rather than in isolation as formerly. Each has an antecedent and a
consequent whose magnitude is determined by a numerical law of
equivalence established by the contemporary physics. Thus the suc-
cession of events is conceived as the circulation of a sort of indestructi-
ble agent, which changes only in appearance or disguise in passing on,
but which suffers no loss; and this is energy.

The most general result of the study of physiological chemistry has
been to teach us that the antecedent of the vital phenomenon is always
chemical.| Vital energy originates in the potential chemical energy

540 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

accumulated in the material of which the organism is composed. The
phenomenon consequent to the expenditure of vital energy is usually
the production of heat. Vital energy is transformed into thermal
energy. These three propositions relating to the nature, origin, and
termination of the vital phenomena are the three fundamental princei-
ples, the three laws, of the energetics of biology.

The place of vital energy in the universal classification of energy is,
from what has been said, perfectly determined. It belongs between
chemical energy, from which it springs, and thermal energy, into which
it is resolved, and which is the “‘ degraded form” of energy, to use the
expression of physicists. From this follows a deduction of immediate
application in the theory of the aliment. Heat is an excretum of the
dynamic order from the living being, quite as much as urea, carbonic
acid, and water are excreta of the material order. It is therefore quite
incorrect to speak of the transformation of heat into vital energy in
the animal organism, although this expression is in common use. Nor
is it more proper to speak of the transformation of heat into muscular
motion, as was held by Béclard, or into animal electricity, as has been
maintained by other writers. These are errors of doctrine as well as of
fact. They imply a false interpretation of the principle of the mechan-
ical equivalence of heat, and the misunderstanding of Carnot’s principle.
Thermal energy does not ascend the energetic scale in the process of
vital phenomena. Heat never transforms itself; it is simply dissipated.

Is this the same as saying that heat is not essential to life? Far
from it, for it is most necessary. But the function of heat is a peculiar
one which should neither be misunderstood nor exaggerated. Itis not
transformed_by chemical or vital reactions, but merely helps to create
the proper conditions for such reactions.

According to the first principles of energetics, in order that vital
energy should be derived from thermal energy it is necessary for the
latter first to be converted into chemical energy, since that is the form
antecedent to and productive of vital energy. Now this retrograde
transformation is impossible according to the received doctrines of gen-
eral physics. The role of heat in the act of chemical combination is
merely to aid the reaction, to put the reacting substances in such con-
dition as regards temperature that the chemical forces are at liberty to
exert themselves. For example, in the union of oxygen and hydrogen
by igniting an explosive mixture of these gases, the heat merely pro-
motes the phenomenon. The two gases are indifferent to each other at
ordinary temperatures, and require to be raised to a temperature oi
about 400° in order to put in play the chemical affinity between them.
It is in asimilar way that reactions are promoted in an organism. They
have a most favorable temperature which it is the role of animal heat
to furnish.

Thus we have shown that heat enters into the conditions of animal
life in two ways; First as an excretum the product of animal activity,
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 541

and second as a factor to promote chemical reactions. Its dissipation
then is not a pure loss. The author drew these conclusions some years
since from certain experiments on the alimentary value of alcohol, not
knowing that they had already been expressed by a contemporary
physiologist (A. Chauveau), and that they were already associated in his
mind with other conceptions of great interest, in the development of
which the author has since had the good fortune to assist.

II.

To say that an aliment is a bearer of energy as well as matter is to
express in brief the fundamental idea of biology, by virtue of which
life is no longer thought of as creating any power special to itself. A
living being is looked upon as the scene of an incessant circulation of
matter and energy which comes from the exterior world and again
returns to it. Matter and energy together wholly constitute the aliment.
All its characteristics, the appreciation of its function, of its evolution,
and of the laws of alimentation, follow as the consequences of this
principle interpreted in the light of energetics.

We first inquire what forms of energy are carried by the aliment. It
may be readily seen that there are at least two. For it is essentially
the source of chemical energy and secondarily and in an accessory
manner a source of heat. Chemical energy alone, as we see from the ©
second law of energetics, is suitable for transportation into vital energy.
This is true at least for animals, but for plants it is otherwise. Their
vital cycle has neither the same point of departure nor destination, nor
does the transformation of energy here follow the same course.

Again—and this is the third great law governing the phenomena—
the energy put in play in life is restored to the physical world in the
form of heat. We have remarked that the disengaged heat is employed
first to raise the internal temperature of the living being. This is the
animal warmth.

There are therefore two kinds of energy furnished by the aliment;
but if it is wished to be very exact and to omit nothing it should be
added that they are not the only two but only the two principal and by
far the most important forms. It is not absolutely true that heatis the
only energy product of the vital cycle. This is the case only for the
animal in repose, when it contents itself with mere placid existence
without engaging in external mechanical work, such as raising external
weights, or even that of its own body. Mechanical work is then a sec-
ond possible termination of the vital energy cycle, but is not neces-
sarily so, for the motion and employment of force by animals are
subordinated to their volition. Again, the vital energy cycle may
terminate in the production of electricity, and such indeed is the case
with the operations of the nerves and muscles of all animals, and with
the operation of the special electric organ in certain fishes, such as the
542 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

ray and torpedo. Finally luminous energy may be produced from vital
energy, as is the case with the phosphorescent animals.

It is useless to weaken principles by thus enumerating all the restric-
tions which attend them. It is well known that there are no absolute
natural principles. It is sufficient to say that the energy which tem-
porarily animates living creatures is furnished to them from the exter-
nal world exclusively in the form of potential chemical energy, and that
it returns to the outer world chiefly in the form of heat but partially in
the accessory form of mechanical energy.

It is clear that if the flow of energy which circulates through the
animal leaves it solely in the form of heat, then this heat becomes a
possible measure of the amount of energy originally furnished by the
aliment. If the outward flow is divided between two channels, heat
and mechanical work, the two amounts of energy thus given up must
be added together. In the case where the product is heat alone we
need only to determine the loss of heat by the calorimeter to have a
measure of the consumption of energy in living. Physiologists have
arranged apparatus in various forms for this determination. Lavoisier
and Laplace employed the ice calorimeter. They piaced an animal of
small size in an ice cage and determined the amount of heat given out
by the amount of ice melted. In one of their experiments they found
that the Indian pig melted 341 grams of ice in ten hours and conse-
quently furnished 27 calories of heat.

More recently a better instrument has been devised. M. d’Arsonval
employed an air calorimeter, which is nothing but a differential ther-
mometer very ingeniously constructed and made self-registering.
Rosenthal, Richet, Hirn and Kaufmann, and Lafevre have used air calori-
meters more or lesscomplex. Others, following the example of Dulong
and of Despretz, have used water and mercury calorimeters, or like
Liebermeister, Winternitz, and Lefevre have had recourse to the method
of baths. There have been many of these researches and they have
contributed very interesting results.

The same problem may be solved in another way. Instead of deter-
mining the energy leaving the body in the form of heat it may be meas-
ured before its entrance in the form of chemical potential. This deter-
mination has been made in the same units as the preceding—that is to
say, in calories. It has been owing to the advances in thermo-chemistry
and to the principles advanced in 1864 by Berthelot that this second
method of arriving at the energetic equivalent of nutrition has become
possible. Physiologists by the aid of these methods have established
the balance of energy for the living being in various conditions, as they
had already done before for matter. If it is asked what has been the
outcome of these researches, we reply that it consists in having deter-
mined an enormous mass of separate facts, of which we can not here
speak, but which have served to build up the general doctrine of the
energetics of biology—that fertile conception which enables us to
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 543

deduce the explanation of the most intricate and disputed phenomena
of nutrition as the consequence of three simple laws.

Examples abound of the fecundity and innate power of these ideas.
To illustrate by a single point, take the long-cherished error of physi-
ologists who believed with Béclard, in the transformation within the
organism of heat into mechanical work. After the establishment of the
doctrine of energy this error was no longer possible. Energetics teaches
us that the current of energy divides itself in leaving the body into two
divergent branches, one thermal and the other mechanical, which are
strangers to each other though springing from a common source, and
have no other relation in common except, that in summation, they rep-
resent the totai energy of life.

We will now clothe these simple ideas in words more or less foreign
to the usage of physiology; and in so doing, we are convinced, to use
the words of Buffon, that “‘the language of science is more difficult to
comprehend than science itself.” The amount of chemical energy which
a unit weight of a given aliment is able to furnish to an organism, and
which may be evaluated according to the principles of thermo-chemis-
try by the aid of the numerical tables of Berthelot, Rubner, and Stoh-
mann, constitutes the alimentary potential, or energetic value of the
substance, or in still other words, its dynamogenic power. The same
number expresses also the thermogenic power, actual or theoretical, of
the alimentary substance. This energy being destined to be trans-
formed into vital energy (termed physiological work by Chauveau, or
physiological energy) the dynamogenic and thermogenic value of the
aliment is at the same time its biogenetic value. Two weights of dif-
ferent aliments for which these numerical values are the same are said
to be isodynamogenic, isobiogenetic, or isoenergetic weights. They are
equivalent from the point of view of their alimentary value. Finally if,
as is usually the case, the cycle of energy is finished by the production
of heat, the aliment which has been used for this purpose has a real
thermogenic value identical with its theoretical thermogenic value as
may be experimentally determined by direct calorimetry.

Mtl.

The aliment is a source of thermal energy for the organism by which
it is decomposed. Physiological chemistry teaches us that whatever
be the methed of its decomposition, it always finally reaches the same
condition, and with the evolution of the same quantity of heat. But
if the point of departure and the point of destination are the same,
the route followed is not necessarily identical. For example, 1 gram
of fat always furnishes the same quantity of heat, 9.4 calories, and is
always rejected in the same condition of carbonic acid and water. But
from the state of fat to that of a mixture of carbonic acid and water
there are many intermediate conditions. Various alimentary cyeles
are therefore possible.
544 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

From the point of view of their production of heat, these cycles are
all equivalent. But are they equivalent from the vital point of view?
Consider an ordinary alternative. The aliment passes from the
initial to the final state after being incorpotated with the elements of
the tissues and having participated in the vital operations. Here the
limentary potential is transferred into thermal energy after having
traversed the intermediate phase of vital energy. This is a normal
case, the regular type in the alimentary evolution. In this case it
might be said that the aliment had fully performed its function; it had
served vital purposes before being changed in the heat, and had been
biothermogenic. Now consider the most simple case of the irregular
or aberrant type. The aliment passes from the initial to the final state
without being incorporated in the living cellules of the organism, and
without taking part in its vital functions. It remains confined in the
blood and circulating fluids, but finally undergoes the same molecular
disintegration and liberates the same quantity of heat. Its chemical
energy changes at the first attack into thermal energy. The alimentis
a pure thermogene. It has abdicated a portion of its functions and
has been of less vital utility.

Does this case present itself in reality? Can the same aliment be,
as supposed, a biothermogene and a pure thermogene? Some physi-
ologists, among them Fick of Wurtzburg, have maintained that it was
actually so with most aliments; the nitrogenous substances, hydrocar-
bons and fats, all being capable of either of these transformations. On
the other hand Zuntz and von Mering have absolutely denied the
existence of the aberrant type of pure thermogene, maintaining that
no substances whatever are directly decomposed into organic liquids
without the functional intervention of the histological elements. Still
other authors, finally, teach that a small number of alimentary sub-
stances thus suffer direct decomposition, and among them alcohol.

The “theory of luxurious expenditure,” of J. Liebig, and the ‘‘ theory
of circulating albumen,” of Voit, affirm that the proteid aliments suffer
in part a direct combustion in the blood vessels. This subject has ocea-
sioned a celebrated discussion, and the opinions of physiologists are
still divided upon it. Disengaging the main object of discussion from
all the side issues which have been raised, the question is whether an
aliment always follows the same course of evolution whatever be the
circumstances, and in particular if it be introduced in great excess.
Liebig held that the superabundant portion escaping by ordinary pro-
cesses was destroyed by direct combustion. He affirmed, for instance,
that substances containing an excessive amount of nitrogen instead of
running the usual cycle of vital operations suffered direct combustion
in the blood. We express the same idea to-day when we say that they
sustain an accelerated evolution, and that their energy, omitting the
intermediate stage, passes at once from the chemical to the thermal
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 545

form. The doctrine of Liebig, reduced to this fundamental idea, merits
survival. Accessory errors compressed its ruin.

Some years later the celebrated chemist and physiologist of Munich,
C. Voit, revived this doctrine in a more pronounced form. According
to him nearly the whole albuminoid aliment was consumed directly in
the blood. He interpreted certain experiments upon the utilization of
nitrogenous aliments by supposing that these substances when intro-
duced into the blood by digestive processes were divided into two por-
tions. One very small portion incorporated itselfin the living organism
and passed to the state of “organic albumen.” The remainder was
mixed with the blood and lymph, and suffered direct combustion, this
being the circulating albumen. In this doctrine the tissues were
regarded as nearly stable, only the organic liquids being subject to
nutritive metabolism. The accelerated evolution regarded as excep-
tional in the doctrine of energetics, was looked upon as the rule by C.
Voit. Pfltiger and the Bonn school have corrected this abusive exag-
geration.

The fact, long known, that the consumption of oxygen is notably
augmented (to as much as five times its usual value) after eating, is
favorable to the supposition that some nutritive substances are absorbed
and pass into the blood, to be immediately oxidized and destroyed at
once. To be sure some experiments of Zuntz and von Mering are con-
trary to this view, for they injected oxidizable substances into the
blood vessels without discovering immediate oxidation. But on the
other hand, more favorable results of such experiments have been
known.

If the accelerated evolution of the ordinary aliment is thus uncertain
it seems that there is undoubtedly a special category of pure thermo-
gens, such as alcohol and the acids of fruit. When alcohol is taken in
moderate doses about a tenth of the quantity absorbed is taken up by
the living elements. The remainder is “the alcohol of circulation”
which is directly oxidized in the blood and the lymph, without inter-
vening in the vital operations other than by the heat which it produces.
According to the theory of energetics such substances are not true
aliments, since their potential energy is not transformed into vital
energy, but passes at once to the form of heat. On the other hand
some physiologists regard alcohol as a true aliment. In their view
everything is an aliment which is transformed in the system into heat,
and they measure the nutritive value of a substance by the number of
calories it produces. By this measure alcohol would be a superior ali-
ment to the carbohydrates and nitrogenous substances. A given
quantity of alcohol, a gram for example, is equal from this thermal
point of view to 1.66 grams of sugar, to 1.44 grams of albumen, and to
0.73 gram of fat. These quantities would be isodynamic.

This is evidently an extreme view, for experience condemns it. The

sm 98——35
546 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

researches of C. von Noorden have directly shown that alcohol can not
be substituted in a ration in the place of an isodynamic quantity of
carbohydrates. If this substitution be made, a ration before just capa-
ble of maintaining an organism in equilibrium becomes insufficient;
the body loses weight; the nitrogenous materials which enter into its
constitution are broken up, and the animal declines.

In the preceding we have accustomed ourselves to look upon a single
characteristic of an aliment (though its first essential, to be sure) as
its energetic character. It is necessary that it furnish energy to the
organism, and in order to do so it must be decomposed or broken up
into simpler substances. Thus fat, which has rather a complicated
molecular structure from a chemical point of view, is given off as car-
bonic acid and water. The same is true for the carbohydrates, such as
saccharine and amylaceous substances. It is because of the simplifica-
tion in structure attending the passage of these substances through
the organism that they give up the chemical energy which they have
stored upin the potential form. 'Thermo-chemistry enables us to deter-
mine from the initial and final states the amount of energy given over
to the living being in the interim. This energetic value, dynamogenic
or thermogenic, gives thus a measure of the alimentary capacity of the
substance. A gram of fat, for example, gives up a quantity of energy
equal to 9.4 calories; the thermogenic value of the carbohydrates is
about half as great, or 4.2 calories; and the thermogenic value of
albuminoids is 4.8 calories. This being so we see that the animal is
best nourished by aliments which are of very complicated chemical
structure.

Iv.

In addition to the energetic theory which we have always discussed
there is another way of conceiving the role of the aliment. It consists
in the consideration of the aliment as a source of heat. We have seen
that an aliment is a source of thermal energy for the organism.
Inversely, can it be said that all substances which give out heat when
brought into the organism are aliments? This is a much controverted
question at present. Most physiologists admit that it is so. Their
notion of an aliment is interchangeable with that which produces heat;
in their idea everything is nutritive which disengages heat within the
body. The most imperative need of the living body is to be kept warm.
Even cold-blooded animals have a constant internal temperature which
must be maintained for the preservation of their lives. On the other
hand the animal heat of the body is continually dissipated in the colder
surrounding medium. Hence a continuous supply of thermal energy
is necessary for the preservation of life. Hence the necessity for ali-
mentation is mixed up in the necessity of a vehicle for heat te cover the
deficit due te the inevitable cooling off of the organism. As arule the
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 5AT

amount of heat thus lost governs the need and fixes the quantity of
the ration.

Such is the theory which opposes the energetic theory and disputes
favor with it among physiologists. Among its strongest adherents are
von Noorden, Rubner, Ch. Richet, and Lapicque. In their view the
generation of heat absolutely dominates the play of nutritive exchanges;
and it is the heat requirement which regulates the total demand in eal-
ories for the support of the organism. It is not at all because the
organism produces too much heat that it disperses it over all its surface,
but emphatically because that it would lose heat to a dangerous extent
that it is adapted to provide against the loss.

This conception of the function of alimentation rests on two argu-
ments. The first is furnished by the experiments of Rubner. A dog
is kept a suitably long time (from two to twelve days) in a calorimeter,
and the quantity of heat given off is compared with the heat furnished
in the food. The accord between the two is in every case remarkable.
But would it be possible that itcould be otherwise? Forina mechani-
eal regulator it is well known that an exact equilibrium between the
supply of heat and the loss must obtain for a constant temperature
within. The second argument is drawn from what is called the law of
surfaces, brought forth by Ch. Richet. By comparing the proper rations
of subjects of very different weights placed in various situations, it was
shown that there was furnished always the same number of calories for
the same surface of skin—that is to say, the same cooling surface. This
is certainly a very interesting fact, but at the same time not necessarily
convineing.

There are, on the other hand, grave objections to this view. The
thermal value of a nutritive principle represents only one aspect of its
physiological function. To be sure man and animals are able to draw
the same profit and the same effects from rations in which one of the
aliments is replaced in isodynamic proportions by two others, and the
same quantity of heat is thus developed. But this substitution is very
limited in its possibilities. Isodynamic substitution—that is, a substi-
tution of aliments pro rata for their thermal value, is limited on all sides
by exceptions. In the first place, there is a small quantity of nitro-
genous aliment whose place can not be supplied. Indeed, even before
the minimum allowance is reached the substitution seems to be perfect.
While substitution is perfect as between the albuminoids and carbo-
hydrates and the fats, it can not safely be made between these and the
nitrogenous substances. If the heating power of aliments was the only
consideration, an isodynamic substitution would not shut out alcohol,
glycerin, and the fatty acids from completely supporting alimentation.
Finally, if the thermal power of an aliment is the sole measure of its
physiological utility, the question arises why aliments could not be
wholly replaced by a dose of heat. Heating from without might, it
548 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION.

seems, take the place of heating from within. One could cherish the
ambition of substituting for rations of sugar and fat an isodynamic
quantity of carbon, used to nourish the man at the same time that it
suitably warmed his apartment.

We

In reality the aliment has another office to perform than to warm the
body or even furnish it with energy. It should not be forgotten that
the organism requires a supply of matter as well as a supply of energy.
It must have a proper quantity of certain definite principles, both
organic and mineral. These principles are evidently for the purpose
of replacing the substances carried out in the circulation of matter,
and to reconstruct the organic material. Such aliments may be called
histogenetic (repairers of tissues) or plastic aliments.

This was the view of alimentation taken by the ancients. Hippoc-
rates, Aristotle, and Galen believed in the existence of a special —
nutritive substance existing in all the infinite variety of substances
employed for nourishment by men and animals. It was not until the
time of Lavoisier that the idea of the dynamogenic and thermal value
of the aliment was conceived. The combined view of these two species
of attributes and their accurate distinction is due to J. Liebig, who
designated them as plastic and dynamogenic aliments. He held also
that the same substance might serve in both these roles, and this he
thought to be the case with the albuminoids.

The elder Magendie, in 1836, had introduced, in an interminable list
of aliments, a preliminary division into proteid substances (now called
albuminoids, nitrogenous and quarternary substances) and terniary
substances.

The proteids are capable of alone sustaining life. Preponderating
importance should be attributed to this class of aliments. These results
of Magendie have been since verified. Pfliiger, of Bonn, has given a
convincing demonstration of them within a year. He nourished, worked,
and finally fattened a dog upon meat alone. The same experiment
showed that the organism can form fat and carbohydrates at the
expense of nitrogenous aliments, and can transform the one class of
substances into the other. Fats and carbohydrates are therefore not
essential, the albuminoids alone being indispensable. Theoretically
man and animals may sustain life exclusive of proteid aliments, but
practically this is not possible for man because of the enormous quan-
tity of meat (3 kilos per day) which he ought properly to use.

Ordinary alimentation employs a mixture of these three kinds of
substances, and in this mixture the albumen contains the plastic ele-
ment actually necessary to repair the waste of the organism. The two
other kinds carry the required energy. In such mixed diets the quan-
tity of albumen ought never to fall below a certain minimum, The
efforts of physiologists in the last few years have tended to fix with
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF ALIMENTATION. 5A9

precision this minimum ration of albuminoids, or, as it may be said in
abbreviated fashion, to determine the quantity of albumen below which
the organism perishes. Voit has indicated as the limit for man 118
grams of meat. This figure, however, is certainly too high, and may
be reduced to 100, to 90, or even to 70. But, on the other hand, the
most advantageous ration of albumen should be considerably above
that actually sufficient.

It remains to mention several recent researches. The most impor-
tant of these by far are those which M. Chauveau has published upon
the reciprocal transformations of immediate principles in the organism,
according to its functional conditions and the circumstances of its
activity. We shall find a natural opportunity to speak of this at suit-
able length in treating of the physiology of the muscular contraction
and movement; in other words, the subject of muscular energetics.

THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS:!

By L. O. HOWARD.

The popular conception of insects in general is undoubtedly that they
are injurious. Many writers, it is true, have pointed out the benefits
derived from insects, but we think of their damage to crops and of
their annoyance to man and animals, and this aspect of the subject is
at once apt to preponderate in our minds. It is more than eighty years
since Kirby and Spence contrasted the injuries caused by insects with
the benefits derived from them, and it has not been comprehensively
done since. In the meantime, whole groups of important injuries have
been developed and whole classes of beneficial work have been discov-
ered. Moreover, the tendency of modern thought has not taken this
direction. The biologic, taxonomic and phylogenetic, and other aspects
of large groups of forms of life have been considered to the exclusion
of the economic aspect, and even where this side has attracted attention
investigators have confined themselves to specific problems and have
not generalized. It may be interesting, therefore, once more to con-
trast the injurious insects with the beneficial ones in an effort to gain
a clearer idea of the status of the group in its relations with man.

In a broad way, we may consider the subject under the following
heads:

Insects are injurious:

1. As destroyers of crops and other valuable plant life.

2. As destroyers of stored foods, dwellings, clothes, books, etc.

3. AS injuring live stock and other useful animals.

4, As annoying man.

5. As carriers of disease.

Insects are beneficial:

. As destroyers of injurious insects.

. As destroyers of noxious plants.

. As pollenizers of plants.

. AS scavengers.

. As makers of soil.

. As food (both for man and for poultry, song birds, and feed fishes)
aud as clothing, and as used in the arts.

552 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

DESTROYERS OF CROPS AND OTHER USEFUL PLANTS.

In the present balance of nature one of the chief functions of insect
life is to keep down superabundant vegetation. Almost every kind of
plant has its insect enemies, and has had such enemies for many thou-
sands of years. So soon as man began to make an effort to upset
nature’s balance by cultivating certain plants at the expense of others
he encountered nature’s opposition by means of the increase of insect
enemies of the particular plant cultivated, and almost as early as there
is any record of agriculture in literature there is also mention of the
destruction to crops caused by insects. Witness the writings of the
prophet Joel, who might almost be termed an agricultural pessimist.

At the present time almost every cultivated crop has not only its
thousands upon thousands of individual insect enemies, but it is affected
by scores and even hundreds of species. A mere tabulation of the
insect enemies of the apple already recognized in this country shows
281 species, of clover 82 species, and of so new a crop as the sugar
beet 70 species. The insects of the vine, of the orange, of the wheat
crop, and, in fact, of all of our prominent staples, show equally start-
ling figures.

The actual damage which is done by insects in this way is difficult
to express. Many attempts have been made by writers on economic
entomology to express it in money values. For example, it was esti-
mated by the late Professor Riley that the average annual damage to
cultivated crops by injurious insects in the United States amounted to
$300,000,000. The loss from the ravages of one species alone, the
chinch bug, during one year was estimated at $60,000,000. While itis
true that the combined losses of individual growers might reach such
enormous sums as these, there is an element in the total loss which we
must not fail to take into consideration, and that is the enchanced value
of the portion of the crop which remains. [Even in the case of an indi-
vidual a man may lose, for example, half of his crop through the work
of the chinch bug, and yet, through widespread damage by this insect,
the money value of the portion harvested may reach an amount almost
as great aS would have been gained through the low prices of a sue-
cessful year of no insect damage. As this applies to an individual, it
‘applies much more strongly to a State or to the country at large, so that
even in the year when the grain crop of the country was said to have
been damaged to the extent of $60,000,000 it is safe to say that the
total price gained for the crop was as great as it would otherwise have
been. These estimates of damage, therefore, would much better be
expressed in terms of bushels, or some other measure, than in money
value.

it is this aspect of our. subject, the damage done by injurious insects

to agriculture, that has given rise to the comparatively new branch of
applied science which we now know as economic entomology, and
which, although originating in Europe, has been encouraged to such
an extent in our own country, owing partly to our greater necessities
and partly to our practical turn of mind, that it is safe to say that at
present America leads the rest of the world in this direction.

It is undoubtedly true that this enormous injury to crops is the chief
item in a general consideration of the injuries brought about by insects.

AS DESTROYERS OF FOODS, DWELLINGS, CLOTHES, BOOKS, ETC.

It is safe to say that there is hardly any product of man’s ingenuity,
hardly one of the thousands of useful materials upon which depend
his comfort and happiness, which is not damaged, directly or indi-
rectly, by insects. The timbers of which his dwellings are built, nearly
all of his household utensils, his garments, practically everything
which he uses as food, many of the liquids used as drink, his books,
the ornaments with which he surrounds himself, the medicines which
he takes when sick, the very tobacco with which he solaces himself—
all are destroyed or injuriously affected by insects. There is, perhaps,
one group of exceptions, and that is those articles which are composed
wholly of metal, and yet even here insects may occasionally play an
injurious part, since instances are on record of the destruction of lead
pipes by insect larvee, and the perforation of the metal linings of water
tanks by small beetles.

Such injuries to human products are more frequent and serious in
tropical regions than in temperate zones, but even here insects of this
nature cause very serious inconvenience and great annual loss. It will
answer our purpose, perhaps, to list some of the varying substances
which are damaged in this way, to get an idea of their almost univer-
sal character: Ham, cheese, salted fish, butter, lard, dried mushrooms,
rye bread, sweetmeats and preserves, powdered coffee, almonds and
other nuts, raisins, breakfast foods, chocolate, ginger, rhubarb, black
pepper, vinegar, sugar, wines, canned soups, tobacco, snuff, licorice,
peppermint, aromatic cardamon, aniseed, aconite, belladonna, musk,
opium, ginseng, camomile, boneset, hides, shoes, gloves and other
leather articles, furniture, carpets, drawings and paintings, paint
brushes, gun wads, combs, etc., made of horn; hay, oats, straw, willow
baskets, ax handles, ladders, wheel spokes and all sorts of agricultural
implements with wooden handles, barrels, wine casks, corks of wine
bottles, sheets of cork, natural history collections, including skeletons
and mummies, and even Persian insect powder! The mention of this
well-known insecticide reminds one of the latest discovery, which is
that certain flies in California breed in the crude petroleum pools in
the vicinity of oil wells, a fact which is almost paradoxical in view of
the extensive use of petroleum as an insecticide.
55A THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

AS INJURIOUS TO LIVE STOCK AND OTHER USEFUL ANIMALS.

Every species of animal which has become domesticated and is of
value to man possesses its insect parasites and enemies. These in
many cases are the same species which affect man and which we will
mention in the next section; others are specific to the animals or
groups of animals which they affect. Horses, cattle, sheep, all possess
insect enemies which are not only very deleterious to their health,
but frequently cause their death in numbers.

The disgusting bot fly of the horse, whose maggots live in incredi-
ble numbers in the stomach and intestines of this noble friend of the
human race; the bot fly of the ox, which causes innumerable sores on
the backs of cattle and by its perforations ruins their hides for com-
mercial use; the bot fly of the sheep, which inhabits the nasal and
orbital sinuses of the sheep and produces insanity and death, will
instantly be recalled by those who are familiar with stock raising,
while hundreds of other species, some in no less degree, as the horn fly,
the numerous gadflies, including the tsetse fly of Africa, the screw-
worm fly of our Southwestern country, unite to make the lives of
domestic animals a burden to themselves and a trial and a loss to their
owners.

An interesting attempt was made some years ago by a prominent
Western agricultural newspaper, The Farmers’ Review, to estimate
approximately the pecuniary loss from the attacks of a single one of
these insects—the ox bot fly, or ox warble—on the cattle received at
the Union Stock Yards of Chicago. It was estimated that 50 per cent
of the cattle received each year are affected. The number of cattle
received at the yards during 6 months of the year 1889 was 1,335,026;
the average value of the hide was $3.90; the usual deduction for hides
damaged by the ox warble was one-third. Estimating at less than one-
third, say $1, the actual loss during six months on hides alone was
$667,513. When to this was added the loss for depreciation in value
and lessened quantity of beef, the loss for each infested animal was
put at $5, a very low estimate, indicating the total loss from the ani-
mals in the Union Stock Yards of Chicago for a period of six months
of $3,336,565.

AS ANNOYING MAN.

There are very few regions of the habitable globe where man is not
personally subject to more or less annoyance by insects. In this part
of the world we naturally think at once of mosquitoes, house flies, fleas,
and of a certain other species which it will not be necessary to name.

A susceptible individual some years ago wrote to the Department of
Agriculture and said that he had come over from the old country and
settled in New Jersey, but that the mosquitoes bothered him so greatly
.

THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 555

that on the advice of friends he moved to northern New York. Here
he found that during a certain portion of the year black flies made life
unendurable; thereupon he packed his household effects and moved to
North Carolina. Here, however, in the summer months red bugs, or
jiggers, bothered him to such an extent that he feared he would go
crazy, and in this desperate condition he applied to this office to learn
whether there existed in the United States a locality where a sensitive
individual could find peace from attacks of insects. He said that he
had been told that in the Western country the buffalo gnat was greatly
to be feared, while certain other biting flies would be sure to keep him
in a constant state of dermal irritation; that farther south he knew
that peaceful nights were to be gained in the summer time only under
the protection of mosquito bars. He had thought of the newly devel-
oping country of Alaska, but had recently seen an account in the
newspaper of the ferocity of the Alaskan mosquitoes, which had prac-
tically destroyed his last hope.

Accustomed as most of us are to the mosquitoes of temperate North
America, we hardly realize the impression which they made upon the
early English travelers. A story told by Kirby and Spence, to the
effect that Mr. Weld in his travels relates from General Washington
that in one place the mosquitoes were so powerful as to pierce through
his boots, has always excited my interest and curiosity, and I recently
took the trouble to consult the original publication, which is ‘Isaac
Weld’s Travels through North America, 1795-1797,” London, 1799. In
speaking of Skenesborough, in northern New York, Mr. Weld dilates
upon the number and ferocity of the mosquitoes, and makes use of the
following words: ‘‘General Washington told me that he never was so
much annoyed by mosquitoes in any part of America as in Skenesbor-
ough, for that they used to bite through the thickest boot.” Now,
knowing that the boots of those days were very thick and that the
mosquitoes of that time must have been structurally identical with
those of to-day, there arises instantly a question of veracity between

Mr. Weld and General Washington; and as we know from Dr. Weems’s -
veracious history that General Washington was so constituted that he
could not tell a lie, it looks very much as though Mr. Weld, like many
another English traveler who has written a book on his return home,
has been inclined to overstate the truth.

In these days of comparative personal cleanliness some of the most
disgusting of the insect annoyers of man have dropped out of sight.
The lice, which in former days were common in all classes of society,
from king to peasant, are now comparatively unknown. The itch dis-
ease, which carried off many a famous character in history, is equally
rare. That it still persists, however, is shown by an occasional case
reported in medical journals. For example, Dr. Robert Hessler, of
Indianapolis, reported in 1892 a case in his own practice of typical
Norway itch in which the itch mites were present in the skin of the
556 | THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

patient in enormous numbers. A rough estimate showed 7,000,000
eggs and 2,000,000 mites.

Those of us who live in a reasonably civilized way are confined, in
our experience of annoying insects, largely to the forms mentioned in
our opening paragraph, namely, mosquitoes and house flies and rarely
fleas; but a glance through the medical literature reveals the existence
of more or less frequent eases of such a nature that they are little less
than horrible. Prominent among these are the cases of so-called
Myasis, and especially those resulting from the attacks of the screw
worm fly, Compsomyia macellaria.

Residents of temperate regions are fortunate as compared with those
of tropical regions in respect to the personally annoying insects. Our
troubles from these individually insignificant causes are intensified to
a degree in warmer countries, where the comfort of the individual
absolutely depends upon the adoption of measures, always difficult
and frequently impracticable, to exclude insects from his person and
from his food. This is so well known in these days of numerous books
of travel that I will close this aspect of our question simply with a
quotation from a poet of the Indies, written many years ago:

‘On every dish the booming beetle falls,
The cockroach plays, or caterpillar crawls;
A thousand shapes of variegated hues
Parade the table and inspect the stews.
To living walls the swarming hundreds stick,
Or court, a dainty meal, the oily wick;
Heaps over heaps their slimy bodies drench.
Out go the lamps with suffocating stench.

When hideous insects every plate defile.
The laugh how empty, and how forced the smile!”

AS CARRIERS OF DISEASE.

Manson’s demonstrated transmission of the filaria diseases of the
East (elephantiasis, chyluria, and lymph scrotum) by insects; the dis-
covery by Salmon and Smith of the carriage of the germ of Texas
fever by the well-known Southern cattle tick; the discovery by Bruce
of the fact that the Tsetse fly of Africa is so destructive to animals,
not by its bite alone, but by carrying into the circulation of the animal
that it attacks the micro-organisms of disease; the demonstration by
Howe and others of the previously suspected fact that the purulent
conjunctivitis of the Egyptians is spread by the house fly; the partly
proven hypothesis of Manson and Grassi of the relation existing
between mosquitoes and malaria; the circumstantially proven carriage
of the germs of Asiatic cholera and typhoid fever by flies; the demon-
stration claimed by Finlay of the carriage of a mild type of yellow
fever by mosquitoes; the suggestion by Hubbard that the “pink eye”
of the South is spread by Hippelates; the well-recognized fact among
the Europeans of the Fiji Islands that without a veil a serious native
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 557

eye disease will spread through the medium of gnats. The suggestion
by Symond of the agency of fleas in the spread of the bubonic plague;
the demonstration of anthrax bacilliin malignant pustules in human
beings, caused by the bite of Tabanus and Stomoxys—all indicate an
important and very injurious function of insects practically unsus-
pected until comparatively recent years. It is, in fact, a rapidly
increasing field of investigations, the possibilities of which can not be
accurately established at the present time. It is, however, not a field
which should be left entirely to the medical bacteriologist; the ento-
mologist should have a share. The life histories and habits of the
insects concerned in the damage should be thoroughly understood, since
it is not impossible that otherwise the medical investigators may find
themselves arriving at perhaps unwarranted conelusions. For exam-
ple, it is a fact probably unknown to the medical men who may be
strongly impressed by the suggested carriage of typhoid germs by flies,
that the house fly so common in our dining rooms, rarely breeds in
and seldom visits human excrement, while those other kinds of flies,
which do so breed, are rarely attracted to articles of food used by
human beings. In the crowded and unnatural conditions of army
camps, however, and especially where cavalry regiments are stationed
so that there are great amounts of horse manure, the house fly may
breed in such enormous numbers as torender of very likely occurrence

a departure from the normal food habits of the adult.

Enough has been shown, however, to emphasize the potentiality of
this phase of insect injury.

BENEFITS.
AS DESTROYERS OF INJURIOUS INSECTS.

The economic bearings of insect enemies of insects are very great,
and perhaps this is, all things considered, the most important of the
beneficial function of insects as a class.

In the eternal warfare of organism upon organism, in the perpetual
strife of species, one preying upon another and that upon a third, the
complications of relations of forms which determine the abundance of
one species and the scarcity of another are nowhere more marked than
among the insects. In fact, to the student of insects who has followed
out even a single chain of these interrelationships the thought must
necessarily come that upon its organic environment, and especially
upon its relations with its living neighbors of the animal kingdom,
depend the chances of a species not only for increase, but for survival
almost to no lesser degree than upon its inorganic environment. Tem-
perature is the great factor which controls the geographical distribu-
tion of life, and temperature is at the back of all these apparent living
first causes which contro} the abundance of a species in a given region,
provided we trace them far enough. Yet these living causes, them-
558 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

selves affected by other living causes in an almost endless chain, some-
times, to all appearance, dwarf even temperature as a controlling factor.

There is not a species of insect that has not its natural enemies in
the guise of other insects; there is not one of these other insects which
has not its own insect foes. From a single species of Bombycid moth,
the larvee of which frequently damage forests in Europe to an alarm-
ing extent, there have been reared no less than 60 species of hymen-
opterous parasites. From a single caterpillar of Plusia brassice have
been reared 2,528 individuals of a little hymenopterous parasite, Copi-
dosoma truncatellum.'

Outbreaks of injurious insects are frequently stopped as though by
magic by the work of insect enemies of the species. Hubbard found,
in 1880, that a minute parasite, Trichogramma pretiosa, alone and
unaided, almost annihilated the fifth brood of the cotton worm in
Florida, fully 90 per cent of the eggs of this prolific crop enemy being
infested by the parasite. Not longer ago than 1895, in the city of
Washington, more than 97 per cent of the caterpillars of one of our
most important shade-tree pests were destroyed by parasitic insects,
to the complete relief of the city the following year. The Hessian fly,
that destructive enemy to wheat crops in the United States, is practi-
cally unconsidered by the wheat growers of certain States, for the
reason that whenever its numbers begin to be injuriously great its
parasites increase to such a degree as to prevent appreciable damage.

The control of a plant-feeding insect by its insect enemies is an
extremely complicated matter, since, as we have already hinted, the
parasites of the parasites play an important part. The undue multi-
plication of a vegetable feeder is followed by the undue multiplication
of parasites, and their increase is followed by the increase of hyper-
parasites. Following the very instance of the multiplication of the
shade-tree caterpillar just mentioned, the writer was able to determine
this parasitic chain during the next season down to quaternary para-
sitism. Beyond this point true internal parasitism probably did not
exist, but even these quaternary parasites were subject to bacterial or
fungus disease and to the attacks of predatory insects. ;

The prime cause of the abundance or scarcity of a leaf-feeding species
is, therefore, obscure, since it is hindered by an abundance of primary
parasites, favored by an abundance of secondary parasites (since these
will destroy the primary parasites), hindered again by an abundance
of tertiary parasites, and favored again by an abundance of quaternary
parasites.

The subject of practical handling of insect enemies of insects has
come into great prominence during the past ten years. The sugges-

1 This observation, which for some years ‘‘held the record,” as the expression is,
was made by Mr. Pergande, of the United States Department of Agriculture.
Recently, however, Prof. A. Giard, of Paris, has more than 3,000 specimens of the
same parasite reared from a Plusia caterpillar.
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 559

tion by the Rev. Dr. Bethune, of Canada, many years ago, of the
desirability of importing the European parasite of the wheat midge
into America was probably the first published international suggestion
of this nature, and, although some subsequent correspondence between
English and American entomologists ensued, no parasites were actually ~
sent over. Later, attempts were made by LeBaron in the case of a
parasite of the oyster-shell bark louse of the apple, and by Professor
Riley in the case of a parasite of the plum curculio, to transport para-
sites from one section of the United States to another, both attempts
meeting with some slight success.

In 1873 Planchon and Riley introduced an American predatory mite,
which feeds in this country on the grape vine Phyllovera, into France,
where it became established, but where it accomplished no appreciable
results in the way of checking the spread of this famous vine pest.

In 1874 efforts were made to send certain parasites of plant lice from
England to New Zealand, without recorded results of value.

In 1880, in an article upon the parasites of American scale insects,
the writer showed that international transportation is especially easy
and especially desirable in the case of these insects.

In 1883 Dr. Riley succeeded in importing a conmon European para-
. Site of the imported cabbage worm into this country, where it estab-
lished itself and has since proved to be a valuable addition to our
fauna.

In 1891 the same distinguished entomologist brought about the impor-
tation of one of the European parasites of the Hessian fly through the
assistance of Mr. Fred. Enock, of London. This parasite maintained
itself in this country certainly as late as 1895, but has accomplished no
appreciable good, so far as has been ascertained, in limiting the increase
of this destructive enemy to wheat.

All previous experiments of this nature were dwarfed into insignifi-
cance by the astounding success of the importation of Novius ( Vedalia)
cardinalis, a ladybird beetle, from Australia into California in 1889,
This importation was made, as will be remembered, by Mr. Albert
Koebele, an attaché of the Division of Entomology of the United
States Department of Agriculture, whose expenses, however, were
paid out of a fund appropriated to the Department of State, for the
purpose of securing a representation from this country to the Mel-
bourne Exposition. A California man, the late Mr. Frank McCoppin,
happened to be at the head of the exposition commission; and, while
the late Dr. C. V. Riley was endeavoring in Washington to induce tie
Department of State to set aside a sum from the exposition fund for
the expenses of Mr. Koebele, representatives of the State board of
horticulture of California were pressing the same facts upon Mr. Me-
Coppin, the head of the commission. These efforts were made inde-
pendently and without consultation, hence it happened that after Mr.
Koebele had succeeded in sending live Vedalias to California, and
560 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

after these insects, by their rapid multiplication and voracious habits,

had absolutely destroyed the cottony cushion scale in the orange

groves of the State, a result which practically saved millions of dollars

_ to California and which attracted the attention of everyone interested in
science or agriculture, a most unfortunate controversy ensued between
Dr. Riley and the California State board of horticulture as to the
placing of the credit of carrying out this wonderfully successful experi-
ment. This controversy embittered the last days of both Dr. Riley
and Mr. MeCoppin, and was the cause of a disturbance of the formerly
pleasant relations between the United States Department of Agricul-
ture and the State board of horticulture of California, which has only
recently been overcome.

Following this successful experiment, the same insect, Novius cardi-
nalis, was sent to South Africa, where it exterminated the white or
fluted scale in that colony. The next year it was sent to Egypt, where
it exterminated a congeneric scale insect in the gardens of Alexandria.

The following year Mr. Koebele, still an agent of the United States
Department of Agriculture, was sent, with the consent of the Hon.
Jeremiah Rusk, but at the expense of the California State Board of
Horticulture, to Australia, New Zealand, and the Fiji Islands, for the
purpose of securing other valuable beneficial insects for importation -
into California. _Thousands of such insects, comprising a number of
different species, nearly all, however, of them Coccinellids, or lady-
birds, were sent over and established in California. Several of these
Species are still living in different parts of the State. The overwhelm-
ing success of the importation of Novius cardinalis was not repeated,
but one of the insects brought over at that time, namely, Rhizobius
ventralis, has unquestionably ridden many olive groves of the destruc-
tive black scale, and is to-day present in many other orchards in such
numbers that the scale practically makes no headway.

After this second Oriental trip the relations between the Department
of Agriculture and the State Board of Horticulture of California
became so strained that the California agents of the Department were
given their choice by the honorable Secretary of Agriculture to resign

‘their positions or be transferred to Washington. Mr. Koebele resigned
and was soon after employed by the then newly established Hawaiian
Republic for the purpose of traveling in different countries and collect-
ing beneficial insects to be introduced into Hawaii for the purpose of
destroying injurious insects. It is difficult at this time to ascertain the
exact results of the more recent portion of this work. Mr. Koebele’s
own published reports have dealt less with results than with the
details of the introduction of insects, and anonymous newspaper
reports are not to be accepted as scientific evidence. Fortunately,
however, one of the collectors of the British Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, Mr. R. E. C. Perkins, was in Hawaii during 1896 and
made a report on Mr, Koebele’s work to the committee appointed by
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 561

the Royal Society and the British Association for investigating the
fauna of the Sandwich Islands, which was published in Nature for
March 25, 1897. From this report it appears that the introduction of
Coccinella repanda from Ceylon, Australia, and China was so success-
ful in the extermination of plant lice upon sugar cane and other crops
as to obviate all necessity for spraying. The introduction of Crypto-
lemus montrouziert from Australia resulted in the entire recovery of
the coffee plants and other trees which were on tke point of being
totally destroyed by the scale insect known as Pulvinaria psidii, Hight
other introduced species had at the date of writing (November, 1896)
been entirely naturalized and were reported as doing good work against
certain scale insects. A Chaleis fly, Chalcis obscurata, introduced from
China and Japan, multiplied enormously at the expense of an injurious
caterpillar which had severely attacked banana and palm trees. Mr.
Koebele, when visiting Washington during November, 1898, mentioned
a number of other importations of beneficial insects into Hawaii, about
which it is as yet too early to speak.

A very recent instance of an international importation of striking
value is the sending of Novius cardinalis from this country to Portugal,
where the white or fluted scale has been checked and in many orchards
exterminated in the course of a single year. This importation was
made by the writer with the invaluable assistance of the California
State Board of Horticulture.

Other experiments in this line are under way. A parasite of certain
wax scales, which are abundant and injurious in the South, has been
imported by the writer from Italy, with the cooperation of Prof.
Antonio Berlese, of the Royal Scuola di Agricoltura di Portici; while
an effort is being made to bring from Europe insects which will prey
upon the gipsy moth which has been so great a plague about Boston;
and other parasites of injurious scale insects in foreign countries are
being studied with the purpose of eventually obtaining their introduc-
tion into the United States.

AS DESTROYERS OF NOXIOUS PLANTS.

Just as we have shown how important is the role played by insects
in the destruction of cultivated and useful plants, it will be easy to
indicate their importance as destroyers of weeds and other noxious
plants. We need only mention the common and cosmopolitan thistle
butterfly (Pyrameis cardui), the equally common milkweed butterfly
(Anosia plexippus), the purslane caterpillar (Copidryas glovert), the bur-
dock beetle ( Gastroidea cyanea), and the purslane sphinx moth (Deile-
phila lineata) to recall to the mind of the experienced entomologist
many other species which do similar work. They are here, as in the
former case, perhaps the principal agents in preventing the undue
increase of any one species of plant, but as we find here not an effort

of man to combat nature, as it were, by increasing the growth and

sm 98 36

562 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

spread of one species at the expense of the others, but the exact oppo-
site, so here also to a degree we find nature arrayed against man,
and insects thus play by no means the same part in the destruction of
weeds that they do in the destruction of cultivated crops. Neverthe-
less, they have an important function in this direction, and it is safe to
say that the benefit which the agriculturist derives from their work in
this way is very great. As long ago as the beginning of the century
it was pointed out by Sparrman that a region in Africa which had
been choked up by shrubs, perennial plants, and hard, half-withered,
and unpalatable grasses, after being made bare by a visitation of
destructive grasshoppers, soon appeared in a far more beautiful dress,
clothed with new herbs, superb lilies, and fresh annual grasses, afford-
ing delicious herbage for the wild cattle and game.

In a similar way Riley has called attention to the fact that after the
great grasshopper invasions of Colorado and other Western States in
the years 1874 to 1876 there were wonderful changes in the character
of the vegetation, the grasshopper devastations being followed by a
great prevalence of plants which in ordinary seasons were scarcely
noticed. Itis true that some of these plants were dangerous weeds,
but others were most valuable as forage for the half-starved live stock.
Moreover, other plants, and especially short or recumbent grasses, took
on a new habit and grew luxuriantly; one species, for example, Hra-
grostis pocoides, ordinarily recumbent and scarcely noted, grew in pro-
fusion to a height of 34 feet.

An important, but not generally realized benefit which : is derived
from the insects may be mentioned under this head, though not strictly
belonging here. Kirby showed, seventy-five years ago, that the insects
that attack the roots of grasses, such as wireworms, white grubs, etc.,
in ordinary seasons only devour so much as is necessary to make room
for fresh shoots and the product of new herbage, in this manner main-
taining a constant succession of young plants and causing an annual
though partial renovation of our meadows and pastures, ‘‘so that, when
in moderate numbers, these insects do no more harm to the grass than
would the sharp-toothed harrows which it has sometimes been obliged
to apply to hidebound pastures, and the beneficial operation of which
in loosening the subsoil these insect borers closely imitate.”

AS POLLENIZERS OCF PLANTS.

It can no longer be doubted that cross fertilization is one of the very
most important elements in the progressive development and continued
health of the great majority of flowering plants, and, indeed, that it is
with some almost a condition of existence. Opposition to this view, at
no time especially strong since the publication of Darwin’s great work,
has become feebler and more feeble until at the present it is not worth
considering.

Comparative experimentation with self-fertilizing and cross-fertiliz-
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 563

ing plants, repeated with many species and genera, have shown a
superior growth and vitality on the part of those subjected to cross fer-
tilization of such a degree as to leave not a semblance of a doubt, while
in individual cases self-fertilization has been scientifically shown to
even result in a deterioration so marked that it has been compared to
poisoning.

In this condition of affairs it at once becomes evident that the good
offices of insects in this direction are of incalculable importance, since it
must be plain that of the natural agencies by which cross-fertilization
of plants is accomplished insects are far and away the most prominent.
Every investigation which has been undertaken of recent years, and
activity in this field is increasing by leaps and bounds, has shown the
most marvelous adaptations between the structure of flowers and the
structure of their insect visitants, all in the line of facilitating or really
enforcing the collecting and carriage of pollen by flower-visiting insects
from one plant to another. An estimate of the numbers of the species
of insects engaged in this work would include the forms belonging to
whole families and almost orders, and if we could imagine the race of
flower-visiting insects wiped out of existence the disastrous effect upon
plant growth would be beyond estimate. I am not prepared to state
that insects benefit plants.in this Way to such an extent as to overcome
the results of the work of the plant-destroying species, but if it were
possible to compare in any way the results of these two classes of work
it is safe to say that the effect would be surprising.

We must, therefore, without going further into detail, place this pol-
lenization of plants as one of the very most important beneficial func-
tions of insects in their relations to man.

AS SCAVENGERS.

Another beneficial function of insects, the importance of which can
hardly be overestimated, is their value to humanity in doing away with
and rendering innocuous dead matter of both plant and animal origin.
This subject has never been discussed without reference to the famous
statement by Linneus that the offspring of three blowflies would
destroy the carcass of a horse as quickly as would a lion; and while
the exact statement in its details is open to doubt, still it serves to
illustrate in a striking way the good offices of insects, and it is cer-
tainly true that after the offspring of the blowfly have finished with
the horse’s carcass this would be left in a much less offensive condition
than after the departure of the lion.

There are inhabited regions in which the climate is so dry that dead
bodies of animals never become offensive, but by natural mummifica-
tion remain simply as cumberers of the earth. In such regions insects
play little part. Wherever, however, there is sufficient moisture to
produce a natural decay, there insects occur in swarms and hasten the
destruction of the decomposing mass in a marked degree. Were the
564 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

bodies of dead animals not destroyed by insects in this way, and, still
more, were the destruction of dead vegetation not hastened as it is by
the attacks of countless insects, it is perfectly easy to see that the
earth would not be inhabitable; its surface would be covered with the
indestructible remains of what was once life in some form.

Large groups of insects, comprising many thousands of species, take
part in this inestimable work, and it will probably be unnecessary in
order to bring about a realization of this value to dwell! further upon
the subject.

AS MAKERS OF SOIL.

Itis a fact not generally realized that insects must take an important
part in the changes in the character of the soil which are constantly
going on. Occurring in such countless millions, as they do, constantly
penetrating the soil in all directions, frequently dragging vegetation
below the surface and bringing the subsoil up to the surtace, changing
the character of the soil humus by passing it through their bodies, and
fertilizing the earth by their own death and decay, it is probable that
insects are responsible for even more soil change than are the earth
worms, which Darwin has placed before us in such an important light.

Insects are found beneath the ground in incredible numbers. Some
of them pass their whole life underground, feeding upon roots and root-
lets, upon dead and decaying vegetable matter, upon soil humus, and
upon other insects. Many of them have their nests underground,
although they get their food elsewhere, while others hide their eggs
or pup underground.

The depth to which they penetrate is something surprising; the
minute insects of the family Poduride have been found swarming
literally by the million at a depth of 6 to 8 feet in a stiff clay subsoil.

AS FOOD AND CLOTHING AND AS USED IN THE ARTS.

In this role insects play an important part. Insects as food and
their products as clothing are well known to all. The great silk indus-
try of the world is derived wholly from insects and almost entirely
from a single species—the silkworm of commerce.

As food, insects have formed articles of diet for certain savage peoples
since the beginning of the human race. Hope, in 1842, catalogued 46
species of insects used as food, and Wallace, in 1854, showed that
insects of six different orders were used as food by the Indians of the
Amazon. Semicivilized peoples to-day use certain insects as food, as
witness the consumption of Corixa eggs by the Mexicans, and a book
has been written under the caption Why Not Eat Insects? for the pur-
pose of showing that many possibilities in the way of dietetics are
being ignored to-day. M. de Fontvielle, in addressing the Société
(Insectologie, in 1883, expressed regret that the attempts made to
popularize the use of insects as food have made so little progress, and
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 565

said that we ought not to forget the remark of the Roman emperor
who said that the body of an enemy never tasted bad, and that the
banquet of the society would always lack something so long as there
was not placed before them at least some grasshopper farina and fried
white worms.

A single insect, the honey bee, furnishes a notable article of food and
is the basis of a great and world-wide industry.

As food for poultry, song birds, and food-fish insects are indirectly of
great benefit to man. Not only do they provide living food for such
animals, but Corixa mercenaria, a water bug, is now being imported by
the ton from Mexico into England as food for birds, poultry, game, and
fish. One ton of these bugs has been computed by Mr. G. W. Kirkaldy
to contain 250,000,000 of insects.'

In the days of pure empiricism in medicine insects were used exten-
sively, and we have only to mention the Spanish fly to show that they
are still of some value. ,

In the arts shellac and Chinese white wax, as is well known, are
insect products, as also are the formerly greatly used cochineal dye and
Polish berry dye, the so-called berry in this case being an insect and
not a berry.

The last-named instances are all derived from scale insects, a group
of astonishing capacity for multiplication, the commercial possibilities
of which are by no means exhausted, as I took pleasure in showing in a

‘paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of

Science in 1897. It should be noted here also that there is good rea-
son to believe that the manna of the Bible, upon which the Children of
Israel subsisted while in the wilderness, was also the secretion of a scale
insect.

SUMMARY OF THE HABITS OF INSECTS.

After this general account, arranged under the classes of damage and
classes of benefits brought about by insects, it will be well to attempt
an arrangement of the subject in a somewhat different manner in order
to gain, if possible, some light as to the relative proportion of insects
which are injurious or beneficial.

It will be manifestly impossible to catalogue the species or the genera
in this way, and it will be obvious that a classification from families
will be lacking in exactness, since some of the families are very large
in number of species and others exceedingly small; but, taking the
groups as a whole, no better and speedier means suggests itself than
to summarize the habits by families.

Another difficulty, however, which arises in such a classification is
the fact that some orders are in a much more advanced stage of classi-
fication than others, and the force which is given to a family as a

1Entomologists’ Monthly Magazine, August, 1898.
566 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

taxonomic group varies with the views of the latest monographer.
Nevertheless, taking only the older and generally accepted families
and Pine at g habits, we find the situation to be as follows:

Of 33 families of Hymenoptera but 2 are strictly plant-feeding; the
Cynipide, or gall flies, are in the main injurious to plants, but some
forms are parasitic; 9 families are strictly parasitic upon other insects;
15 are predatory upop other insects; 2, comprising the bees, have no
other especial value in their relations with man than as pollenizers of
plants or producers of honey; 3, comprising the ants, are beneficial as
scavengers, but injurious in their other relations. It must be remem-
bered, however, that at least 27 of the 33 families are of the greatest
value in the cross fertilization of plants, in which work the insects of
this order perhaps take the lead.

In the Coleoptera, or beetles, considering 82 families, the insects of
9 families on the whole are injurious and of 23 families on the whole
are beneficial as destroying injurious insects; 10 families are beneficial
as Scavengers and 30 or more, mostly small groups of little importance,
contain some scavengers and many neutral forms of practically no
economic importance, although certain of them visit flowers; 2 families
contain both injurious and beneficial forms, as well as many that are
neutral.

In the Siphonaptera, or fleas, the species of the single family are par-
asitic upon warm-blooded animals.

In the Diptera, or true flies, if we classify the families according to
habits of the majority of the species in each, we get, approximately,
injurious families, 10; predaceous families, 11; parasitic family, 1; scav-
engers, 19. In point of numbers of individuals in this order, as well
as in the Coleoptera, no doubt the injurious will exceed the predaceous,
while in the Diptera the scavengers will probably equal all of the oth-
ers put together.

In the Lepidoptera practically all of the sixty-odd families are inju-
rious through the damage done by their larvae to vegetation; but here
again it must be remembered—and the same comment holds for many
of the Diptera which we have just considered—that the adult insects
are among the most active and frequent visitors of flowers and have a
great and beneficial effect on cross fertilization.

In the Trichoptera the insects of the single family feed upon aquatic
plants and have no economic value except as furnishing food for food-
fishes.

The insects of the single family in the order Mecoptera are indiffer-
ent in their economic relations, though probably slightly beneficial.

In the Neuroptera all of the 7 families are beneficial through their
predaceous habits, with the exception of the Sialidz, which, since their
larve are aquatic, nay be termed indifferent or neutral, though it has
both a beneficial and injurious relation to tuod-tishes,
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 567

In the Homoptera we have 9 families, all of which are injurious, except
that here and there a species has had a commercial value, like the lac
and dye insects.

In the Heteroptera there are 11 families which are strictly plant
feeders; 8 are strictly predaceous; 3 are both injurious and preda-
ceous, while the economic value of 13 is more or less doubtful. Most
of these last are aquatic and have some value as fish food.

The insects of the single family of the order Physaptera are injurious.

In the Orthoptera we have 1 family of strictly predaceous habits, 1
which has a mixed food and is partly injurious and partly beneficial, as
its species become scavengers; the habits of 1 family are unknown, while
in the 4 remaining families the species are all injurious as destroyers of
vegetation.

The insects of the single family of the order Euplexoptera are prob-
ably beneficial as predatory forms and scavengers.

The single family of the order Mallophaga is injurious, containing
parasites of birds and mammals.

In the Corrodentia the habits of the insects of the single family are,
on the whole, of little economic importance, though the species are to
be classified in the main as scavengers.

In the Isoptera the forms belonging to the two families are injurious.

In the order Plecoptera the species of the single family are practi-
cally neutral in their economic relations, although they possess some

‘value as fish food.

All of the insects of the single family of the order Odonata may be
called beneficial. The adults are predaceous upon other insects, and
are thus strictly beneficial, but the larve may in a sense be termed
injurious, since they are aquatic and prey upon other aquatic insects
which themselves may be food for fishes.

The insects of the single family of the order Ephemerida are of little
economic value, except that they are important fish food.

Lastly, the insects of eight of the families of Thysanura are beneficial
as scavengers and soil makers, while some of the species of one family
are somewhat harmful from the damage which they do in households.

Tabulating the facts thus gained we have the foliowing: Injurious as
feeding upon cultivated and useful plants, the insects of 112 families;
injurious as parasitic upon warm-blooded animals, the insects of 1
family; beneficial as preying upon other insects, the insects of 79 fami-
lies; beneficial as scavengers, the insects of 32 families; beneficial as
pollenizers only, the insects of 2 families; beneficial as forming food for
food-fishes, the insects of 3 families; of undetermined economic impor-
tance, the insects of 49 families; families containing both injurious and
beneficial forms, 22 families. The totals are: Beneficial, the insects
of 113 families; injurious, the insects of 116 TS - both, or unde-
termined, the ingedts of 71 families.
568 THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS.

CONCLUSION.

And now the question is: Are we any nearer the answer to the exact
determination of the economic value of the Class than we were at the
start? We have, perhaps, gained by this summary a clearer idea of
the economic importance of insects, and possibly it may appear by this
contrasting method that the benefits derived from them entirely offset
their injuries; but we can not, in our present stage of enlightenment
(and I say it with all reverence), complacently and piously adopt, with
the good old rector of Barham, the view that insects, with all the lower
animals, were created for man’s benefit, God permitting occasional
injuries, to use Kirby’s words, ‘not merely with punitive views, but
also to show us what mighty effects He can produce by instruments so
insignificant, thus calling on us to glorify His power, wisdom, and
goodness.”

Contrast with this view the view of Professor Bailey, in one of his
charming essays in the volume entitled The Survival of the Unlike:
“We are now prepared to admit that this whole question of enemy and
friend is a relative one, and does not depend upon right and wrong,
but simply upon our own relationships to the given animals and plants.
An insect which eats our potatoes is an enemy because we want the
potatoes, too; the insect has as much right to the potatoes as we have.
He is pressed by the common necessity of maintaining himself, and
there is every evidence that the potato was made as much for the insect
as for human kind. Dame Nature is quite as much interested in the
insect as in man. ‘What a pretty bug!’ she exclaims; ‘send him over
to Smith’s potato patch.’ But a bug which eats this insect is benefi-
ficial; that is, he is beneficial to man, not to the insect. Thus every-
thing in nature is a benefit to something and an injury to something;
and every time that conditions of life are modified the relationships
readjust themselves.”

In these words Bailey, with ie accustomed felicity, has expressed
the situation admirably. Man is but one of the forms of life struggling
for existence, at continual warfare with surrounding forms; but by
virtue of his surpassing intelligence—itself as gradually evolved as
have been the physical characteristics of any given species—he has
overrun the earth, has accommodated himself to the most unnatural
environments; he has dominated all other species in nature; he has
turned to his own uses and encouraged or hastened the evolution of
species useful to him or of useful qualities in such species; he has wiped
out of existence certain inimical forms and is gaining the control of
others. He is the dominant type, and types whose existence and meth-
ods of life are opposed to his interests are being pushed to the wall.
It is the culmination of a history which has many times repeated itself
in past ages. The struggle of other forms of life to accommodate
themselves to the conditions breught about by the rapid development
THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF INSECTS AS A CLASS. 569

of this dominant type is one of the most interesting fields of study open
to the biologist to-day. 1t would seem as if, in man’s efforts to make
the face of the earth his own, all the complicated elements of life were
arrayed against him, and the great and ultimate result of the labor of
the biologist in his study of the relations of the different forms of life
and the laws which govern their development will be to bring about
the absolute control of all other life by man. Thus itis not only the
economic worker who looks for immediate results of a practical kind
from his labor—the scientific agriculturist, the horticulturist, the eco-
nomie zoologist, the medical bacteriologist—who should command the
respect of even the practical-minded man, but the biologist in whatever
field, however restricted it may be, whether he is working toward the
understanding of broad principles and general laws, or whether in
some narrow corner of research he is accumulating material which will
help ultimately to lead to wider understandings—all are working help-
fully and practically toward the perfect well-being of the human race.

RECENT ADVANCES IN SCIENCE, AND THEIR BEARING
ON MEDICINE AND SURGERY!

By Prof. R. ViRcHOow.

The honor of being invited to deliver the second Huxley lecture has
deeply moved me. How beautiful are these days of remembrance
which have become a national custom of the English people! How
touching is this act of gratitude when the celebration is held at the
very place wherein the genius of the man whom it commemorates was
first guided toward its scientific development! We are filled not alone
with admiration for the hero, but at the same time with grateful receg-
nition of the institution which planted the seed of high achievement
in the soul of the youthful student. That you, gentlemen, should have
entrusted to a stranger the task of giving these feelings expression
seemed to me an act of such kindly sentiment, implying such perfect
confidence, that I at first hesitated to accept it. How am I to find in
a strange tongue words which shall perfectly express my feelings?
How shall I, in the presence of a circle of men who are personally
unknown to me, but of whom many knew him who has passed away
and had seen him at work, always find the right expression for that
which I wish to say as well as a member of that circle itself could? I
dare not believe that I shall throughout succeed in this. But if, in
spite of all, I repress my scruples it is because I know how indulgently
my English colleagues will judge my often incomplete statements, and
how fully they are inclined to pardon deficiency in diction if they are
convinced of the good intentions of the lecturer.

PROFESSOR HUXLEY’S WORK.

I may assume that such a task would not have been allotted to me
had not those who imposed it known how deeply the feeling of admira-
tion for Huxley is roeted within me, had they not seen how fully I
recognized the achievements of the dead master from his first epoch-

making publications, and how greatly I prized the personal friendship
which he extended toward me. In truth, the lessons that I received
from him in his laboratory—a very modest one according to present
conditions—and the introduction to his work which lowe tohim form one
of the pleasantest and most lasting recollections of my visit to Ken-
sington. The most competent witness of Huxley’s earliest period of
development, Professor Foster, presented in the first of these lectures!
a picture of the rapidly increasing extension of the biological knowl-
edge which must have excited not only our admiration but also the emula-
tion of all who study medicine. Upon me the duty is incumbent of
incorporating with this presentment the newer strides of knowledge
and of stating their influence upon the art of healing. So great a task
is this that it would be presumptuous even to dare to attempt its accom-
plishment in a single lecture. I have decided, therefore, that I must
confine myself to merely sketching the influence of biological discoy-
eries upon medicine. In this way, also, will the example of Huxley be
most intelligible to us. I must here make a confession. When I tried
to ascertain how much time would be required to deliver my lecture as
I had prepared it, I found, to my regret, that its delivery would occupy
nearly double the time assigned tome. I had therefore to reduce it to
about half of its original dimensions. This could only be done by means
of very heroic cuts, seriously damaging in more than one place my
chain of ideas. If, therefore, you should find, gentlemen, that my
transitions from one point to the other occasionally are of a somewhat
sudden and violent character, I trust you will bear with me and remem-
ber that, if you should take the trouble of reading my address after-
ward, you will be less shocked than you may be to-day by my statements
when they appear in print.

THE BEGINNINGS OF BIOLOGY.

Huxley himself, though trained in the practical school of Charing
Cross Hospital, won his special title to fame in the domain of biology.
As a matter of fact, at that time even the name of biology had not |
come into general use. It was only recently that the idea of life itself
obtained its full significance. Even in the late Middle Ages it had not
sufficient strength to struggle through the veil of dogmatism into the
light. Iam glad to be able to-day for the second time to credit the
English nation with the service of having made the first attempts to
define the nature and character of life. It was Francis Glisson who,
following expressly in the footsteps of Paracelsus, investigated the
principium vite. If he could not elucidate the nature of life, he at least
recognized its main characteristic. This is what he was the first to
describe as ‘“‘irritability,” the property on which the energy of living

1 This lecture by Prof. Michael Foster is reprinted in the Smithsonian Report for
1896, pages 339-364.
RECENT ADVANCES IN SCIENCE BEARING ON MEDICINE. 9573

matter depends. How great was the step from Paracelsus to Glisson
and, we may continue, from Glisson to Hunter! According to Para-
celsus, life was the work of a special spiritus, which set material sub-
stance in action, like a machine; for Glisson, matter itself was the
principium energeticum. Unfortunately, he did not confine this dictum
to living substances only, but applied it to substance in general, to all
matter. It was Hunter who first announced the specific nature of liv-
ing matter as contrasted with nonliving, and he was led to place a
materia vite diffusa at the head of his physiological and pathological
views. According to the teaching of Hewson and Hunter, the blood
supplied the plastic materials of physiology as well as the plastic
exudates of pathology. Such was the basis of the new biological
method, if one can apply such an expression to a still incomplete
doctrine, in 1842, when Huxley was beginning his medical studies at
Charing Cross Hospital. It would lead too far afield were I to recount
in this place how it happened that I myself, like Huxley, was early
weaned from the pernicious doctrines of humoral pathology.

THK DEVELOPMENT OF BIOLOGY.

When Huxley himself left Charing Cross Hospital, in 1846, he had
enjoyed a rich measure of instruction in anatomy and physiology.
Thus trained, he took the post of naval surgeon, and by the time that
he returned, four years later, he had become a perfect zoologist and a
keen-sighted ethnologist. How this was possible anyone will readily
understand who knows from his own experience how great the value
of personal observation is for the development of independent and
unprejudiced thought. For a young man who, besides collecting a

rich treasure of positive knowledge, has practiced dissection and the

exercise of a critical judgment, along sea voyage and a peaceful sojourn
among entirely new surroundings afford an invaluable opportunity for
original work and deep reflection. Freed from the formalism of the
schools, thrown upon the use of his own intellect, compelled to test
each single object as regards properties and history, he soon forgets
the dogmas of the prevailing system and becomes first a skeptic and
then an investigator. This change, which did not fail to affect Huxley,
and through which arose that Huxley whom we commemorate to-day,
is no unknown occurrence to one who is acquainted with the history
not only of knowledge, but also of scholars. Weneed only to point to

John Hunter and Darwin as closely allied examples. The path on

which these men have achieved their triumphs is that which biology in
general has trodden with ever-widening strides since the end of last
century—it is the path of genetic investigation. We Germans point
with pride to our countryman who opened up this road with full con-
viction of its importance, and who directed toward it the eyes of the ©
world—our poet-prince Goethe. What he accomplished in particular
574 RECENT ADVANCES IN SCIENCE BEARING ON MEDICINE.

from plants others of our fellow-countrymen achieved from animals— ~
Wolf, Meckel, and our whole embryological school. As Harvey, Haller,
and Hunter had once done, so these men began also with the study of
the “ovulum,” but this very soon showed that the egg was itself
organized, and that from it arose the whole series of organic develop-
ments. When Huxley, after his return, came to publish his funda-
mental observations, he found the history of the progressive trans-
formations of the contents of the egg already verified, for it was by
now known that the egg was a cell, and that from it fresh cells and
from them organs arose. The second of his three famous papers—that
on the relationship between man and the animals next beneath himn—
limned in exemplary fashion the parallelism in the earliest development
ot all animal beings. But beyond this it stepped boldly across the
border line which tradition and dogma had drawn between man and
beast. Huxley had no hesitation in filling the gaps which Darwin had
leftin his argument, and in explaining that “in respect of substance and
structure man and the lower animals are one.” Whatever opinion one
may hold as to the origin of mankind, the conviction as to the funda-
mental correspondence of human organization with that of avimals is
at present universally accepted.

OMNIS CELLULA FE CELLULA.

* * * The greatest difficulty in the advance of biology has been
the natural tendency of its disciples to set the search after the unity of
life in the forefront of their inquiries. Hence arose the doctrine of
vital force, an assumption now discarded, but still revealing its influ-
ence from time to time in isolated errers. No satisfactory progress could
be made till the idea of highly organized living things as units had
been set aside; till it was recognized that they were in reality organ-
isms, each constituent part of which had its special life. Ultimate
analysis of higher animals and plants brings us alike to the cell, and
it is these single parts, the cells, which are to be regarded as the
factors of existence. The discovery of the development of complete
beings from the ova of animals and the germ-cells of plants has bridged
the gap between isolated living cells and complete organisms, and has
enabled the study of the former to be employed in elucidating the life
of the latter. In a medical school where the teaching is almost exclu-
sively concerned with human beings this sentence should be writ
large: ‘The organism is not an individual, but a social mechanism.”
Two corollaries must also be stated—(1) that every living organ-
ism, like every organ and tissue, contains cells; (2) that the cells are
composed of organic chemical substances, which are not themselves
alive. The progress of truth in these matters was much retarded by
that portion of Schwann’s cell theory, which sought to establish the
RECENT ADVANCES IN SCIENCE BEARING ON MEDICINE. 575

existence of free cell formation, which really implied the revival of the
old doctrine of spontaneous generation. This belief was gradually
driven out of the domain of zoology, but in connection with the forma-
tion of plastic exudates found a sanctuary in that of pathology. I
myself was taught the discontinuity of pathological growths—a view
which would logically lead back to the origin of living from nonliving
matter. But enlightenment in this matter came to me. At the end of
my academical career I was acting as clinical assistant in the eye
department of the Berlin Hospital, and I was struck by the fact that
keratitis and corneal wounds healed without the appearance of plastic
exudation, and I was thus led to study the process of inflammation in
other nonvascular structures, such as articular cartilages and the intima
of the larger vessels. In no one of these cases was plastic exudation
found, but in all of them were changes in the tissue cells. Turning
next to vascular organs, and in particular those which are the common
seats of exudation processes, I succeeded in demonstrating that the
presence of cells in inflammatory exudates was not the result of exuda-
tion, but of multiplication of preexisting cells. Extending this to the
growth in thickness of the long bones—which was ascribed by Duhamel
to organization of a nutritious juice exuded by the periosteal vessels—
I was thus eventually able to extend the biological doctrine of omnis
cellula e cellula to pathological processes as well; every new formation
presupposing a matrix or tissue from which its cells arise and the
stamp of which they bear.

HEREDITY.

Herein also lies the key to the mystery of heredity. The humoral
theory attributed this to the blood, and based the most fantastic ideas
upon this hypothesis. We know now that the cells are the factors of
the inherited properties, the sources of the germs of new tissues and
the motive power of vital action. It must not, however, be supposed
that all the problems of heredity have thus been solved. Thus, for
instance, a general explanation of theromorphism, or the appearance
of variations recalling the lower animals, is still to be found. Each
case must be studied on its merits, and an endeavor made to discover
whether it arose by atavism or by hereditary transmission of an acquired
condition. As to the occurrence of the latter mode of origin, I can
express myself positively. Equally difficult is the question of heredi-
tary diseases; this is now generally assumed to depend on the trans-
mission of a predisposition which is present, though not recognizable,
in the earliest cells, being derived from the paternal or maternal tissues.
But the most elaborately constructed doctrines as to the hereditariness
of a given disorder may break down before the discovery of an actual
causa viva. A notable example of this is found in the case of leprosy,
576 RECENT ADVANCES IN SCIENCE BEARING ON MEDICINE.

the transmission of which by inheritance was at one time so firmly
believed in that thirty years ago a law was nearly passed in Norway
forbidding the marriage of members of leprous families. I myself,
however, found that a certain number of cases at any rate did not arise
in this way, and my results were confirmed by the discovery of the
leprous bacillus by Armauer Hansen. In a moment the hereditary
theory of the disease was overthrown and the old view of its acquire-
ment by contagion restored. Precisely the same happened a few
decades earlier with regard to favus and scabies. Another instructive
condition is that known as Heterotopia, in which fragments of tissues
or organs are found dwelling in a situation other than that which is
normal to them. This is particularly the case with certain glands,
such as the thyroid and suprarenal, but is also known with cartilage,
teeth, and the various constituents of dermoids. It no doubt occurs
by process of transplantation, the misplaced tissues developing no new
properties, but merely preserving their normal powers of growth.
The attempt to generalize from this fact and te attribute all tumor
formation to this cause carries the idea beyond its proper scientific
limits.

PARASITISM AND INFECTION.

With regard to the subject of parasitism, the progress of scientific
observation was retarded for centuries by the prevalence of the assump-
tion made by Paracelsus that disease in general was to be regarded asa
parasite. Pushed to its logical conclusion, this view would imply that
each independent living part of the organism would act as a parasite
relatively to the others. The true conception of a parasite implies its
harmfulness to its host. The larger animal parasites have been longest
known, but it is not so many years since their life history has been
completely ascertained and the nature of their cysts explained, while
an alternation of generations has been discovered in those which are
apparently sexless. Very much more recent is the detection of the
parasitic protozoa, by which the occurrence of the tropical fevers may
be explained. As yet we have not complete knowledge as to their life
history, but we hold the end of the chain by which this knowledge can
be attained. The élite of the infectious diseases are, however, the work
of the minutest kind of parasitic plants, bacteria, the scientific study
of which may be said to date from Pasteur’s immortal researches upon
putrefaction and fermentation. The observation of microbes under
exact experimental conditions, and the chemical investigation of their
products opened up the modern field of bacteriology, a science among
the early triumphs of which were the discoveries of the bacilli of tuber-
cle and Asiatic cholera by Robert Koch. In connection with this sub-
ject three important landmarks requirecomment. One is the necessity
for distinguishing between the cause and the essential nature of infec-

tious diseases, the latter of which is determined by the reaction of the
tissues and organs to microbes. Secondly, there is the relation between
the smaller parasites and the diseases determined by them. This may
be summed up in the general word (introduced by Professor Virchow
himself) “infection.” But to assume that all infections result from the
action of bacteria is to go beyond the domain of present knowledge,
and probably to retard further progress. ‘The third point is the ques-
tion as to the mode of action of infection. It is only the larger parasites
whose main effect is the devouring of parts of their hosts; the smaller
act mainly by the secretion of virulent poisons. The recognition of this
- latter fact has led to the brilliant work of Lister on the one hand and
to the introduction.of serum therapeutics on the other.

ANTISEPTIC SURGERY.

It would be carrying coals to Newcastle were I to sketch in London
the beneficial effects which the application of methods of cleanliness
has exercised upon surgical practice. In the city wherein the man still
lives and works who, by devising this treatment has introduced the
greatest and most beneficent reform that the practical branches of
medical science have ever known, everyone is aware that Lord Lister,
on the strength of his original reasoning, arrived at practical results
which the new theory of fermentative and septic processes fully con-
firmed. Before anyone had succeeded in demonstrating by exact
methods the microbes which are active in different diseases, Lister has
learned, in a truly prophetic revelation, the means by which protection
against the action of putrefactive organism can be attained. The open-
ing up of further regions of clinical medicine to the knife of the surgeon
and a perfect revolution in the basis of therapeutics have been the con-
sequence. Lord Lister, whom I am proud to be able to greet as an old
friend, is already and always will be reckoned among the greatest
_ benefactors of the human race. May he long be spared to remain at the
head of the movement which he called into existence.

ARTIFICIAL IMMUNISATION.

It remains for me to say a word concerning the other great problem,

- the solution of which the whole werld is awaiting with anxious impa-
tience. I refer to the problem of immunity and its practical corollary,
artificial immunisation. It has already happened once that an English-
man has succeeded in applying this to the definite destruction of at least
one of the most deadly infectious diseases. Jenner’s noble discovery
has stood its trial as successfully, except in popular fancy, as he hoped.
_ Vaccine is in all hands; vaccination is, with the aid of governments,
spreading continually. Pasteur also labored with determination; others
have followed him, and the new doctrine of antitoxines is continually

acquiring more adherents. But it has not yet emerged from the conflict
of opinions, and still less is the secret of immunity itself revealed. We
must become well accustomed to the thought that only the next century
can bring light and certainty on this point. [Professor Virchow, having
referred with pride to the influence of cellular pathology in modern
treatment, entailing, as it does, the principle of destroying the focus of
disease by early operation, concluded his lecture in these words: May
the Medical School of Charing Cross Hospital continue upon the newly
opened path with zeal and good fortune. But may its students at the
same time never forget that neither the physician nor the naturalist
dares to dispense with a cool head and a calm spirit, with practical
- observation and critical judgment. |

A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.!

By F. E. PEISER.

The preparation of a history of Babylonian culture is surronnded with
so many difficulties that only those but slightly acquainted with its
aspects would dare to undertake the task. In fact, the most necessary
preliminary studies have been begun only within the last few years.
Historical works on the subject show a disregard or ignorance of the
elements of the history of culture, while the preliminary works which
have appeared lack more or less the bond of interrelationship. It is,
therefore, not an unimportant work to give for a part of the history of
culture an outline, or skeleton, about which the scattered and discon-
nected studies, thus far attempted, may rally, and thus make it pos-
sible to proceed more methodically in the consideration of individual
questions.

For these reasons I have decided to condense several lectures written

some years ago into the present publication, which neither claims

completeness nor to pronounce the final word. On the contrary, I
hope that sharp criticism will be aroused by this sketch, through which
the common aim or object may be advanced. As this is really a sketch
of the subject I have refrained from citing and collating authorities
which are to find their place in monographs to follow; and this also
explains why I have taken up society as a unit, and scarcely more than
indicated its development. The work is based mainly upon the condi-
tions of Babylon in the sixth and seventh centuries before the Christian
era. In going still farther backward, the task is to unravel the close-
meshed fabric of Babylonian culture and to study the history of its
development along the individual strands.

In the activity of thousands of years the Euphrates and the Tigris
have built up from alluvial drift the territory between their arms. Sand
and stones, stripped by the melting snow from the Armenian Moun-
tain peaks, have formed deposits which pushed the Persian Gulf ever
farther back toward the suuth and east. Thus we have in the south
a province with no mountainous formations, but only plains and hills
of sand, with but few stones. The plain is traversed by the two rivers

named, which differ in relative level at two points; at one place the
water of the Euphrates flows over and feeds the Tigris, while 100 miles
southward an equalization occurs by the reflux of the Tigris into the
Euphrates.

If we consider the climate of the country, we find in the south, in the
whole of Babylonia, the characteristics of the hot desert climate modi-
fied only by the moisture from the rivers. The desert extends up along
the Euphrates and spreads far away beyond it over to Mesopotamia.
Nevertheless we must form no false picture of the Mesopotamian des-
ert. After heavy rains it is overgrown by vegetation with wonderful
rapidity; and the traveler from the Occident is often amazed when,
after the rain, the entire desert appears yellow with crocus plants or
blue with other growths. At such times the Arabian nomads cross the
Euphrates to pasture their cattle, and thus thousands of years ago
strife arose between the residents and the invaders, which centinued
yet further during the historical development.

So far as historical notices accessible up to this time extend, there
still remains the sole probability that in the south of the country trav-
ersed by the two streams, northward, eastward, and westward from the
Persian Gulf, originally dwelt people of a race who used an agglutina-
tive language, were characterized by a compact bodily frame, and were
of a Mongoloid type. I do not wish to enter deeply into several much
too radical theories concerning the Sumerians and their racial affinities;
I would merely like to refer to the fact that I have already in my
book, Hittite Inscriptions, called attention to the possibility of a connec-
tion between the so-called Hittites, non-Aryan proto-Armenians, and
Sumerians, and that the ancient population of Elam might easily be
included with these. But even in the earliest times Semites appear to
the north of the district bordering on the Persian Gulf. As in the
historical development between 2000 and 600 B. C., two invasions and
settlements of Semitic nomads can be recorded, in which connection the
theory advanced by Winckler concerning the Aramezans and the Chal-
deans is especially to be noticed, it is very natural to assume also for
these most ancient Semites a nomadic period, which had already ended
when history begins to raise the curtain before our searching eyes.

The political supremacy of these oldest Semites introduced racial
variations. We may look upon the invading Kassites from the Kas-
sean mountains as a third element, which also for a time furnished the
acknowledged rulers of Babylonia.! The second” wave of Semitic immi-
gration, the Aramaic tribes, had begun in the time of the Kassu rule,
and for centuries furnished the nomadic population of the steppes,
against whom the population of the cities were engaged in struggle. The

1 These Kassites soon succumbed to the higher civilization of the Semites, who, in
their turn, stood upon the shoulders of the Sumerians.

2Or the third,if it is necessary, as now appears to be clear, to assume, after the
Babylonian-Semitic immigration, a Canaanitic one. (I, dynasty from Babylon.)
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 581

advances of the tribes and the retreats of the agricultural population
were accompanied by ruins of dikes and canals until a strong hand
again forced the nomads back and restored the water courses. These
tribes became gradually settled and constituted the fourth racial element,
as appears from several historical notices and from Assyrian contracts.

Finally, we must notice the pushing forward of the Semitic Kaldi
tribes from the south, and the contemporaneous efforts of the Assyrians
from the north to obtain the supremacy in Babylonia. But while the
preceding four elements composed the basis or foundation out of and
upon which ruling classes developed, these two latter parties formed
external factors which influenced the social and political life of Babylon.

If we also mention as a potent external factor the Elamite monarchy,
which endeavored to play off the Kaldi and the Assyrians against each
other in their struggle for Babylon, we have briefly sketched the pic-
ture of the inhabitants, their origin, and those of their neighbors who
come into consideration.

From these elements and their sediment was formed what we are
accustomed to regard as the Babylonian state. We must not imagine
an oriental state, however, as being any such firmly-welded whole as
are our modern Kuropean states. Race feeling operated in a manner
altogether different from among us. There the whole life of the State
was concentrated about great cult centers. Surface configuration,
intercourse relations, and the coincident power of single provinces
welded a greater political unit about a cult center. Thus was formed
a political organization that perhaps soon after was merged into a
larger unit, and left nothing but a name behind it in proof of its former
existence. Among these political units we know of Sumer and Akkad,
that is the power once connected with Ur, the Kingdom of Babylon;
also smaller ones in the north, such as the kingdom of ‘‘ the four regions”
and the Kingdom of Kisshat, of which the cult center is not yet pre-
cisely determined but probably to be sought in northern Mesopotamia.!
Farther away from the proper center lies Elam, which had attained the
rank of a State since primeval times. We see Assyria and farther to
the north, the proto-Armenian tribes.

The political history of Babylon, even in the earliest times, presents
an alternating picture of centralization and disintegration of the empires
embodying the centralization. The question presents itself, what could
have been the cause which in so remote a period again and again led
to the consolidation of a great district, while as yet, in all neighboring
provinces, with few exceptions, only a more or less feeble tribal bond
could be formed. The answer may be inferred from the following
circumstances:

(1) As soon as an individual by reason of the domination of one of
the smaller commonwealths had succeeded in restoring the centraliza-

1 According to Winckler, whose theory we follow, perhaps Harran.
582 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

tion after a period of its decay, his main efforts were especially directed
toward the restoration of the neglected canals.

(2) During a decline of the central authority the canals became
choked with sand.

(3) The Babylonians imagined the period of such political weakness
to be a timeof anger of the gods, who were deserting the country and
giving the supremacy over to its enemies.

(4) The hydrographic conditions of the country of the two rivers
were of such nature as in themselves to call for regulation and utiliza-
tion. For, while the bed of the Tigris in its northern portion is lower
than the Euphrates, so that the latter seeks an outlet toward the former ~
during inundations, farther on, at the second confluence of the rivers,
itis higher. This peculiarity, which apparently contradicts the fact
that the Tigris in that part flows much more swiftly than the Euphrates,
is explained by the fact that the former flows in a straight course, and
thus has a much shorter distance to traverse than the Kuphrates,
which describes a largeloop. And while the swifter course of the Tigris
prevents it from choking its channel, the Euphrates at once covers its
domain, its bed, and channels with its alluvial drift whenever a sys-
tematic regulation is not kept in continuous operation. It repeatedly
fills its own channel, tears away the banks, and reduces the painfully
acquired agricultural land to swamp and waste again.

In reply, then, to the inquiry as to the cause of this ever-reappearing
centralization, it may be answered that the nomads who first settled in
the country of the two rivers were compelled by the hydrographic con-
ditions to regulate the river system; this regulation demanded and
developed an administrative center; these conditions gave as a result
the idea that the country belonged to the gods; and this idea had
force to bring about a real centralization. Ideas continue in activity
thousands of years after the conditions cat of which they arose have
altered. We must not be surprised, therefore, at finding this idea
operative under later conditions; we may even use it as a clue to the
complicated life of New Babylon.

If, now, we consider the State—I speak, of course, of the individual
States in their inward and outward design—we have to regard two
factors: (1) The State centers about one focus of cult. For the Orient
this cult center is of the greatest importance, since the development of
the State is most closely connected withit. (2) The other point of view
is the political-economic. The citizens of each onecf these States became
landowners soon after they had settled in Mesopotamia. They did not
cultivate the land themselves, however, but the work was done by serfs
or semiserfs, obtained by military expeditions and by purchase. We
have private contracts from which we see how boat expeditions were
undertaken up the Euphrates against the northern provinces, where
the less civilized tribes lived, and in which the contractors, who in this
case were merchants and freebooters, undertook to procure slaves.
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 583

Among the Assyrians, in contrast to Babylonia, the idea of the State
was one of somewhat firmer consolidation. This was caused by the
situation of Assyria, wedged between Babylonia and northern Meso-
potamia, and by the institution of a mercenary army since Tiglath-
Pileser I, which was likewise an efficient factor in the formation of a
stronger government than in Babylonia. Nevertheless, the political
institutions of the two States are somewhat similar.

The officials were grouped in three orders—those who were occupied
with the internal administration; those who watched over the neigh-
boring and tributary States, and the military service that guarded the
interests of the State against enemies, and were frequently employed
as governors of subjugated States and tribes. The old nobility had,
moreover, a direct interest in the State, inasmuch as they preeminently
shared the offices among themselves.

The. remaining subjects of the King were partly direct and partly
indirect, and the latter certainly, in so far as they were, first of all, sub-
ordinate to the hierarchy of a temple.

The interest that the individual citizens had in the State lay, apart
from the especial interests of the nobles, in the defense against outward
attack and in the maintenance of law and’justice; and we find, in fact,
that the Babylonian State was characterized by a highly developed
juridical life. As against the nomadic tribes the domestic militia and
mercenaries had to suffice more or less, while against the neighboring
powers the tribes themselves were now and again impressed into service.

Of the constitution of the Babylonian State we know very little
indeed, and the little we do know is of a negative character, only as
the documents give us information of the abrogation of this or that
privilege, etc. Besides that, there are preserved to us several charters
from Babylonian provinces, which grant certain prerogatives to one
family or another. Thus it was legally established that officials of the
State should not enter a free territory of this kind; that its inhabitants
should not be arrested by the State police nor be constrained to the
performance of a number of various villein services owed to the State.
We may probably assume that certain cities obtained charters or fran-
chises, but we have only proofs for the investure of foreigners with civic
rights first in the time of the Persians, when very soon resounds the
ery “Civis Susanus sum” (I am a citizen of Susa), which is important
for our appreciation of Cyrus’s statesmanship.

Erom all accounts we must conclude that the Babylonian kingdom
was divided into provinces, which were subdivided into administrative
districts, within which lay the free family estates. Everywhere but
in the free estates or territories the central authority had the right to
command arrests, to construct roads, bridges, etc., and to collect stal-
lions for the breeding studs of the Government, or to make arrange-
ments for the maintenance of the studs. The contrast thus made
apparent between the rights of the general Government and those of

584 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

the free estates indicates a period of transition from the feudal to the
centralized system. The former is, of course, the earlier, and bears
witness to a time when the families were absolutely independent. With
the growth of the central power, however, the importance and influence
of the old families diminished, and only now and then occurred a relapse
into the feudal system, such as, for instance, we learn from the char-
ters. Such privileged territories were generally held in the possession
of the old noble families. These also furnished the State with the entire
force of its dignitaries, and the high political offices very often descended
from father to son.

The citizens were, indeed, as explained above, very different as
regards race and legal status, but soon became amalgamated under the
influence of the higher civilization.

The Babylonians appear to us enterprising and rather vindictive and
litigious, as shown by the numerous lawsuits. In their relations with
the gods they assumed the position of equals, and yet at the same time
displayed the deepest submission. They made offerings to the gods,
but also demanded favors in return. If a person had once committed
an offense, however, he could not lament sufficiently before the higher
powers.

The family formed the focus of the whole life of the Babylonians, and
presented a united and unbroken front. Thus we often find the inter-
ests of the State and those of the family in conflict. The sharp sepa-
ration of the families from one another is easily explained by the former
nomadic life of these peoples.

Since, moreover, the individuals of a clan were dependent upon one
another, the legal conception was gradually developed that the property
of an individual belonged not to himself, but to his whole family. We
may thus explain the fact that real estate could be soid only on condi-
tion that the other members of the family gave their assent or signified
their willingness by their presence while the bill of sale was being
drawn up. A further important factor in the development of the
family life is ancestor worship and the conceptions resulting from it,
which have had the greatest influence in the religious develoument of
the Semites.

The families are, then, as we have seen, the actual units out of which
the State is composed. The individual members of the family stand,
therefore, in a somewhat freer position as regards the State; they feel
that they are first of all members of their own family, from which their
connection with the State results secondarily.

The relation of the King to the subject was a double one. (1) The ~
king was the highest representative of the family, which implies the
conception of the whole State as one family. Under this conception
he was the representative of his subjects in their relations with the
gods, and had as such a great authority. (2) The king, however, did
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 58h

not belong to the particular families to which the individual subjects
belonged. Therefore family interests in this regard often overbalanced
the duty owed to the King.

The individual families in Babylon were often at ermnity with one
another, and this antagonism had close relations with external politics.
All the powers round about Babylon, as the Elamites, Assyrians, and
Kaldi, had their partisans in the city. The partisans, however, belonged
respectively to the different families. According as the influence of
this or that external power predominated in Babylon, one family was
played off against another, and their relative possessions were thus
shifted accordingly. The two boundary stones belonging to this period—
one dated from Sargon, the other from Merodach-Baladan—are very
good illustrations of this condition.

The relation of children te their parents was at first a rather patri-
archal one, traces of which are found down to the latest times. We
have a document from which appears the father’s right of protest on
the occasion of his son’s intended marriage. The son might, indeed,
marry against his father’s will, but in that case the marriage was not
of full validity. On the other hand we find phenomena which result
from the further development of the family under the influence of private
property rights. Documents dated from about 2300 B. C. refer to adop-
tion to gain laborers. Another kind of adoption was one for the pur-
pose of the fulfillment of obligations imposed by ancestor worship; that
is to say, if there were no sons, a slave might be adopted, who should,
after the father’s death, bring him the customary offerings. We often
see that elderly Babylonians intrusted themselves to a child or adopted
slave for care and shelter, and made over their property to the child
on condition of being supported by him. This custom is to be regarded
already as a result of the evolution from collective to individual prop-
erty rights.

We do not know much about Babylonian education. We can only
draw inferences from what Assurbanipal relates concerning his educa-
tion in the bit riduti (nursery). He states that he was trained in feats
of bodily dexterity, and in reading and writing as well. We may prob-
ably assume that the well-to-do families had their children taught in a
writing schooi (bit dupsaruti). We have fragments of tablets in which
mention is made of a writing house, and there are still extant copies of
historical and epic works prepared by writing pups and then presented
to a library.

Trades were diligently practiced, and children and slaves were bound
apprentices to master craftsmen. The period of apprenticeship lasted
several months or several years, according to the difficulty of the trade.
This may have been the case among business men as well, for we find
slaves who carried on business for their masters. If the slave proved
to be true and clever, he might even be manumitted, but he still retained
586 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

a connection with the family. Although then, in this case, the idea of
the family did not rest upon blood relationship, it nevertheless appeared
strong in all directions.

If, now, we compare the inference from the particulars gathered con-
cerning the family with that drawn from the inscriptions, it is shown
that what is apparent from the documents was also legally established.
For example, sons-in-law could pass over into the family of the wife and
become legally associated to the ancestor worship of this family.

As regards the relation of the family to the temple, we must make a
distinction between the oldest cults existing within the domains of the
individual families and the cults of entire cities. No especial imposts
were necessary for the former, since these cults were cared for solely
by the members of the respective families. For the latter, on the con-
trary, special taxes were raised by the king. Occasionally, however, it
happened, also, that the king assigned to a temple a whole family, who
then had to provide for its maintenance. This probably occurred for
the most part after insurrections had been quelled.

In the deportations so often practiced by the Assyrians, the question
is always of the noble families, who were thereby placed in a trying
situation. They might, indeed, carry on their religious observances
even at their place of exile, but were yet obliged to feel themselves in
banishment, since, according to its idea, ancestor worship was attached
to the graves of their forefathers. Upon the latter point we have but
little material; nevertheless, this much is evident from it—that it was
not necessary that the graves should be separate. We find, on the
contrary, in Babylonia, great sepulchers, whither the dead from whole
districts were brought. These sepulchers were naturally the centers
for the surrounding district, and individual families connected them-
selves, respectively, with such a temple and such a sepulcher. To
understand the development of the family upon the religious basis of
ancestor worship is extremely important in the historical consideration
of the Semitic nations, and without this understanding a number of
facts can not be explained.

The attempt has been made to prove the existence of a matriarchate
also among the Semites, and it has been thought possible to adduce
evidence for this view from the oldest inscriptions. This theory
depends upon the arrangement of the names of the gods and god-
desses and of the ideograms for man and woman. Nevertheless, the
fact that in the Sumerian texts the feminine element precedes the
masculine is capable of explanation on other grounds.

It appears, however, from the Old Babylonian decuments that the
wife could conclude independent private contracts; and that she had a
legal standing in the family circle as well as before a court of law; that
is, She was capable of being her own representative in regard to her
own affairs. She had her private property and retained the right to
dispose of it. Between the thirtieth and the twentieth centuries B. C.
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 587

marriage had already developed in Babylonia upon the basis of indi-
vidual property rights. Of course there existed at the same time rem-
nants of more ancient modes of marriage, especially when the contract-
ing parties were not of equal caste. Thus we have in the time of the
New Babylonian Kingdom—that is, about the seventh century B. C.—a
case where a man married a singer. In the marriage contract the death
penalty was laid upon the eventual unfaithfulness of the wife; the hus-
band, on the other hand, could put his wife away forthwith on the pay-
ment to her of a specified sum of money. In ordinary cases the wife
obtained her dowry back if she was repudiated. The children remained
in the husband’s family. There are, however, remnants of a system
where, upon a separation, the daughters followed the mother. The
material does no% suffice to furnish answers to all questions relative to
this subject.

We find women active in trade, industry, and agriculture, and
although here, as elsewhere, men were in preponderance, we see them
as priestesses in public worship. In the more ancient time they had
not only the religious ceremonials to perform, but authority to manage
the property of the deity. Women were also much esteemed as proph-
etesses. Thus there was in Arbela a temple which harbored a great
number of prophetesses who were, for example, much consulted by
Asarhaddon.

After all that I have said about the position of woman there is no
occasion for surprise if we find her in an influential position as queen.
An indication of this is the short notice in the synchronistic history
that an Assyrian princess ascended the Babylonian throne, and, vice
versa, we find in the ninth century the Babylonian princess Samuramn-
mat upon the Assyrian throne. The latter had an important sovereign
position. We find that she exercised influence upon the internal life
of the State whose king she had married, and that she doubled Baby-
lonian influence in Assyria. It is very probable that the legend of the
Greeks concerning Semiramis can be traced back to the important
position of Samurammat, to whose name, however, whole myths of the
goddess Istar have been transferred. Reliefs from the time of Assur-
banipal show that the position of the queen was an important one in
this time, as well, and a similar conclusion concerning the position of
the middle-class woman can be drawn from the documents. * * *

Among the slaves we must distinguish between (1) those that were
in the private possession of an individual; (2) the gleb« adscripti,
villeins, who in part had arisen from the condition of slaves, in part
had been reduced from the condition of freemen into serfdom; (5) the
temple slaves, some of whom were purchased and some presented to the
temple by pious citizens cr by kings; (4) those belonging to the State,
captives of war, of whom the greater part passed into the possession of
individuals or of the temple. The first and third classes were employed
in industries and about houses, the second in the cultivation of land.
588 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

We must consider industry in Babylon as highly developed. A large
number of certificates of delivery have come down to us, from which it
appears (1) that private individuals in Babylonia possessed industrial
establishments of the nature of factories, and (2) that the temples were
great factories. The slaves were let out to work by their masters, and
the hire either given to the slave, in case he himself delivered to his
master the profit due from him as slave and maintained himself, or, on
the other hand, given to the master if the latter provided for the slave’s
maintenance. Finally, the employer might give the slave his mainte-
nance and the surplus earnings of the slave to the master. In this case
the slave also received something for his labors. Thus the slave might
accumulate a little capital. Besides, slavery was not as harsh in the
Orient as in the Occident. The slave might buy his own freedom, and
could be adopted and become a member of the family and rise to the
highest places.

If one compares the employer’s expenses when slaves were hired with
the cost of free laborers, the latter are in most cases considerably moré
expensive. This appears to contradict an economic law that work
under like conditions should receive equal compensation. I believe
that I am able to solve the riddle in the following manner: Ifa frée
man entered into service, he had no claim for compensation if he be-
came sick or disabled by his work. The slave, on the contrary, must
be maintained by his master, and there were laws according to which
whoever hired a slave was required to pay an indemnity to lis master
during the continuance of any disability incurred by the slave while a
servant. Slaves were well protected by these exceedingly humane
laws. Everyone who hired slaves belonging to others took good care
not to disable them by overburdening. their strength. As a conse-
quence, the wages for a slave were smaller than those of a free man,
who was obliged to forego indemnity if he received an injury from his
work.

As for the glebe adscripti, they correspond to our tenants by villein
service; they had to perform a kind of corvée, that is, they were
obliged to work for the landowner on certain days. In most cases,
these slaves belonged to a temple and, on this acoount, the temple had
also jurisdiction over the slaves belonging to it. Fugitive and refrac-
tory slaves were put in chains, but might be released upon the guar-
anty of acomrade. Documents referring to such cases are extant.

Upon military matters in Babylon little has been handed down to us.
The foreign rulers of the successive periods had their own national
troops, and probably seldom drafted the Babylonians themselves into
military service. These troops gradually became property owners and
Babylonians, which explains the clinging to the most ancient custom,
namely. that the possession of landed property implied the obligation
to furnish soldiers.

From the manner of the origin of the central powers, as sketched
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 589

above, aS well as from the idea that the country was subject to the
gods, on the one side, and from the repeated political revolutions on the
other, it results, as a matter of course, that out of the tribal possession
of the land three forms of ownership must have developed: (1) Temple
ownership; (2) State ownership, and (3) only secondarily, private owner-
ship. All three forms are met in the New Babylonian documents,
naturally with many variations.

Temple ownership developed out of the proprietary claim upon the
whole territory comprised in the district about the temple. Originally
a Share of the products was yielded on this account to the deity and,
therefore, to his tempie. Naturally, in the evolution of things, conflicts
of rights must have arisen, and thus, even in the oldest documents as
yet in the Sumerian language, we see the kings engaged in regulating
the temple revenues. Although gradually a partial conversion of the
payments in kind into monetary payments took place the former
remained by far the most prevalent, even in the Babylon of Nebuchad-
nezzar and the Persians, as the contract tablets show.' Since,
especially in years of bad harvests and in times of war, the revenues
established by the kings yielded but little, a fixed income was early
provided, inasmuch as certain pieces of land were conveyed not merely
into the theoretical proprietorship but into the actual possession of the
temple, in order that from them the expenses of the temple and the
priests might be met.

For the form of State ownership we have only slight indications.
If the Assyrian kings restored their possessions to the nobles exiled
or imprisoned by the Kaldi, and, vice versa, the Kaldi kings did the
same with regard to those exiled by the Assyrians, this restitution
might have taken either the form of enfeoffment, of which we have an
example in the Merodachbaladan stone of the Berlin Museum, or the
form of restitutio in integrum, while it is yet impossible to determine
certainly whether State or private ownership was really the form in
question. So, in the case of a number of revenues, the question is still
open whether we have before us taxes upon private property or rents
on account of original State ownership. On the other hand a consid-
erable number of documents in proof of genuine private ownership
are extant.

If we consider the three forms of proprietorship from the point of
view of revenues, it appears that the temples played a double réle. If
they only took a revenue from certain pieces of ground, they were
upon the same footing as the State, which received revenues from the
feudal estates, but if they held the estates in actual possession they
were analogous to private individuals, who could manage these proper-
ties themselves or lease them.

We thus come to the subject of husbandry, which we may now divide

1Thence results the arrangement by which the temple farmed out the latter
revenues.
590 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

into the two principal classes, management by the owner and farming
on lease. I premise that this refers only to the property-holding
classes. The agricultural laborers, that is, the real producers, were
either slaves or peasants, who in their village community had gradu-
ally come to a certain condition of servitude, either to the temple or to
the State or to the nobles. We have, then, to distinguish between the
property-holding classes and the agricultural laborers. Naturally, a
large number of modifications of condition arose which bridged over
the transactions. But, in the rough, for the time which extends from
the ascendancy of Assyria over Babylon to the downfall of the former
power, that is, from 900 B.C. to about 600 B. C., one may assume as
the greatest difference between the two neighboring States—a differ-
ence which was also characteristic of the different relation of power—
the existence in Assyria of a free peasant class, in distinction to the
existence in Babylonia of an unfree peasant class.

That the development of Assyria from a political point of view was
much influenced by its social constitution is to be assumed as a matter
of course. If, now, we can logically represent this development, we
shall be able to judge of the social background, concerning which little
documentary evidence remains. The test will beif the little furnished
by the inscriptions agrees with the conception previously gained by us.

Now, it is quite easy to trace how the Assyrian kings gradually
formed for themselves a military force suitable for rapid movements,
and how the latter, originally, indeed, consisting of natives, became
more and more a.mercenary force recruited. from the free lances of all
Asia Minor. It is, moreover, clear from the history of Assur from the
time of Asurnacirpal on, that the internal tranquillity was greater or
less in proportion to the exhibition of power with regard to outside
countries. This is explained by the fact that, so long as the surround-
ing peoples could be forced to pay tribute, the standing army was
maintained by this tribute, but when from any cause tribute was less
freely given, the public burden fell more and more heavily upon the
producing classes. When, under the kings of the eighth century, the
north and east became less productive because of the pressing forward
of Aryan tribes, circumstances must have come to such a pass that a
complete revolution resulted, which brought Tiglath-Pileser III, and
after him, Salmanassar IV, to the throne. Since this revolution took
place in opposition to the ruling dynasty, and since neither king gave
himself any trouble to establish his legitimacy by artificial pedigrees
showing relationship to ancient legendary dynasties, it is probably
to be assumed that they effected their usurpation in the face of
the hitherto ruling classes of the military and priests by the help of
a third factor. This, then, will also explain the fact that after the
counter revolution of Sargon, he and his successors seized upon the
old broken threads and relied chiefly upon the soldiery and priesthood.
If, then, we inquire concerning this third factor, the only answer is that
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 591

it is to be sought in the ranks of the townspeople and peasants. It
- is thus made possible to see in the revolution of 745 B. C. the vie
tory of a revolt of peasants. And this, again, is only to be imagined
on the hypothesis that in Assyria a strong peasant class unspoiled by
servitude had survived. Always presupposing that development had
. taken place thus, the ascendancy of Assyria over the surrounding
powers may be accounted for as the result of the liberated strength of
the nation; and, moreover, the easy victory of Sargon, who accom-
plished the restoration with the aid of the priests, may be explained on
the assumption that many years of warfare had shattered the social
condition of the peasants.

There are two factors which make possible a verification of these
facts. In the first place, the fact that Sargon, after he had seized the
_ power, regulated property rights in favor of the temples, and, conse-
quently, to the prejudice of the townsmen and peasants, who were
probably reduced to yet more oppressive dependence. Thence it follows
that, before the restoration, temple ownership had been restricted and
relations with the temple relaxed, a fact which accordingly supports
my representation of the development. And, secondly, the course of
Sargon in the foundation of the city Dur-Sharrukin, inasmuch as he
boasts that he has accomplished the expropriation of the landowners in
a just manner, seems to indicate that a free peasant class had survived
even after the restoration. Under the descendants of Sargon, the evo-
lution of conditions probably tended more and more toward-the extine-
tion of this class, and thus formed the social groundwork which, after
the downfall of the dynasty, allowed Assyria as well as Babylon to
become a Median and Persian province.

Farming on the owner’s own account, as we know it from the temple
records, was practiced in this manner: Peasants brought their products
to the temple storehouses and received for these products receipts from
officials appointed for this purpose. It was the same in the case of
private owners. It seems, however, as if this kind of management
was not very prevalent, or, at any rate, fell into disuse more and more
in New Babylon. It was replaced by a system of leasing, which was
highly perfected and formed the transition from domestic to commercial
management.

I have already stated that the temples farmed out the collection of
their revenues; likewise, as with private owners, they rented great
tracts of land to contractors. These contractors made a business of
renting, inasmuch as they either had the land cultivated on their own
account by free or unfree laborers, or leased single pieces again. This
sublease was concluded either after exactly the same form as between
the first renter and the proprietor or else it was a share rent, so that
the property did not give a fixed rent but a proportionate return, which
brought a larger or smaller sum according to the result of the harvest.
Such farming on shares was also practiced where renters took property
592 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

directiy under their own management from proprietors. The picture
of the economic relations of Babylon which we can thus sketch by the
help of the contracts, resembles throughout that of Italy in recent
centuries, whose political development, indeed, presents besides many
striking analogies to that of Babylon. Fully to show this in detail,
however, would lead me far beyond the limits of my essay.

Production was directed primarily toward the gaining of the neces-
saries of life. If the accounts of the Greeks had not already taught
us this, the indigenous inscriptions would, immediately upon their
decipherment, have shown that the main stress of social activity in
Babylonia was placed upon a quite extraordinarily intensive cultiva-
tion of the soil. Innumerable are the receipts for the delivery of grain,
of dates, of date litter, date wine, sesame, and garlic, which are found
cited here, just as in the accounts of the Egpytian pyramids. And on
this subject the accounts of the temples, of which the storehouses
appear to have ruled the market, speak more clearly than anything
else. At the same time, the arrangement is especially peculiar, accord-
ing to which live stock appears not to have been pastured upon the
owner’s land nor under the owner’s direction, but to have been given
into the charge of contractors, who undertook to pasture the herds of
various owners, engaged to guard and care for them, and were paid for
their services. Here the influx of nomad tribes, with property con-
sisting mainly of herds, and the resulting forms of collective owner-
ship of large tracts of arable land appears to have ied very early to
certain compromises with the perfected private ownership of real estate.

The consumption of these products, so far as they were not claimed
by the producers themselves, must have taken place in the cities; and
since exportation could probably have taken place only on a limited
scale—for as far as Arabia the neighboring provinces seem to have
produced their own grain—a conclusion as to the size of these cities is
thereby justified. But then itis unavoidable to assume a highly flourish-
ing condition of industry in these cities; and, indeed, the textile fabrics
of Babylon must have been known and celebrated throughout the whole
world of that time. The smith’s and carver’s arts had likewise attained
a high degree of perfection. While, however, the materials for these
arts—as metals, stone, and ivory—were not produced in the country,
but entered it as objects of exchange for the products of Babylon, the
material for weaving was in part obtained in the country. There are
yet preserved for us many copies of orders by warrant, of which the
temple workers received wool from the temple warehouses in order to
make cloth of it; and this wool came not only from the possessions of
the Babylonians themselves, but deubtless also from the flocks of the
nomadic Aramezans, who became, by reason of having a market for
their products, ever more firmly attached to the regions of the Euphrates
and the Tigris through which they roamed. It is clear how there may
and must have arisen through this development conditions which led
eS
~

A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 593

to antagonism between plain and city, between pasture and agricul-
tural country, and which were then reflected in the political intrigues
according as individual parties represented one or the other interest.
And it is clear, further, that with the peculiar growth of temple owner-
ship—as I have developed it above out of the idea of proprietary claim
upon the soil—antagonisms must have grown up between the priests
or representatives of the interests of the temples and the kings as
representatives of the interests of the state. Only by means of this
insight into its material condition does the history of Babylon, at the
time of the dynasty of Sargon, for instance, become intelligible.

I have already, above, emphasized the fact that the cultivation of
the land must have been a very intensive one. We see this from pic-
tures which show how water was raised from the canals onto the land
by means of hydraulic machines; and we can draw this conclusion from
the syllabaries published in the second volumne of the London work of
inscriptions, which deal with the various phases of agriculture. Finally
we gather the same knowledge from the data of the lists which, drawn
up by the temple officials, show what amount was to be raised in taxes
alone from the several tracts of ground. These tracts themselves were
distinguished according to the kind of cultivation; those where the
clods were broken with the hoe were from this called aggullattu—that
is, a tool which Tiglath-Pileser I, for example, had used on the con-
struction of readways in the Armenian highlands. Ancther kind of
tool after which tracts of land were named was the marru, written
gish mar—that is, the ideogram for wood, plus the ideogram mar, which
is applied to a kind of wagon. Unfortunately the meaning of the word
can not yet be ascertained with precision. While marru, in the archi-
tectural inscription, is taken by some to mean scoop or bucket, others
find in it the meaning wagon tongue. In some of the contracts marru
certainly means a kind of vessel. It might not be impossible that there
were two meanings in the word: (1) that of the vessel, which would
then be referred to in the contracts, as well as in the architectural
inscriptions; (2) also that of an implement which might perhaps find
employment in transportation as well as in agriculture. I imagine it
as a primitive kind of cart or dray, and consider it not impossible that
by putting in a plowshare a plow might also have been made from it.
Further, lands were designated as zaqpu to be derived from zaqaf, if
they were pianted with date palms, as pi shulpi, if bordering on water
and swampy, as ipinnu, if watered with the water wheel, and as taptu,
of which the exact signification as yet eludes definition. specially in
Babylonia the idea of fallow land appears to be lacking, which occurs
quite frequently in the Assyrian contracts. Whether here the land
actually was or could have been continuously cultivated, without fixed
rotation and without pause, I leave undecided.

The individual tracts of land were not computed according to meas-
urements of pure plain geometry, like building plots, but according to

sm 98——38
594 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

measures that had been evolved similar to the German joch, morgen,
ete.—that is, according to the gur,! or the real unit of capacity, which
about corresponds to the German wispel (24 Berlin bushels). Accord-
ing to this, a piece of land was designated by the amount which could
be sowed upon it. Naturally, the ancient method must have been per-
fected under advanced conditions into a fixed measure of extent; it
appears that generally a subdivision of the gur—namely, one-tenth of a
qa (that is, one eighteen-hundredth of the gur), with the ideographic
denotation sha. hi. a, of which I do not know the pronunciation—was
fixed as a certain extent of land, which then passed as a unit of measure.
It is not yet possible to say anything quite definite as to the size of this
unit of measure; Oppert’s calculation rests upon false premises. The
celebrated assyriologist begins with the unit of linear measure, the ell,
and is naturally compelled to construct besides the usual ell a much
longer one for land measurement. I believe that lam able to come
nearer the truth by a conjecture. If the ground area of a house is
measured, it is done by the construction from the linear measure
gi—aqanu, (reed, i. e. rod) —=7 u (u—=ammatu—an ell) of a unit of surface
measure, namely, gi. u, that is, a surface of which one side was 7 ells,
the other, 1 ell long. This construction was carried to such extent
that, if there were subdivisions, these were computed according to the
surface unit gi. shu. si, ganu, uban (bollen) (mehri haben) inch; the
unit of measure was accordingly divided into parts, of which one side,
equal to 7 ells, remained invariable, while the other side was one or
more inches in length. It seems to me now, that the procedure was
of like nature in the construction of the surface unit for agricultural
land. Since u (—ammatu) is to be taken as a fundamental unit,
according to the accounts of several documents, this ell ef land will
denote @ piece of land, of which the short side was equal to 1 ell, while
the long side, however, extended as far as was necessary in order that
one sha. hi. a might be sowed upon it.

We do not learn very much about the real activity of the peasants.
The ground was broken, watered after the sowing, guarded against
injury from birds or herds, and the fences around the tracts kept in
order. The duty of watching and putting the ditches in order is many
times emphasized in the documents of lease. About the harvests and
the manner of gathering them there is almost nothing to be gained
from the inscriptions.

In the Babylen of Nebuchadnezzar II, the main harvest of grain was
in Airu (the Hebrew lyyar); for dates, in Arah-samna (the Hebrew
Marheshwan), It is many times stipulated in the contracts that the
grain cr the dates to be delivered should be brought to the city by
boat, and then delivered either into storehouses or granaries on the

'1 gur originally equaled a camel toad; imir, the fifth part of it, equaled an ass’
load,
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 595

quay, or in the house of the purchaser or of the lessor, respectively.
That the waterways, which received careful attention, were used for
this transportation, need not excite surprise. Since ship asses are
many times mentioned, it might seem as though the boats had been
drawn from the bank by asses, but that is probably not correct.
According to the representations, rafts of the Assyrians were made of
wooden frames, under which were fastened skins of rams, closed and
water-tight, and filled with air. Navigation is practiced in similar
manner down the river even to-day on the Tigris. At the place of des-
tination the wood is sold along with the cargo, and the skins are piled
up and transported back upon asses. Such asses might well be meant
in the passages mentioned; nothing, however, is learned from this as
to the manner of navigation on the canals.

The laborers had, as a remnant of the ancient domestic management,
their full maintenance upon the land,-and wages beside. If they were
free peasants, these wages came from a share in the produce of the har-
vest. Slaves received their food and clothing from their masters and

if they were hired, the employers might give them wages as he did to
free laborers; from this they paid to their owner the profit due him from
aSlave, but might, however, claim clothing from him. Therefore, there
are also contracts of hire in which the employer pledged himself to fur-
nish the clothing. It happened, besides, that the employer paid the
slave’s dues to the master, and guaranteed food and clothing, originally
without paying the slave himself anything at all. This would seem to
have been the earlier, the other the later form; yet nothing conclusive
can as yet be established concerning these important questions.

From the part of the crop which now remained over, therefore, as fol-
lows from the conditions detailed above, the contractor’s rent was to be
paid, the owner’s income, and the incumbent taxes and imposts. The
rent was either a fixed rent or a share rent. In the first case there was
fixed the amount of produce or money to be delivered to the owner.
We have several such records, but unfortunately the particulars as to
the amount of the rent permit of no inference as to its relation to the
returns from the harvests. It was otherwise in the case of the share
rents. There it was provided that, after deduction of costs, the pro-
ceeds were to be divided equally between tenant and owner. There are
several statements in which, moreover, it was agreed who should pay
the taxes.

The income of the owners of landed property, among whom the tem-
ples also are, of course, to be reckoned, came to them, according to
what was said above, in the shape of money or in that of produce. If
the latter case prevailed, and this was the rule, there was, naturally,
often a hardship for the ownerin being compelled to meet his monetary
obligations during a period of low prices for grain. On this account,
we find an exceedingly large number of texts in which prepristors were
596 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

forced to mortgage their lands in order to procure money. Nay more,
there even exists a document by which a Babylonian in straits mort-
gaged his harvest on the stalk.

The necessity of obtaining ready money arose not, perhaps, from
private needs alone. The public institutions must many times have
cooperated in this respect, asin Rome at the time of the Republic.
For, although as already recounted at the outset, the temple imposts
and even the direct State taxes were still usually delivered in the form
of produce, and accordingly little was at first converted into fixed -
sums of money, there was another consideration which compelled the
use of money. And this was the obligation which rested upon the
individual estates to furnish soldiers and their equipment, and likewise
to provide for their maintenance. ‘This obligation was probably derived
from conditions in which the landowner, as yet a peasant himself, held
himself in readiness for service in arms in defense of the country. But,
indeed, a mercenary soldiery must have developed in Babylon very
early, especially because of the changing foreign rule.

Thus we find documents in which money is appropriated directly to
serve for the equipment or maintenance of soldiers. Moreover, this
explains the occurrence of the designation of qashtu for certain pieces
of property; these were just such as had to furnish archers.

Other exactions, to mention these also which, indeed, did not demand
a direct expenditure of money, resulted from the public works. For
this the organs of administration could constrain the laborers of the
temple estates as well as those of private ownership to a kind of corvée,
in which their maintenance was furnished by the possessors of the
estate.

In Babylon a very important industrial life had developed very
early. Of raw products for this, the country had only clay, asphalt
and reed in the best quality. ATI else, for instance, skins of animals,
wool, so far as this was not furnished by the tribes which roamed
through the country had to be imported. On this account the kings
were very often led to undertake military expeditions toward the
Amanus, both in order to keep the way open for traffic and to obtain
as tribute what they could not buy. Babylon must, indeed, have been
a gigantic thoroughfare for the trade between the Mediterranean and
the Indian Ocean. About this we can learn nothing directly from the
cuneiform inscriptions, though we can learn it indirectly, by inferences,
and, moreover, from the Greek authors. One thing is nevertheless
clear, that great amounts of raw products lay in the storehouses of
Babylon.

Production was divided into the work of trades and that of factories.
I call trades the activity of free or unfree laborers, because they were
entitled to take apprentices and teach them their trade, an institution
which fully corresponds to that of our modern trades. We have to look
upon the temple and the industrial establishments of the rich citizens
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 597

as factories. We have a number of certificates of delivery which show
how the raw materials were delivered into the industrial establish-
ments and how the finished products were delivered from them. These
indicate how long the laborers worked and what amount of wages they
received. As soon as the products of the trades came into demand as
objects of luxury, craftsmanship touched the boundaries of art. The
conditions in question are similar to those which existed in ancient
Egypt. Artizanship is a refinement of what is commonly called trade

_work, which yet can not attain individuality.

The fine arts were mainly employed upon the royal edifices. Almost
every kind of technique was practiced there—metal work (especially
embossed work), metal casting, ivory and wood carving, and stone and
tile mosaic. The technical perfection of the last was especially remark-
able. One is with reason astonished at the blues, partly metallic colors,
partly lapis lazuli, which were burnt in upon the tiles for mosaics. The
bronze doors of Balawat are a splendid relic of the artistic skill of
former times. In considering the stone carving it is striking in how
masterly a way the hardest stones were subdued in the most remote
times, and that, too, with tools with which modern artists can not work
at all. At that time there was as yet no steel. Even the hard basalt
was worked with chisels of tempered bronze. Among the minor arts,
that of the lapidary is especially to be noticed. We find quite delight-
ful engravings upon the hardest gems. Here, again, is such a technical
perfection as could be developed only by the practice of centuries, and
which later became lost, so that similar noticeable works could first
be produced again only in Italian workshops. Wood carving was
employed in the construction of thrones and of little Venus figures in
wood. A similar highly developed art appears also in ivory work.
Ivory was a much-prized article, for the sake of which the kings often
undertook military expeditions, since the elephants were already exter-
minated on the Euphrates and the Tigris toward the beginning of the
tenth century B.C. The ceramics, for which the most excellent raw
material was present in all Babylonia, were also remarkable. The clay,
which was already washed smooth by the rivers, was ground up so fine
that clay writing tablets, for instance, were made of such superlative
quality that they could be covered with writing so small as hardly to
be read without a microscope.

The Babylonians are our predecessors in the art of printing. We
have matrices in clay and in wood. The writing to be multiplied was
first carved in wood, then cast in clay, and could then be imprinted
upon any number of clay tablets.

A highly developed branch of industry was the art of weaving and
embroidery, although we have no specimen of the material. We can
form an idea of this art from the representations of the Egyptians and
the Babylonians. The Babylonians understood how to weave very thin
fabrics as well as the thickest. I myself have seen a clay tablet in Lon-
598 A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY.

don which had been laid upon a piece of linen, so that even now the
position of the threads and the excellence of the fabric to which they
belonged can be estimated.

The tanner’s trade, moreover, was highly developed. This, too, can
be judged of only through pictorial representations. According to
these, shoes and the harness and saddles of horses were elaborately
worked.

Those who carried on industry were partly free, partly slaves; the
former received wages, the latter were hired or rented. The owners of
the slaves received from the latter, if they were skilled laborers, a fixed
income. This must be clearly recognized in the picture of the social
relations in Babylon. It is a matter of course, that here the interests
of the owners and those of the laborers must have been diverse,
and that, therefore, in spite of the immense population of Babylon, its
political conditions must have been very unstable, because only the
rich—that is, the dwindling minority—had an interest in the mainte-
nance of order. Babylon had never been able to attain the position of
Rome, where the Plebs constantly obtained more rights.

As for the instruments of labor in Old Babylon, they were not highly
developed. On the other hand, a high degree of technical perfection
was wrought out with these poor instruments. Among us the reverse
is the case. The tools are very good, but the skill of the human hand
has greatly diminished.. Whether a division of labor in the modern
sense existed in Babylon can not be yet made clear. There are, never-
theless, a number of facts which would point to it.

According to the representations in the reliefs, the citizens attended
public gatherings on state occasions and temple ceremonies, richly
adorned and with the insignia which distinguished them as citizens;
that is, in flowing garments, with large and artistically made head-
dresses, with a seal ring upon the finger, with staff in hand, with girdle
and beautifully embroidered leather shoes. In everyday work, on the
contrary, we see the same citizens carrying on their business in shirt
and apron. Unfortunately, the remains which are at hand come mostly
from temples and palaces, and therefore we can form a clear picture only
of great state functions.

Several scholars maintain that in Babylon only the femles and
palaces are to be considered as great buildings, while the inhabitants
lived in primitive huts. This is an untenable view. Portions of foun-
dation walls which belonged to private houses have been discovered,
and we are justified in the assumption that Babylon, so long as it
existed, made, with its houses, the impression of a great city. One
must not forget, withal, that it was an oriental city which required
another kind of architecture than that of our great cities. Upon the
main streets, which were paved with stone, little outbuildings, such as
we still see in oriental cities, which must have served as booths or
A SKETCH OF BABYLONIAN SOCIETY. 599

bazaars, were erected before the houses. There, as in the gates of the
temples and palaces, handiwork and traffic were briskly carried on.

Money, the medium of exchange, received its first and best improve-
ment there. It had passed from the conception of barter to the refined
conception of value. In even earlier times gold ard silver money, and
also as subsidiary coinage, copper, bronze, and iron were used. The
further the development went the more need there must have been of
having the metals in a fixed form and in certain proportions of weight
in order that there might be no necessity for weighing the metals each
time. It was, therefore, molded into bars and rings. Unfortunately,
no such coins have been preserved, but we have written references to
them. The unit of value was the mine. This contained 60 sheqels, and
the latter had again subdivisions, but these varied. From the two
first developments of money arises the third; the use of money as
capital; that is, interest-bearing capital. We have, in about 2300 B. C.,
the transition, as people pledged themselves to work a certain length
of time for a sum of money which they must return later.

Exchange was known in Babylon, and there are statements of the
changes in value of money. Moreover, the ratio of value between
gold and silver was fixed.

This fine development of the relations of value was accompanied by
another—the relation of the purchasing power of money to livelihood.
A number of documents exist which show that the living expenses of
the laborers can not have been very high, and this agrees with what
we know of the Orient from other sources. The soil furnishes the nec-
essaries of life without man’s having to take much trouble. Conse-

quently, idleness and beggary are nowhere more widespread than in

the Orient. Nowhere is industry urged forward in a more brutal way.
There are many reliefs from Babylon and Egypt which show laborers
constantly driven by blows from a stick; during the transportation of
colossal weights an overseer with a club stands behind every three
or four laborers.

CONCLUSION.

During the correction of the preceding sketch, which the editor of
the Mittheilungen has sent to the press half against my will, but which
I will not now withdraw, since otherwise I should be obliged to let it
lie for many years to come without finding the time to work it over
thoroughly, two gaps came to my special notice, the filling up of which,
however, is subsequently to take place elsewhere. The professional
position of the priests will probably be described by Zimmern in his
contributions to the knowledge of the Babylonian religion; that of the
judges will be treated by Kohler in the fourth part of the work
published by Kohler and myself upon Babylonian juridical life.

THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE

By PHILIPPE BERGER.

For some time Carthage, which seemed to have been so completely
destroyed by the Romans that its very ruins had disappeared, has
again been attracting public attention. But a few weeks ago the
reports of tine Académie des Inscriptions told the tale of new discov-
eries made in the necropolises of Carthage by the inde‘atigable zeal of
Pére Delattre.

The interest aroused by this resurrection of the past has overstepped
the confines of the learned world. Tourists hasten to attend the open-
ing of the tombs in the hope of being present when relics of the time
of the Magos, the Hamilcars, and the Hannibals are brought to light.
The Government, too, has realized the importance of these discoveries
for the history of Tunis. Under the enlightened patronage of our resi-
dent general and thanks te the subventions of the minister of public
instruction and of the Académie des Inscriptious, M. Paul Gauckler,
director of the Service des Antiquités et des Arts in Tunis, erected a
shed beside Pére Delattre’s, and in continuing the very line of excava-
tion that has yielded Pére Delattre such happy results at the first
stroke of the pickax he has come upon a mine richer than any yet
worked.

Under a layer of the Byzantine period he discovered a carefully
mured up sanctuary of the Roman epoch. In this subterranean cham-
ber, awaiting better times, doubtless, and protected against the zeal of
the new religion, had been piled up lists of priests, votive offerings,
Mithraic groups, a bull’s head bearing a votive inscription to semibar-
barous gods between its horns, and marbie statues, many of them
worthy to appear beside works of the great era of classic Greece. Then,
under the Roman, he found in the Pheenician layer, studied by Pére
Delattre, tombs of the same architecture and with the same contents as
those excavated by his predecessor, but singularly rich, containing
rings, bracelets, gold necklaces—real treasures, such as would have
made the heart of Dureau de La Malle and of Beulé leap for joy.

602 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

So each day discloses antiquities surpassing in richness and artistic
interest any before known; and if Carthage had yielded nothing but
tombs they would have sufficed te give unexpected information, to him
who knows how to question them, upon Phenician art and civilization
of the period preceding the overthrew of the queen of the sea by the
Romans.

Ti.

Few spectacles give the impression of the oblivien into which past
grandeur falls in the same degree as the ruins of Carthage. Nowhere
does Delenda Carthago strike one as such a vivid reality. The Romans
acquitted themselves of their work conscientiously, and civilization has
completed what the conquerors left undone. The stones of Carthage,
after serving in the Roman town, were used, and continue to be used,
for the houses of Tunis, and the marble of its columns adorns the cathe-
drals of Italy and southern France.

From the promontory whence the bay cf Tunis is seen in the dis-
tance, with the beautiful line of mountains that shut it in on the south,
the glance wanders over some earth heaps in which only the trained eye
can recognize the site of ancient Carthage. Not even ruins are visible.
Far off, toward Tunis, there gleam in the sunlight two lagoons, called
the ports of Carthage. They probably formed the inner harbor. The
orifices of the great cisterns, the circus and the amphitheater, both of
the Romar pericd, and the long line of agueducts gliding toward Zag-
wam, this is all that remains of Carthage. Not far from the sea, in the
middle of a tract of land bought by France, on a hillock supposed to
have been Byrsa, rises the basilica of St. Louis, at which the antiqui-
ties of Carthage were deposited as soon as found. It was the first
museum for the purpose and the only one until René de La Blanchére
prepared the palace of Manuba to house the finds from excavations
made under the management of the Antiquités in Tunis.

It is proper to say that to Cardinal Lavigerie belengs the chief merit
of these discoveries. After Dureau de La Malle, who restored the
topography of Carthage without ever having been on its site and
endeavored to found a society for the exploration of its ruins, and
after Beulé, who more recently brought his artistic and archeologic
skill to bear upon them, Lavigerie was the first to comprehend the
necessity for making systematic excavations at Carthage and for main-
taining a permanent station there.

Even before this the Academy, interested in collecting the material
of the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, had charged M. de Sainte-
Marie, dragoman of the French consulate at Tunis, to institute some
such action. In a little while he had a collection of more than two
thousand votire steles of dull sameness, proving, however, that the seil
of Carthage still hid Phoenician antiquities. He found, besides, numer-
ous bits of architecture, statues or fragments of statues, all of the
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 603

Roman period. He died just after the publicatien of the texts which
science owes to him. After his departure from Tunis the excavations
were continued by MM. Reinach and Babelon, and it may be said that
the researches called forth by the publication of the Corpus Inscriptio-
num Semiticarum gave the first impulse to the movement now develop-
ing before our eyes.

The Cardinal did not stop at any sacrifice. He paid for the excava-
tions out of his own purse and pleaded the cause of his museum with
the persuasive ardor characteristic of him. Fortunately his right
hand in this enterprise was Pére Delattre, who, with his frank, ener-
getic features, long blond beard, and white robe, is a figure well
beloved by all visitors at Tunis. Having been long identified with the
place and knowing the people and the locality, Pére Delattre was in a
better position than anyone else to gather information from the natives
and to know at what points to conduct researches.

His investigations, at first limited and rather haphazard, underwent
a change as the result of a visit of the Marquis de Vogiié. He gra-
ciously placed at Pére Delattre’s disposal a sum sufficient to enable
him to proceed with his work. From that time his resolution was
fixed. He conceived the plan of exploring the necropolis in the side
of the hill of St. Louis. At nearly the same time a French engineer,
who deserves mention, M. Veruaz, in examining the subterranean
canal which flows from the great cisterns into the sea, struck upon the
first tombs of the Pheenician necropolis of Bordj Djedid, which is
crossed by the Roman aqueduct.

M. Héron de Villefosse, who had been present at Pere Delattre’s
first excavations, and had constituted himself his representative at the
Academy, kept it daily informed of his discoveries. Yet it neither
subsidized nor encouraged him in any way. And thus, little by little,
laboring from tomb to tomb, from necropolis to necropolis, he succeeded
in determining the site of three great Carthaginian cities of the dead.

These necropolises, extending along the hills that reach from the
chapel of St. Louis to the sea, form a semicircle, which embraces the
heart of the city, as it were, in the horns of a crescent. Was the whole
of the ancient city comprehended within these limits? It must have
been very small; but early ome, also, was of no great extent, and the
seven hills are to-day lost in the maze of streets and buildings that
form the heart of the modern city. Possibly, too, what has happened
to our cemeteries in Paris occurred in Carthage. At first outside the
city, they were finally surrounded by it, but were kept in use never-
theless.

In any case, all are not of equal antiquity. The most ancient, called
Douimés, from the name of the territory covering it, occupies the most
distant point from the sea, not far from the cistern of Maiga. It cer-

a tainly goes back to the sixth, if not to the seventh, century B.C. This

age is indicated by the presence of beautiful Corinthian vases, whose
604 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

date is known to within a century, as well as by the form of certain
pieces of earthenware, specially of some rather primitive lamps, resem-
bling deep saucers, the edges of which are pressed together on one side
to form a channel for the wick. And this opinion concerning their age
is confirmed by the discovery of the pendant to a gold necklace, hardly
the size of a ten-franc piece, but admirably engraved with a legend in
Pheenician characters of the most archaic type.

The farther from the center, the more recent the date of the necropo-
lis. The least ancient one, yet antedating the end of the Punie wars,
forms the right horn of the crescent, where the hills marking the north-
ern limit of the village meet the sea near the Turkish fort of Bordj
Djedid. Itis especially interesting for the richness of its funeral access-
ories, in which the influence of Greek art predominates, and for the
remains of men contemporary with the supreme struggle of Carthage.

The tombs usually consist of one or more funeral chambers connected
by a vertical shaft. They were sunk in the side of the hill to a depth
of 8,10, and even 14 meters. To get at them it was necessary to clean
out shafts choked up and completely covered over with dirt heaps, make
subterranean passages from tomb to tomb, remove obstacles, and haul
aside, even blow up, great flagstones, barring the way to chambers—
all at the peril of a thousand difficulties, over which only energy stimu-
lated by the hope of discovery could triumph.

One of the most beautiful tombs of the necropolis of Douimes is the

one called by Pére Delattre the tomb of Iadamelek, because the pend-
ant to a gold necklace found in it, near one of the skeletons, bears that
name—the name of the owner—following a dedication to Astarte-Pyg-
malion engraved in microscopic but perfectly clear Phcenician charac-
ters of great antiquity.
- A rock slab, 3 meters long by 50 centimeters thick, covered the sep-
ulcher, and Pere Delattre had to cut a passage through it and through
9 meters of earth before he reached the chamber, which he found intact.
He describes the sight that met his eyes in these words: ‘‘ The walls
and even the flagstone pavement were overlaid with stucco. This
stucco, exceedingly fine and hard, had the white crystalline appearance
of snow. The flame of our candles made it gleam in myriad sparkling
points. Part of the glazing had become detached, and had fallen on
the skeletons in sheets; another part, still unbroken, leaned over like
a great piece of cardboard. The density of the stucco was such that
under the slightest stroke it gave out a metallic sound.”

The glazing did not reach the top of the chamber. Between the
stucco and the large stones covering the cave was a space of 19 centi-
meters, into which a wooden cornice and ceiling had once fitted, but
had now disappeared. The imprint of the fibers, and even bits of wood
sticking to the rock, could leave no doubt that they had been there. A
red thread 5 centimeters below the stones, which must have served as
a chalk line to bring the cornice and the ceiling flush with each other,
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 605

proved with what care this tomb had been executed to the slightest
detail. And in the silence of the funeral chamber, in the midst of the
usual furnishings of these tombs, the skeletons of two Carthaginians,
husband and wife, still guard the remains of the jewels with which
they had been adorned.

The tombs vary greatly in their contents, yet nearly all present cer-
tain minor objects, which form the obligatory and ritualistic part of
the equipment. Near the head, or in a small niche in the wall, are two
vials, always the same; a lamp, still blackened with smoke, which
probably burnt near the head after the closing of the tomb; then, often,
at his side a scent box, which was meant to be held in the hand, but
which had rolled to the ground on the crumbling of the bones.

The dead are laid, not in a lateral niche, as in certain other necropo-
lises, but on the ground, in the midst of all the objects with which the
respect of their family had surrounded them. There was no coffin.
They were lowered through the shaft by cords on a board which served
as a funeral couch. Close-riveted handles and large brass nails bear
witness to the manner of adjusting those pieces of wood.

Sometimes the body seems to have been covered with two planks,
forming a roof over it. Inthe more recent sepulchers are large pointed
amphore, and stone chests containing ashes or calcined bones. Often
skeletons and cinerary urns are found in the same tomb. This indi-
cates that cremation gradually displaced burial.

Besides the stationary objects, there lay on the ground or leaned
against the wall vases of very different forms and dimensions. Some-
times unadorned, sometimes decorated with fringes and black and red
circular lines; vases of black Rhodesian earth covered with friezes of
animals or scenes from mythology; vases in the form of baby bottles,
called bazzula by the natives; large clay amphore of rude workman-
ship; oinochoés, elegantly shaped; alabaster pieces; goblets; vials, on
which the Pheenician painter had allowed his fancy free play, some in
the form of animals, others representing a crouching woman, or a
baboon holding another vase shaped like a frog’s head. Ostrich eggs,
painted red and yellow, figure extensively in these sepulchers—often
several are found in one tomb. In thetomb of Iadamelek an egg, still
intact, served both as a receptacle and as stopper to a larger vase.
Elsewhere there were only simple rowdelles, rudely painted with human
features. Again, there were Egyptian figurines; statuettes; terra-cotta
masks; objects having symbolic or religious significance, as well as
articles of daily life; small chairs and tables, looking like toys; bone
or ivory pieces artistically worked; the whole series of arms and metal
utensils; and, finally, scattered around the dead, the remains of his
ornaments; innumerable beads for necklaces, of paste, of precious
stones, or of gold; rings; bracelets—the whole of life transported to
the tomb, the expression, as it were, of the identity of the dead.

Allthis yields but one thought. The continuation of life in the tomb
606 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

enables us in a measure to reconstruct what it might have been on
earth. For the tomb is the only place that preserves the secrets of
life when its last trace and memory have been obliterated from the
world of the living.

II.

Till within the last few years it would have been difficult to convey
a fairly precise idea of Carthaginian life and civilization. One man has
tried, and he could try, because he was a novelist, Gustave Flaubert.
Not that his description is literally true, but he was an extremely con-
scientious student, and to his conscientiousness he joined the gift of
correct and vivid perception. Apart from the inevitable exaggerations
of romance, which can sometimes be attributed to the authors from
whom Flaubert drew his information, Salammbo gives the sensation of
forceful, sensual realism. It is cumbered with an accumulation of dec-
orative detail not in contradiction with the glimpses obtained from
monuments. Flaubert seems to have had somewhat of a Carthaginian
soul.

But one thing he could not bring out clearly, namely, the composite
character of this civilization and its Egyptian aspect, strikingly dis-
played in the costume of the priestesses of Tanit and in the ornaments
which, to use the expression of Moutesquieu, burdened their superb
heads.

The Carthaginians, like all Phoenicians, gave little scope to the ideal.
This is shown by the realism of their art and their religion. They were
not endowed with a powerful, creative genius; they did not, like the
Greeks, create types which compelled the admiration of the world and
enriched humanity with new forms. Like all realists, they excelled in
the art of imitating whatever struck the eye. They imitated the forms
of nature as well as the art-forms of the people with whom they came
in contact. The Phenicians lacked the independence to elaborate
from them a new conception of art, distinguished by certain constant
characteristics. They were indebted to all their neighbors in succes-
sion. Their art, Chaldean when in contact with Chaldean, became
Egyptian near Egypt and Greek in the Hellenic period. The Greeks
themselves derived the models for their masterpieces from the Orient,
but they transformed them by a new idea. The Phenicians departed
from their models only as an interpreter varies what he interprets;
they fashioned them in their own image, thereby giving them a some:
thing peculiar to themselves. They were great animal painters, also,
and under their treatment even the human face assumed a singularly
lively expression. From this peint of view such a thing as Pheenician
art may be said to exist.

The excavations of Carthage have brought out the profound influ-
ence of Egypt on this ancient Carthaginian civilization. The sight of
the objects unearthed from the tombs transports one to the borders of
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 607

the Nile. The statuettes have the headdress, costumes, and posture
of mummies. The rings and scarabs bear Egyptian scenes, often
Egyptian legends. The amulets, which alternate with strands of pearls
in the numerous paste necklaces, reproduce subjects familiar in Egypt;
the oodja, the sacred eye of Osiris, the grotesque stocky figure of the god
Phtah, ankhs (crux ansata), small tables for libations. The uraeus on
either side of the solar disk is one of the favorite designs of necklace
pendants and earrings, and figures in the head gear of goddesses, in
which it forms a kind of high crown, recalling the turreted crown of
Ceres.

Doubtless many of the amulets, intaglios, and bibelots, objects which
are easily carried from place to place, and are stopped in their wander-
ings only by the tomb, were actually made in Egypt. But we can not
explain as a foreign importation the terra-cotta pieces and the gold and
silver jewelry in which an unmistakable imitation of Egypt is accom-
panied by certain characteristics proving them of home make.

These characteristics appear in certain figurines absolutely Egyptian
in the posture of the body and in the disposition and details of the
costume. for the graceful forms of the Egyptian women, so pure of
line as to seem scarcely human, more massive, less spiritual bodies
are substituted. The head is never Kgyptian, the protruding eyes are
singularly expressive, the root of the nose thick, the lips sensual, the
chin prominent. The artist certainly had a Carthaginian model.

Nowhere does this mixture of imitation and subjective, realistic
interpretation appear better than in the terra-cotta masks frequently
found in Carthaginian tombs, one of the art forms in which.the origi-
nality of the Carthaginians had freest play. Curiously enough, these
masks have holes in the top and sometimes in the sides for suspending
them; yet they were not hanging up in the tombs, but laid at the side
of the dead. Nor were they meant to cover the face—they were too
small.

However that may be, the resemblance to Egyptian funeral masks
is striking. Some of the women’s masks might be taken for masks of
mummies. The hair, rolled up in front over a bandeau, falls in two
fine but heavy tresses behind the ears, which are inordinately length-
ened by earrings, and spreads out on the chest. But the countenance,
the features, the form of the face, denote another inspiration—Greek
rather than Egyptian. The whole physiognomy has a refinement and
a softness of expression which make of the masks truly subjective
works of art. The men who bought these beautiful Corinthian vases
and shut them up with themselves in their tombs must have realized
the remoter influences at work on this art. It was the art of early
Greece, the half Oriental art of Homeric times.

Moreover, the masks are not all made from the same model. A cer-
tain course of deterioration is perceptible, a steady diversion from the
Egyptian pattern. On some of them the tresses are replaced by small,
608 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

close curis covering head and shoulders with their wavy mass. Under
this abundance of hair falling over the brow are two almond eyes with
protruding eyeballs, set deep under long, arched eyebrows. The cheek
bones are sunken, the firmly set lips, like the ears, are painted a vivid
red, and the neck and breast are dotted red and blue. From afar it
recalls the beautiful head of the Cerro de los Santos, recently put on
exhibition at the Louvre.

The necropolis of Tharros in Sardinia had revealed the same mixture
of native and Egyptian art. The likeness between the relics of Tharros
and those of Carthage is so great that most of those from the necrop-
olis of Sardinia could as well be ascribed to a Carthaginian necropolis.
But what, in Tharros, might have appeared an exceptional phenome-
non peculiar to it the Carthaginian experience shows to have been the
rule. The mixture of the two is a fact dominating the whole of the
Pheenician civilization of that period in the western basin of the
Mediterranean.

The great merchants, responding to the prevailing taste of the people
with whom they traded, made whatever had a good sale. Ata time
when Egypt seemed the type of perfection in art and civilization, they
made imitation Egyptian as we make imitation Chinese or Japanese.
But they did not work for export only, and their home art was sub-
jected to the same influences. What has happened in our time with
regard to China and Japan in a feeble measure reproduces what
happened at Carthage. The introduction of Japanese figures, vases,
cunningly shaped articles, introduced us to an art which reacted on our
ceramics and our decorative painting. Egypt was not nearly so distant
from Carthage as we are from the Far East; it had, besides, the prestige
conferred by age and the refinement of a powerful civilization. It
invaded Carthage on all sides and penetrated everywhere. Egyptian
divinities were introduced with the amulets sold at the gates of temples
and cemeteries, and, when the Carthaginian represented women or
goddesses with Egyptian costumes or headdresses, without deubt they
merely reproduced what they saw about them daily.

It more and more appears that this somewhat servile imitation of
nature—rude, yet close, biting, and somewhat satiric—was the dis-
tinctive trait of Carthaginian art. The mask of a man, the only one of
its kind, is a striking example. The oval, bony face is encircled by
whiskers, leaving mouth and chin uncovered; the prominent nose, as
well as the ears, are pierced with a gold ring. The eyes have an oddly
mocking expression; they are painted white, the eyeballs and eyebrows
black. The short, crisply curled hair meets the brow in a straight line
from ear to ear, and wherever the skin shows it is highly colored in red-
Several of the engraved stones of exquisite workmanship, in which
Greek influence is perceptible, present the same type of man with crisp
curls, side whiskers, and smooth-shaven chin. Whiskers worn by Greek
warriors had appeared on some of the most ancient specimens of Greek
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 609

ceramics, but the nose ring, the nezem, on a man—what a curious thing,
what a revelation it is. That is the way the old Carthaginian sea
wolves must have looked.

There are other masks in these tombs; not portraits, but veritable
grinning masks. One represents an old man, with smooth-shaven,
wrinkled face, the nose hooked, the bald forehead receding. The laugh
that draws his features makes his cheek bones prominent, and forms a
double, funnel-shaped circle of folds about his mouth. The eyes are
represented by balls shaped like reversed crescents, and on each cheek
bone is a slight application of pastel. Another mask, both grotesque

_ and sinister, has rarer strength of expression. The low, narrow fore-

head bulges out; the cheek bones are sharp and prominent; the nose,
with base deeply imbedded in the cheeks, follows their movements; the
eyes are made by two large holes cut through the thickness of the
mask, and the mouth, whose lips form a bourrelet, recalling the Greek
tragic mask, by another; between the eyebrows is the disk, inclosed in
the reversed crescent, ond the whole face, with its irregular features,
changes expression with the angle under which it is seen.

The Carthaginians were endowed with feeling for caricature. Real-
ism—that is, the nonidealistic reproduction of nature—induced a height-
ening of her grotesque aspects, an exaggeration of all her features.
This bias betrays itself everywhere in their portraiture—on their
engraved stones and on their statuettes. They liked to depict man in
attitudes lacking the nobility of Greek figures, and they liked to depict
monkeys.

This feeling for caricature comes out even in their divinities, fat,
stocky dwarfs with lolling tongues, sometimes disgustingly nude; those
horned devils’ heads, and those monstrosities made up of parts of ani-
mals different in nature and sex. Their Hercules, the prototype of the
Greek Hercules, has the Greek hero’s strength and other attributes,
but is a grotesque dwarf, who struggles with cranes, larger than him-
self, and, though a dwarf, is yet terrible. They had a perception of the
contrasts and mockery of things human, and were the first to represent
their tragic and terrible aspect.

Possibly this is the most original side of their art, the side that
obtruded itself on the people with whom they came in contact. Cer-
tain by no means unimportant gods of Egypt, Bes, Set, Phtah, as a
dwarf, and all the grotesque and malevolent divinities of darkness and
evil, introduced at an early period into the Egyptian Pantheon, seem,
if not directly of Phoenician origin, at least to have sprung from the
ancient fountainhead of civilization whence Pheenicia came forth, and
of which she has in a measure preserved the classic type.

This explains the coarse idols, the fetiches, the stone gods, objects of
Carthaginian fear and adoration. In the necropolis of Douimés was
found a kind of hard, blackish pebblestone, strange to the environs of
Carthage, of the shape of a flattened sphere. On one side it bears rude

sm 98——39
610 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

tracings, large round eyes, a nose, ears, and a inouth inordinately wide,
whose straight line cuts the lower part of the face—the grinning face
of the man in the moon. This stone is certainly a betylus; that is, an
idol, one of the stones inhabited and animated by a divinity, which
were called by the Greeks stones with souls. Compare it with those
beautiful Carthaginian masks, representing the head of a goddess sur-
mounted by a crown of serpents, pure of line, refined and dignified, and
the contrast fairly grates on one. On the one hand, Greek art at its
noblest brought to bear on an Oriental conception; on the other, coarse-
ness and barbarity. However, this head has a certain amount of
expression, and the same expression is found on a similar stone bearing
a mysterious inscription on the reverse side. Itis found, also, on ostrich
eggs with human features coarsely painted in blue, red, and black.
One realizes that this god devoured children.

The jewelry and the articles in precious metals help te complete the
picture of this strange civilization, a curious mixture of refinement and
barbarity, thoroughly impregnated with Oriental ideas, of which the
excavations at Carthage disclose new manifestations every day. The
jeweler’s art does not pretend to embody a high conception of the ideal.
Jewels are the accessories and natural complements of beauty; they
are often substituted for it among peoples who rate richness of form
above beauty of feature and purity of line. To judge by their variety,
their perfection, and the place they hold in these sepulchers, they seem
to have been one of the favorite forms of art among the Carthaginians;
yet even they show this mixture of borrowed and native art. There
are scarabs, amulets, fragments of purely Egyptian necklaces, along
with pieces of jewelry in which, by the side of an inspiration from
foreign sources, the native skill of the Carthaginians in such work
asserts itself. ;

The Pheenicians were always marvelous workers in metal. When
Solomon wanted to decorate the temple of Jerusalem and his palace he
requested the King of Tyre to send him artists. It is probable that
the jewelers of Sidon played the same role in Greece. M. Naville has
recently shown that they practiced their art as far as Egypt. At all
events, the products of their industry flooded the markets of the Occi-
dent, where they took women in exchange for their gold necklaces, their
bracelets, and, above all, their bronze and silver cups in repoussé, deco-
rated in long circular designs with scenes from the chase, processions
of wild or domestic animals, contests between gods and fantastic
beasts—a résumé of the religious conceptions which developed into the
mythology of the Greeks.

The cups that are found in Greece, the Isle of Cyprus, and even Italy
have not yet been discovered in Carthage. The soil has not the sandy
dryness of Egypt, which preserves relics buried in it; nor has it been
overlaid with a stratum of cinders such as at Pompeii enshrouds and
petrifies a whole civilization in its perfection. The cedar wocd which
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 611

covered the dead or formed the ceiling of their tombs has failen to

dust, and only the handles by which they were lowered on their funeral
couches remain.

Even bronze and silver have been consumed by rust, yet these metals
must have held a large place in the equipment of the tombs. Thereare
remains of weapons—small hatchets, spear heads, cutlasses, hooks,
shovels, and tongs; also, thick copper cymbals, bells, mirrors, and,
above all, beautiful bronze vinochoés, which, being more massive, have
resisted better. One of them, entirely of gilded bronze and of rare
elegance of form, is provided with a handle rising in a graceful curve
over the neck. The junction of neck and. handle is made by a square
piece, from which the head of a calf, surmounted by disk and urzus,
stands out in relief. On others the handle, artistically wrought, has,
at the points of attachment a beardless head above and below a bearded
head with the features of a Silenus.

Gold alone has not been attacked by time. It has resisted even the
wear of the waves of the sea. The coast of Carthage, on a level with
the promontory of Bordj Djedid, is veritable gold-bearing sand, mixed
with which are found, now small grains of gold, now links, rings, and
other minor objects. As M. Gauckler has demonstrated, the presence
of this gold is due to the collapse of the caves of the necropolis sunk
in the cliff.

Only Etruscan jewels or the art of a Castellani can give an idea of
the method by which Carthaginians worked the gold and produced
jewels whose delicacy still charms. These bits of necklaces, these
pendents and earrings, are made by placing tiny balls of gold close to
each other to form links, beads, and cubes. The delicacy of effect
obtained by the application of this milled work to massive gold can
not be described. The earrings, especially, are small masterpieces of
jewelry. Sometimes they end in long gold beads; sometimes they are
shaped like lanterns, with a pyramid of gold grains rising in the middle.
These jewels are not peculiar to the necropolis of Bordj Djedid. The
most beautiful, possibly, came from the more ancient tombs. In one of
the latter M. Gauckler quite recently discovered a body wearing a gold
finger ring with four baboons engraved on the chaton, in the left ear an
earring with the symbol of Tanit, around the neck a large necklace of
massive gold, composed of 40 pieces of various shapes symmetrically
disposed on either side of a central brooch, which consists of a turquoise
crescent falling over a hyacinth disk. Another necklace of silver com-
pleted the adornments.

A curious terra-cotta statuette enables us to understand how these
jewels were worn. It represents a goddess seated, her mantle wound
about her bust in the shape of a disk. The headdress is high and
decorated with a triple row of roses, disks, and laurel leaves; long
shell-shaped earrings hang to the bottom of the cheeks. Three ample
necklaces drop over the breast and entirely cover it. The first, which
612 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

clasps the neck, is composed of beads; the second, spread out like a
fan, of pieces as large as olives; the third, of still larger disks. This
must have been a typical costume, for it reappears on several nearly
identical statuettes. On one found at Tharros the breast of the goddess
is entirely covered with six rows of jewels, each with a different motive.

So little by little the tomb gives up all the tokens of a civilization
which caused the fortune of Rome to tremble in the balance, and whieh:
has left a name in history for the brilliancy of its wealth and for its
determined energy in seeking to control the markets of the ancient
world.

III.

The silence concerning the names of those buried in the tombs is sur-
prising. In Egypt the chambers of the hypogea and the pyramids are
covered with inscriptions ranged along the walls. The Greeks and
Romans inscribed the name and title of the dead on slates to keep their
memories alive. Here thereis nothing of the kind. Oftenest the sepul-
chral chamber and even the sarcophagus bear no mention of him who
is buried there. On some rare mortuary plaques appears the dry
legend, ‘‘Tomb of such a one, son of such a one,” and that is all. Not
_ one has yet been found in place. The inscriptions multiply only as
cremation is resorted to. Then funeral urns begin to be covered with
- legends, printed in ink, most frequently with the name of those whose
ashes they contain.

It seems, however, that the silence is breaking; the very tombs are
beginning to speak. Recall that little gold medallion found in one of
the most ancient tombs of Carthage, with a dedication to Astarte-
Pygmalion, followed by the owner’s name: ‘“‘To Astarte-Pygmalion,
Iadamelek, son of Paddai. Pygmalion protects whom he protects.”
Is it not interesting to find the name Pygmalion, brother-in-law of
Dido, who plays so great a role in the history of the foundation of
Carthage, associated in this ancient tomb with Astarte?

At the end of last year Pére Delattre made a discovery in the necrop-
olis of Bordj Djedid, which suffers no diminution in interest through
pertaining to less ancient times. In clearing out a shaft sunk verti-
cally into the ground to a depth of 14 meters he reached a mortuary
chamber. Here, in the midst of an obstructing mass of débris, he
found beside chests containing skeletons and the usual funeral acces-
sories, first, four little stone sarcophagi, from 40 to 50 centimeters
long, inclosing only calcined bones; then in a corner to the left of the
chamber, under the ceiling, another sarcophagus of the same dimen-
sions, but bearing on its lid the full-length portrait of the dead,
engraved on a block cut out in relief in the thickness of the lid to
reproduce the contours of the body.

The body lies extended to its full length, like the figures on the flat
tombstones of the Middle Ages. It is an old man with a long beard
THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE. 613

and hard features, his forehead bare, his upper lip strongly curved, his
turbaned head lying on two cushions with tassels. His right hand is
lifted in sign of adoration; his left holds ascent box. On his breast he
wears a breastplate of the shape of a Maltese cross, its points extending
to the shoulders. A band reaching from the right shoulder to the hem
and, widening from the shoulder on, makes a brocade on the robe, which
iaps over the feet in large folds. On the vertical edge of the lid behind
the head is the legend, in beautiful Pheenician characters, ‘‘Abdmelqart,
the Rab.”

Another funeral chamber at the bottom of the shaft contained a second
sarcophagus with a human figure of the same dimensions, less archaic
in style, possibly, yet wonderfully lifelike. The pose is the same, but
the body, instead of being engraved, is sculptured in high relief on the
cover, like the knights and ladies on their stone coffins. The expression
is calm and collected; the hair and beard are carefully curled. The
sculptor’s work, somewhat weak and betokening no great antiquity, is
so finely done that all the details of the costume can be studied. A
large band, a sort of cap, caught at the shoulder by a clasp, falls to the
middle of the leg. Asin the other sarcophagus, the right hand is lifted
and the left holds a scent box on a level with the breast.

Contact with these great dead, who possibly played a role in the
struggles of Carthage with the Romans, is deeply impressive, and cone
is tempted to question them. Whowerethey? Were they all of equal
dignity? What office was denoted by that title Rab, which signifies
“prince” or “grandee?” Doubtless it meant members of one of the
grand councils of Carthage, one of the principes mentioned after the
suffetes on inscriptions. The dedication of the temple of Astarte and
Tanit, found at nearly the same time on the top of the cliff overlooking
the necropolis of Bordj Djedid, mentions on the list of eponymic mag-
istrates, between the suffetes and the high priest, the same personages
with the same titles. And who knows but what the soil of Carthage
may some day yield a list of the Rab, or, indeed, of the suffetes—a list
which would do for Carthaginian history what the discovery of the
Consular Fastes has done for Roman history?

Meanwhile every day adds to our knowledge, or, rather, diminishes
our ignorance, and every day we are permitted to penetrate deeper
into this life beyond the tomb, the continuation of terrestrial existence.
Some few weeks ago M. Gauckler discovered near a shaft one of the
small lead leaves rolled up, which were slipped into the tomb, and bore
lmprecations to restrain certain spirits or conciliate them; only the
inscription was not Greek or Latin, like that of all hitherto known, but
in Pheenician characters. Thus beliefs supposed to have been peculiar
to Egypt or Greece turn out to have been Carthaginian as well.

Another inscription, the latest discovered, of which Peré Delattre
has just sent a photograph, will possibly furnish some light on this
point, when entirely deciphered. It is a funeral inscription of rare
614 THE EXCAVATIONS OF CARTHAGE.

interest, in which the author traces his genealogy back to the seventh
or eighth generation. The genealogy is accompanied by honorary
titles, of whose import we have as yet only a faint idea. After giving
his descent, the Carthaginian at great length commends the monument
that he has erected and possibly his titles also to the favor of the gods,
and appears to invoke the benediction of the sun god on his mortal
remains.

At all events, it is not a slab for merely identifying the dead, but a
monumental inscription intended for an edifice over the tomb. It seems,
then, that the necropolises whose traces we seek underground were
covered, according to a frequent usage among Oriental peoples, with
monuments which kept a place for the dead among the living. Up-
heavals—the law of history—have swept these monuments away, but
one inscription has been left as proof of their existence. Others will
be found; the discoveries that have succeeded each other for some
years without interruption in the domain of Carthaginian antiquity
permit us to hope for more.

We must not shut our eyes to the fact that we are witnesses of an
event of greater archologic interest than any that has taken place
for some time. It is the beginning of the resurrection of Carthage.
If for no other reason than this, we ought to congratulate ourseives
upon the conquest that has put Tunis into our hands, and gave a pow-
erful stimulus to research by handing this historic ground over to
science as a field for exploration, such as, comparatively speaking,
Egypt was at the beginning of the century. The minister of public
instruction thoroughly realized its importance when he instituted the
North African commission. It instigates discoveries and centralizes
them; serves as a bond between the direction of the Académie des
Antiquités in Tunis and the officers of our topographical survey and
the scholars to whom it intrusts missions, and effectively coordinates
all these efforts in a way beginning to show good results.

Every civilization depends on those that have preceded it. It puts
to good use the lessons of things. The sites of towns, ports, roads,
the administration of water ways, the customs of the first cultivators of
land, the laws that governed their development, are so many signboards
for later occupants. The knowledge of Carthaginian civilization and
of times preceding it is necessary to understand the development of
Roman colonization. It even explains for us to-day certain predominant
traits of that mixture of peoples unified by Islam. In this study noth-
ing can be neglected, for often things apparently valueless suddenly
assume unsuspected importance. I do not speak of the pleasure
experienced by the lover of science, when he questions ancient times,
reconstructs what is no more, follows up the genesis of nations, discovers
points of contact between civilizations to all appearance widely sepa-
rated, and explains the present by the past, thereby fully realizing the
bond that unites all things.
THH TRANSPORTATION AND LIFTING OF HEAVY BODIES
BY THE ANCIENTS:!

A PROBABLE METHOD.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, C. EH.

Curator of Technology, United States National Museum.

The ability displayed by the ancients in transporting heavy objects
from place to place, and in raising them many feet above the surface of
the ground in the construction of temples, palaces, and pyramids, has
long been a source of wonder. It may, indeed, be truly said that the
“engineers of the present era would find it difficult to perform similar
feats, even when aided by the mostimproved appliances devised through
the ingenuity developed in this inventive age.

So impressed with amazement at the achievements of the ancient
architects have trained archeologists become that not infrequently the
opinion is expressed that these men, whose work has withstood the
ravages of scores of centuries, must have been aided by well-devised
machines, possibly operated by one or more of the generated forces.

Notwithstanding these conjectures, in the many careful and thorough
explorations made in Jate years the remains of no hoisting machine
have thus far been discovered, nor has there been found, either in the
Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform inscriptions or in the Egyptian hiero-
glyphiecs, an account or description of the processes employed by the
ancients in lifting heavy masses to extraordinary heights. In fact, no
equivalents for the words “ derrick,” “ pulley,” ‘“‘ winch,” etc., have yet
been identified in these ancient records to encourage the belief in a
seaculo sapienti.

Itis the purpose of this paper to explain how many of the edifices now
regarded as remarkable could have been constructed by primitive tools
and simple methods. Eight years ago, while the writer was making
the investigations which led to the publication of a paper entitled
“The beginnings of engineering,” presented before the American
Society of Civil Engineers, access was had to many drawings and
photographs of ancient mural paintings and carvings in relief in the

615
616 TRANSPORTATION OF HEAVY BODIES BY THE ANCIENTS.

collections of the United States National Museum and in the great
libraries of Washington and New York City.

While several pictorial remains are in existence, showing how, by
the aid of sledges, rollers, and levers, huge images of stone were moved
‘over ground from the quarry to the building under construction, noth-
ing has been found to show how these heavy masses were lifted into
position. In examining the photographs referred to, it was noted,
especially in the pictorial representation of Assyrian and Egyptian
remains, that many figures are represented in various attitudes carry-
ing something in baskets or bags. It occurred to the writer that this
‘‘something” was clay or other kind of earth, and a method of lifting
heavy bodies into position suggested itself, in which the sledge, the
roller, the level, and the inclined plane, made of earth, were the only
mechanical powers necessary to be utilized, no pulleys, cranes or other
machinery being employed. .

From the earliest times the erection of embankments of earth has
been carried on by savage nations and primitive peoples. The earth-
works left by the mound builders in America and Europe are conspicu- —
ous evidence that the digging and carrying of earth was practiced on a
large scale in many localities, far distant from one another, centuries
ago.

Let us see how, by the aid of inclined planes of earth, the huge
stones used in the construction of dolmens or cromlecks could be put in
position by the use of primitive appliances. The stone posts could be
moved to the desired place and erected in a vertical position in the
manner indicated by the several accompanying drawings. In the illus-
tration (PI. I) figure 1 shows the stone post lying flat and supported
upon rellers; figure 2 shows two piles of earth dug from the pit in
which one of the posts is to stand. The stone slab can be rolied up
the inclined plane and tilted into position, and, by the use of levers
and pry bars, be made to stand upright; and when the second post was
erected by a similar operation, and the space between the posts and
around them filled with earth, the top stone or lintel could be placed in
position after being elevated to the desired height on another inclined
plane, made of earth, as shown in Pl. II. These operations being com- -
pleted, the earth could be returned to the pits from which it was dug
and the surface of the ground leveled.

Since chese lines were written the author has received the following
communication from Dr, William H. Dall, of the United States Geo-
logical Survey:

“During a visit to the island of Jersey (Channel Islands) in 1878,
while wandering over the hills, f noticed among many dolmens scat-
tered about one which seemed to have never been finished. The sides
stood erect, and one enormous roofing slab had been laid in place, cov-
ering about half the cavity at the inner end. Behind it and against

the erect slab, forming the end of the chamber, was an inclined plane
of earth, beaten very hard, and extending from the level of the uprights

to the general level of the soil. Here was a clue to a very simple
explanation of what had often puzzled me—how the prehistoric people
without tools could have raised such heavy weights as the roofing slabs
of the dolmens to the positions in which we find them. It was evident
that cords and rollers, with a sufficient number of sturdy savages,
would have been amply sufficient for the purpose in the case betore
me. The thorough manner in which the clay of the inclined plane had
been consolidated was evident when it was considered that the denu-
dation of it by the elements during unknown centuries had been insuf-
ficient to noticeably reduce its level or conceal its evident purpose.”

- The construction of the Egyptian pyramids, for centuries a matter
of wonder, could have been performed by similar methods. Let us
suppose that each of the stone blocks used had a rectangular base,
being half as thick as wide, and that they were moved from the quarry
to the pyramid in the direction indicated by the arrow in figure 1, block
No. 1 being first placed on rollers and moved into position. The stone
blocks numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5 could then have been transported along
the surface of the ground in the same manner, and so could the other
stones in the same tier, which are not shown in this view. An embank-
ment at a 20 or 30 per cent grade (see section A) could then have been
constructed by

Over the sur- ne

face of this plane, extended toward the quarry, the second tier of stones,
of which blocks numbered 6, 7, 8, and 9 are visible, could then have
been put in place; embankment B could then have been constructed,
blocks numbered 10, 11, 12, and those behind them being put in place;
and so on, by the aid of the additions to the embankments, C, D, and
£, the remaining stones could have been put in position.

When the pyramid was complete the earth could have been removed
from in front of it, the pits filled up, restoring the original condition of
the surface of the ground, leaving no hint to gratify the explorer forty
centuries after the work was done.

Let us see what labor this method would have involved in the con-
struction of the pyramid of Gizeh, the largest of its kind, which is
approximately 150 yards high and 250 yards square at the base. As
is well known, in building this pyramid, which is located 3 miles south
of Cairo, two kinds of stone were used—limestone and red granite. The
limestone was quarried at El] Massarah, 45 or 50 miles from Gizeh, while
the red granite was brought from Assouan, near the first Cataract,
over 500 miles. Both of these quarries were located on the River Nile.

AMC

In the foreground of the illustration (Pl. III) are to be seen rafts
laden with stone blocks, brought from the quarries. Upon the sloping
embankment blocks are being drawn on sledges, perhaps equipped with
rollers, to the highest point to which the structure has been built, the
inclined plane being gradually made longer and higher with earth
brought from the pits on the right and left. The highest embankment
necessary when the workmen reached the top course, assuming that a 20
per cent grade was adopted, would have been 750 yards long, contain-
ing about 7,500,000 cubic yards, if the sides of the earth embankment
would stand at an angle of 30 degrees, which is not at all improbable.

Assuming that one laborer could have placed 23 yards (about 20
barrow loads) of earth on an average each day on this embankment,
10,000 men could have built it in twelve months of twenty-five working
days. Itis stated that 100,000 men were employed for twenty years in
the whole work, so that, according to this calculation, the construction
of this embankment would have occupied only a small portion of the
total time consumed.

The false werk to support the walls of the interior chambers of the
pyramids could also have been made of earth rather than of timber. It
should be remembered that heavy lumber for scaffolding must have
been brought over long distances and that the framing and erection of
any structure of sufficient strength to bear heavy weights would have
required more skill and knowledge than the building of the pyramid
itself by the method above described.

In the great temple of Rameses II is to be found a collossal statue of
that king, which equals in dimensions and exceeds in weight any other
Egyptian monolith, being 60 feet high and weighing 887 tons 54 hun-
dredweight. It was made from a single block of red granite brought
from the quarries at Assouan, 135 miles distant, by the River Nile.

At Baalbec, Syria, are to be found the ruins of three temples, one of
which has been given the name of Trilithon, ‘‘Three-stone temple,”
from the extraordinary proportions of three of the stone blocks found
in it, each being over 63 feet in length, 13 feet in height, and propor-
tionately thick. These stones now rest in a wall over 20 feet above the
present surface of the ground.

In the solution of the problem of putting similar huge blocks in place
at the present day the utilization of inclined planes of earth in the
manner just described might well be considered by the modern engineer
before adopting a more complex method. In fact, since the various
details of this method of construction have suggested themselves, the
writer has examined photographs of many ancient structures and has
yet to find one that could not have been constructed to a great extent
according to the practices just described. Until the principles of the
true arch were understood it was less difficult to move and erect long
blocks of stone by these primitive methods than to place smaller units

over the openings of structures designed in accordance with the types
of ancient architecture, in which the arch, with a keystone, was lacking.

_ Especially was this true in an era when the value of time was not
considered, and slaves were to be obtained by thousands, at small cost,
to toil and sweat to gratify the ambition and perpetuate the fame of
kings.

Happily for our race and time, the crack of the Egyptian slave mas-
ter’s whip and the weird cries in cadence of the battalions of swarthy
laborers, while tugging in unison to draw or hoist the monolith, has
given place to the puffing engine and the rumble of revolving wheels;
but, mayhap, in the years to come, the engineering methods in vogue
at the end of this eventful century will seem almost as crude to those
who will practice in the new fields of applied science on the borders of
which we seem to stand as these primitive methods of the ancients now
appear to us. Whether the anticipations for the future shall be real-
ized or not, and proud as we may be of the advances made by discov-
ery and invention in our age, we must not forget that the patient per-
severance of the engineers of antiquity, who, by brawn and muscle, and
unaided by mechanism, built wiser than they knew, have been rewarded
by the preservation of an indelible record of their achievements in the
material remains of their edifices that have withstood the ravages of
centuries. Will fate so favor the engineer of the nineteenth century,
versed in the laws of modern science, and skilled in the practice of the
mechanic arts?

POSTSCRIPT.—Since this paper was published in Cassier’s Magazine,
there appeared in L’Illustration, Paris, for the first time, an illustrated
account of the restoration in 1895-1898 of the Temple of Karnak, the
original construction of which was begun by Usertsen I in the twenty-
fifth century B. C., being added to by Thothmes III, 1600 B. C., and
again by Rameses III, 1200 B. C.

In the work connected with this valuable archeological undertaking,
a Frenchman, M. M. G. Legrain, under whose direction the restoration
was carried on, employed at one time over 700 Fellahs. The methods
adopted to replace the huge carved blocks of stone are thus described
in L’Ilustration, January, 1899:

By means of filling in and an inclined plane M. Legrain succeeded in lowering,
piece by piece, its architraves of a weight of 57,200 pounds, and its capital and its
tambours of 22,000 and 9,900 pounds.

* * * * * *

It is a curious fact that the Fellahs merely began again exactly what their fathers ~
had done in order to crown with success the work to be accomplished. In looking
at these inclined planes and at the laborers bent under baskets of earth, we find
ourselves carried back several thousand years, since we have seen the same picture
sculptured upon the walls of the edifices in commemoration of their construction.
There is but one thing wanting in the modern picture, and we have not to regret it,
and that is the man with the lash, the taskmaster of the force of laborers of what
was, of old, the land of the Pharaohs.

THE PAST PROGRESS AND PRESENT POSITION OF THE
ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCHS.!

By E. W. BRABROOK.

Iam very sensible of the honor of presiding over this section at a
Bristol meeting. Bristol, from its association with the memory of
J. C. Prichard, may be regarded as the very birthplace of British
anthropology. .

In submitting to this section some observations on the past progress
and the present position of the anthropological sciences I use the
plural term, which is generally adopted by our French colleagues, in
order to remind you that anthropology is in fact a group of sciences.
There is what in France is called pure anthropology or anthropology
proper, but which we prefer to call physical anthropology—the science
of the physical characters of man, including anthropometry and crani-
ology, and mainly based upon anatomy and physiology. There is com-
parative anthropology, which deals with the zoological position of man-
kind. There is prehistoric archeology, which covers a wide range of
inquiry into man’s early works, and has to seek the aid of the geolo-
gist and the metallurgist. There is psychology, which comprehends
the whole operations of his mental faculties. There is linguistics,
which traces the history of human language. There is folklore, which
investigates man’s traditions, customs, and beliefs. There are ethnog-
raphy, which describes the races of mankind, and ethnology, which
differentiates between them, both closely connected with geographical
Science. There is sociology, which applies the learning accumulated
in all the other branches of anthropology to man’s relation to his fel-
lows, and requires the cooperation of the statistician and the econo-
mist. How can any single person master in its entirety a group of
sciences which covers so wide a field, and requires in its students such
various faculties and qualifications? Here, if anywhere, we must be
content to divide our labors. The grandeur and comprehensiveness of
the subject are among its attractions. The old saying, “I am a man,

and therefore I think nothing human to be foreign to me,” expresses
the ground upon which the anthropological sciences claim from us a
special attention.

ft may illustrate what I have said as to the varied endowments of.
anthropologists by a reference to the names of four distinguished men
who have occupied in previous years the place which it falls to my lot
to fill to-day—most unworthily, as I can not but acknowledge, when I
think of their preeminent qualifications. When the association last
met at Bristol, in 1875, anthropology was not a section, but only a
department, and it was presided over by Rolleston. There may be
some here who recollect the address he then delivered, informed from
beginning to end with that happy and playful wit which was charac-
teristic of him; but all will know how great he was in anatomy, what
a wide range of classical and other learning he possessed, and how he

‘delighted to bring it to bear on every anthropological subject that was
presented to his notice. In 1878 Huxley was the chairman of this
department. It is only necessary to mention the name of that illus-
trious biologist to recall to your memory how much anthropology owes
to him. Hight years before he had been president of the association
itself, and seven years before that had published his Evidence as to
Man’s Place in Nature. Brilliant as his successes were in other
branches of scientific investigation, | can not but think that anthro-
pology was with him a favorite pursuit. His writings upon that
subject possess a wonderful charm of style. In 1883 the chairman
was Pengelly, who for many years rendered service to anthropology by
his exploration of Kent’s Cavern and other caves, and who happily
illustrated the close relation that exists between geology and anthro-
pology. His biography, recently published, must have reminded many
of us of the amiable qualities which adorned his character. Finally, in
1886, two years after anthropology had become a section, its president
was Sir George Campbell, a practical ethnologist, a traveler, an admin-
istrator, a legislator, a geographer, who passed through a long career
of public life with honor and distinetion. All my other predecessors
are, | am glad to say, still living, and I make no mention of them.
The few names I have cited—selected by the accidental circumstance
that they are no longer with us—are sufficient to show what varied
gifts and pursuits are combined in the study of anthropology.

There is-another side to the question. Great as is the diversity of
the anthropological sciences, their unity is still more remarkable. The
student of man must study the whole man. No true knowledge of any
human group, any more than of a human individual, is obtained by
observation of physical characters alone. Modes of thought, language,
arts, and history must also be investigated. This simultaneous inves
tigation involves in each case the same logical methods and processes.
It will in general be attended with the same results. If it be true that
the order of the universe is expressed in continuity and notin cataclysm,
PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 623

we Shall find the same slow but sure progress evident in each branch
of the inquiry. We shall find that nothing is lost, that no race is abso-
lutely destroyed, that everything that has been still exists in a modi-
fied form, and contributes some of its elements to that which is. We
shall find that this, which no one doubts in regard to physical matters,
is equally true of modes of thought. We may trace these to their
germs in the small brain of the palceolithic flint worker; or, if we care
te do so, still further back. This principle has, as I understand, been
fully accepted in geology and biology, and throughout the domain of
physical science—what should hinder its application to anthropology?
It supplies a formula of universal validity, and can not but add force
and sublimity to our imagination of the wisdom of the Creator. It is
little more than has been expressed in the familiar words of Tennyson—

“Yet I doubt not thro’ the ages one increasing purpose runs,
And the thoughts of men are widen’d with the process of the suns;”

and supports his claim to be ‘“‘ the heir of all the ages, in the foremost
files of time.”

I propose, in briefly drawing your attention to some recent contribu-
tions to our knowledge, to use this as a convenient theory and as point-
ing out the directions in which further investigations may be rewarded
by even fuller light.

Applying it, first of all, to the department of physical anthropology,
we are called upon to consider the discovery by Dr. Dubois at Trinil, in
Java, of the remains of an animal called by him Pithecanthropus erectus,
and considered by some authorities to be one of the missing links in the
chain of animal existence which terminates in man. In his presidential
address to this association last year, Sir John Evans said: “Even the
Pithecanthropus erectus of Dr. Kugéne Dubois from Java meets with
some incredulous objectors from both the physiological and the geolog-
ical sides. From the point of view of the latter the difficulty lies in
determining the exact age of what are apparently alluvial beds in the
bottom of a river valley.” In regard to these objections, it should be
remembered that though the skull and femur in question are the only
remains resembling humanity discovered in the site, it yielded a vast
number of fossil bones of other animals, and that any difficulty in set-
tling the geological age must apply to the whole results of the explora-
tion. The physiological difficulties arise in two points—do the skull
and femur belong to the sameindividual? Are they, or either of them,
human, or simian, or intermediate? As to the first, it is true that the
two bones were separated by a distance of about 50 feet, but as they
were found precisely on the same level, accompanied by no other bones
resembling human bones, but by a great number of animal remains,
apparently deposited at the same moment, the theory that they belonged
to different individuals would only add to the difficulty of the problem.
With regard to the skull, a projection of its outline on a diagram com-

paring it with others of low type belonging to the stone age shows it

to be essentially inferior to any of them. With regard to the thigh,
you will recollect that at the Liverpool meeting of this section, Dr.
Hepburn displayed a remarkable collection of femora from the anatom-
ical museum of Edinburgh University, exhibiting pathological and
other conditions similar to those in the femur of Trinil. Though this
evidence tends to show that the bone is human, it is not inconsistent
with, but on the contrary goes to support, the conclusion that it belongs
to an exceedingly low and ancient type of humanity. Whether, there-
fore, we call the remains Pithecanthropus erectus with their discoverer,
or Homo pithecanthropus with Dr. Manouvrier, or Homo Javanensis
primigenius with Dr. Houzé, we are in presence of a valuable document
in the early evolution of mankind.

One element of special interest in this discovery is that it brings us
nearer than we have ever been brought before to the time when man or
his predecessor acquired the erect position. I believe that it is acknowl-
edged by all that the femur belonged to an individual who stood upright,
and I presume that the capacity of the skull being greater than that of
any known anthropoid is consistent with the same inference. The sig-
nificance of that has been most clearly set forth by my predecessor, Dr.
Munro, in his address to this section at Nottingham in 1893. He showed
that a direct consequence of the upright position was a complete divi-
sion of labor as regards the functions of the limbs—the hands being
reserved for manipulation and the feet for locomotion; that this neces-
sitated great changes in the general structure of the body, including
the pelvis and the spinal column; that the hand became the most com-
plete and effective mechanical organ nature has produced; and that
this perfect piece of mechanism, at the extremity of a freely moving
arm, gives man a superiority in attack and defense over other animals.
Further, he showed that, from the first moment that man recognized
the advantage of using a club or a stone in attack or defense, the direct
incentive to a higher brain development came into existence. Theman
who first used a spear tipped with a sharp flint became possessed of
an irresistible power. In his expeditions for hunting, fishing, gathering
fruit, etc., primitive man’s acquaintance with the mechanical powers of
nature would be gradually extended; and thus from this vantage point
of the possession of a hand, language, thought, reasoning, abstract
ideas would gradually be acquired, and the functions of the hand and
the brain be developed in a corresponding manner. I do injustice to
Dr. Munro’s masterly argument by stating it thus crudely and briefly.
It amounts to this—once the erect position is obtained, the actions of
man being controlled by a progressive brain, everything follows in due
course.

The next stage which we are yet able to mark with certainty is the
paleolithic, but there must have been a great many intermediate stages.
Before man began to make any implements at all, there must have been

aE ee eh ee ee
PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 625

a stage of more or less length during which he used any stick or stone
that came to his hands without attempting to fashion the one or the
other. Before he acquired the art of fashioning so elaborate an instru-
ment as the ordinary paleolithic ax or hammer, there must have been
other stages in which he would have been content with such an improve-
ment on the natural block of flint as a single fracture would produce,
and would proceed to two or three or more fractures by degrees. It
must have been long before he could have acquired the eye for symme-
try and the sense of design, of adaptation of means to ends, which are
expressed in the fashioning of a complete palzolithic implement. It is
probable that such rude implements as he would construct in this inter-
val would be in general hardly distinguishable from flints naturally
fractured. Hence the uncertainty that attaches to such discoveries of
the kind as have hitherto been made public. Prof. McKenny Hughes,
who speaks with very high authority, concludes a masterly paper in
the Archeological Journal with the statement that he has ‘‘ never yet
seen any evidence which would justify the inference that any implements
older than palolithic have yet been found.” The name “ palotalith,”
which had been suggested for prepalolithic implements, seems to him
unnecessary at present, as there is nothing to which it can be applied;
and as it will be long before it can be asserted that we have discovered
the very earliest traces of man, he thinks it will probably be long
before the word is wanted. An elaborate work on the ruder forms of
implement, just published by M. A. Thieullen, of Paris, who has for
many years been engaged in collecting ‘these objects, adds materially
to our knowledge of the subject.

Another line of argument bearing strongly in the same direction is
afforded by the discovery in various places of works of art fabricated
by early man. The statuettes from Brassempouy, the sculptures repre-
senting animals from the Bruniquel, the well-known figure of the mam-
moth engraved on a piece of ivory from Périgord, and many other
specimens of early art attest a facility that it is not possible to associ-
ate with the dawn of human intelligence. M. Salomon Reinach tells an
amusing story. A statuette in steatite of a woman, resembling in some
respects those of Brassempouy, was discovered in one of the caveras
of Mentone, as far back as 1884, but when the discoverer showed it to
a personage in the locality, that authority advised him not to let it be
seen, lest it should take away from the belief in the antiquity of the
caves, it being then thought too artistic to be consistent with early man.
The finder acted on this advice, in ignorance of the real interest of the
statuette, until April, 1896, when he showed it to M. Reinach and M., Vil-
lenoisy, who promptly interviewed the sage adviser in question, and
obtained a confirmation of the statement. Some interesting additions
to our gallery of prehistoric art have been recently made by M. Emile
Riviere and M. Berthoumeyrou, at Cro-Magnon, inthe Dordogne. These
are a drawing of a bison and another of a human female in profile,

which M. Riviere has kindly allowed me to reproduce. Among the
other objects found in the same place were some flint implements
brought to a fine point, suitable for engraving on bone or horn.

The idea of making in any form a graphic representation of anything
seen has never, so far as I know, occurred to any lower animal; and it
could hardly have been among the first ideas formed in the gradually
developing human brain. When that idea is found carried out with
remarkable artistic skill, by means of implements well adapted for the
purpose, we may surely assume that the result was not obtained till
after a long interval of time, and was approached by gradual steps
marked by progress in other faculties, as well as in the artistic faculty.

it may be that some day ali uncertainty on this head will be removed
by decisive discoveries.

The interval between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods rests in
the like condition of incertitude. That by some means, and somewhere
on the face of the globe, the one period gradually passed into the other
we can not but believe. That the transition between them may have
involved innumerable degrees is also highly probable. Where and
when and how each step was taken we do not know at present, and
possibly never shall know. The problem is not satisfactorily solved by
the production of paleolithic implements resembling neolithic forms,
or neolithic implements resembling paleolithic forms, inasmuch as
between the one period and the other an interval of time involving
geological and other changes has to be accounted for.

In this respect, also, our best authorities are the most cautious and
PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 627

conservative. In the excellent address which Prof. Boyd Dawkins
delivered to the Royal Archeological Institute at the Dorchester meet-
ing last year, on the present phase of prehistoric archeology, he con-
trasted the few primitive arts, such as sewing, and the manufacture of
personal ornaments and rude implements of the chase, possessed by the
paleolithic hunters—apart from their great proficiency in the delinea-
tion of animals—with the variety of arts, such as husbandry, garden-
ing, spinning, weaving, carpentry, boat building, mining, and pottery
making, possessed by the neolithic herdsmen, and held that between
the two there is a great gulf fixed. Somewhere the gulf must be
bridged over. Prof. Boyd Dawkins says that the bridge is not to be
found in the caverns of the south of France. It is difficult to meet his
argument that the presence of grains of barley and stones of the culti-
vated plum at Mas d’Azil are evidences of neolithic civilization. His
objections to other discoveries are not so strong as this, but are strong
enough to make us pause. The tall, long-headed people whose remains
were found at Cro-Magnon, he holds te be early neolithic and not pale-
olithic, to stand on the near side and not on the far side of the great
gulf.

These considerations lend importance to the discoveries which have
been laid before this association at previous meetings by Mr. Seton-
Kerr, and which have also been commented upon by Prof. Flinders
Petrie and Sir John Evans. If we are compelled to admit a breach of
continuity in Europe, is it in Africa that we shall find the missing

links? That is another of the great problems yet unsolved. The

evidence we want relates to events which took place at so great a
distance of time that we may well wait patiently for it, assured that
somewhere or other these missing links in the chain of continuity must
have existed and probably are still to be found.

The next stage, which comprises the interval between the neolithic
and the historic periods, was so ably dealt with by Mr. Arthur J. Evans
in his address to this section at the Liverpool meeting that it does not
eall for any observations from me. ‘Two committees appointed by the
association in connection with this section touch upon this interval—
the committee for investigating the lake dwellings at Glastonbury, and
the committee for cooperating with the explorers of Silchester in their
well-conducted and fruitful investigation of the influence of Roman
civilization on a poor provincial population. I pass on to consider the
very great progress that has been made of late years in some of the
branches of anthropology other than physical and prehistoric, and
especially in that of folklore. I do this the more readily because I do
not recollect that folklore has ever before been prominently referred
to in an address to this section. Itis beginning to assert itself here,
and will in time acquire the conspicuous position to which it is becoming
entitled, for the British Association is sensitive to every scientific

movement and responds readily to the demands of a novel investiga-
628 PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

tion. Already, for three or four years, a day has been given at our
meetings to folklore papers, and at the Liverpool meeting an exceeding
philosophic, and at the same time practical, paper was read by Mr.
Gomme, and is printed in extenso in the proceedings as an appendix
to the report of the ethnographic survey committee. The term “folk-
lore” itself is not without a certain charm. It is refreshing to find a
science described by two English syllables instead of by some compound
Greek word. The late Mr. W.J.Thoms had a happy inspiration when
he invented the name. It is just twenty years since the Folklore ~
Society was established under his direction. It has accumulated a
vast amount of material and published a considerable literature. It
is now rightly passing from the stage of collection to that of system-
atization, and the works of Mr. J. G. Frazer, Mr. HE. Sidney Hartland,
and others are pointing the way toward researches of the most
absorbing interest and the greatest practical importance.

A generalization for which we are fast accumulating material in folk-
lore is that of the tendency of mankind to develop the like fancies and
ideas at the like stage of intellectual infancy. This is akin to the
generalization that the stages of the life of an individual man present
a marked analogy to the corresponding stages in the history of mankind
at large, and to the generalization that existing savage races present
in their intellectual development a marked analogy to the condition of
the earlier races of mankind. The fancies and ideas of the child
resemble closely the fancies and ideas of the savage and the fancies
and ideas of primitive man.

An extensive study of children’s games, which had been entered into
and pursued by Mrs. Gomme, has been rewarded by the discovery of
many facts bearing upon these views. A great number of these games
consist of dramatic representations of marriage by capture and mar-
riage by purchase—the idea of exogamy is distinctly embodied in
them. You will see a body of children separate themselves into two
hostile tribes, establish a boundary line between them, demand tbe one
from the other a selected maiden, and then engage in conflict to deter-
mine whether the aggressors can carry her across the boundary or the
defenders retain her within it.

There can be little doubt that these games go back to a high antiq-
uity, and there is much probability that they are founded upen customs
actually existing or just passing away at the time they were first
played. Games of this kind pass down with little change from age to
age. Hach successive generation of childhood is short. The child who
this year is a novice in a game becomes next year a proficient and
the year after an expert, capable of teaching others, and proud of the
ability to do so. Even the adult recollects the games of childhood and
watches over the purity of the tradition. The child is ever a strong
conservative.

Upon the same principle, next to children’s games, children’s stories
c
oe

PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 629

claim our attention. Miss Roalfe Cox has collected, abstracted, and
tabulated not fewer then 345 variants of Cinderella, Catskin, and Cap o’
Rushes. These come from ali four quarters of the globe, and some of
them are recorded as early as the middle of the sixteenth century.
These elaborate stories are still being handed down from generation to
generation of children, as they have been for countless generations in
the past. Full of detail as they are, they may be reduced to a few
primitive ideas. If we view them in their wealth of detail we shall
deem it impossible that they could have been disseminated over the
world as they are otherwise than by actual contact of the several
peoples with each other. If we view them in their simplivity of idea
we shall be more disposed to think that the mind of man naturally pro-
duces the same result in the like circumstances, and that it is not
necessary to postulate any communication between the peoples to
account for the identity. It does not surprise us that the same compli-
cated physical operations should be performed by far distant peoples
without any communication with each other. Why should it be more
surprising that mental operations not nearly so complex should be
produced in the same order by different peoples without any such com-
munication? Where communication is proved or probable it may be
accepted as a sufficient explanation; where it is not provable there is
no need that we shouid assume its existence.

The simple ideas which are traceable in so many places and so far
back are largely in relation with that branch ef mythology which per-
sonifies the operations of nature. Far be it from me to attempt to
define the particular phase of it which is embodied in the figure of
Cinderella as she sits among the ashes by the hearth or to join in the
chase after the solar myth in popular tradition. The form of legend
which represents some of the forces of nature under the image of a real
or fictitious hero capable of working wonders appears to be widely dis-
tributed. Of such, I take it, are the traditions relating to Glooscap,
which the late Dr. 8. T. Rand collected in the ceurse of his forty years’
labors as a missionary among the Micmac Indians of Nova Scotia,
where, Mr. Webster says, Glooscap formerly resided. The Indians sup-
pose that he is still in existence, although they do not know exactly
where. He looked and lived like other men; ate, drank, smoked, slept,
and danced along with them, but never died, never was sick, never grew
old. Cape Blomidon was his home, the Basin of Minas his beaver

pond. He had everything on a large scale. At Cape Split he cut

open the beaver dam, as the Indian name of the cape implies, and to
this we owe it that ships can pass there. Spencers Island was his
kettle. His dogs, when he went away, were transformed into two
rocks close by. When he returns he will restore them to life. He
could do anything and everything. The elements were entirely under
his control. You do not often meet with a mischievous exercise of his
power. Itis a curious part of the tradition, possibly a late addition
630 PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

to it, that it was the encroachments and treachery of the whites which
drove him away.

The early inhabitants of the island of Tahiti appear to have had a
whole pantheon of gods and heroes representing the various operations
of nature. Even the Papuans have a legend in which the morning star
is personified acting as a thief. But it is needless to multiply instances.
Lord Bacon, who says ‘The earliest antiquity lies buried in silence
and oblivion. * * * This silence was succeeded by poetical fables,
and these at length by the writings we now enjoy, so that the concealed
and secret learning of the ancients seems separated from the history
and knowledge of the following ages by a veil or partition wall of
fables interposing between the things that are lost and those that
remain,” has shown in his Wisdom of the Ancients that classical
mythology was in truth a vast system of nature worship, and in so
doing has done more than even he knew, for he has affiliated it to those
ideas which have been so commonly formed among rude and primitive
peoples. It is true, he says, fables in general are composed of ductile
matter, that may be drawn into great variety by a witty talent or an
inventive genius and be delivered of plausible meanings which they
never contained. But the argument of most weight with him, he con-
tinues, ‘‘is that many of these fables by no means appear to have been
invented by the persons who relate and divulge them, whether Homer,
Hesiod, or others; but whoever attentively considers the thing will find
that these fables are delivered down and related by those writers not
as matters then first invented and proposed, but as things received and
embraced in earlier ages. The relators drew from the common stock
of ancient tradition and varied but in point of embellishment, which is
their own. This principally raises my esteem of these fables, which I
receive not as the product of the age or invention of the poets, but as
sacred relics, gentle whispers, and the breath of better times, that from
the traditions of more ancient nations came at length into the flutes
and trumpets of the Greeks.”

Except that he supposes them to bea relic of better times, the poet’s
dream of a golden age no doubt still ringing in his ears, Bacon had in
this, aS in many other matters, a clear insight into the meaning of
things.

Another idea that appears among very early and primitive peoples
and has had in all time a powerful influence on mankind is that of a
separable spirit. The aborigines of northwest central Queensland,
who have lately been studied to such excellent purpose by Dr. Walter
Roth, the brother of a much-esteemed past officer of this section, are in
many respects low in the scale of humanity, yet they possess this idea.
They believe that the ghost or shade or spirit of some one departed can
So initiate an individual into the mysteries of the craft of doctor or medi-
cine man as to enable him, by the use of a death-bone apparatus, to

PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 631

extract blood from the victim against whom it is pointed without actual
contact and to insert in him some foreign substance. They will not go
alone to the grave of a relative for fear of seeing his ghost. It appears
that they have the fancy that Europeans are ghosts. The Tasmanians
also, as Mr. Ling Roth himself tells us, had the same fancy as to the
Europeans and believed that the dead could act upon the living. The
Pawnee Indians, we are assured by Mr. Grinnell, believe that the spir-
its of the dead live after their bodies are dust. They imagine that the
little whirlwinds often seen in summer are ghosts. The Blackfeet think
the shadow of a person is his soul and that while the souls of the good
are allowed to go to the sand hills, those of the bad remain as ghosts
near the place where they died. The Shillooks of Central Africa are
said to believe that the ghostly specters of the dead are always invisibly
present with the living and accompany them wherever they go. The
aborigines of Samoa believed in a land of ghosts, to which the spirits
of the deceased were carried immediately after death. The religious
system of the Amazulu, as described by Bishop Callaway, rests largely
on the foundation of belief in the continued activity of the disembodied
spirits of deceased ancestors.

Mr. Bryee, in his ‘‘ Impressions of South Africa,” says that at Lezapi,
in Mashonaland, are three huts, one of which is roofed and is the grave
of a famous chief whose official name was Makoni. ‘‘On the grave
there stands a large earthenware pot, which used to be regularly filled
with native beer, when, once a year, about the anniversary of his death,
his sons and other descendants came to venerate and propitiate his
ghost. Five years ago, when the white men came into the country, the
ceremony was disused, and the poor ghost is now left without honor and
nutriment. The pot is broken, and another pot, which stood in an
adjoining hut and was used by the worshipers, has disappeared. The
place, however, retains its awesome character, and a native boy who was
with us would not enter it. The sight brought vividly to mind the
similar spirit worship which went on among the Romans, and which
goes on to-day in China; but I could not ascertain for how many gen-
erations back an ancestral ghost receives these attentions—a point
which has remained obscure in the case of Roman ghosts also.”

The aborigines of New Britain are said to believe that the ghosts of
their deceased ancestors exercise a paramount influence on human
affairs, for good or for evil. They have the poetical idea that the stars
are lamps held out by the ghosts to light the path of those who are to
follow in their footsteps. On the other hand, they think these an-
cestral ghosts are most malicious during full moon. Not to multiply
instances, we may say with Mr. Staniland Wake, it is much to be
doubted whether there is any race of uncivilized men who are not firm
believers in the existence of spirits or ghosts. If this is so, and the
idea of a separable spirit, capable of feeling and of action apart from
the body, is found to be practically universal among mankind, and to
632 PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

have been excogitated by some of the least advanced among peoples,
and if we observe how large a share that idea has in forming the dog-
mas of the more specialized religions of the present day, we shall not
see anything inherently unreasonable in the generalization that the
group of theories and practices which constitute the great province of
man’s emotions and mental operations expressed in the term “religion”
has passed through the same stages and produced itself in the same
way from these early rude beginnings of the religious sentiment as
every other mental exertion. We shall see in religion as real a part of
man’s organization aS any physical member or mental faculty. We
Shall have no reason to think that it is an exception to any general law
of progress and of continuity which is found to prevail in any other
part of man’s nature.

The same inference may be drawn from many other considerations.
Take, for instance, the belief in witchcraft, which is so characteristic of
uncivilized man that it is hardly necessary to cite examples of it. The
Rev. Mr. Coillard, a distinguished missionary of the Evangelical Society
of Paris, in a delightful record, which has just been published, of his
twenty years’ labors as a missionary pioneer among the Banyai, and
Barotzi of the Upper Zambesi, ‘‘on the threshold of Central Africa,”
says: ‘“‘In the prison of the Barotzi, toiling at earthworks, is a woman—
young, bright, and intelligent. She told me her story. A man of re-
markably gentle character had married her. The king’s sister, Katoka,
having got rid of one of her husbands, cast her eyes on this man and
took him. He had to forsake his young wife—quite an easy matter.
Unfortunately, a little later on, a dead mouse was found in the princess’
house. There was a great commotion, and the cry of witchcraft was
raised. The bones did not fail to designate the young woman, and she
was made a convict. A few years ago she would have been burned
alive. Ah, my friends, paganism is an odius and a cruel thing.” Ah,
Mr. Coillard, is it many years ago that she would have been burnt alive
or drowned in Christian England or Christian America? Surely the
odiousness and the cruelty are not special to paganism any more than
to Christianity. The oneand the other are due to ignorance and super-
stition, and these are more hateful in a Matthew Hale or a Patrick
Henry than in a Barotzi princess in the proportion that they ought to
have been more enlightened and intelligent than she. It is only one
hundred and twenty-two years since John Wesley wrote: “I can not
give up to all the Deists in Great Britain the existence of witcheraft;”
and I believe that to this day the Order of Exorcists is a recognized
order in the Catholic Church.

The same line of argument—which, of course, I am only indicating
here—might be pursued, I am persuaded, in numberless other directions.
Mr. Frazer, in his work on the Golden Bough, has most learnedly
applied it to aremarkable group of beliefs and observances. Mr. Hart-
land has followed up that research with a singularly luminous study
of several other groups of ideas in the three volumes of his ‘‘ Legend of
PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES. 633

Perseus.” More recently, Mr. Andrew Lang has sought to show that
the idea of a Supreme Being occurs at an earlier stage in the develop-
ment of savage thought than we had hitherto supposed. Striking as
these various collocations of facts and the conclusions drawn from them
may appear, I am convinced there is much more for the folklorist to do
in the same directions.

The principle that underlies it all seems to be this: Man can destroy
nothing, man can create nothing, man can not of his own mere volition
even permanently modify anything. A higher power restrains his
operations, and often reverses his work. You think you have exter-
minated a race; you have put to the sword every male you can find,
and you have starved and poisoned all the survivors of the community.
In the meanwhile, their blood has been mingled with yours, and for
generations to come your bones and those of your descendants will pre-
serve a record of that lost race. You think you have exterminated a
religion; you have burned to death all of its teachers you can find, and
converted forcibly or by persuasion the rest of the community. But
you can not control men’s thoughts, and the old beliefs and habits will
Spring up again and again, and insensibly modify your own religion,
pure aS you may suppose it to be.

Huxley, in his address to the department of anthropology twenty
years ago, said, with the force and candor that were characteristic of
him: “Anthropology has nothing to do with the truth or falsehood of
religion—it holds itself absolutely and entirely aloof from such ques-
tions—but the natural history of religion and the origin and the growth
of the religions entertained by the different kinds of the human race
are within its proper and Jegitimate province.” I do not presume to
question that as an absolutely accurate definition of the position—it
could not be otherwise; but if there be any here to whom what I have
been suggesting is in any sense novel or startling, I should be glad to
be allowed to say one word of reassurance to them. When my friend
Mr. Clodd shocked some of the members of the Folklore Society by his
frank statement of conclusions at which he had arrived, following the
paths I have indicated, it was said we must fall back on the evidences
of Christianity. What more cogent evidence of Christianity can you
have than its existence? It stands to-day as the religion which, in
most civilized countries, represents that which has been found by the
operation of natural laws to be best suited for the present circum-
stances of mankind. You are a Christian because you can not help it.
Turn Mahometan to-morrow, will you stop the spread of Christianity?
Your individual renunciation of Christianity will be but a ripple on
a wave. Civilized mankind holds to Christianity, and can not but do
so till it can find something better. This, it seems to me, is a stronger
evidence of Christianity than any of the loose-jointed arguments I find
in evidential literature.

Upon this thorny subject I will say no more. I would not have said
so much, but that I wish to show that these considerations are not
634 PROGRESS AND POSITION OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES.

inconsistent with the respect I entertain, and desire now as always to
express for those feelings and sentiments which are esteemed to be
precious by the great majority of mankind, which solace them under
the adversities of life and nerve them for the approach of death, and
which stimulate them to works of self-sacrifice and of charity that
have conferred untold blessings on humanity. I reverence the divine
founder of Christianity all the more when I think of Him as one who so
well ‘“‘knew what was in man” as to build upon ideas and yearnings
that had grown in man’s mind from the earliest infancy of the race.
To return. If continuity be the key that unlocks the receptacle
where lie the secrets of man’s history—physical, industrial, mental,
and moral; if in each of these respects the like processes are going
on—it follows, as I have already said, that the only satisfactory study
of man is a study of the whole man. It is for this reason that I ask you
to take especial interest in the proceedings of one of the committees of
this section, which has adopted such a comprehensive study as the
guiding principle of its work—I mean the ethnographical survey com-
mittee. I have so often addressed this section and the Conference of
Corresponding Societies on the matter, since the committee was first
appointed at the Edinburgh meeting, on the suggestion of my friend,
Professor Haddon, that I can hardly now refer to it without repeating
what has been already said or forestalling what will be said when its
report is presented to you, but its programme so fully realizes that
which has been in my mind in all that I have endeavored to say that I
must make one more effort to enlist your active interest in its work.
The scheme of the committee includes the simultaneous recording in
various districts of the physical characters, by measurement and by
photography, the current traditions and beliefs, the peculiarities of
dialect, the monuments and other remains of ancient culture, and the
external history of the people. The places in the United Kingdom
where this can be done with advantage are such only as have remained
unaffected by the great mevements of population that have occurred,
especially of late years. It might have been thought that such places
would be very few, but the preliminary inquiries of the committee
resulted in the formation of a list of between 300 and 400. So far,
therefore, as the testimony of the very competent persons whose advice
was sought by them is to be relied on, it is evident that there is ample
scope for their work. At the same time, the process of migration from
country to town is going on so rapidly that every year diminishes the
number of such places. One thinks with regret how much easier the
work would have been one or two or three generations ago; but that
consideration should only induce us to put it off no longer. The work
done by the lamented Dr. Walter Gregor for this committee in Dum-
friesshire and other parts of Scotland is an excellent type of the way
in which such work should be done. His collections of physical meas-
urements and of folklore have been published in the fourth and fifth
reports of the committee. There can be no doubt that few men pos-

Pests

sess the faculty he had of drawing forth the confidence of the villagers
and getting them to tell him their superstitions and their old customs.
He succeeded in recording from their lips not fewer than 733 items of
folklore. They not merely form exceedingly pleasant reading, such as
is perhaps not often met with in a British Association report, but they
also will be found to throw considerable light on the views which I
have ventured to lay before you. Itis much to be wished that others
who have the like faculty, if even in a lesser degree, could be induced
to take up similar work in other districts, now that Dr. Gregor has so
well shown the way in which it ought to be done.

The work done by the committee for the ethnographical survey of
Canada; the completion of the ethnographical survey of the North-
western tribes, which has been ably conducted for many years; and
the progress made in the ethnographical survey of India will also be
brought under your notice, the latter in a paper by Mr. Crooke, who
has worked with Mr. Risley upon it.

Another movement, which was originated by this section at the
‘Liverpool meeting, and was referred to in the report of the council of
the association last year, has made some progress since that report was
presented. Upon the recommendation of this section, the general com-
mittee passed the following resolution and referred it to the council for
consideration and action:

“That it is of urgent importance to press upon the Government the
necessity of establishing a bureau of ethnology for Greater Britain,
which, by collecting information with regard to the native races within
and on the borders of the Empire, will prove of immense value to science
and to the Government itself.”

The council appointed a committee, consisting of the president and
general officers, with Sir John Evans, Sir John Lubbock, Professor
Tylor, and your esteemed vice-president, Mr. Read, the mover of the
resolution. Their report is printed at length in last year’s report of
council, and shows clearly how useful and how easily practicable the
establishment of such a bureau would be. The council resolved that
the trustees of the British Museum be requested to consider whether
they could allow the proposed bureau to be established in connection
with the museum. I understand that those trustees have returned a
favorable answer; and I can not doubt that the joint representations
which they and this association will make to Her Majesty’s Government
will result in the adoption of a scheme calculated to realize all the
advantages which we in this section have so long looked for from it.
In the secretary of state for the colonies and the chancellor: of the
exchequer we have statesmen who can not fail to appreciate the ben-
efits the community must derive from acquiring accurate and scientific
knowledge of the multifarious races which compose the Empire.

Those of us who visited the United States last year had the oppor-
tunity of observing the excellent work which is done by the Bureau
of Ethnology at Washington, and those who stayed at home are prob-

ably familiar with the valuable publications of that department. An
act of Congress twenty years ago appropriated £4,000 a year to the
Smithsonian Institution for the continuance of researches in North
American anthropology. The control of the Bureau was intrusted to
the able hands of Major Powell, who gathered round him a band of
skilled workers, many of whom had been previously engaged on ethno-
graphic research under the direction of the Geographical and Geological
Survey of the Rocky Mountain region. In field work and in office work,
to use Major Powell’s convenient distinction, ample return has ever
since been rendered to the United States Government for the money
thus appropriated, which has since been increased to £8,000 a year.
Our own bureau of ethnology would have a wider sphere of operations,
and be concerned with a greater number of races. It would tend to
remove from us the reproach that has in too many cases not been
without foundation—that we have been content to govern races by the
strong hand without caring to understand them, and have thus been
the cause of injustice and oppression from ignorance rather than from
malevolence. If that were only a record of the past, we might be con-
tent with mere unavailing regret; but the colonial empire is still
expanding, and we and our competitors in that field are still absorbing
new districts—a practice which will probably continue as long as any
spot of ground remains on the face of the globe occupied by an unciv-
ilized race.

Would it not be worth while at this juncture to extend to the peoples
of Africa, for instance, the principles and methods of the Ethnographic
Survey—to study thoroughly all their physical characters, and at the
same time to get an insight into the working of their minds, the senti-
ments and ideas that affect them most closely, their convictions of right
and wrong, theirsystems of law, the traditions of the past that they cher-
ish, and the rude accomplishments they possess? If for such a service
investigators like Dr. Roth, who began his researches in Queensland
by so close astudy of the languages and dialects of the people that he
thoroughly won their confidence, could be found, the public would soon
learn the practical value of anthropological research. If the consider-
ations which I have endeavored to urge upon you should lead not only
the scientific student but the community at large to look upon that
which is strange in the habits and ways of thinking of uncivilized
peoples as representing with more or less accuracy a stage in that long
continuity of mental progress without which civilized peoples would
not be what and where they are, it could not but favorably affect the
principles and practice of colonization. Tout comprendre e’est tout
pardonner. The more intimate our acquaintance with the races we
have to deal with and to subjugate, the more we shall find what it
means to stand with them on the same platform of common humanity.
If the object of government be, as it ought to be, the good of the gov-
erned, it is for the governing race to fit itself for the task by laying to
heart the lessons and adopting the processes of practical anthropology.
THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS!

By L. FROBENIUS

The day of great exploring expeditions in Africa is over. Bold lines,
only occasionally broken up into dots, and great and little bluish-green
spots of curious outline fill the white spaces which stare the student
in the eyes in the times of scientific truth, and in the times of more
vivid fancy were adorned with the figures of grotesque animals and
with neat inscriptions like Caput Nili and Montes Lune. In its main
features, the picture is unrolled before our eyes. One is tempted to
believe that the old Roman question about Africa not only has become
too trivial to be put, but has lost its justification. That, however, is not
quite true. What bold investigators, great pioneers, still find to tell
us of civilizations nearer home, proves more and more clearly that we
are ignorant of hoary Africa. Somewhat of its present, perhaps, we
know, but of its past little.

We ethnologists have fared particularly ill. Far from bringing us
answers to our questions, the travelers have increased our enigmas by
many an addition so peculiar that astonishment has scarcely yet made
room for investigation. For the pictures of the inhabitants and the
specimens of their civilization are indeed questions. Open an illus-
trated geography and compare the ‘Type of the African Negro,” the
bluish-black fellow of the protuberant lips, the flattened nose, the stupid
expression, and the short curly hair, with the tall bronze figures from
Dark Africa, with which we have of late become familiar, their almost
tine-cut features, slightly arched nose, long hair, etc., and you have an
example of the problems pressing for solution. In other respects, too,
the genuine African of the interior bears no resemblance to the accepted
negro type as it figures on drug and cigar store signs, wearing a shabby
stovepipe hat, plaid trousers, and a varicolored coat. <A stroli through
the corridors of the Berlin Museum of Ethnology teaches that the real
African need by no means resort to the rags and tatters of bygone
European splendor. He has precious ornaments of his own, of ivory
and plumes, fine plaited willow ware, weapons of superior workmanship.

638 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATION.

Nothing more beautiful, for instance, can be imagined than an iron club
caretully wound round with strips of metal, the handle covered with
snake skin.

Wolf, Wissmann, Pogge in the south, Schweinfurth and Junker in the
north, justly demanded ‘“ What sort of civilization is this? Whence
does it come?”

For years I have been occupied with the problems of the evolution of
the African nations; that is, the history of African civilization, and
long the origin of the peculiar civilization of the Congo Basin haunted
me as the most difficult of all the questions involved. Some time after
the solution had been found a first essay was published in Petermann’s
Mitteilungen (1897, Parts X and XI), where, I hope, by the way, that its
continuation will shortly be published. In this article various aspects
of African culture were subjected to an examination as to their con-
stituent elements, the composition of each, its prevalence, and its origin.
The areas of distribution of elements of the same origin were represented
on charts, and it was made to appear that elements of the same origin
were of equal range. With regard to the affinity of the elements of
African civilization, the new and astonishing fact of their Malayo-
Negrito relationship was established. Once only it had been referred
to before, by Friedrich Ratzel in his well-known work on African bows,
where, however, the consequences following from it were not traced.

The article was misunderstood in various ways. The daily press took
hold of the matter, and credited me with the opinion that Malays are
living in West Africa. The fact that the Malayo-Negritos were left
undefined was taken amiss, etc. It therefore seems advisable to review
the whole statement briefly. It must be borne in mind that the article
in Petermann’s Mitteilungen was but the beginning of a more extended
treatise, the continuation of which will appear shortly.

The question concerning the origin of the civilization of the interior
of Africa can not be solved without reference to the composition of
African civilization in general, and this in turn requires consideration
of the question: How can culture affinities be determined?

1. The proof of culture affinity! depends upon our conception of civ-
ilization. Consideration of our own culture and that of others teaches
that the history of peoples and the history of civilizations fall short of
identity only in the measure in which forms of civilization, more than
peoples, are the creatures of their surroundings and of the home soil.
Though Roman culture was derived from Greek, the culture of North
America from that of Engiand, the Renaissance in Germany, in the
Netherlands, and in France, from the Renaissance in Italy, yet they
are not the same. On the soil which produced the classic culture of

‘The whole of this is a sketch-like reproduction of the detailed investigations
contained in the work: Der Ursprung der Kultur, Vol. 1; Der Ursprung der afri-
kanischen Kulturen, which is to be published before the end of the year by Gebriider
Borntriiger, Berlin.
THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS. 639

Rome, the Renaissance put forth her most exquisite blossoms, yet the
two differ in kind. The variation between the mothers is patent. Be-
sides, every form of civilization passes through a genetic period, a pe-
riod of maturity, during which it may propagate itself—how widely
Rome scattered her seeds!—and a period of decay. Civilization, then,
resembles an organic being in its development—it is born, it perishes,
it can propagate itself. More particularly it resembles a plant—it
takes root in the soil, and when its seeds fall into other land new vari-
eties sprout up.

Now, the cartographic presentation in Petermann’s Mitteilungen
taught a tact of primary importance, that certain culture elements ap-
pear together and are equally distributed. Thus, in spite of transitions,
mixtures, irregularity of occurrence near the boundary lines, they are
made to assume corporeal form by means of a certain unity of distri-
bution. We have the proof that it is possible, if only in roughest
outline, to trace geographic position and extent.

Again, the cartographic method of ethnography demonstrated that,
in spite of great variability, the marks of origin are indelibly impressed
upon the framework of these forms or creatures of civilization. In other
words, it has been ascertained that ethnographic objects illustrative of
phases of culture may be examined with a view to fixing their descent,
as we examine the limbs and organs of a living being.

The gain is great which thus accrues to the history of civilization
and of mankind. The astonishing fact of the Malayo-Negrito origin of
West African culture proves how far from their source prehistoric
forms of civilization wandered, and warns us, especially in the case of
complicated products, not to talk too much of local discovery of natural
laws, of independent invention and origin. It is becoming clearer and
clearer that the manifold ramifications of human culture are but the
crown of a single race, a fact which was repeatedly stated by Ratzel,
but which could scarcely have been established with certainty until now.

The material awaiting investigation has itself indicated the way te
the possible solution of the: problems. We have alluded to the char-
acteristics of culture forms which make them appear similar to animals.
Now, then, as the affinities and the descent of the latter have been
recognized, so the affinities and the descent of culture forms are
demonstrable.

Scientists have succeeded in making out the genealogical tree, as it
were, of animals by following up the developments of the parts of the
organism, the changes, under various conditions, in the organs, the
modifications in certain bones, etc. I maintain that the same is pos-
sible in the study of culture forms. Shields, bows, spears, and huts
recur, to be sure, on every continent, in all ethnological groups, in
astonishingly similar forms; but closer attention reveals this similarity
to be only apparent. They are separated from one another by vital
differences, reaching back often to their very origin.
640 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS.

Our first aim, then, should be to become acquainted with the devel-
opment of the products of a given form of civilization, and it is
attained by means of culture-anatomy, as illustrated in Petermann’s
Mitteilungen.

This initial step in the work of investigating is bound to lead to the
desired goal, if we succeed in presenting the peculiarity of the material
on the one side and the form and nature of the object on the other, so
as to make it appear that the object grew out of the material as a
necessary consequence. Frequently the question of origin is solved
with the determination of the province in which the material is indig-
enous. Other forms of civilization adopt the object and fashion it of
other material. The student may thus have to travel along the same
road again and again.

After the elements of a given form of civilization have been defined,
culture physiology follows as a second part of the investigation. It
can easily be demonstrated that differences in geographic position con-
dition differences in the phenomena of civilization. Not only does an
isiand race differ from the races of the mainland in its means of support,
but it is peculiar as to social conditions, weapons, etc. The problem
is complicated by the fact that local material gives rise to a series of
utensils and ornaments whose existence is due solely to the material,
and which are replaced by other products when the culture in question
is transplanted. The forms remain, the material changes, and again
the investigator must retrace the path to the point of departure.

In the following it will be my endeavor to make this outline more
intelligible by means of illustrations.

2. Our investigation of culture-anatomy may begin with African
drum forms. By far the larger part of African drums consist of a log
scooped out, one or both ends covered with hide. We need not enter
into details here, and I do no more than state the fact that the Indo- ©
nesian method of bracing drums reappears on the West African coast.
Besides these commonest drum forms, others occur made entirely of
a log, hewn round or with angles; in the latter case usually wedge-
shaped, the broad surface resting on the ground. The logs are hol-
lowed out within through a cleft, made always on the broad side. Often
the cleft is enlarged at its ends, the enlargement forming a round aper-
ture in the drums of the Congo, an angle in those of the Cameroons.
The famous signaling or telegraph drums of the Cameroons belong to
this class. The drums covered with hide are found throughout the
whole of Africa, with the exception of its southernmost part, but the
wooden drums occur only in the Congo Basin and in Upper and Lower
Guinea. The hide-covered drums are a development of the famous
millet mortar, which points to East India. The civilization of the Medi-
terranean shores has similar drums made of clay, and related to those
found in Persia and in prehistoric tombs of Germany. Now, the weoden
drums belong to the Malayo-Negrito elements of African culture. They
THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS. 641

recur in Melanesia and frequently in Polynesia. Their home obviously
must be the same as that of the lofty bamboo cane, for these drums
are developed from the bamboo.

The stringed instruments of the Africans follow the drums most nat-
urally. The Africans possess a greater variety of these instruments
than any other peoples living in a state of nature. Every foreign form
adopted by them brings forth an enormous progeny. We shall men-
tion only the more important considerations, the most important, first
of all, that despite their love of music the Africans invented no
stringed instrument. Their wealth of forms arises from modifications
of foreign patterns, derived chiefly from India, West Asia, and the
Malay Archipelago; that is, Indo-China or Melanesia. The instrument
from West Asia resembles the guitar, and is distinguished by a sound-
ing-board covered with skin, by strings made of sinew, hair, or strips
of skin, and by the presence of a peg. It has spread through North
Africa from Senegambia to Abyssinia. More than that, penetrating
farther than other importations from West Asia, it has reached the lands
along the Ogome and the Sande. We note a preponderance of ani-
mal material in contrast with the Malayo-Negrito stringed instruments,
the original form of Which is preserved between the Niger (Ibo) and
the Congo (Bateke). It is made of reed, or the stem of the raphia, or
bamboo (bamboo palm). Several strips are loosed along its whole
length except at the two ends, where they are furthermore secured by
rings of rattan (rotang). These rings, together with a board or rod in
the middle, interposed between the strips and the reed so as to form a
bridge, serve to brace the strips. On the underside of the bridge a
sounding-board in the shape of a gourd (calabash) is attached. Numer-
ous as the forms are that have developed from this simple instrument,
they are all characterized by vegetable strings, a bridge, a vegetable
sounding-board, and mostly by rattan rings. The stringed instrument
just described is the direct descendant of the well-known Indonesian
bamboo instrument. The area of prevalence of the Malayo-Negrito
features pointed out is coextensive with that of the Malayo-Negrito
druts.

Ratzel was the first to recognize the bows of the Africans as excellent
material for classification. There are three kinds. Through old as
well as recent illustrations we are most familiar with the Asiatic
weapon, consisting of two limbs, each arched, with a depression in the
middle where the limbs meet. It isspread from north to south, approxi-
mately as far as the bearers of Islam penetrated and in the Nile terri-
tory even beyond their settlement. Thesecond variety is the Kast Indian
weapon, which was obviously developed here at the point of contact
between the two chief forms of the bow, that is, the North Asiatic form
just mentioned, and the Malayo-Negrito form. The typical Malayo-
Negrito form has but a single arch, a bowstring of vegetable fiber, a
groove on the inner side, and buttons plaited of rattan or carved out of

SM 98 41

642 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS.

wood, to hold the bowstring in place at thetwoends. It is ornamented
with rattan rings. This bow prevails within the domain of West Afri-
can civilization. The East Indian mongrel type, on the other hand,
characterized by the down and inward bending of the bow ends, is
found in the north (in the gaps of the territory covered by the Asiatic
bow), the east, and the south of the continent. Again we see the
Malayo-Negrito implement of the West Africans, with its rattan bow-
string, its rattan buttons, and its rattan ornaments, distinguished by
vegetable material.

The shields of the Africans reveal three points of departure. The
first is the West Asiatic round buckler with a protuberance. It is most
frequently made of the skins of the pachydermata. Abyssinian bucklers
can with difficulty be distinguished from those of West Africa, even the
iron mountings of the two being the same. The smaller Somali shield is
pressed. To this class belongs one of the Lange shields, the one with
the convex form and of the size of a man’s head. On the other side of
Africa modifications from the type were made in favor of greater, as on
this side in favor of smaller size. The shields of the western Sudan,
made of elephant’s skin, cover horse and rider. The defensive armor
of the Baghirmi, and especially of the Nubians, falls under the same
group. The second primary form is represented by the Negrito staff-
shield, the kuerr of the Dinka and the kirvi of the Hottentots. These
are staffs, sometimes with, but usually without, handholds, used in
Africa as parrying weapons. Negrito civilization among the Australa-
sians, as, for instance, in Marsa, ete., furnishes much better specimens
of the same. Here the thickening of the staff toward the middle is
accompanied by a hollowing out into a handhold. These characteristies
recur among the African Negrito forms only in the kuerr of the Dinka.
In all others the handhold is replaced by a strip of hide around the
hand and the staff. The widening of the strip has led to the form
familiarly known under the name of Zulu shields. On the borders of
the territory of the round Asiatic bucklers, a mongrel type is found in
the Massai shields. The staff in the middle, being the chief defense
and serving as the handhold, has been preserved. - Hide is replaced by
skin, which is kept stretched by means of a pad around the edge. A
slight protuberance, probably to increase the space between the hand
and the staff, is noticeable. The third place is filled by the reed-covered
wooden shield of the Baluba, as Livingstone became acquainted with
it near Shinto, Gamietto along the Kazembe, and Wissmann and Pogge
to the north of the line connecting these two points. The shield of
Bukoba, near Lake Victoria, is essentially the same. That of the
Wanyoro, Waganda, Wakavirondo, on the other hand, is of finer work-
manship. The well-known Ambatsh shield of the Wakarra lacks the
rattan covering, while that of the Kongo and Sande races consists of
reed plaiting alone, without the wooden foundation. We can easily
uzderstand how this change takes place, that is, how the wooden frame-
THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS. 643

work gradually dwindles into nothing more than a protection for the
fist. In fact, the reason for the modification can be shown. The wooden
framework is absent in the territory of pointed iron missiles. The
yielding reed surface does not permit them to enter; they glance off
and lose their momentum. Wooden shields with reed covering reap-
pear on the coast of Upper Guinea. We know them also from the Gold
Coast, and older accounts mention them in the Liberian region. Related
forms are found in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Here again
Malayo-Negrito affinity is bound up with the vegetable material.

The axes of the Africans are frequently characterized as being of the
same form everywhere. Such a statement is not in accordance with
fact. The great differences among them become obvious on a compari-
son of the Dahomey ax with one from Bihe, and, again, with one from
East Africa. The helve of the Dahomey ax is bent forward at the
upper end, the head being inserted in the deflected portion. This form
obviously originated in the hoe. The Kast African ax is a smooth staff,
into which the head is wedged so that a considerable piece of the blade
protrudes above. The handle of the South African ax is bent baek-
ward, and is sometimes adorned with all sorts of curious scallops and
ornaments. Into this projection the tang of the blade is fitted. The
blade itself is of extraordinary shape, taking its rise in a little eyl-
inder polished down in front. Several considerations determine my
opinion that the last is of Malayo-Negrito origin. In other words, it
is derived from a stone, or, rather, a shell ax. The cylindrical form of
the head is the one occurring in the Melanesian shell ax, later stone ax.
In Oceania the head directly or, by the intervention of the handle, indi-
rectly is laced to the backward bent helve. The lacings are reproduced
in the West African ornamentation with its peculiar zigzag lines. The
ax forms derived from the hoe are connected with the cultivation of
millet—that is, they are of Kast Indian extraction.

The huts of the Africans show manifold primary forms. Two factors
indicate as many zones of influence. Building with clay extends from
the north to the Sudan and is suggestive of Egyptian brick buildings
and the architecture of Asia Minor, therefore of west Asiatic influence.
The Kongo Basin and North Guinea are the region of former pile dwel-
lings, whose last remaining trace is easily discerned even now in the
peculiar window doors. This bears witness to Malayo-Negrito affinity.
The northern domain, in which clay is used, is gradually enlarging,
while the southwestern is more and more suffering contraction. But
the affinity of the hut forms goes further; it is fundamental. The West
and Central African house is constructed like a house of cards—of six
mats made of palm leaves, two forming the roof and four the walls, all
tied to one another, The inside space is partitioned off into rooms by
mats suspended from above. The Oceanian house is exactly like this,
only it is raised on piles. Often, too, the number of outer walls is
reduced. On the other hand, the interior division into chambers is the
644 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS.

same as in Africa, but occurs more frequently. Pile dwellings are con-
comitants of a fixed domicile, or, rather, a settled mode of living is a
result of limited insular spaces fit for habitation. The nomadic habits
of the Africans were destructive of stability. The durable pile dwell-
ing is therefore declining steadily, and the simple portable card house
remains as the continental form of the original Malayo Negrito island
hut. H. Frobenius has proved that the round huts show two medes of
construction—the one exemplified in the Sudan and along the Nile, the
other in the east and south. One of them at least, the northern form,
which can be traced back to the tent, is demonstrably of Kast Indian
affinity.

The chairs and neck rests of the Africans exhibit so rich a variety of
forms that it is difficult to disentangle the web without illustrations
and lengthy descriptions. It may be stated that the South Africans,
excluding Hottentots and Bushmen, show transitional forms pointing
to Oceania. There are two or four feet. The seat is supported by
figures of men and animals, often degenerating into grotesque orna-
ments. The neck rests, however, attain to full development only along
the Zambesi, and finally manifest Malayo-Negrito sense of beauty of
form only in the Kongo Basin and in North Guinea. Moreover, in
many instances it is questionable whether the object under considera-
tion is a chair or a neck rest. The form with one round foot belongs to
the whole of the north.

The costumes of the Africans in one respect point to the soil, to the
means of support. Wherever in Africa cattle breeding is carried on,
that is to say, in the whole of South and East Africa, and in the Sudan,
we find hide and leather clothing, except that in the east and the north
of the Sudan leather is replaced by cotton. Cotton is met with also in
the southeast and in the southwest, pointing to India as the place of
departure. ' The eastern must be added as the last of the cotton areas.
In the west, on the other hand, that is, in the Kongo Basin, the
fabric that predominates is made of palm fibers, a phenomenon of
Malayo-Negrito origin. Two small enclaves on the east side indicate
how the manufacture of these tissues reached Africa. The path of dif-
fusion of a fourth material, that made of bark, is still more evident.
There can be no other explanation for the two broad strips of territory
on which it occurs, extending from the east coast, the lake and forest
region. In patches of territory, here and there, bark fabrics occur in
the Sudan too, but they prevail to the exclusion of all others only in
the northern and western part of the Kongo Basin. In the southern
Sudan they appear by the side of other materials. On the western
coast, among the southern Cameroons and along the Volta, bark tissues
are still in use, and on the Bissagos Islands they were once common.
The Malayo-Negrito affinity of the bark fabrics of Africa with the
well-known tapa cloth of the natives of Oceania is favored by the
fact that the trees yielding the raw material are planted and tended
in great quantities in newly-founded villages.

3. The investigation into culture physiology may proceed from the
proposition that all the Malayo-Negrito elements discussed above are
distributed essentially over the same area. The solid tract of territory
covered by them lies in the !”ongo Basin, extending southward to the
Zambesi Valley, northward to the lands about the sources of the Shari,
and eastward to the East African area of depression. In the north-
west the area of Malayo-Negrito elements continues along the Guinea
coast into Senegambia, but the limits can no longer be determined with
certainty. Inthe course of thelast few centuries Semito-Negritoes from
the interior and Europeans from the coast have either brought about
complete destruction of native culture, or effected far-reaching changes.
Upon the diffusion of culture elements of other affinities we shall
expatiate later.

Outside of the unbroken domain of Malayo-Negrito culture, phe-
nomena of the same kind and descent occur in disconnected, widely
separated regions all over Southeast and East Africa. On the one hand
we are reminded thereby that culture elements other than those of
Malayo-Negrito origin are found within the area of distribution claimed
for the latter. These non-Malayo-Negrito elements either are found in
enclaves of exclusive occupation, pointing to the fact of recent immigra-
tion, or they appear in fraternal association with the Malayo-Negrito
elements, which in this case have been thoroughly interpenetrated with
African elements, and have completely absorbed them. On the other
hand, the occurrence of objects of Malayo-Negrito origin outside of
their west African central abode indicates the extent of their former
distribution, or the path of migration.

In itself the fact of agreement in form between certain or indeed all
of the objects in use in West Africa and those of Oceania is not con-
vineing proof of their culture affinity. But likeness of anatomical
origin coupled with the outlined area of distribution is evidence not to
be gainsaid. Slowly progressing contraction of the area of distribu-
tion until it is narrowed down to a border, or strip, in the west, together
with isolated remains in the mountains, near the mouths of rivers, or
in other out of the way places not readily inundated by waves of
national migrations—this is the characteristic of the present zone of
Malayo-Negrito civilization in Africa.

And this area of distribution proves not only the path along which
Malayo-Negrito civilization traveled, but also that along which other
civilizations made their way. By the same side, in all probability,
entered from India the use of iron and the cultivation of millet and
cotton. The spread of these elements, pressing forward victoriously
from the East, is an eloquent witness, when we remember that the Hast
Indian bellows are not found among the southwestern tribes. The
descent of Semitic or Semito-Negrito culture from the north into the
interior has been overrated. The centers of culture in Africa along the
Mediterranean have never contributed elements of profound or vital
influence to the native Africans. The reason is that the north coast,
646 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS.

with the exception of Egypt, so woefully limited in extent of territory,
never developed a civilization peculiarly its own, because it lacked a
hinterland. The Sahara interposed its desert barrier. Mediterranean
forms of civilization failed to exert influence upon the Sudan races for
the same reason that the Hottentots lacked many an African element
of East Indian civilization. In the latter case, too, a Sahara interferes,
the Kalahari Desert. The east side, then, is the open door of the
African continent. If it was so hard to penetrate to the interior from
the west, while the east side never offered real difficulties, it was because
advance from the west was tantamount to “ swimming against the tide.”
So the picture of the contraction or repression of the area of Malayo-
Negrito culture dispersion as a mechanical process stands clearly
revealed before us.

But the essential factor in these processes lies deeper, in the nature
of the civilization, in its physiologic structure. If we consider the
peculiarity of the Malayo-Negrito culture elements dependent upon
the material, we see vegetable substances everywhere. Witness
the shields, the bow, the drums, the stringed instruments, the cos-
tumes. But the prominence of vegetable material in all the manifesta-
tions of Malayo-Negrito culture is less noteworthy than the lack of
animal substances. The only exceptions are shells, fish bones, feathers,
and lizard skins, that is to say, material of minor consequence, such as
is within the reach of all island races. On the other hand, look at the
culture forms of East, North, and South Africa—everywhere decidedly
preponderating use of hides, sinew, hair. We can discern the deeper
law of the distribution of these two forms of civilization; wherever
Malayo-Negrito culture still exists, cattle breeding is not carried on to
any great extent. (Goats need not enter into the account.) However
we have not yet reached the fundamental explanation.

An examination of Malayo-Negrito characteristics with a view to
origin and development points to definite plants. It is not possible.
for me to substantiate this statement here, lacking, as I do, space and
illustrations. Among weapons the bow, among smoking utensils the
Malayo-Negrito pipe indicates evolution from the bamboo. This
material, which plays so gigantic a role in the economy of Malayo- ~
Negrito Oceania, is replaced in Africa, often very inadequately, by ribs
of banana leaves and leaf stems of the bamboo palm, or Raphia vinifera.
Study of plant geography accordingly leads to the region where the
use of the bamboo is pronounced in the manufacture of objects illustra-
tive of native culture, that is, to Indo-China and the Malay archipelago.

Again, the iron blade used on the Malayo-Negrito ax of the Africans
we found to be a derivation from shell blades, such as are met to this
day in Melanesia. Valuation in kauris (cowry shells)—that is, those of
East Indian origin—disappears in the Kongo Basin, and here and there
we meet with ropes of shell coins made, like the Melanesian divarra,

they passed for money so late as the time of the first European arrivals;
on the upper Ituri, Stuhlmann found them used as jewelry, and we are
familiar with similar ropes in Loango and on the Kongo. So we have
the remains of island civilization on the mainland. But the island and
fisherman’s civilization of Oceania has bequeathed many another
legacy to the Africans. One of them is pile dwellings, whose degen-
eration on the continent we have referred to. The present discussion
enables us to understand their slow disappearance. Finally, the cul-

- ture of a fishing community is on all sides characterized by mesh work.

The well-known nets carried by the men of New Guinea recur in the
culture of West Africa. In New Guinea the net is used as clothing,
and in the whole of West Africa we hear of the netted jerseys of the
disguised.

Tf, on the other hand, we devote attention to the nature, the physio-
logic structure of the culture forms adjacent to the West African
culture area, we shall recognize the significance of the continental
civilization. In the first place, the breeding of cattle exercises deep
influence upon the compass and intent of culture. The remarkable
migratory life of the Africans is explained by the half-nomadic oceu-
pation of cattle herding. Their food consists mainly of flesh. On the
other hand, it is a fact generally overlooked that the West Africans
on the whole are vegetarians. Furthermore, the institutions of the
family and of the state among the real Indo-Africans or Indo-Negritoes
point to the patriarchate, a phenomenon concomitant with cattle-
breeding, which is opposed to excessive crossing. In the West African
circle, again, the matriarchate, the family grouping that obtains among
island races, hence among the Oceanians, is possibly to be classed
among Malayo-Negrito characteristics, in particular when accompanied
by exogamy. :

The very views of life entertained by the two groups show similar
opposition in their physiologic essentials. Restless nomads are seldom
reminded of their past; hence the tendency toward the worship of
manes and of ancestors is slight among them. On the other hand,
turn in what direction they will, island races encounter traces of their
former life. The natives of Oceania know some tale to tell of every
locality; likewise, the mythology connected with manes flourishes in
West Africa.

Thus the features of division and of union stand out from the gray
background. For Africa is a continent like unto itself alone, and it
exercises leveling power like none other. At a casual glance, then,
African forms of culture may seem to differ but slightly from one
another. But our study of the manifestations of life proves that cycles
of thousands, yea, of hundreds of thousands of years—for thus only
can we properly express our ignorance of how time must be computed
in such cases—have not succeeded in obliterating the identity of origi-
nal forms and traits.
648 THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS.

4, The culture forms of Africa described in the above show the fol-
lowing sources:
1. Negrito culture forms.
2. Malayo-Negrito culture forms.
3. Indo-Negrito culture forms.
4, Semito-Negrito culture forms.

The remains of Negrito civilization are very slight. In fact, they
will become clearly visible only when south Asiatic and Oceanic forms
of culture have been thoroughly investigated and classified. At pres-
ent 1 can set down the following with certainty as marks of Negrito
culture: The staff as a javelin, the staff as a weapon of defense, the
staff as musical instrument (Klangstab). The area of diffusion of these
elements, though often modified almost beyond recognition, I can prove
to be the whole of Africa almost as far as the Sahara. I say “almost,”
for they seem to be absent from the West African sphere of civilization.
It would be improper to connect Negrito culture directly and unre-
servedly with the so-called dwarfs—the little yellow race of pygmies.
These Bushmen have everywhere accepted the civilization of their
surroundings. (Parasite culture !)

With regard to the three other sources, the conspicuous thing is the
addition of ‘‘Negrito” in each instance. This I believe to be in accord-
ance with the facts of the case, for wherever Africa has been subjected
to influences from Asia and Oceania there has been an admixture of
Negrito culture. The importance of Malayo-Negrito culture will be
considered presently. Hast Indian spheres of culture in the period
before their rise were obviously impregnated with elements of Malayo-
Negrito extraction. But North African culture elements all point to
reciprocal relations with the continent.

When we come to the consideration of Malayo-Negrito culture, a
glance at foreign relations is necessary. In the article in Petermann’s
Mitteilungen, Part IV, the attempt was made to give a cartographic
representation of these affinities. Three zones, or belts, are distinguish-
able. The southernmost embraces Australia and the southern point of
Africa. Here Malay influence, though slight, is unmistakable, but the
conspicuous fact is the preponderance of Negrito culture elements. It
is, therefore, the region—perhaps the ‘“‘region of remains”—of the old
Negrito civilization. The zone farthest north is defined naturally by
the linguistic uniformity of all the races. It includes the Hovas of
Madagascar, the Indonesians, Micronesians, and Polynesians, hence is
the domain of young Malay civilization. The third of the Malayo-
Negrito zones lies between the other two, and comprehends the West
Africans, the West Malagassas, some Indonesians, the lesser Sunda
islands, the Moluccas, and the Melanesians. It is the territory within
which but one race has been crossed with another.

The situation of these three zones is the key to our problem. Youth,
hence unity of language, is the characteristic of the northern zone;
age, indicated by repression to the very limits of settlement, is the
THE ORIGIN OF AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS. 649

mark of the southern zone. The middle belt is at once the richest and
the most uniform. It bears neither the senile expression of the Negrito
zone nor the youthful, impetuous character of the Malay zone, but that
impressed by a great and serious past.

In addition to the above, we must bear in mind the situation and
surroundings of the first source and center of Maiay culture forms; that
is, Malacca, or more properly, perhaps, Indo-China. The reader will
permit me to point out a remarkable parallelism. As Farther India
thrusts out its elongated form into a sea of islands, opposite to which
is a continent, while a peninsula of firmer outline, East India, lies on
the west, so Greece, opposite to Egypt and to the east of Italy, sends
its point into an archipelago.

History proclaims the important bearing of the peculiar geographic
position of Greece and Italy upon culture, yet surely the history of
Mediterranean civilization neither began with Egypt nor ended with
Rome. If, then, we speak of the civilization of the Middle (Mediterra-
nean) Sea, we may equally speak of the civilization of the Middle
(Indian) Ocean. In intercourse with Egypt, Greece rose to supreme
position as a civilizing and colonizing power, covering the central and
eastern shores of the Mediterranean with its stations. A like point of
view gives us aclue to the course of Malayo-Negrito culture, whose
influence is demonstrable on all the shores of the Indian Ocean. Malay
culture acquired the faculty of spreading to so great an extent that it
entered into alliance with Negrito culture as Greek intermingled with
Egyptian civilization. ‘The rise of every form of civilization is preceded
by some such impregnation. To avoid misapprehension, I emphasize
the fact that the young Malay civilizations, characterized by linguistic
sameness, owe their rejuvenation to a recent epoch.

This comparison of geographic positions furnishes a clue not only to
the spread of Malayo-Negrito civilization as far as West Africa, but
also to that of Indo-Negrito relations. The ancient civilization of India
may properly be compared to that of Rome. The culture that brought
the Africans millet and iron was solid, practical, robust in every respect.

Finally, with regard to Semito-Negrito civilization, I should like to
utter a caution against overestimating it. In the material products of
civilization its influence is barely traceable. It introduced neither the
plow nor solidly built houses to the part of the continent that is genu-
inely African, yet this should have been the task of the Semitic culture
agents. Whatever they have imported, such as the straight sword, the
double-limbed bow, the round shield, ete., did not penetrate far to the
south and was not original with them.

In closing this article I beg leave to state its purpose emphatically.
It was written not to array arguments substantiating the correctness
of certain new points of view, but to sum up these points of view in
a brief presentation. If I have succeeded in showing how the new
method should be wielded and what sort of results can be reached by
its application, it has fulfilled its purpose.

DOGS AND SAVAGES.!

By Dr. B. LANGKAVEL, Hamburg.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

In submitting to the readers of this journal the results of my studies
upon the relations between savages and the most important and widely
diffused of our domestic animals, I shall cite the sources of my informa-
tion. Of the 114 longer or shorter papers and notices that I have
written during the last fifteen years concerning the dog, 22 treat of the
Asiatic races, 4 of the African, 11 of the American, 4 of the Austral-
Polynesian, the remainder of the Kuropean. In all these papers my
principal aim was to determine the different races correctly. What-
ever I have gathered during this period from the widespread litera-
ture of geology, ethnology, and zoology concerning the relations
between dogs and savages will be presented briefly in the following

pages.

The oft-raised question concerning the original home of the dog is,
so far as our knowledge reaches, well answered by the remark of
Alfred Nehring,’ that ‘‘our most important domestic animals have
generally no single home,” a saying that might in a certain sense be
paralleled by the old tradition of the Flatheads and others, that “‘ when
the son of the Sun came to earth he was accompanied by a dog.”

The dog has been scattered over the entire earth for an immeasurable
length of time. Only in a very few localities is he entirely wanting or
very rare. Of these I have spoken at length in a paper published in
the journal Der Hund of April 1, 1886, and I will state here what
has since become known to me, as it is important for the later discus-
sion of the question. In Asia the dog is very rare at Tarim, according
to Prschewalsky.* At Flores dogs and horses are so seldom seen that

at sight of them the natives seek refuge in trees;' and, according to
Dr. Claus,” a similar fear is shown by the South American Suyas. In
Kagaruma-Shima (Liukiu Islands) there are neither hares nor wild
pigs, on account of which the people have no need for hunting dogs;*
the same is the case at Minicoy,* in the Maldive Islands,’ at Hormuz,
in the Persian Gulf, and on the island of St. Lawrence, as Norden-
skidld tells us.*. In South America no dogs are found with the Bakairi,
Manitsanas, and Bororo;* in Africa there are none on the Comoro
Islands,° nor are there any among the old Tasmanians.” In ancient
times none were allowed on the island of Delos.’ Crawford contro-
verts the statements of Ritter,” Lassen,” and Kolenati™ concerning
the absence of Canidae in western India.”

Osseous remains of dogs are found in that stratum of the earth’s
crust from which we obtain information concerning men, animals, and
plants that existed long before the historical period. Prehistorical
discoveries, chiefly in Europe, show us the dog already, at that time,
affecting and influencing in various degrees the life of man. Deep
scratches made by knife-like instruments found on the bones of young
and old dogs, bones broken in pieces, skulls cracked with stones to get
at the sweet-tasting brain, lead us to recognize these relics as food
rejects, and I might now affirm with still more ground the view I pub-
lished in Ausland ' fourteen years ago, that man, during the first stage
of his earthly wanderings in a constant struggle for existence, obtained
control over the dog as over other animals, merely for food purposes.
The food question is the chief one both for animals and man; even at
the present time anthropoid apes and the lowest races of people show
that they can liveon fruits and roots of the woods and fields, on insects
(caterpillars, crickets, locusts, ants, larvae of every kind), worms, mus-

sels, lizards, etc. Where necessity requires it, there is, as is too often
forgotten, nothing strange about this. The nature of man is such that
he must either prey on the animal world or perish from want, hunger,
and cold. -As soon as he learned to use, for defense or attack, other
weapons than his own limbs, he must have begun to bring the dog
nearer to him as his helper in the struggle. From the earliest stage
when the dog was used merely as food, the custom of eating him in one
way or another has survived among a great number of peoples; and
the number of dog-eating races of which I published a list in 1881 could
now be easily increased to 200, although there would then be included
such tribes as have been compelled to adopt the custom from hunger
or because of hostile neighbors. When Fr. Ratzel' remarks: ‘One
may assert in general that man, in the lowest grade of civilization,
always first gratifies his pleasures, and only takes up useful things
when necessity drives him to it; thus we see the dog as his only con-
stant companion at a time when his use was very limited,” he is
speaking of a certain stage of civilization like that, for instance, of the
Chambians, who domesticate divers animals for amusement.” Specially
gifted men may early have attempted the exhibition of animals, as we
read, not to mention early European sources, in Maury’s * report on the
Tchoude in southern Russia and Siberia. Waitz (VI, 786) mentions a
dance in which adults introduce dogs in order to teach boys to acquire
control over them, and this may perhaps be considered a survival from
that distant time when men strove by means of cunning (traps) or
arms, to capture these animals.

It is a noticeable fact that may be explained to some extent on phylo-
genetic grounds that the primitive dwarf peoples had but one domestic
animal, the dog. The Batua, from Lubi to Taganyika, have, with the
exception of a few fowls, no domestic animals but the dog, and, indeed,
one of the remaining breeds of African dogs is a quite serviceable,
well-marked, greyhound-like species, very much used for hunting.‘
The Bushinan has no other animals than the dog and the louse, and
only the first is possessed by the dwarf-like Veddahs of Ceylon, and the
Negritos of the Philippine Islands. The high relative standing given
to the dog by all these peoples is explained at once by their occupation
of hunting, which early caused them to consider the most suitable
animal for the chase, which therefore limited their domestication of
animals to the dog, who thereafter had no rival with whom to share
his master’s care and attention. The most significant fact shown by
- this continued limitation is that stocks of a certain culture stage
remain stationary at this point. As the dog is the oldest domesticated

animal, so the peoples that extend their training to no other animal,
probably from natural incapacity for progress, remain at the lowest
and oldest stage of the development of man. In other words, they
appear as primitive races.

In those places where dog-eating is the custom, and where young
and fat dogs are considered great delicacies, much care is bestowed on
the young puppies, and only too frequently have travelers seen young
mothers give them the breast. Thus, in New Guinea! and in Australia
the-father even kills his own child that the mother may give suck to
a puppy, and similar cases have been often noted’ at Tahiti,’ Hawaii,
and the Society Islands.*’ In upper Burma, in 1879, Joest saw in the
bazar in Thayetmyo a young Burman girl nursing at one breast her own
offspring, at the other a small dog, and in Mandalay he was assured
that young mothers reckon it an honor to give suck to little white ele-
phants; that the Ainu women of Yezzo nurse little bears in the same
way is well known.” Wrangel® was the witness of an incident in the
polar regions similar to that which Joest saw in Burma. The women
of the Paumaris in Peru nurse dogs and monkeys as do those of Dutch
Guiana and others.“ In Gran Chaco the women willingly nurse young
dogs, but never motherless babies.’ Frequently the reverse condition
exists; for example, Chinese women of Java give their children female
dogs from which to nurse. * * * But the dog is handled and
well cared for not only in those regions where he is an important
article of food, but still more frequently when he is a helpful hunting
companion, as with the Wagandas.”” ‘The Shilluk never treat their
dogs badly; neither will they allow anyone else to do so. The beau-
tiful ‘“‘slugi” is the favorite of the Arab and his children,” and is
treated well by the boys." With the Battaks each boy has a particular
dog as a *“‘*kaban,” or companion, that is highly regarded even when
very old.!* With the Patagonians favorite dogs are formally adopted.”

DOGS AND SAVAGES. 655

Just as the dog was used by later prehistoric man for hunting, he is
also used by the savages of to-day, and in all four quarters of the
globe we find him widely distributed, though in different grades of
development. It would be a waste of space if I should here enumer-
ate all peoples who hunt with more or less highly trained hunting dogs,
but this subject belongs to a treatise on the science of hunting. A few
examples will be sufficient to show how varied are the methods of hunt-
ing in Australia,' New Guinea,’ among the Tehuel of Guanaco,’ in
America, in Matto Grosso,‘ in Ecuador.’ The natives of Haiti raised
a breed of small dogs for hunting on the island.’ Even before the
time of Columbus the Tarumas possessed, as they do now, excellent
hunting dogs which they kept, when not in use, in a kind of cage.?
The Bonny negroes bury their hunting dogs and in the Bushman village
of Guidappou talismans are hung around them." For the hunting
methods of the Koluschans, Hurons, and Tlinkits, see note.’ In North
Borneo the people land from five to seven dogs from boats in different
places and learn from their bark where a boar is to be found, land there
and kill him with spears. In the south of this island the flesh is sepa-
rated from the bones of this wild animal and fastened to a tree; the
dogs are then set onto this meat to make them courageous.'"” The hunts
for stags and boars by the Bagobos and on Peel [Island are also char-
acteristic." Savages have never descended to the mutilation of hounds
hunting off their ground, as was practised in Europe in former centu-
ries, the English law of the time of Henry VII providing that the lett
leg should be cut off, and the ordinance promulgated in 1702 that one
paw or all the claws of one foot be removed.”

Castration has been practiced on dogs from an early date, for differ-
ent purposes, and in countries far distant from each other, for example
among the Kamchatkans,” the residents of Sakhalin,” and in Togoland.”

656 DOGS AND SAVAGES.

Fishing is, as is well known, eagerly pursued by many hairy animals,
and by the dogs of northern regions especially in summer, thereby sav-
ing their masters the trouble of feeding them. I have written two pa-
pers! on the subject of fishing dogs, and in the second I mentioned,
from the work of Howard,” the skilled methods of the Ainos of Sakhalin
which considerably excel those of the English fishermen of Colvyn Bay
on the coast of North Wales.

As draft animals dogs are attached to vehicles both on water and
on land. As with us canal boats are drawn on rivers by means of a
rope by people on the bank, so in eastern Siberia they are drawn by
dogs, and indeed four dogs drag a boat regularly on the Yenisei from
Troizkek cloister against the stream, and do it more easily than four of
the small native horses.? They are used similarly—of course constantly
only in the summer—by the Jukahirs,* the Giljaks on the Amur,’ and
the Kamchatkans.°®

But this use of the dog is not as general as its employment as a draft
animal on the land, concerning which Kohl has given us a tolerably
general idea,’ while the works of Lord and Baines are exhaustive and
instructively illustrated.’ The treatment which the poor draft dogs
have to endure from us is discussed in the “ Neue Deutsche Jadg-Zei-
tung” (XIV, 157). In this first decade of this century, Humboldt®
refers to the significance of similar folk customs, and Yule!’ has made
the observation that dog sledges are now used in Asia as far south as
61° 30’, but in the eleventh century they were also in use between the
Dwina and the Pechora. According to Ibn Batuta,!! they were used in
the fourteenth century in the Land of Darkness, in Bulgaria (the old
Bulgaria in central Russia), where the people drove with three dogs
abreast and one leader. According to Langmantel,” ‘There are in
these countries Wassibar dogs that draw carts in summer and sledges
in the winter, and are as large as a donkey; and the people in this
country eat dogs.” Dogs are still sometimes used in some regions of
Poland and in the northwestern provinces of Russia to draw small
loads, but such a custom is not general,’ and the animals are also too
weak, but the comparatively small Siberian dogs, in spite of their

greater leanness, accomplish considerable, their strength and persever-
anee being astonishing. Kennan says:' “TI drove a team of nine, in
twenty-four hours, over 150 kilometers; they often pull for forty-eight
hours with no food except one fish of 14 or 2 pounds. In the west the
dogs are made to pull with the hips, in the east with the breast.’
According to Exman,’ the tent-living Samoyeds use only the reindeer as
a draft animal, but the remainder of the Samoyeds and the Yakuts use
dogs, and indeed each one can puil an average weight of 20 to 35 pud.
Concerning Tobolsk, says the Abbé Chappe d’Anteroche,°® “The only
traveling is by dogs, which are harnessed to sledges.” In the province
of Jenesei there were in 1864,in the capital, 115 sledge dogs; in the
city of Turukhansk, 43; in the entire district, 860." According to
Finsch,‘ a draft dog costs, in Beresovskoe, 2 roubles. They are so har-
nessed that the drawing strap passes from the sledge between the
legs of the dog and to a ring fastened around the body and to the tail;
they draw, therefore, with the hips. Still farther east the number of
sledge dogs is so much greater that in 1880 there were in Yakutsk
3,192,° although many Yakuts still travel with reindeer.’ Wrangel'’
already observed that on the Kolyma male dogs exclusively are used
for pulling, part of the females being saved for subsequent breeding
purposes, and the rest drowned; he was very much astonished at the
sagacity displayed by the leader. Along the Kolyma the inhabitants
are also of the firm conviction that there the male dogs alone can
thrive. Notwithstanding this any change for the better is made im-
possible, the people often enduring the pangs of hunger in order to
support their dogs. Their number is estimated at 2,265, and since each
receives 4 herrings daily there are required during the year for them
alone 3,306,900 fishes. Between the Lena and Bering straits 12 dogs
run before every ‘‘narte” and cover in an hour on favorable ground 5
nautical miles. At Shigansk a good leading dog is worth from 40 to
60 roubles.'' The descriptions of men and dogs during the winter at
Ussuri are very interesting.”

The Kamchatkans are the recognized masters in dog-sledge driving

and in breaking in dogs. They also use only the males, the team con-
sisting of 12 besides the leader; on each dog falls the average load
of 1 pood (36 pounds) and in twenty-four hours he is expected to cover
a distance of 150 versts (100 miles)’. Krascheninnikow the elder?
remarks that in going down hill only one dog is used, and Wrangell?
that with dogs not fully trained only 10 to 15 versts (7 to 10 miles) dis-
tance is covered in a day, at first; he is also of the opinion that the use
of dogs as draft animals originated on this peninsula, and that earlier
all peoples of northeastern Asia drove only reindeer. The number of
draft dogs is approximately 10,000, an average of 9 to each family, and
the price is from 3 to 25 roubles each.* Here, as with the Tchuktches,
they are urged on by a rattle.” In recent times the number of dogs
in a team, the size of the load, and the price of dogs seems to have
changed greatly, for Gilder® saw in Petropaulovski 6 drawing a sledge
with one person; a team of 9 good dogs was expected to pull 600
pounds, while with the Eskimos 9 dogs pulled a load of 1,800 to 2,000
pounds 15 to 20 English miles a day for weeks, and even for months.
He bought 40 full grown dogs and paid for each $7.50. Yerman and
Bennet‘ drove in sledges with 4 or 6 dogs. When von Dittmar® lived
there, there was a team of 8 large, black dogs with a fox-red leader,
that alone was worth 25 roubles, while the other 8 together were worth
only 40 roubles. Hach one had a leather neck strap, therefore pulling
with the breast and neck, and all were governed solely by the voice.

Concerning. the draft dogs of the Tchuktches, we learn through
Wrangell® that not as on the Kolyma, always 2, but always 4 run
abreast; through Hedenstrém" that they can, exceptionally, cover 200
versts (132 miles) in a day; and through Nordenskidld" that they can
pull for twenty-one consecutive hours without being unharnessed.
There are also many draft dogs on Bering Island, 600 being used
exclusively to haul driftwood on sledges.”

Let us return from here over the island of Sakhalin to Russian Asia,
in order to observe several races who drive mostly draft dogs of a
smaller breed, as in the Amur coast lands, or as the Tunguses and

Lamuts, who also drive reindeer.' In the island of Sakhalin all the
tails of the males are cropped to remove a hindrance in pulling.2 The
Oroks of to-day are ‘‘a mongrel race of reindeer-driving nomads and
Stationary dog-owning fishermen.”* The draft dogs of the Giljacs are
described by H. Itussell Killough,* a traveler among the Yukahiras, in
Petermann’s Supplement, No. 54, 17.

In Alaska the dogs of a team, usually 4 abreast, travel so closely
one behind the other that amputation of their tails is found to be nec-
essary.” * * * Krause® writes concerning the teams of the Tlin-
kits, Boas‘ of those of the natives of Baffins Land, Leland and Kane?
of the Ottawas of the northern lakes. Formerly, dog sledges orna-
mented by three bells were in use at the head waters of the Mississippi,
sledges were also used by the Thickwood Cree Indians in winter.2 In
Labrador the sledges are drawn by from 12 to 20 male and female dogs
with 2 leaders, on a 20 to 30 foot trace, while the other dogs of the
team are traced short. During the thawing weather in the spring the
dogs wear regularly made shoes of seal skin, in which are cut holes for
the two front toes to give freedom to the nails. Above the toes the
leather is tied fast. It is easily conceived that the animals become
exhausted after three hours during these thaws. With lighter loads,
3 to 12 animals are used before the sledge, with a leader attached to a
trace 5 meters long."

The Eskimo dog, which Le Peyrere' described in 1647, saying that
he was very large and was used like a horse, is found, according to
Robert Brown,” as far north as man goes, but is not used by the
Eskimos farther south than Holsteinborg, because the ocean does not
freeze in winter sufficiently hard to use sledges on it. If this dog
should become extinct, the Greenlander must also perish; this event
is more certain than the extinction of the prairie Indians after
the death of the last buffalo. In Greenland 6 to 8 dogs usually go
together; in order to break them of their obstinacy they are often
beaten with a whip having a handle a meter long with 6 or 8 lashes

of walrus hide. Toward the middle of 1870 there were in all northern
Greenland only 155 draft dogs.! On the northern shore of Hudson
Strait and in King Williams Land the training is much better than
in Greenland, because here the whip is seldom used, the refractory
ones being punished with snowballs or, at most, by throwing sticks at
them. Since it is assumed that the Eskimos owned dogs before their
distribution was as wide as it is now, it is of interest to note the calls
with which the different races, separated from each other, direct their
animals. The Greenlander driver, writes Bessels, has only the call
i! i! il, short and spoken in falsetto. If he wishes the dogs to turn to
the right, he cracks his whip on the left side, and vice versa. A short
whistle means stop! This is the custom of all the inhabitants of the
mission parts of Greenland. Those on the east shore of Smiths Sound
call out a vehement ha! ha! ha! The method of guidance is as before
mentioned. The stop call is oh! In the neighborhood of Ponds Bay
the call for turning to the right is woa-ah-ha-ha-ha!; for the left, ah-woa-
waha!; for halt, oh!

In Cumberland the sounds used are woa-hau-ha! for the right, ach-woa-
wit! or ach-woa-woa! for the left, hda-ha-d for urging onward, and sim-
ilarly by the Itaners on Smiths Sound. Stop is oh!

With the Eskimos on the Hudson Strait only the exclamation ov /
ow! ow! is used, and those on King Williams Land know only the call
kgu! kgu! kgu! The lash is unknown; one person goes before and
leads the dogs or presses a stick of wood against the side opposite to the
direction in which they should go. Bessels could not iearn what was
the custom in Alaska; many were of the opinion that they only heard
curses, the embellishment of which depended on the obstinacy of the
dogs or the irritability of the master. There also a person precedes
the sledge. The number in a team varies between 4 and 8, and the
load for a sledge is rarely more than 100 pounds. Well-kept animals
cover, on a smooth road, 4 German miles an hour, and work twelve hours
a day. After work they receive a pound of meat or fish. Neumayer
remarks in another place that in Labrador the expressions auk! auk!
auk! for to the right and ra-ra-ra for to the left are tuged. Many tribes |
of Eskimos show a pride in the fact that their dog teams are matched in
color.” According to A. v. Etzel, the legend of the frozen sea, with the
mention of dog sledges, known only in the northernmost colonies of
South Greenland, is a striking evidence of emigration to South Green-
land from the north.’ In East Greenland the dogs have become extinet
through sickness.‘ In conclusion, I will remark that the statements of

Andrée’ concerning the weight and speed of sledges, which differ some-
what from the above, are borrowed from John Crawford: ‘‘On the rela-
tion of domesticated animals to civilization,” in the “Transactions of the
Ethnological Society of London,” II, 587-468.

Over the highest passes of the Himalayas and Thibet, where ponies
and yaks can not venture, sure-footed sheep and goats are used as
beasts of burden; sheep also are used in the country surrounding Ba-
hia, South America, carrying a water jar on either side, up hill and down
on very narrow mountain paths. Among the Indians of North America
the dog is used as a beast of burden. Here, abused and harshly treated
during life, he after death receives many honors—a truly human char-
acteristic. At the time of Coronado, in the year 1540, he was used by
a branch of the Comanches on the borders of the province of Durango
for the transportation of hides, and is still kept for the same service.2
Dogs are also used as beasts of burden by the prairie Crees in the Sas-
katchewan region,’ as well as by the Atnatanas on the Copper River.’
The ancient Peruvians also possessed such dogs.” In Asia the so-called
Yenesei-East-Jaks® own pack dogs and in Kamchatka they traverse
the mountains with light loads.’

However useful to man the dog may have proven himself as a hunt-
ing animal and beast of burden, yet many races of people left it to him
to keep himself fat and in good condition as he did before their mutual
approach. Fortunately, or unfortunately, he is an omnivorous animal,
and this peculiarity makes him useful about the dwellings of larger or
smaller settlements of man as a sort of street scavenger, sharing the
office with vultures and the like, as is now the case in many eastern
countries. What man no longer uses in his household—offal, dead ani-

mals, the bones of game, and in many places even human corpses—is

thrown out and becomes food for the usually empty stomach of the
neglected dog.

From classical antiquity we obtain many accounts of human bodies
being thrown to the dogs to be devoured. Hector threatened to do this
to Ajax and retracted his decision only because of Priam’s tears. In
Pohlman’s paper on the excess of population in the great cities of the
ancients, he has collected (p. 135) numerous passages from ancient
authors showing this to have been done. In Asia we find, especially

among the Mongolian peoples, a complete indifference to the corpses of
the ‘‘misera plebs.” Before the year 1000 such bodies were given as
prey to dogs—in Bactria according to Onesicritus, by the Hyrcanians
according to Cicero, by the Sogdians according to Strabo. Th. vy. Bayer! |
remarks that with the Kalmucks the bodies of the inferior classes are
thrown after death, either into the water or out on the steppes for the
dogs, vultures, etc., to devour; the better classes are, however, burned.
A similar fate for the corpses of beggars in Kuldja is mentioned by
Radloff?. 1n Urga, writes Prschewalsky,’* the beggars have their nest-
like beds in the market place. If one be about to die the dogs stand
around him and wait for his Jast breath; he is then devoured. The
dead of better classes are carried to the churchyard, dogs make up the
procession and conduct the interment by means of their stomachs; only
princes, gogos, and the highest lamas are really buried. In the well-
known parable of Lazarus, who ate the crumbs which fell from a rich
man’s table, the dogs came and licked his sores. Would anything very
different have befallen his body after his soul had flown to Heaven? If
in the cities of China, according to Exner’s account,‘ a beggar is dying,
his identity is determined by officers, he is allowed to lie where he is,
covered with mats held down with stones so that the dogs can not
trouble him while alive; as soon as he is dead, however, they do their
duty. The Kamchatkans believe in the life of the soul after the death
of the body, and in the warm desire for this better life the father often
allows his children to strangle him or to throw him to the dogs.’ In
caves of Poland thus far examined, traces of human industry have been
found, but no human bones; this was held as a negative indication of
the former occupation by Mongols,° who gave the dead to the dogs; a
positive indication, however, was found in the names of places as sagen
Mongolian zagan=white, zebrzydowo, zebr=wolf; Karsy, Kars=
steppe fox, and many others. It is an interesting fact‘ that exactly in
the center of the wide district through which we find scattered the
place name Psar lies the dog field at Breslau, Psie polje= Pasje polje.
The Polish chronologist, Vinc. Kadlubek, mentions this dog field at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, and says concerning it that here in
the year 1109 a battle took place between the Polish Prince Boleslaw
and the German Emperor. The Germans were overcome, many were
left lying on the battlefield, and the dogs swarmed from all sides and
devoured the flesh until they were so gorged that they went mad;
‘caninum campestre locus ille nominatur.” But an older chronologist,

named Gallus, who lived in the twelfth century and described this same
battle, said nothing whatever of mad dogs.'! There is no doubt that
Pasje polje, or dog field, received its name before the battle of 1109, and
is probably of the same ancient origin as the word Psar, belonging to so
many places. In the good old times of the European Middle Ages we
find numerous examples of the disposing of superfluous men by means
of dogs. I instance only the well-known story of the Cid, who, when he
could not get wood enough to burn his prisoners, had them torn to
pieces by dogs.’ In later times such bloodhounds were usedin America
for the execution of the most terrible deeds at the command of their
masters.

We learn from Stanley that in Usukuma and Uganda dogs are used
in battle. This was also the custom in ancient times.? When Marius
overcame the Cimbri, his legions had also to fight against women and
dogs. The Celts, as is shown by a bronze dog from Herculaneum, pro-
tected their dogs with spiked collars and metal breastplates. In the
battle of Morat, in 1476, as the troops stood in order of battle, the dogs
also began to fight. The Burgundian dogs were overcome by those of
the Swiss, an omen of the overthrow of their masters. The Turks also.
placed dogs on their outposts. That the much prized Friedenhunde of
our day were formerly educated as war dogs is proved by a widespread
literature on that subject. In conclusion I will only say that on Robben
Island (near Kapstadt) the bodies of people who have died of the
smallpox are given to the dogs toeat.1 * * #*

The Eskimos of America pour the urine over the fragile roofs of their
artificial snow huts, and thereby attract the caribou, which are greedy
for the salt that it contains.? The chalky excrement, for which there is
a special market in Berlin as the so-called pharmaceutie gentian, is used
by the peoples of western Asia for tanning. its use spread from there
to the dog-abounding city of Constantinople, for the preparation of
morocco leather,’ and great cargoes of it are sent from thence to the
United States for the preparation of morocco.’ The Tlinkits throw the
bodies of dogs attached to long lines into the sea; after a time they
become covered with dentalia and are then withdrawn." Concerning
the use of the teeth for weapons and adornment, see below. According to
Agatharchidas, Diodorus, and Strabo, the name Cynomolgi (dog’s-milk

eaters) is applied by the inhabitants of Sierra Leone to the tribes who
use the milk of swine.’ According to Major,’ in the neighborhood of
Cape Branco men, horses, and dogs live for months on the milk of the
most varied animals, as they also do on honey in South Africa.

Trade in dog’s hides is carried on from northern Asia in two direc-
tions—either west to Europe or east to North America; and the farther
they are carried the more expensive they become; for while in Obdorsk
a good skin costs 6 roubles,’ in the market of Charkow a black Siberian
dog pelt is worth from 50 to 100 roubles.*— In Paris the pelt is quickly
tanned and prepared as fashion demands.’ The greatest number of
dogskins is, however, consumed in eastern Asia itself, though the trade
there is now somewhat reduced. On account of the war with Japan,
fewer marriages take place in thickly populated China. There were
formerly brought to the young bride in Manchuria and Mongolia, as
wedding presents, many dogs, which thick-haired curs the young hus-
band took with his wife to his new home, then immediately slaughtered
them and made from the skins carpets and bed covers.

The superfluous ones were sold to traders in Chinese ports, and
thus dogskins of an annual value of nearly 2,000,000 marks were sent
to the United States.° As in the Abyssinian monastery Zad’ Amba
the entire possessions of a pious brother consisted in the half of a goat-
skin—his carpet, his bed, his cloak, his all‘—so also in China the poor
and the beggars own nothing but a shabby dog skin® that they have
found or that has been given them, and the middle classes complete
their winter costume by a storm coat of dog or goat skin. The princi-
pal export town for colored skins is the port of Liao-ho, or Niutschwang,
in Manchuria. It was formerly believed that these skins came from
ownerless, wandering dogs, but the yellow book of the customs officer
of that city at the end of the year 1880 shows that the production of
hides is the work of a trade organization. In all Manchuria and on the
eastern borders of Mongolia are to be found thousands of flocks of
young dogs. The severe cold, with a mean temperature of 33° to 37°
F’., develops beautiful pelts. Concerning their further preparation,
coloring, and the use of the flesh, see “Ausland.”® In Greenland,
where the caribou hunts are unprofitable, skins of seals and dogs are
used in preference, the skin of the young dogs especially as a lining for
winter boots; still it is very dear.’? In Grisecke’s time such skins were

thrown away on account of their offensive smell.! With the Samoyeds
the caps and the konitza (an article of female dress) are made of this
fur.” Ktavenstein’ gives an account of this use by the Kiptchaks,
Kraschennikow?* by the Kamchatkans. In Kamchatka, as Steller has
quoted from the yearbooks of Tag, a sort of cloth is made from dog’s
hair and different grasses.” The use to cover boxes in North America®
and flasks on St. Kilda’ is old. We find the custom widely spread of
using the separate parts of the body of the dog for adornment, and, on
the other hand, examples of expensive dog collars. In the latter con-
nection K. Schumann," the famous traveler, mentions that the Japa-
nese, as has been related by the Arabs, made for favorite dogs, monkeys,
etc , gold collars, thus anticipating the eccentricities of modern French
and American ladies, such as Patti and others. The old Egyptians
fitted their fine greyhounds with quite broad collars.? The fine dogs
of the Bashilangi do not wear collars, but a band around the belly,
similar to many Siberian draft dogs.!° As an adornment and also as a
means of deceptive decoration, the tails of many hairy animals are used.
In Majorea part of the Sunday costume of every girl is a neat braid,
not always genuine, as many fasten a cow’s tail therein.’ Before this,
in ancient times, Indian women plaited the black hair of the yak
under their own natural locks, xa? xogmobvtar waka woataws.” Gus-
tav Nachtigal saw in Wadai a Sklav woman who had fastened two
heavy braids of sheep’s hair under her own.’ To the northward from
the Victoria Nyanza, Baker met two men with horns on their heads
and cow’s tails instead of beards.'' Many tribes of Indians comb the
hair of the dead carefully, and in order to make the braid longer plait
into it buffalo hair.’ These analogies will suffice, and it is unnecessary
to dwell upon those Australians who insert the bushy tail of the dingo
dog into their beards in order to make them longer.'® The Wahaha
carry dog tails on their spears. The finger-long head of the spear is
burned into the handle and held fast by the skin of such a tail drawn
around it while still green.” The Parsi receive at puberty a girdle of

hair, which, according to the assertion of the Mesopotamian Jews, is
plaited from dog’s hair.' The Haidahs of British Columbia weave
white dog’s hair with other material, and on Puget Sound blankets are
also made of it.’

The large white eyeteeth of the dog, worn singly in the ears or many
together, also strung on a string, mingled with those of other carnivora,
are widely used as an adornment, uot only for men, but for women and
girls; for example, as a breast ornament at Friedrich Wilhelms Haven in
New Guinea, as necklaces and bracelets in the western part of the
south coast of the British portion of that island;* near Cape Concordia
such strings are more rare, the bones of Abrus precatorius being used
instead. On the Solomon Islands a traveler saw a magnificent neck-
lace of 500 dog teeth, each of which was carefully bored through.
Since only 2 teeth are here taken from each dog 250 dogs must have
been required, most of which were natives of San Christoval, where the
teeth are extracted from the living dogs without compunction.’ In the
southeastern portion of New Guinea all four eye teeth of these animals
are taken, and with more reason than shells (cowries), used as money as
they are in the Solomon Islands, Samoa, and other places; partly taking
the place of our diamonds and other precious stones.° The Igorroto also
wear necklaces and pendants of dogs’ teeth.” These teeth are also used in
New Guinea for weapons, and in the clubhouses there one may see
many dog skulls hung up as decorations." Asin Jaya itis held to be
disgraceful to have white teeth like those of the dog the people, as is
well known, color their teeth and those of dogs are not used as
ornaments.®

Schweinfurth saw in Africa necklaces of teeth of which there were
several from the dog;!? Junker saw similar ones among the Bari, and
Schuver among the Berta."

I may here briefly touch upon the use of the word dog as a term of
reproach. In the Old Testament, by the Arabs, and especially by most
Mohammedans, the word dog is an abusive epithet.!. Among the
Usbegs, while it is an impropriety to ask after a man’s wife, to ask after
his dog is a deadly insult, says Wood,” the epithet “dogseller” is the
deepest of insults. In the fourth century B. C. Yaska was of the opin-
ion that the name dog was sometimes applied to express contempt.’
In Latin, canis, as an epithet always referred to some special trait of the
dog (impudicity, cowardice, a snarling temper) and was not, as with us,
an expression of exasperated contempt.‘ Must that not also have been
the case in Halle in the fifteenth century, where it was the custom to
give to men zoological names (Tyle-dog, Heinz-ape, Fritz-sheep, pigsty,
etc.). In a recent political election speech in Newcastle, Mr. Morley
referred to the abusive use of the word “dog,” declaring that he could
not look upon it as an insult, for most dogs that he knew deserved to
be placed higher than many men. The following sections will clearly
show that many races take the same view.

It is a truly human trait to first recognize the worth of another after
his death. This is exemplified by many of the hunting peoples of North
America. The dog, the most faithful of the domestic animals, whose
fidelity is recognized. by the Koran, and who is therefore allowed to
participate in the joys of the Mohammedan paradise, is cruelly treated
by them while living, but when he dies and is transported to the happy
hunting grounds they do honor to his bones. They will not offend his
spirit because they will find him again in the after life.“ Among the
old Mexicans and Mayas he accompanied the dead in their passage to
the other side;‘ among the mound-builders of Nashville, Tennessee,’
and among the Eskimos’ he was placed in the graves of young children
who could not alone find their way to the spirit land. Dogs thus became
_ the guardians of the threshold at the entrance to the nether world.
According to the Zendavesta, certain dogs have the power of protect-
ing departed spirits from the demons lying in wait for them on the
perilous passage of the narrow bridge over the abyss of hell; and a
dog is always led in funeral processions and made to look at the corpse.!”

According to Synesius (fifth century), Cerberus held the position as

sentinel at the mouth of hell, and Dante represents him as keeping
watch at the entrance to the third circle, where he torments the souls.
“The Aztees held the belief that the Techichi acted as a guide through
the dark regions after death.”’ Luther asserts, in his “Table talk,”
that dogs also go to heaven. He firmly believed that he would again
see his own little dog in the other world, and Klopstock’s Messias
(\.VI, 260-333) has Elisama’s dog enter heaven. The Countess Eliza-
beth Charlotte von Orleans said: “I am much pleased with what he
(Leibnitz) has stated, that animals do not wholly perish. It comforts
me very much about my dear little dog.”” In German mythology the
dog is the messenger of death,’ and in Formosa when a dog howls the
people have the priest come, for some member of the family is about to
die.t Bastian® gives another view: God created the dog and assigned
to him the duty of keeping watch against the serpent who betrays
man. ‘This is, therefore, the reason why, when one is about to die, the
dog howls. In Borneo it is believed that he who laughs when a dog or
a serpent crosses the path will be turned to stone.®

Black is recognized as a fateful color; black dogs are held to be the
familiars of sorcerers; the evil one himself takes the form of a black
dog (in Goethe’s Faust). In the folk-tale of the wise Odin the black
dog is the offspring of the devil; a great fear of the traveler on the
Swedish heaths is that of meeting the Restless One with a couple of
black, fire-spitting dogs. The heathen Samoyeds of the neighborhood
of the Mezen offer to the devil either a reindeer or a black dog, who is
drowned after sunset. The head is turned toward the west. These
animals are offered also to the Tadepzii and Chechi, and the head of the
victim is then thrown to its relatives; all the flesh is torn off from it,
and the gnawed skullis placed on a pole opposite the idol.* The Lapps
abuse their dogs, so necessary to them, with kicks, because they are
held to be “the degenerate offspring of the wolf,” who has intruded
among men to work them harm. On this account, when these close rel-
atives to the wolf have grown old they do not kill them, but fasten
them to a tree until they have starved to death. [For the same reason
a dog must never be present at a marriage.’ In the year 1702 the
French soldiers who were defending Landau were firmly convineed that
the black dog of their general was a familiar spirit of the devil, who

1Fr, A. Ober, Travels in Mexico, p. 320. The old inhabitants of the Cordilleras
thought differently. Andrée Bresson says (Bolivia, p. 128): ‘‘In the burials of Arica,
we find with the mummies the artificial eves which the ancient Peruvians, actuated
by a religious sentiment, placed near their dead to conduct them in the journey to
the underworld; provisions for the route are also not forgotten.”

personally drew up all plans of battle. Among the Esthonians black
dogs, cats, moles, and cocks belong to that class of animals that must
be sacrificed at the raising of the Kalevi treasure.! In Manchuria the
evil spirit, or little black dog, is visible to the sorcerer alone.2 The
shamans, or medicine men, sacrifice a dog on great occasions for exor-
cism.? In Kamchatka a dog is also offered up to the evil spirit of the
. hills, the entrails are strewn around, and the body and hind legs hung
on along pole. Of Phcenician origin was the worship of the goddess
upon the promontory of Kolias near Athens, where, on the second day
of the Thesmophorian festival, there were held at night orgies during
which dogs were offered up, a custom which fully indicates its oriental
origin.” In West Timor, as a declaration of war, the head of a black
dog is thrown into the territory of the enemy.*®

The dog was worshiped and appeased as a god by many peoples, as
in America among the ancient Peruvians of Xauxa and Huanca, where
priests blew upon the skeletonized heads of dogs. In Cuzco, the blood
of black dogs was smeared over the countenances of the idols, their
hearts and lungs were used in augury; the ears of dogs used at a burial
were cut off.’ Similar offerings were known earlier in Yucatan.? In
Africa, the Baghirmi, natives of Gabberi, also sacrifice dogs. At
ancient Byblus, in Asia, the dog was sacred to Mars. On the Lykos
River, in Syria, stood a hollow idol of a dog which sounded as the
wind blew threw it, but on the approach of an enemy barked, in
tones audible as far as Cyprus. The dog is also honored by many
families of the Ansurii. Zoroaster also makes this animal sacred and
it is highly honored by the Kolis."° In Sikkim, the household gods of
the Metch are distorted figures of a god often pictured as riding on a
dog." In Japan, dogs are numerous because they are held as sacred.
These dogs are often buried so that only the head remains free. Before
the nose of the dog is placed dainty food. After this Tantalus-like
torture, the head is cut off shortly before death from starvation, and
made into the mysterious box of the priest.” That a long time ago

offerings of dogs were made at Sakhalin, was determined by Poljakow
from discoveries at old places of sacrifice, where, among countless
other bones, ten toothless skulls of dogs were also found.’ The Koriaks
likewise, in order to insure good fishing, made offerings of dogs, and,
indeed, of the best, because the god commanded it; these were simply
hanged upon trees. It cost Major Abase much trouble to make them
-understand that the worst dogs would answer the same purpose.’ In
northern Siam, between Scwegun and Hlaingbwe, the Karens pro-
pitiate the spirits by suspending the carcass of a dog from an impro-
vised altar of bamboo.’ In Cambodia, dog’s teeth drive away ghosts,
and in Sumatran traditions dogs play significant parts.* In the Celebes,
the people sacrifice dogs, because through such an offering the ground
becomes more fruitful.’

In Australasia, at Samoa, dogs and some birds are consecrated to
the greater gods; at the Solomon Islands, together with other skulls,
those of dogs are hung in considerable numbers in each village.® In
New Guinea, at the Kaiserin-Augusta River, a dog was killed as a
sign of friendship for the Europeans, and in New Zealand Forbes found,
in an undisturbed cave, the carved figure of a Maori dog, which was
contemporaneous with the moa.’

Among the ancients I will only mention that the Romans offered up
to their gods yearly upon their altars a considerable quantity of dog’s
flesh, and that in the temple of Zeus Adranos 1,000 dogs were used as
guards.® I might here add a few instances which show that dogs are
also regarded with significance in Christendom, especially during the
Christmas season. As Branchion was following a stag with dogs, the
animal took refuge in the cave of a hermit, and the hunters and dogs
knelt in awe before the cross. In France it is believed that during
the Christmas midnight mass the animals kneel in their stalls, but
it is very imprudent to watch them, because they will all attack you.
In Poland, at this season, the young girls go out into the yard and
listen for the barking of the dogs; from the side where a dog barks
a future husband will come. In the Christmas matins of Stralsund,
an eyewitness of the sixteenth century reports that quite different
behavior occurred; the house of God was made a romping place for the
greatest misconduct. Young men sat in women’s clothes on the women’s
chairs, others were clothed like shepherds, took dogs and goats along

with them, ran up and down the church with these beasts, screaming
and rolling over each other on the floor.'. Among the country people
of India a similar custom prevails, where at a birth festival boys and
girls enact a scene of childbirth, the newborn child being represented
by a young dog.” Dogs also understand how to distinguish between
various religions. In a Chinese writing that treats of the preservation
of the purity of the Chinese customs it is said, “‘The corruption of the
foreign devils (i. e., the Roman Catholic Christians) is so great that
even pigs and dogs refuse to eat their flesh.” *

Many people suppose that if dogs are allowed to gnaw the bones of
animals pursued in the chase or used for sacrifice the hunt or the offer-

‘ing will prove ineffectual. Among the Eskimos the dogs must not

gnaw seal bones while the seal hunt is going on.!’ The Metschers and
Mordwinians, the oldest inhabitants of the Tambol Government, after
a meal instituted in honor of the war gods, throw the remaining bones
into the water so that the dogs may not eat them.’ When the dog
fails in his special quality, watchfulness, he deserves punishment ‘even
to the third and fourth generation.” The Romans gave to their dogs
every year a sound flogging because their forefathers slept during the
attack on the capitol by the Gauls while the geese gave the alarm for
which they have received so much honor. This custom was even sur-
passed in Paris during the time of Louis XIV, when annually, on a
set day, many dogs and cats were buried by the magistrates with
festival ceremonies on the Place du Greve.

In Germany, several centuries ago, the killing of dogs was allowed
‘“‘to flayers and knackers, also to doctors and students of medicine,
that they might better learn the human body; further, to apothecaries,
that they might thus obtain medicines.” ° Elsewhere, also, such reme-
dies have been found efficacious. The Tchuktches sometimes kill a
dog in order to anoint and heal the sick with its fat and blood.* Asa
remedy for Filaria medinensis natives in Kordofan drink beer (merissa)
in which dog’s excrement has been placed.’ The fetich Koro, a dog
with two heads, is considered in Inshono as very powerful against dis-
ease.° Through dogs may diseases also be occasioned, as, for example,
among the Nubians, where the taking in of a dog’s breath may cause
“the worst kind of internal disorders.” '° * * * The mandrake root,
well known in ancient German and Roman times, appears also with all

its power in the country of the upper Nile, where its possession gives
the greatest good fortune to man. When fastened to the tail of a dog,
to be torn up by the roots, it cries.’ One of the most remarkable out-
growths of superstition is the oxvloyapos; that is to say, the holding
of the so-called dog’s marriage at Cyprus, as an approved means for
curing the bite of a mad dog. If anyone was bitten in this way, he
must, exactly forty days thereafter, celebrate a dog’s marriage, at
which he must heartily eat, drink, and dance; he must not sleep during
the next night, and the poison of the rabies will pass off by transpira-
tion.” In the tradition of the sea of quicksilver the metal can be
collected only by means of dogs-skins sewed together.*? Concerning
the dog in Persian mythology, compare Gerlach, and concerning the
holy fire of the Gebers in the Jezd oasis, in which were 72 to 75 differ-
ent materials, among which a widow and a dog, see Ritter.

The portents of dogs in folklore are treated at length in ‘‘Ausland,”®
but to what is there said I may add a few remarks. The Mbocavies
(Pampas) think that certain of the stars are an ostrich that is pur-.
sued by the heavenly dogs. The moon is a man, and when it suffers
eclipse its entrails are torn out by dogs.® In Mongolian mythology it
is said that the moon in the shape of a yellow dog has licked his own
chops.’ In the time reckoning of many peoples the dog also plays a
part. ‘The Cambodians, like all peoples who have taken from China
the elements of their calendar, use for designation of time a duodenary
cycle, each year of which bears the name of an animal—chachien.”®
So also in Siam, Annam, among the eastern Khirghises, etc.? Among
the converted Indians of Istlavacan not only is a month ealled after
the dog, but also a day in each month.”

Hunters and shepherds among the most different peoples know that
their dogs understand exactly their speech and gestures, and so do
those that busy themselves much with dogs," and conversely the mas-
ters understand the various notes of the voices of the dogs that have
become much modified by the contact with civilization and under the
training of man. On that account the inhabitants of the Gold Coast
formerly believed that European dogs could talk, and in Unyoro the
tradition is curreat that dogs were once endowed with speech.” That

the association of shepherds and dogs in Egypt alone reaches back for
thousands of years, we see from the sceptre of the Pharaohs, a long
Shepherd’s staff whose crook has the form of the head of an animal,
indeed a very well-designed head of a dog. Wilkinson saw similar
Staffs among the Egyptian peasants of to-day, as did also Virchow and
Schliemann at Epidauris.!

In Yule’s masterly work? we read: “The doghead feature is at least
as old as Ctesias. The story originated, I imagine, in the disgust with
which allophylian types of countenance are regarded, kindred to the
feeling which makes the Hindoos and other eastern nations represent
the aborigines whom they superseded as demons. The Cubans de-
scribed the Caribs to Columbus as maneaters with dogs’ muzzles, and
the old Danes had tales of Cynocephali in Finland. Ibn Batuta
describes an Indo-Chinese tribe on the coast of Arakan or Pegu as
having dogs’ mouths, but says the women were beautiful. Trio Jordanus
has heard the same of the dog-headed islanders. And one form of the
story, found, strange to say, in China and diffused over Ethiopia, rep-
resents the males as actual dogs and represents the females as women.
Oddly, too, Pere Barbe tells us that a tradition of the Nicobar people
themselves represents as of canine descent, but on the female side!
The like tale, in early Portuguese days, was told by the Peguans, viz.,
that they sprang from a dog and a Chinese woman. It is mentioned
by Camoens (10, 122). Note, however, that in Colonel Man’s notice of
the wilder part of the Nicobar people the projecting canine teeth are
spoken of.” To these words I will add the following notes: Forbes®
speaks of the transformation of a dog into a man; according to Colqu-
houn,‘a dog married a ‘daughter of Yao,” and Robert Hartman?
discusses the tradition that in Dschur lo wate (woman town) there were
only women, and these consorted with dogs.

On the island of Hainan the aborigines, the Li-tse, descended from
dogs, and therefore yet have tails as appendages.® Radloff* speaks of
the origin of the Khirgises from dogs. The Ainos trace their deriva-
tion from the offspring of a woman and a dog.® Also in America many
stocks derive their own origin from dogs—for exainple, the Chuchacas,
the Kadiaks, the Chippeways, the Dog-rib Indians.’ According to Boas,
this came to pass in the latter case very easily. A woman driven from
her tribe married a dog, bore to him six dogs, and once surprised them

with their skins off, at which time they were children. She craftily
took their skins away, and they consequently became men and the
ancestors of these Indians. Bastian! informs us that men, on account
of evil deeds, may lose their voices and must for punishment bark like
dogs. In conclusion, I will give only two more examples. That the
souls of men may find homes in the bodies of dogs is held at Tongking?
and at Africa, where, among the Baschilange, according to Pogge, the
faith prevails. Therefore they call those who eat no dog’s flesh
“Muschilambus.” Whether this is because of any veneration to the
dog he does not know. Kalambo, however, has all dogs killed because
they are magical beings.?

For a number of years past I have been working on a book which is
to contain a collection of the names given to mammals by all peoples,
and it will be readily understood that in this collection the designa-
tions for the widely distributed dog surpass all others in number. Let
us see what deductions can be drawn from the names given to dogs by
savages in the four quarters of the globe.

Among the African names for the dog there is one that is also used
for animals in general; among others there are several that are used in
one and the same tribe for swine. This favors the view that the earliest
dogs among them were not used either for the chase or as guardians,
but, like swine, for food, perhaps as far back as that epoch when the
northern part of Africa had a different conformation, together with a
different flora and fauna,

In North America a comparison of the words for wolf and dog show
us that, as was also known from zoological reasons, the dog distributed -
from north to south was partly derived from the Canis latrans by the
somewhat active intercourse between the Indian tribes of the Northwest
and the peoples of northeastern Asia, and also that at an early period
the dog of the Tchuktches and Kamchatkans came over, for the Kam-
chatkan name for dog is also found in America. When later the Euro-
pean horse was brought on he frequently received the name of some
species of deer; but, as he soon became indispensable, he sometimes
received the same name as the only domestic animal they had hitherto
had; soin Dakota the mystical word for horse is ‘schanka-wankan,”
the holy or spirit dog.

In South America, asin Africa, we sometimes find the same name used
for dog and pig; occasionally the same for dog and beast of prey. The
bare word tchinu (dog) is the same as the Botocudo tehine (animal), also
thiicke utschiaghanti among the Miranhas; in the same way the modern
Greeks call the horse generally the animal, the Italians call sheep pecora,
on the Romagna pigura; the Greeks of Thira designate all beasts of
burden xr7a, in Syra irregularly ro xtyvo. The age of the South

American aborigines can not be measured by means of historical data,
but may, perhaps, be estimated in another way. The meal industry is
without doubt the most significant feature of the civilization of these
tribes to whom the use of milk and its products is entirely unknown.
The Old World used only innocuous grain food plants, increasing them
by cultivation and forming from their products meal and bread. In
South America, on the contrary, a very poisonous, quickly fatal plant
is first deprived of its poison, and the porridge then made from it is

rendered palatable by the addition of the juice from the little Limonia,

the bark of Dicypellium caryophyllatum, ants, or honey. The customs
of changing the fruit of the Gulielma speciosa, of producing yellow par-
rot feathers by means of trog’s blood (among the Munderucus), and
many similar ones that are widely spread also point to an old civiliza-
tion with which many races of dogs may have been contemporaneous.

In southeastern Asia we meet with a word for the dog that means
animals in general; in another case his designation is the same as that
for the horse, the pig, and carnivorous animals, and the same obtains
in the Ural-altaic, Slavic, and Germanic tongues, where the designations
for dog, wolf, and fox have often the same origin. Three thousand
years ago the Chinese called all the nomads of the west dogs, and the
word dog in Turko-Tatar was derived from ‘ et” (low, base) or from
“kurt” (greedy animal). The Turanian ideogram for dog is wr-ku,
which, according to Halevy, is derived from ur (flesh-eating) and ku
(domestic). It is striking that the root words for dog and bear never
agree, while those for dog and the smaller carnivore sometimes do so.

The statement of Leland, ‘all ignorant and unscientific people give
to unnamed animals the name of some creature with which they are
familiar,” holds good for the savages of Australia and Oceanica. Many
words for dog, such as keru, signify also animals in general; so, also,
keru kejerik, the rat animal, i. e., cat (Museum Godeffroy, I, 43); others
signify also pig—for example, buga, brooas (Pott, Etymology. Fasch-
ungen, II,1,138). Kittlitz (11, 8) remarks that after one had once seen
a pig every large animal, even the cat, was called cochon, just as the
Jakuts use the Mongolian word for pig (chachat) as a designation for
the leopard. At Queen Charlotte Sound the natives called all the quad-
rupeds that Cook had with him dogs. (Voyage toward the South Pole,
I, 125.) As the sailors in calling the dog toward them said ‘ come

here,” so the inhabitants of Mortlock Isla d afterwards called the dog

‘¢ comelhere.”

In the Verdidad, the oldest and most genuine portion of Zendavesta,
it is said: ‘The world is maintained by the intelligence.of the dog,”
and Brehm adds to this: ‘‘ We can not conceive of savage man without
the dog; still less can we imagine the educated and cultivated inhabit-
ants of the thickly populated parts of the earth.” The dog is a part
of man himself. Heis, as Fr. Cuvier expresses it, the most remarkable,
complete, and useful acquisition which man has ever made.
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.!

By M. BERTHELOT.

Geber, the Arabian philosopher and chemist, asserts that the perfec-
tion of a being depends upon an exact equilibrium among its elements,
Whenever that state of equilibrium is obtained, he says, the being
becomes immortal, because there is then a complete compensation
between its opposing elements and nature. Whatever may be thought
of such reasoning, ideas and definitions of this kind correspond but
little with the conditions that affect genius in art and science. In fact
power and beauty generally are the result of the exaltation of certain
qualities developed with an unusual intensity; this constitutes the true
originality of genius, and all compensation between contrary aptitudes
results in a certain mediocrity.

These truths have rarely found a more striking application than in
the career of Brown-Séquard. He possessed qualities of imagination
and of originality characteristic of great discoverers, rather than those
habits of precision, accuracy, and application that belong to scientists
of repute in their work, scientists that are perhaps more esteemed in
the academies because they have fewer imperfections. Still, let us not
forget that it is the inventive minds that keep humanity going.

Brown-Séquard was an inventor, and some of his fundamental ideas,
thought to be strange and almost senseless at the time they were
expressed, in the crude state in which he frequently left them, have yet
shown an originality as marked, perhaps, as thoseof Pasteur or of Claude
Bernard. Brown-Séquard left a profound mark on the biological field
because he had a very high ideal of science, an ideal that he pursued in
spite of all obstacles with a passionate devotion, sacrificing to it the idols
ordinarily worshiped by man—money, position, aud honors. In his busi-
ness affairs there was the same instability, the same want of balance as
in his intellectual career, and he passed an existence as wandering and
agitated as that of a scientist of the sixteenth century. He spent his
life between two races, the French and the Anglo Saxon, to both of
which he belonged by family connections, traversing the routes of the

world, from the Indian Ocean, where he was born, to the coasts of
Europe and America; sometimes an experimenter, sometimes a consult-
ing physician, sometimes a scientific journalist, and sometimes a pro-
fessor; at Paris, at London, at Dublin, at New York, at Boston, until
the time when he found in his later years a resting place and the crown
of his career in our old but always youthful College of France, always
an asylum for original intellects, and in our Academy of Sciences, a
final consecration of scientific work.

Such is the man whose life and work I am about to try to sketch.

Charles Edouard Brown-Séquard was born April 8, 1817, at Port-
Louis (Mauritius) of an American father, Brown, of Philadelphia, and
a French mother, who was a Mile. Séquard, of Provengal origin. His
father, a captain in the merchant marine, went to sea with his vessel
some months before the birth of his son, and was never heard of again.
Brown’s lot was in this respect like that of EK. Rénan, who also lost
his father nnder similar circumstances. Our scientist bore, in his phys-
ical frame as in his intellectual character, the traces of this double
origin, modified by the climate of his birthplace. From his mother he
inherited that southern vivacity and sympathetic character that
attracted so many to him, while from his father he derived that adven-
turous boldness which he carried into his experiments, and also that
ability to promptly change the surroundings of his life and to work
without cessation during the constant shifting about of an adventurous
career. The tropical land where he was born endowed him with the
physical characteristics of the Indian creole. Formerly a French
colony, it was torn away from its native country by the disasters of 1814,
because it was a naval station of the first rank, being the base of the
bold expeditions conducted by Dupleix and La Bourdonnais, in the
eighteenth century.

Therefore, England, who hastens to seize every island, every cape,
and every strait that controls the sea, did not neglect to possess herself
of Mauritius at the time of our misfortune. The population has, how-
ever, even to the present day, preserved a certain attachment for the
country from which it sprang.

When Brown-Séquard was born Mauritius was no longer French ter-
ritory, and tbis was the reason why, when after a wandering existence,
he wished at the decline of his life to settle finally in France, it was
necessary for him to become naturalized. Still his native tongue was
French, and when he made his first visit to the United States he was
obliged to learn English, which he did during the voyage.

In the midst of privation and poverty his mother raised him with a
tenderness of which he always preserved the most lively remembrance.
She lived by the work of her needle, employing an aged negro to sell
her embroidery. Thus it was that our future colleague was initiated
into the severe struggle for existence, an initiation that tempers the
spirit of those that can submit to it without shrinking. It is well to
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 679

detail it here in order that we may understand the course which Brown
pursued for a long time and the incomplete character of his works.

At 15 years of age he became a clerk in a colonial provision store,
which was also, as in Italy, a place of rendezvous and gossip, so that the
young man was in contact not only with the laboring people but also
with the cultivated residents of the neighborhood. He showed the
influence of the latter by writing poetry, romances, and plays, a begin-
ning often made by those who have not received a regular education.
In reality these attempts are about equivalent to the scholastic exercises
produced by the rhetoricians and philosophers of our graduating classes,

At 20 years of age Brown set out with his mother for Paris, then the
ideal center of attraction for natives of Mauritius. Immediately on his
arrival in 1838, counting innocently on his literary talents for support,
he presented his works to Charles Nodier, who hastened to enlighten
him as to their true merit by saying, ‘In order to live you must take
up some regular business, my friend.”

Claude Bernard had in a similar manner begun by writing a tragedy.
But without being rich he was not so poor as Brown-Séquard. The
latter, also like Bernard, followed the advice given him and decided
that he would become a physician, a profession for which he had hith-
erto shown no predilection. !

This profession did but little toward satisfying his immediate wants,
for it could bring in nothing until after long years of apprenticeship.
Besides, Brown-Séquard had no preparation for it whatever; preliminary
scientific knowledge was wanting as well as material resources. Special
qualifications were also needed, but of these there was fortunately no
lack. ?

The mother and son leased rooms in the rue Férou near St. Sulpice,.
and there gave board and lodging to students from Mauritius who were
more fortunate than they.

These little groups of foreigners, clustering around their compatriots,
are common in Paris; it is greatly to be regretted that the administra-
tion has of late years made constant efforts to discourage them and to
get them attached to faculties in the provinces, where they will not
acquire so readily a hearty sympathy with our national life.

In the meantime Brown-Séquard was at work trying to amend, or
rather to completely renew, his education. He prepared at the same
time his medical examinations and two baccalaureate courses in letters
and sciences; for it had not yet pleased the authorities to prolong the
duration of the courses which are now retarded by a series of barriers
regularly spaced off. F

Our future colleague filled a double office, that of pupil in the labo-
ratory of Martin Magron and that of tutor, transmitting the knuowl-
edge that he had just acquired to his less active and less intelligent
comrades. This is a profession in which more than one of us has com-
menced his career, thus finding, as did Brown-Séquard, the pecuniary
680 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

resources necessary for obtaining an education. It should not be sup-
posed that these conditions are absolutely unfavorable; on the con-
trary, by teaching one is forced to learn more thoroughly what is
taught; some author, whose name I do not remember, has said that in
order to teach it is necessary to know a subject twice over. <A teacher
must certainly apply himself to think out and assimilate his subject in
a way not often accomplished by the young student who pays scanty
attention to the lesson, listening with a distracted mind and perhaps
never thinking of it again.

It was by contact with these Parisian masters that there came to
Brown-Sequard the revelation of his true vocation, which had hitherto
remained obscure. While reproducing the experiments of others in
the laboratory of Martin Magron, he conceived the idea of experimeunt-
ing on his own account; his passion for physiology burst forth and
assisted to sustain him in the midst of painful trials while he was enter-
ing upon a life of difficulties. He was, in fact. soon subjected to both
personal and family troubles.

A dissecting wound, an accident still too frequent among students,
made him ill for long months. Searcely had he recovered when lhe lost
his mother, his devoted companion and support. Brown-Séquard had
a peculiarly sensitive and affectionate nature, which often made him
unhappy during the course of his life. Prostrated by this unexpected
stroke, carried away by au irresistible influence, and semidelirious, he
quitted Paris and embarked for his native land. Hardly arrived there,
more reduced in material resources than ever, and finding it impossible
to renew them in so restricted a sphere, he obtained the aid of a friend
to return to Paris.

Friends were never wanting to Brown-Séquard. Like all loving
natures he always received keen and affectionate sympathy.

He then returned to Paris, poorer than ever, to finish his medical
studies, working in a poor chamber and nourished sometimes on only
dry bread and water; without fire in the dead of winter, living helter-
skelter with guinea pigs and rabbits, the subjects of his experiments,
who were henceforth to be his companions up to his very last nee
for half a century.

He graduated in medicine in 1840, publishing in his thesis a prelim-
inary sketch of his researches on the nervous system.

It should not, however, be supposed that Brown was always unhappy;
as is usual in youth he lived upon imagination and hope, exalted by his
discoveries. He often in after life referred to these first years with
affectionate remembrance.

This young man, so industrious and zealous, could not long fail to
receive aid from those around him—aid from the young scientists and
artists of his own age, aid also from scientists who had already become
famous. If we should accuse some of the latter of being selfish and
jealous it would be an accusation which, as all this company knows, it

THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 681

would be very unjust to make general. Among the devotees of science
there are many who are happy to aid and encourage beginners, to sus-
tain them, and to hand to them in turn the torch of science, which it is
our duty, our honor, and our pleasure to keep burning still more bril-
liantly during the next generation.

In this manner Brown-Séquard lived until about 1848. At this epoch,
so fertile in disclosures and in quickly-blighted hopes, he found himself
placed, because of his experimental work, in relation with the Society of
Biology, founded during that very year, and of which he was later to
become one of the principal pillars of support.

The Society of Biology had just been founded at the instance of cer-
tain young men, such as Charles Robin, Claude Bernard, Follin, and
others whose names have become well known. Brown-Séquard was one
of its first four secretaries. It was and has not ceased to be an excellent
forum for the study and discussion of problems of natural science, a
forum less solemn than those of the academies, the discussions being
more friendly, not being exposed in the same degree to disturbing
vanities and personalities unduly excited by a sometimes excessive
publicity. There is found there a sincerity and consequently a greater
certitude in the demonstrations as well as the concurrence and col-
laboration of comrades of the same age not yet disunited by the rival-
ries of a career.

On the other hand, resources of all kinds were scanty at the Seciety
of Biology. Science, especially at that time, furnished but little to
beginners. Since then the Republic has increased these resources,
especially in the form of those scholarships for superior instruction,
which have in recent times been unjustly attacked by those who have
narrow views, and who are perhaps actuated by jealousy of progressive
methods.

While the Society of Biology did not furnish the same resources as
we have at our command to-day, it nevertheless aided, even from the
first, the young scientists who crowded to its ranks, attracted both by
the confraternity of scientific work and by the good will of the first
president, Rayer. Rayer was a man of experience and judgment rather
than of originality; a clever man who had by his merit attained a good
position, both from a pecuniary and a scientific point of view. This
did not prevent him from remembering that in his youth he had suf-
fered from the religious and philosophical intolerance of the Restora-
tion, which had barred him from a teaching career, and he took pleasure
in protecting young scientists and in aiding them by his influence,
which was great, and which was to become much greater by reason of
the repute that attached to him because of professional medical services
rendered to prominent and powerful people. Claude Bernard, Charles
Robin, and others also, among whom I have the honor to count myself,
have received from Rayer assistance in their careers which they have
uever forgotten.
682 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

Rayer thus gave to Brown-Séquard. his first opportunities for work;
he interested himself in him and confided to his care certain patients
whom he thought ought to be treated by galvanism.

The next year, in 1849, during that deadly epidemic of cholera, which
left a profound impression on the minds of the students and doctors of
my time who were called to treat the sick and dying, Brown-Séquard
was appointed as assistant physician at the military hospital of Gros-
Caillou. It was a dangerous post, requiring devotion to duty. Brown
never drew back on such occasions.

Still his means of existence continued to be uncertain. In 1852 he
found hinself at the end of his resources, and his republican opinions
hardly permitted him to hope for any official support. He embarked
for New York on a Sailing vessel. He was ignorant of the language of
the country where he was going to seek his fortune, but he smilingly
said that he counted on the length of the voyage for learning English
and on his profession for subsistence when he had once arrived in the
United States. He showed at this time that mixture of almost childish
want of foresight and self confidence that characterized his entire life;
tossed about incessantly from fortune to poverty, always rescued before
reaching the last extremity and always recovering himself by his own
energy.

Thus it was that he commenced that irregular career that led him so
many times from France to England and to America, and from America
to England and to France, attracted on the one hand by the desire for
a life in Paris, the only place where his scientific instincts were com-
pletely satisfied, and on the other by his Anglo-American traditions
that led him to seek for a living in New York or London, where applied
science was more generously compensated. He crossed the ocean in
this way more than sixty times in the course of a half century.

This existence of a scientist wandering from country to country
becomes more and more rare and difficult. During the sixteenth cen-
tury it was almost the usual method of life. As the new spirit of the
tenaissance found but little encouragement in the old scholastic uni-
versities, scientists and artists were then in the habit of wandering
between France, Italy, Germany, and sometimes England, seeking the
protection, too often capricious, of princes and sovereigns. In the seven-
teenth century Louis XIV called te France Cassini, Huyghens, and
many others, some of whom, indeed, founded dynasties there.

The eighteenth century, with its ideas concerning the moral and
intellectual unity of the human race, was favorable to this wandering
habit. Even in our own days we have seen that in the early part of the
present century it was kept up between France, Italy, and Germany,
as weil as between Germany, England, and Russia. It would be easy
to cite numerous examples of this, but since the wars of the last forty
years that have established the great European States these powers
have become more jealous of each other; each has tried to preserve
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 683

more and more the advantages of its own State for its own citizens.
This tendency to exclusion has begun to affect even the United States.
The life of a wandering scientist, such as Brown-Séquard, has there-
fore become quite difficult. Perhaps, indeed, it would not have been
possible, even in his time, had he not possessed special qualities derived
from his racial origin.

Although we can thus easily explain the national exclusiveness ef
the present day, we may perhaps in certain respects see cause to
regret it; for the exchange of ideas and conceptions between peoples
is more easily effected by means of persons than by books, and this
exchange is indispensable for the general diffusion of knowledge and
culture.

Hardly had Brown-Séquard landed at New York when he was
obliged to give lessons in French to support himself. He made the
acquaintance of some of the distinguished physicians of the city who
had attended at Paris the lectures of Magendie, Andral, and Bouillaud.
They obtained for him the post of teacher of experimental physiology
in one of the American medical schools. At the present time a young
Parisian physician would hardly find such resources in New York. In
the first place, because scientific culture has remarkably developed in
America during the past half century, and the Americans find among
themselves the necessary teachers; but also because we no longer, to
the great damage of French influence, give the same welcome to for-
eign students. Too frequently, repulsed by us, they go to complete
their education in Germany. Let us hope that our University of Paris
will pursue a more enlightened course and repair the sad mistakes into
which narrow-minded persons have led her.

In 1853 Brown Séquard was in America and led there a very unset-
tled life. In order to support himself he resorted to obstetric practice
at $5 a case, and assisted in the preparation of a treatise on obstetrics.
In the meantime he married, espousing Miss Fletcher, niece of Daniel
Webster, the celebrated orator, and had by her a son, recently deceased,
who gave his father but little satisfaction. Brown-Séquard returned to
France during the summer, without, however, finding there any more
solid means of support. Patients did not care for a physician so un-
settled in his habits. He would not, however, abandon science, which
was always the principal subject of his thoughts. It was, indeed, at
this time that he published, in the Philosophical Medical Examiner, his
first paper on experimental epilepsy. Still adventurous and unsettled,
he returned to the United States, to leave again in 1854, in order to
visit Mauritius, his native island. There he chanced upon an epidemic
of cholera, which was decimating the population. Physicians were
needed. Brown Séquard was put in charge of a hospital and various
relief establishments. The treatment he adopted, founded upon the use
of opium, was in accordance with the practice of the period. The prin-
cipal fruit of his services was a gold medal, struck by order of the
684 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

municipality of Port Louis. At the end of the year he returned to the
United States, where he received the appointment of professor of
physiology in the University of Richmond, Virginia, and began his
course in 1855.

He seemed then to have a secure position, which would enabie him te
live and to devote himself to original researches. This was, however,
a delusion. The directors and the pupils of the university required
didactic, elementary knowledge only, to prepare the pupils to answer
examination questions. As to original researches, neither the one nor
the other cared anything about them. Besides, there were already
coming up in Virginia certain problems of a more extended political
and social character, relating to slavery, an institution thought by the
Southern States to be essential. Already there was beginning that
fermentation which culminated a few years later in the war of secession.
Now Brown-Séquard was too much attached to the humanitarian ideas
of the eighteenth century and of the French revolution to hesitate. His
social position in Richmond became unpleasant. It was practicable
for him to make a change he had in view, as he had been able to acquire
some income in the practice of medicine. Accordingly, instead of
pursuing in the United States the career now open before him, he took
advantage of the small sum he had accumulated by economy and
hastened to Paris, the center of attraction to which he was always
drawn.

It was at this period that I saw him for the first time, at the end of
1855, in the sympathetic circle of the Society of Biology. He was
then 38 years of age. Ihave still before me a vision of that original
face, delicate and kindly, embrowned by the climate of his native
island; those keen and gentle eyes, always in restless motion, animated
at once with an affectionate regard for the friends of science and by
an unceasing and ever-watchful curiosity, which led him to search
out her secrets, and also by some inexplicable feeling of timidity, which
doubtless caused his inability to manage his own affairs.

His personal devotion to science was unbounded, and led him more
than once to make experinents that might endanger his health. Thus
he repeated in his own person the experiments that Spallanzani had
made upon ravens, that of collecting gastric juice by means of a sponge
attached to a string, swallowing the former and then withdrawing it
from his stomach charged with the precious liquid. The following
story, even more striking, is related of him.

In 1851 he was making researches upon red and dark blood. He
injected into the arm of an executed criminal, thirteen hours after
decapitation, 250 grams of his own blood, obtained by opening a vein.

In 1855 he set up in the rue St. Jacques a physiological laboratory in
common with Charles Kobin, another investigator who was also loved
by the young. Among the beginners of that period who have since
made their mark it will suffice to mention our friend Laboulbene, pro-
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 685

fessor in the faculty of medicine, who has recently been snatched from
us; Rosenthal, of Vienna, Westphal, of Berlin, Czermak, and others
whose names I no longer remember. The vivacity and personal force
of Brown-Séquard, together with the simplicity, the innocent sincerity,
and the generosity of his character were particularly attractive to
young men; but he did not have the same influence upon men of age
and authority, who during that period of social constraint, looked upon
all innovations with a suspicion fortunately unknown to the present
generation.

The method of Brown-Séquard also excited some distrust among those
scientists who demand a didactic rigor for all demonstrations. He pro-
ceeded rather by intuitions, based upon the execution of incomplete
experiments, which appeared still more unsatisfactory because of the
extreme complexity of physivlogical problems. Hence arose many dif-
ficulties and doubts, which prevented for a long time the reputation of
our future colleague from obtaining that extent and solid foundation
which it has since acquired.

At this time he was engaged in researches upon the suprarenal cap-
sules and particularly upon the spinal cord which contradicted the
accepted views. ‘These gave him a certain notoriety among neurolo-
gists. I will again refer to them later.

Nevertheless, in 1856, the Academy of Sciences awarded him a prize.
The fees of the pupils in his laboratory provided him with some
resources, and the assistance of Rayer gave him some patients. As
his scientific reputation began to be reestablished, the nature of his
work gave him authority as a practitioner in the domain of nervous
diseases, that field so pregnant with doubts and with desperate hopes.
His practice began to assure him the advantages of a professional
career. It is well known that men esteem but little those scientific
discoveries that can not be turned to profit.

The researches of our colleague upon epilepsy, its etiology and treat-
ment, were especially celebrated. Always active, and always scatter-
ing his forces, he took up the most diverse projects. He went to Lon-
don, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin to exhibit his discoveries. His
authority was at this period greater, perhaps, in England than in
France; he was therefore divided between the two countries.

In 1888 he undertook at Paris the publication of the Journal de
Physiologie de Vhomme et des animaux, filled with his own contributions
during eight years.

In the month of May, in the same year, he was called to the Royal
College of Surgeons of England, and delivered there six lectures in
which he summarized his work on the nervous centers and gave his
ideas as to the reiations between the experimental researches and the
therapeutics of the nervous system. These lectures were published in
1860 in Philadelphia; that is to say, in the third of the intellectual
centers between which Brown-Séquard continually vibrated.
686 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

His experiments on epilepsy, its experimental production, and hered-
itary transmission, had especially struck the world of medicine and
established the reputation of Brown as a neuro-pathologist. There-
fore when there was founded in London a national hospital for epilep-
tics and paralytics, Brown was appointed, in 1859, its physician, a posi-
tion which he held for only afew years. It was there that he finally
assumed the character of the chief of a school, and students hastened
to attend his instruction. No salary was attached to this position of
physician to the hospital, but there were compensations both in the
way of honors and of money. In 1861 Brown was elected a member
of the Royal Society of London. At the same time he became, in Eng-
land, a consulting physician whose advice was very much sought, and
was in the way to make his fortune. His reputation extended at the
same time in France, in England, and the United States, everywhere
assured because of his devotion, liis activity, and his love for science.

He indeed preferred science for herself alone rather than for any
profit that could be gained by her aid. His patients wearied him and
his restless nature prevented him from remaining for a long time in the
same place or in the same position. As he became more confident of
the value of his discoveries, he became more firmly resolved to devote
himself to a purely scientific career aS soon as he could obtain the
necessary means of existence. This confidence had its base in his com-
plete and absolute respect for truth, in his slight regard for personal
considerations, and especially in his lack of pretensions to infallibility,
a too frequent weakness of some of the most celebrated geniuses.

In 1863 we find him again at Boston, professor of the pathology of
the nervous systemin Harvard University. It was his wife, a native of
Boston, who had persuaded him to this change. His name and teach-
ing had become popular in America. Happy, surrounded by friends,
sustained by the influence of Agassiz, who was then all powerful in the
American universities, Brown-Séquard seemed to have at last become
settled in his life and in his career. Alas! it was then, as often hap-
pens in our lives, that misfortune struck him a second blow in his dear-
est affections and disturbed his life and his thought—his wife died in
1867.

When he lost his mother, seized with a sort of irresistible impulse, he
quitted all and fled from Paris to Mauritius, seeking in an irreflective
physical agitation, if not consolation, at least distraction from the
domestic grief which overwhelmed him. Twenty years after, the death
of his wife, whom he had married in 1853, plunged him again into a
similarly disturbed condition. He socn quitted the place where his grief
had prostrated him, and in 1867 returned to France, resuming there
the source of a career that had been interrupted for nine years. ‘Thus
his life again recommenced, like a series of equal periodic cycles, in
which he continually repeated his triple part of experimenter, journalist,
and professor.
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 687

As an experimenter he occupied himself with researches ceaselessly
begun, laid aside, then taken up again and thoroughly carried out,
upon the physiology and pathology of the nervous system.

As a journalist he continued his Journal de Physiologie, abandoned
in 1864 for the Archives de Physiologie, published in collaboration
with Charcot and Vulpian. Scientific journalism always had for hima
particuiar attraction, in spite of the fatigues and disappointments of
the profession. He loved to write according to his own fancy as well
as to combine ingenious experiments. He stimulated his collaborators
and showed them original work to be done, applauding every novelty,
attentive to every mark of talent in young people. He worked much
and made others about him work.

As professor he also made his way and became established, thanks
to his personal popularity and to the influence of Agassiz and of Rayer,
now more powerful than ever as physician to the Emperor, and like-
wise supported by letters from Agassiz, who had great influence with
Napoleon III.

Rayer had made a breach in the long-established routine of the fac-
ulty and had undertaken a reform which failed for reasons it is unneces-
sary torecall here. He profited by his transitory authority to establish,
for the benefit of Brown-Séquard, a provisonal course of experimental
physiology in the Faculty of Medicine of Paris. Nothing more could
be done on the staff, as Brown was not a French citizen. He thus
reappeared as a professor where he had been a student in his youth.
Claude Bernard, Vulpian, and Brown had climbed up side by side, con-
stantly increasing in reputation and discoveries, the ladder of superior
instruction bv which we are elevated, little by little, to the first rank,
by force of merit and the opinion of our peers.

Brown-Séquard was not made for a didactic lecturer, nor was he
likely to carry away his auditors by bursts of borrowed eloquence.
But he excelled in displaying his own discoveries with a sincerity that
was not wanting in finesse. His researches on the hereditary trans-
mission of nervous lesions attracted the attention of both physicians
and naturalists. They were also in close relation with the theories of
Lamarck and Darwin on the gradual modification of organisms trans-
formed both by natural selection and the artificial conditions of exist-
ence.

But Brown could not bring himself to continue a fixed residence
anywhere. During the siege of Paris he was on a journey to the
United States, where he gave a series of lectures of which the proceeds
were intended for our wounded.

In 1872 there was another change. He married a second time, his
bride being an American, Mrs. Carlyle, of Cincinnati, by whom he had
a daughter, now the wife of a physician in Dublin. He gave up his
provisional chair in Paris at the moment when measures had been
taken to naturalize him, so that it could be made permanent, and estab-
688 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

lished himself at New York as a consulting physician. His marriages
were always one of the causes of the perpetual oscillations which pre-
vented him from taking root anywhere. He hastened, as was his inva-
riable method, to immediately found a medical journal, The Archives
of Scientific and Practical Medicine and Surgery. But few numbers
of this journal were published. It contained Brown’s first paper upon
inhibition and dynamogeny.

This new period of his life was not a happy one. Disturbed by
domestic troubles, finding nowhere about him the quiet necessary for
his scientific pursuits, tormented by a perpetual need for money which
he could not succeed in controlling, his tired faculties no longer suffi-
cing for the simultaneous efforts required for the enforced quiet of
scientific reflection and the struggle for material resources, Brown-
Séquard now passed some of the most painful years of his life.

On February 12, 1873, in a private letter to a friend, he wrote: “You
are young, and you have a numerous family; you have, as a compensa-
tion for your exile, the constant assurance of sincere affection. But I,
who am growing old with frightful rapidity, have near me only people
destitute of any tender feeling. Alas! what will become of me?”
“Your departure,” he again said, ‘‘is the greatest misfortune that has
happened to me for a long time. Not only were you a consolation to
me by your sincere attachment, you were also a living reminder of the
Society of Biology and of my Parisian friends. 1 can not endure the
idea of living here for the rest of my life. I am very unhappy. In
the future I intend,” he adds, not without a certain artlessness, ‘‘to
pass four or five weeks in England, three or four months in Paris, and
the winter here. I can make a living.”

He succeeded in doing this by means of medical consultations. The
publication of the journal had led to some losses of money; his lectures
brought but little profit. But nervous disorders abounded; in this
respect he seemed not to want for resources. ‘I arrived from Boston
to-day (April 20). I have never seen anything like the scenes that
occurred yesterday. From 7 o’clock in the morning to 8 o’clock in the
evening, when I refused to see any more sick, there was an uninter-
rupted flow of very patient patients. The last which I saw had been
waiting for their turn for five or six hours.”

At this time, too, the scientific career of Brown-Séquard appeared
to be settled by a definite appointment in America. I refer to a chair
of physiology, provided with a vast laboratory and forming part of a
great scientific establishment that Agassiz had organized with the aid
of a generous patron. ‘The matter should be reported in detail, as it is
characteristic of the state of science in the United States.

“You know about Agassiz Island (on the north side of Long Island),”
writes Brown to a friend. ‘It is about as large as the various public
parks of London put together; if is very fertile, and is worth, together
with the houses that have been built upon it, $100,000. Mr. Anderson,
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 689

who gave this island to Agassiz, has just authorized him to expend upon
it the whole of a capital of $50,000. Agassiz has asked me the direct
question: ‘‘ What will you take per year to carry on the chair of experi-
mental physiology that I propose to found? Include in this all your
expenses, for I wish you to give up the practice of medicine.” This was
even beyond the dreams of Brown-Séquard, and to crown it he adds:
‘¢ Agassiz is soon going to have thousands of rabbits, guinea pigs,
birds, pigs, cats, dogs, and living cold-blooded animals, all of which
he will put at the disposal of experimenters. Why am I not again 30
years old!”

But this ideal dream of the physiologist was not to be realized.
Agassiz fell sick, and the propositions that he had made to Brown came
to nothing. Institutions that depend on the good will of a single per-
son are subject to the same vicissitudes as his life or his mental condi-
tion. Those only rest on a solid foundation that have the support of
the State, or, at least, that of a great organization controlling unin-
cumbered capital. We have been informed by several European scien-
tists who have settled in America that the regular salaries are small
when we take into account the increased cost of living, and the situa-
tions are not always permanent, as in old Europe. If donors are easily
found to encourage a scientific project, continual support is more rare
and often dependent upon the good will of someone, or upon the legis-
lative assemblies, which regulate and change it every year.

In the month of July, 1873, Brown-Séquard was again in Europe, at
Brighton, sick, exhausted both by work and by domestic troubles. ‘TI
am in the depths of despair; life is odious to me. It is possible that I
will never return to America.” In October, however, he was again in
New York, always a prey to the most sinister foreboding. ‘I havea
constant headache. I think that I am fatally affected.” Annoyances
of all kinds and money embarrassments increased; his patients did not
pay him, and he adds: ‘‘They owe me nearly $4,700; I would be bank-
rupt if an illness. should keep me for a month without making any-
thing.” His impressionable nature was still more disturbed by his
domestic troubles than by his pecuniary embarrassments. ‘Despair
and uncertainty; these are my lot. What would I not give to have you
with me. I have so much need of your sympathy and assistance. I
can rely no longer on my own health. I fear that I may die suddenly,
or fall sick, good for nothing—I am afraid I have a serious cerebral
affection. If you have more confidence than I in my health, come to
ine as soon as possible. As soon as I have no longer any depressing
influence near me everything becomes easy. My wife is always very
sick; as for myself, lam exhausted.” But his generous feelings awaken
at the touch of science. ‘The fact is decisive,” he answers a corre-
spondent, who had written him concerning an observation, “it belongs
to you; pull the string and you will then pass to another.”

In 1874 he lost his second wife, whose conduct had been a source of

690 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

perpetual torment to him. But he was still disturbed concerning the
career of his son. It was at this time that he refused a chair in the
University of Glasgow, because of the climate. He repaired to New
York, to Chester, to Paris, and in 1875 again returned to New York,
always involved in financial difficulties. ‘‘I have the means for living
just nine months, after which there is absolutely nothing. I must once
for all put myself in a position to earn something for my old age,
which is rapidly coming on.”

The years 1874 and 1875 were thus passed in agitations of all kinds—
illness, melancholy, and lamentations—without his being able to decide
what todo. He hesitated between Glasgow, Geneva, Paris, and New
York. ‘To choose is very perplexing; there are difficulties every-
where.” In the midst of all this he gave lectures on amaurosis and
hemianesthesia; a scientific discussion with Charcot in the Society of
Biology excited him greatly. Another trait of character may be men-
tioned: In 1876 he visited in Paris, as a consulting physician, Dom
Pedro, whose affable and open countenance we all remember. Yet
Brown-Séquard did not feel entirely satisfied. He saw that sovereigns
do not like to be treated on terms of equality; one can always feel the
claw under the velvet foot of the leopard.

In 1877 he married a third time, espousing the widow of Doherty,
the painter. This wife died in 1894, a few months before him. It was
at the time of this marriage that he accepted for a while a chair of
physiology in the University of Geneva, but circumstances prevented
him from ever occupying it. He had, however, reached the end of his
life of wandering and agitation and was about to find among us, in a
purely scientific situation of the very first rank, a rest for his declining
years, surrounded by honors to which his long career entitled him. He
had always been dominated by an ardent zeal for intellectual matters,
and he had not hesitated to sacrifice to them the advantages, even
though well earned, which belong to a purely professional career.

Brown-Séquard was in New York, in 1878, when he heard of the death
of Claude Bernard, who was snatched away after a few weeks’ illness
by an affection of the kidneys. Brown immediately proceeded to Paris
to apply for the position. No ehair could suit better this original mind
than that which had been occupied by Magendie and Claude Bernard,
nor could any teaching be better adapted to him than that in the
College of France, a teaching essentially personal and in which each
teacher gives out his own ideas and exhibits his own work at the very
moment he has completed.it, whether in his study or in his laboratory,
without any care for a didactic course, following no set programme,
not subject to the fatigue of examinations which are at once the evi-
dence of a course and the proof of capacity of candidates for diplomas.
This way of considering teaching as a personal matter suited perfectly
the vivacious mind of Brown-Séquard, characterized by good qualities
and by imperfections, but, above all, original and inventive. He was,
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 691

therefore, warmly welcomed by the assembly of professors of the col-
lege and by the section of the academy, by whom he was presented
to the minister. But he had first to go through the formalities of
naturalization, which was indispensable to a titular professor.

So Brown-Séquard finally settled in France, and never again re-
crossed that ocean which he had traversed so many times. He found
among us that regular support that was necessary for the carrying
on of his work. He ceased to be distracted between the struggle for
existence, which must be the care of every man, and the necessity for
_ searching for the truth, which was his individual predilection. Hitherto
he had oscillated between the two without being able to resolve to live
with such singleness of purpose as would have freed him both from
perplexities and weakness in his business affairs and in his scientific
work. He henceforth, for sixteen years, lived happily and tranquilly,
at least as much so as his ever.active nature would permit.

His activity did not, indeed, decrease.

As early as 1875, at the time when he was making his researches
upon inhibition, he touched upon a new subject which he was destined
to develop more as the time went on; this was the subject of internal
secretions and their physiological significance. In 1881 the Academy
awarded him the Lacaze prize; in 1885 the great biennial prize. In
18386 he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences in the sec-
tion of medicine. He succeeded Vulpian as he had succeeded Claude
Bernard in the College of France. Both had been for a quarter of a
century his colleagues in the Society of Biology. They had been pres-
idents of that society. Brown-Séquard also became one in his turn, in
the place of Paul Bert, who was younger, but who yet died before him.

He there trained pupils who have since made their mark, and he had for
his successor our colleague, d’Arsonval, who served his apprenticeship
at the College of France under Claude Bernard and Brown-Séquard,
and who took, in his turn, a special flight of his own, giving to his
teaching an originality no less striking. So it is that in life we are
called to replace successively the friends of our youth and more mature
age. We may be counted happy if, during the long course of our
existence, our affections have not been chilled or blasted by rivalries,
or even OF divergencies, at first inappreciable, which eins ally sepa-
rate characters and interests.

In 1894 Brown-Séquard lost his third companion, to whom he had
been tenderly attached for eighteen years. Although time had calmed
the expression of his feelings, formerly so violent, still it had not chilled
his heart. This last stroke was too much for him—he could not bear
it. ‘‘l can work no more,” he said, ‘all is finished.” He returned
from Nice to Paris in March, and expired on the Ist of April. At the
International Congress at Rome, which was in session at that time, our
colleague, Bouchard, with tears in his eyes, read to the section of phys-
iology the dispatch announcing the death of the illustrious scientist.
692 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

The entire assembly rose, animated by feelings of respect and sorrow.
It sent a telegram of condolence to the Academy of Sciences at Paris—
a last homage to the life that was wholly devoted to disinterested
research for truth.

The scientific work of Brown-Séquard is considerable in amount and
extends to nearly all branches of physiology, these being traversed in
turn by this indefatigable explorer.

This work bears the stamp of the personality of the author. It is of
an intuitive character, governed by his imagination, quick to perceive
the original side of new problems and to attack old problems in an
unexpected way. But he did not stick long to any point; he was not
one of those who: study for a long time with minute attention a par-
ticular fact under all conditions until they have a complete knowledge
of it. Constantly drawn in divers directions by an inexhaustible
curiosity, he had no time to analyze in an extended and rigorous man-
ner the facts he had just discovered. He was in too much of a hurry
to get on and had to return to his work again and again and repeat his
imperfectly finished studies and demonstrations, for, though he often
changed the object of his researches, they were always present in his
mind, and he was always seeking to carry them further, never hesi-
tating to acknowledge former errors. This is a phenomenon that has
often been noted in the history of science; there is a certain opposition,
or, rather, contrast, often seen between the inventive genius who discovers
new facts and the precise mind that gives to them the final sanction of
exact demonstration. These two kinds of minds are equally necessary
and supplement each other reciprocally, without there being, however,
any exact line of demarcation between the scientists who possess
them. Thus Brown-Séquard, who may be said to be an inventor rather
than a demonstrator, once gave at London a lecture (called the Croonian
lecture) on the life of the muscles, a lecture cited by John Stuart
Mills in his Treatise on Logic as a perfect example of the employ-
ment of the four scientific methods.

The labors of Brown-Séquard were directed dabaciall and OHI
to the elucidation of the necessarily related subjects, the physiology
and pathology of the nervous system. During the latter years of his
life he added to it a new investigation, equally important, which has
opened surprising vistas in medicine—that of internal secretions and
their normal office in the healthy human organism, as well as their
therapeutic effect upon the organism when diseased.

In the early part of his career, in 1846, he began the study of the
spinal cord as the transmitting agent of sensory impressions and motor
impulses. He attacked a problem which seemed at that time already
solved by the discovery of two kinds of nerve roots taking origin in
the spinal cord—the motor roots and the sensory roots. Charles Bell
had also extended that distinction to the columns of the cord itself.
THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 693

The sensory transmission was thought to take place exclusively by the
posterior columns, motor transmission by the anterior columns.

This was a very simple and clear doctrine, that appeared to be well
established. But in the sciences, especially in these that relate to life,
well-defined limitations of this kind are not often found. Brown-
Séquard reopened the whole question by his experiments, especially by
Showing that the transmission of sensory impressions may take place
through the gray matter of the cord quite as well as or better than by
the posterior column.

At the same time he investigated another idea that had been
casually referred to by the brothers Weber—that of inhibition; to
this Brown-Séquard returned again and again during thirty years,
giving to it immense developments.

The statements of Brown-Séquard were at first received with some
distrust, as often happens with those who oppose generally accepted
ideas and dominant schools. The official professors of the universities
often have their course of instruction fixed and do not like to have the
trouble of changing their teaching. Brown finally triumphed, for he
pursued his experiments without relaxation, giving them increasing
variety and attraction of form. He found that a transverse section of
one-half of the cord caused a paralysis of movement on the same side
and a paralysis of sensation on the opposite side in regions which receive
their nerves from the part of the cord situated above the section. This
is what Brown ealls a unilateral paralysis. The experimental fact
corresponded with various pathological observations made on man and
was of use in diagnosing certain lesions of the spinal cord.

This was not all. The reflex power of the cord, almost abrogated at
the moment it is separated from the brain, afterwards gradually
increases and the section of the posterior columns is followed by
hyperesthesia. In a report read on the 21st of July, 1885, to the
Society of Biology, Broca confirmed the exactitude of these experiments,
causing a profound revolution in the doctrine of Bell, The discussion
continued, none the less heated and active, from 1850 to 1860, without,
however, causing Brown, whoever might contradict him, to have resort
to those personalities which too often envenom scientific discussions.

A sunilar question of this sort, yet more complex, separated Brown-
Séquard and Charcot in 1874. This was that of the central localiza-
_ tion of functions. The paradoxical mind of Brown Séquard was always
ready to raise objections to accepted theories. He gave three lectures
- to the Royal College of Physicians in London to show that there is no
relation between a given cerebral lesion and a concomitant paralysis.
The question is indeed a complex one, the simple relations which seem
so evident a priori being often contradicted by certain secondary effects
of a reflex nature, in which intervene some inhibitory symptoms. A
local lesion of the cord or brain may thus cause congestions and hemor-
694 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

rhages in distant organs, or, indeed, cedemas and anemias; it may
even disturb or increase the nutrition of those organs; suspend or
exaggerate their secretions. These effects may also be produced either
on the opposite side from the injured or irritated nerve or on the same
side. Conversely, the lesion or irritation of a principal nerve may
produce, either at once or after a considerable time, disorders in the
encephalic centers. For example, a section of the sciatic nerve in-
creases the irritability of one-half of the nervous system and decreases
that of the other half. In this kind of phenomena it may be that the
same symptom may result from a lesion of different organs. And,
inversely, the real efficient cause, the pathological primum movens can
not be ascertained without a delicate and complete analysis of the
phenomena. It may be remarked here that the excitability of the
sensory or motor nerves that serve as intermediaries for such effects
is independent of their special aptitude for the conduction of sensory
impressions or motor impulses.

The assembling and interpretation of these phenomena constitute a
special branch of physiology developed by Brown-Séquard, and com-
prised under the names dynamogeny and inhibition. It is an entirely
new doctrine, which he opposed to that of cerebral localization. It
concerns not only physiology but psychology itself; that is to say, the
domain of conduct and intelligence which has its seat in the brain.
These are indeed verities of fact independent of any metaphysical
theory. Yet, we hasten to add, the conclusions of Brown-Séquard
-were too absolute. If the facts that he cited did not seem doubtful,
he at least exaggerated them by a too wide generalization. He had,
however, none the less, the merit of having stated this problem and
shown its full extent.

There are few phenomena in which inhibition exerts a more striking
influence than in those which result from the action of the vaso-motor
nerves. As early as 1851 Claude Bernard had observed the local rises
of temperature and increased activity of the circulation that follows a
section of the cervical sympathetic nerve. Conversely, Brown dis-
covered that a stimulation of that nerve contracts the same vessels
that its section dilates and reduces the temperature of that region
which shows a rise when the nerve is cut. By an analogous correla-
tion, if we plunge one hand in water, a thermometer placed in tle
other hand shows a decrease in temperature.

The development of these ideas may be earried still further, and
thus Brown was led to the most remarkable discoveries, for instance,
to the experimental production of epilepsy and the hereditary trans-
missions of lesions by whose aid he was able to produce that malady.
His experiments went back, indeed, to 1852-53. They were the imme-
diate result of his investigations upon inhibition, and he carried them
or for a quarter of a century. He operated preferably on guinea pigs,
animals possessed of considerable vitality and easily propagated. He

THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD. 695

was therefore always surrounded at his various residences by a collec-
tion of these little animals, and was always ready to show to visiting
scientists experiments confirming his assertions.

The discoveries I have just sketched all relate to the study of the
nervous system. If they do not form a single, methodical whole, they:
at least show an evident dependence and connection with each other.
But Brown-Séquard also attacked other problems, some of which have
contributed in no small degree to popularize his reputation. I will
not speak here of his experiments upon asphyxia, upon red and dark
blood, upon the exciting effect of carbonic acid, and the injurious effect
of expired air, distinct from those of carbonic acid, ete. These obser-
vations were isolated, or nearly so. But we would leave an important
gap in the biography of our friend if we did not give some space to
his work and ideas concerning internal secretions.

Among the multiple glandular organs which are found in the human
economy, the greater part produce liquids which can flow out through
visible channels. The function of the glands is made evident by this
means, and that of their secretions is also manifest, at least in a general
way. Still, there are some whose use and even existence have remained
obscure up to a recent period. Such are the spleen, the suprarenal
capsules, the thyroid body, and others that might be mentioned. In
1856 Brown-Séquard took up the study of these functions. He began
with the suprarenal capsules, incited to work in this direction by the
existence of certain diseases of origin unexplained, except, indeed,
that they coexisted with a lesion of the suprarenal capsules. Brown
discovered that the extirpation of these glands in an animal was always
followed by the death of the animal. This he attributed to the exist-
ence of some internal secretion of these organs, a secretion continually
discharged into the blood and necessary for life. But he went no
further at this time, and did not take the subject up again until twenty
years later, in 1889.

This time he tried another gland and examined the physiological
action of the testicular fluids, being led by divers reasons to suppose
that those fluids contained certain substances which they also dis-
charged into the blood and which tended to exalt the power of the
nervous system and to keep up the vital energies. He did not hesitate
to extract these fluids from the organs of animals and to make upon
himself, by means of hypodermic injections, certain trials of them which
appeared decisive. He concluded that he had discovered a new thera-
peutic method. The subject required delicate manipulation, not only
because of the extraordinary precautions required for this kind of inoc-
ulations, but of charlatanism, always ready to possess itself of new
curative procedures. Brown-Séquard did not cease to protest against
the abuse by which his name was made to cover industrial enterprises,
But he persisted in the idea and it developed with increasing import-
ance, until it now constitutes an entire new method, designated under
696 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF BROWN-SEQUARD.

the name of opotherapy, or treatment by organic extracts. Extracts
from the pancreas, the liver, the suprarenal capsules, the spinal cord,
the ovary, the prostate, the testicle, tbe thyroid gland, have thus been
successively used in therapeutics with varying degrees of success.

The study of the thyroid extract especially has led scientists to the
most unmistakable results.

This subject has not failed to extend itself still further. In fact, the
preparation and effects of these various extracts have come to be con-
founded with serotherapy or the treatment by serums, modified for the
purpose of combating diphtheria and various other diseases. The old
inoculation of the virus of smallpox and the vaccination of Jenner have
been brought under the same category of ideas. But it is beyond the
limits of the present notice to try to state, even in a summary manner,
the developments, every day more extensive, of the new doctrines and
therapeutic methods. Under their influence the theory of germs is
itself undergoing profound modifications, which tend to change the
views which were at first held. Not only are the effeets produced by
microbes upon living organisms referred more and more to the domain
of chemistry, and considered as independent of life, but the real agents
that cause these phenomena are no longer supposed to be the microbes
themselves. According to the new doctrine it is not the microbe that
acts by virtue of its own life, carried on either with or without the
assistance of air, in producing the phenomena of disease or of fermen-
tation; but, as I formerly thought, if 1 may be permitted to cite
myself, the real agents of all these phenomena are chemical agents,
properly so-called, secreted by the microbes, yet distinct from them.
These are immediate definite principles belonging to the class of the
alkalis or the amides, that act either as toxines or antitoxines, accord-
ing to circumstances. i

In this way there tends to be formed an entirely new system of phys-
iology and of practical treatment of disease, a system which recalls in
some respects, and in certain of its methods, the primitive conceptions
and even the superstitions of the early days of medicine. We certainly
do not wish to fetter ourselves with the formulas of such a system any
more than with those of the old ideas concerning the spiritual cause of
disease and the vitality of miasms, or with those of the recent theories
of the necessary and universal influence of microbes in pathology.
Modern science does not become petrified in any dogmatism; but its
incessant evolution is regulated by the very succession of discoveries
accomplished according to its methods. Now, it is certain that the
study of the internal function of glandular cells and that of the secre-
tions of microbes has become to-day the point of departure for an
entirely new set of therapeutic procedures; unknown ways have been
opened by these discoveries for physiology and the medical sciences. To
3rown-Séquard will be given the glory of having been one of the con-
querors in this new domain. :
