REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1948

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the
fiscal year ended. June 30, 1943. The first 12 pages contain a sum-
mary account of the affairs of the Institution; it will be noted that
many activities usually included in this section are missing, wartime
conditions having forced their suspension. Appendixes 1 to 10 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the In-
ternational Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astro-
physical Observatory, which now includes the divisions of astro-
physical research and radiation and organisms, the Smithsonian
library, and of the publications issued under the direction of the
Institution. On page 89 is the financial report of the executive com-
mittee of the Board of Regents.

THE SMITHSONIAN IN WARTIME

At the close of the fiscal year, 83 employees of the Institution had
joined the armed forces and 5 had left to serve in special capacities
in the various war agencies. Those leaving included 10 members
of the scientific staff. Many of those remaining at the Institution
devoted 100 percent of their time to war projects assigned by the
Army, Navy, or war agencies, and all other staff members were oc-
cupied in varying degree with such projects, depending on the extent
to which their special knowledge was in demand. In short, all per-
sonnel and facilities of the Institution and its branches were made
available and were extensively used in the prosecution of the war.

The Institution’s normal activities were kept alive to the extent of
continuing observations the cessation of which would leave perma-
nent gaps in records essential to future investigations, and of main-
taining and caring for the National collections. All other research

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

and exploration projects not necessary for the orderly resumption
of cultural activities after the war have been suspended for the dura-
tion with one exception, namely, those activities related to a closer
cultural cooperation with the other American republics. Such co-
operation is of vital importance not only for better relations between
neighboring countries in the present time of emergency, but also as
a permanent program after the war. The Institution is particularly
well fitted to take part in such a program because of its many years
of friendly contact with the scientists and scientific institutions of
the other American republics.

Thus the wartime policy of the Institution has been to use all its
resources to aid in winning the war, while continuing insofar as
possible the recording and publishing of essential scientific observa-
tions and such curatorial work as is necessary for the proper care
of the National collections.

The Smithsonian War Committee, appointed by me early in 1942,
has continued to meet regularly with the aim of originating or con-
sidering plans to increase the Smithsonian’s contributions to the war
effort. The Committee has made many recommendations during the
year, most of which I have approved and put into effect. Several
war projects have also come to the Institution through my own con-
tacts with Army and Navy officials or through contacts made by
other Smithsonian staff members.

It seems desirable to present here, as a record of the Institution’s
part in the war, a brief statement of such of its wartime activities
as can be made public. As regards the year’s publications, most of
which related to the war or to the other American republics, a state-
ment will be found farther on in this report under the heading
“Publications.” It will be seen that much of the Institution’s con-
tribution is of an indirect nature, for the obvious reason that an
organization can only undertake work for which its staff has the
requisite training and experience. In total war, however, accurate
knowledge of obscure peoples and places and other subjects chiefly
of academic interest in normal times suddenly becomes of vital im-
portance to the Army and Navy. In furnishing some of this infor-
mation, urgently needed and often hard to get, lies the Institution’s
major contribution.

Strategic information to war agencies.—As stated, the Institution’s
greatest usefulness, as in the case of other similar organizations,
derived from the specialized knowledge of its scientific staff, which
provided the answers to innumerable urgent questions continually
facing the Army, Navy, and war agencies. More than a thousand
recorded inquiries had been answered up to the close of the fiscal
year, and probably as many more for one reason or another were
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

not included in the record. The great majority of these were not
simple questions that could be answered on the spot, but were of
such a nature that considerable time was required to provide a com-
plete answer. Many inquiries involved a series of conferences or
the writing of extended illustrated reports. A list of selected ex-
amples tabulated by the War Committee shows not only the very
wide range of these questions, but also the extent to which modern
total war depends on scientific knowledge. The Institution was in
a peculiarly favorable position to render this type of service because
of its location in Washington, the headquarters also of the War and
Navy Departments and most of the war agencies. It had the further
advantage of being closely associated with the Ethnogeographic
Board, discussed in the next paragraph.

Ethnogeographic Board.—Early in the fiscal year the Institution
joined with the American Council of Learned Societies, the Social
Science Research Council, and the National Research Council in
sponsoring the Ethnogeographic Board, a nongovernmental agency
whose function is to act as a clearinghouse between the above insti-
tutions and other scientific and educational organizations throughout
the country, and the Army,.Navy, and war agencies within the
Government. The Director of the Board is Dr. William Duncan
Strong, formerly of the Smithsonian Bureau of American Ethnology
and at present on leave from Columbia University. The offices of
the Board are in the Smithsonian building, a portion of its operating
costs have been defrayed by the Institution, and three members of
the scientific staff of the Bureau of American Ethnology have been
detailed to assist the Director of the Board. The War and Navy
Departments assigned liaison officers, and under the energetic leader-
ship of Dr. Strong the Board has become the focal point for the
finding of the best sources of strategic information in the fields of
science within its scope.

War research projects—A number of research and consultation
projects have come to the Institution through the Ethnogeographic
Board, the Smithsonian War Committee, and contacts of various
officials of the Institution. As these were all of a strictly confiden-
tial character, nothing can be said about them except that they were
concerned with many different branches of science, including an-
thropology, biology, geology, physics, and meteorology. These proj-
ects occupied practically the entire time of the instrument and
mechanical shops of the Astrophysical Observatory, the division of
radiation and organisms, and the division of engineering, as well
as the time of numerous members of the scientific staff.

Inter-American cooperation.—F or many years the Institution has
been in close contact with scientists and cultural organizations in the
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

other American republics through its anthropological, zoological, and
botanical explorations and field work in that area and through the
wide exchange of its publications for those of scientific institutions of
Mexico and South and Central America. Thus the Institution has
been in an excellent position to undertake several major projects de-
signed to improve cultural relations with our neighboring countries
to the south. Under the direction of Dr. Julian H. Steward, of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, a Handbook of the Indians of South
America has been brought practically to completion and is expected
to be published during the coming year as a Bulletin of the Bureau.
This comprehensive publication, which will form four volumes of
text and two of bibliography, is a truly cooperative undertaking,
for 50 percent of the contributors are scientists in the other American
republics. Also on the initiative of Dr. Steward, and with Dr. Ralph
L. Beals as temporary director, an Inter-American Society of Geog-
raphy and Anthropology has been organized, with membership open
to scientists anywhere in the hemisphere. More than 700 members
have already been enrolled from nearly all countries on both con-
tinents. A journal with articles in English, Spanish, and Portuguese
will record the activities of the Society. The first part of a “Checklist
of the Coleopterous Insects of Mexico, Central America, the West
Indies, and South America,” prepared under the direction of Dr. R. E.
Blackwelder, is now in press as a Bulletin of the National Museum. A
long-needed tool for entomologists, this check list will be used for
years to come by scientists of the entire hemisphere. A number of
Smithsonian scientists have visited other American republics during
the year in the interest of closer professional collaboration.

Other wartime activities—The new series of publications, Smith-
sonian War Background Studies, will be described in detail in an-
other place. I will say here only that the series is filling a real need
for authentic information on the less well-known peoples and regions
involved in the war, and the demand for the books was so great that
editions had to be increased progressively from 3,500 to 8,000 copies.
In addition both the Army and Navy ordered editions of from 1,000
to 10,000 copies of several of the papers for the use of service personnel.

One of the first recommendations of the Smithsonian War Com-
mittee was for a roster of the technical and geographical knowledge
of the Institution’s staff. The roster has been at the service of the
Ethnogeographic Board and has been of material aid in enabling
the Army, Navy, and war agencies to locate quickly the specialist or
the knowledge they needed.

Under the direction of the Smithsonian library, a file of illustra-
tions of strategic areas appearing in Smithsonian publications and in
the more obscure technical journals has been completed and made avail-
able to war agencies. A brief description of the resources of the Smith-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

sonian library of nearly a million volumes has been distributed to key
personnel.

For the benefit of members of the armed forces, the Museum build-
ings have been kept open all day Sunday. A set of six colored post
cards showing striking Museum exhibits was given to servicemen
entering the Arts and Industries building, where facilities for writing
and mailing the cards were made available. More than 300,000 cards
were given during the year. A small leaflet welcoming service men
and women to the Institution was also made available; in it is de-
scribed the part played by Army and Navy personnel in the past in
building up the National collections. At the close of the year a col-
lector’s manual for members of the armed forces was in preparation,
and a plan was being worked out to provide docents for Museum tours
for service personnel.

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES
OF THE INSTITUTION

National Musewm.—Throughout the year members of the scientific
staff have been occupied with furnishing technical information and
carrying on research connected with the conduct of the war. The
Museum buildings have been kept open all day Sundays for the
benefit of service men and women. The Museum collections were in-
creased by 230,231 specimens, bringing the total number of catalog
entries to 17,808,471. Outstanding among the new accessions were the
following: In anthropology, 1,443 specimens of pottery and figurine
fragments from various localities in the United States and Mexico, a
ceremonial mace of serpentine from Maré, Loyalty Islands, and
Weapons, armor, and musical instruments from the Philippines; in
biology, a complete skeleton of the African bush elephant, birds from
New Guinea and Eritrea, the latter a hitherto unrepresented locality,
two large collections of fishes—one comprising more than 50,000
specimens transferred from the Fish and Wildlife Service, the other
nearly 35,000 specimens collected in Venezuela by the curator of fishes,
and the Frank C. Baker collection of mollusks, comprising 10,000 spec-
imens, one of the important mollusk collections of North America; in
geology, the John W. Langsdale collection of minerals, a 316-carat star
sapphire and a 54-carat blue Brazilian topaz, five volumes containing
1,500 photomicrographs of the structure in meteoric irons, presented
by Dr. Stuart H. Perry, associate in mineralogy, and a collection
of 2,000 Triassic fossils from Nevada; in engineering and industries,
an original truss of an iron railroad bridge built in America in 1845,
two sets of aircraft identification models used by our armed forces,
and a collection of specimens to be used as an exhibit of alternates and
substitutes developed recently to cope with shortages of war materials;
in history, the finest accession of firearms, swords, and daggers received

by the Museum in recent years, the gift of Ralph G. Packard. The
few expeditions that were in the field during the year were concerned
with matters connected with the conduct of the war or were the result
of pre-war commitments. Because of travel difficulties, the number of
visitors dropped to 1,355,269 as compared with slightly over 2,000,000
in the previous year. A definite count showed that servicemen aver-
aged 25 to 35 percent of the total number of visitors. The Museum
published its Annual Report, 3 Bulletins, 1 Contribution from the
National Herbarium, and 25 Proceedings papers. Staff changes in-
cluded the death of Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of the
department of biology, and the appointment of Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt,
curator of the division of marine invertebrates, to succeed him. Nu-
merous members of the staff were furloughed for military and naval
duty.

National Gallery of Art.—The total attendance at the Gallery for
the year was 1,508,081, a daily average of 4,182 of whom more than
one-fourth were service men and women. Special activities for mem-
bers of the armed forces have included Sunday evening musical con-
certs, Sunday night suppers for servicemen, and the Servicemen’s
Room, which has furnished a place of relaxation for many men in the
service. Among the outstanding acquisitions of the year were a col-
lection of 23 paintings from Chester Dale; the Widener collection of
paintings, sculpture, and other objects of art, one of the greatest
donations ever made to any Museum; and the famous Rosenwald col-
lection of prints, numbering over 6,500 items. A number of special
exhibitions were held during the year, including an exhibition of
Chilean contemporary art, the Thomas Jefferson Bicentennial exhibi-
tion, and an exhibition sponsored by Life magazine of 125 paintings by
leading American artists, in cooperation with the War Department,
in United States battle zones. There were printed during the year a
check list of the Widener collection, a new general information
pamphlet, a catalog, a portfolio of colored reproductions, and nine
pamphlets dealing with the Gallery and its collections. The daily
Gallery tours of the collection have been supplemented by tours for
service men and women on Saturdays. A motion picture on the
National Gallery of Art was completed in cooperation with the Office
of Strategic Services; this will be widely circulated among educa-
tional institutions and the general public.

National Collection of Fine Arts.——Because of crowded conditions
in Washington the annual meeting of the Smithsonian Art Com-
mission was not held, and proffered gifts of works of art are being
held by the National Collection of Fine Arts to be passed upon at the
next meeting of the Commission. Two members of the Commission
died during the year: John E. Lodge, chairman of the subcommittee
on Oriental art, and Charles L. Borie, chairman of the Commission
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

since 1935. Fourteen miniatures were acquired through the Catherine
Walden Myer fund. Five paintings were purchased under the Henry
Ward Ranger bequest; by the terms of the bequest these are as-
signed to various art institutions and under certain conditions are
prospective additions to the National Collection of Fine Arts. Seven
special exhibitions were held, as follows: Oil paintings, water colors,
and pastels by Seforita Carmen Madrigal Nieto, of Costa Rica; oil
paintings by Senorita Pachita Crespi, of Costa Rica; oil paintings
by Frank C. Kirk, of New York; miniatures by members of the
Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters; oil paintings and designs
by Simon Lissim, of New York; water colors by Leonora Quarterman,
of Savannah, Ga.; oil paintings by Walter King Stone, of Ithaca, N. Y.

Freer Gallery of Art-—Additions to the collections included Chinese
bronze, Persian gold, Persian and Indian paintings, Chinese porce-
lain, and Chinese and Persian pottery. Besides the regular curatorial
work, the staff devoted much of its time to supplying information to
war agencies and to translating matter from Chinese and Japanese
sources, amounting to hundreds of typewritten pages. In addition,
Chinese and Japanese names on maps of war areas were identified and
transliterated to the number of more than 5,000. The Director gave
a series of lectures to Washington school teachers on Chinese culture
as reflected in the fine arts in furtherance of a plan to disseminate
knowledge of China in the public schools. Visitors to the gallery
numbered 53,769 for the year, and 12 groups were given docent service
or instruction in the study room. John Ellerton Lodge, Director of
the Freer Gallery from its beginning in 1920, died on December 29,
1942. Under Mr. Lodge’s wise administration was developed the
work of the Gallery in the study and the acquisition of Oriental fine
arts. He was succeeded as Director by Archibald G. Wenley, asso-
ciate in research at the Gallery.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Activities concerned with the
other American republics have been emphasized during the year, and
a large part of the time of the staff has been devoted to war projects.
Several members have worked nearly full time in cooperation with
the Ethnogeographic Board in preparing strategic information for
the Army, Navy, and war agencies. M. W. Stirling, Chief, directed
the fifth National Geographic-Smithsonian archeological expedition
to southern Mexico. Excavations at the site of La Venta in southern
Tabasco resulted in the discovery of construction details of the stone-
fenced enclosure, one of the central features of the site. Three rich
burials contained jade offerings of high quality. Dr. J. R. Swanton
completed the proofreading of his 850-page bulletin entitled “The
Indians of the Southeastern United States,” and did further work
on the now extinct language of the Timucua Indians of Florida.
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

Dr. J. P. Harrington investigated the Chilcotin languages of north-
ern California, and later in the year devoted his time to the prepa-
ration of material for the linguistic section of the Handbook of
South American Indians. Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, Jr., investigated
a site in eastern Wyoming from which more than 70 projectile points
of the Yuma type were recovered. Dr. Roberts devoted the last two-
thirds of the year to the preparation of a series of “survival” arti-
cles from data furnished by members of the Smithsonian staff. These
articles were made available to the armed forces through the Ethno-
geographic Board. Dr. J. H. Steward continued his work as editor
of the Handbook of South American Indians, assisted by Dr. Alfred
Métraux of the Bureau staff. The Handbook, which will consist of
four volumes of text and two of bibliography, was three-fourths com-
pleted at the close of the year. Dr. H. B. Collins, Jr., was engaged
in furnishing regional and other information to the armed services,
mostly in connection with the Ethnogeographic Board. Dr. W. N.
Fenton devoted most of his time to projects received by the Ethno-
geographic Board from the armed services, and continued to serve
as a member of the Smithsonian War Committee. Miss Frances
Densmore completed two large manuscripts on Indian music. The
Bureau published its Annual Report and three Bulletins. The
Bureau library has been much in use as a source of material for the
Kthnogeographic Board and the war agencies.

International Exchanges.——The International Exchange Service is
the official United States agency for the interchange of governmental
and scientific publications between this country and all other coun-
tries of the world. During the year the Service handled a total of
513,460 packages of publications with a total weight of 248,648
pounds. Although the war prevents shipments to many foreign coun-
tries, nevertheless consignments went forward during the year to
all countries in the Western Hemisphere and to a number in the
Eastern Hemisphere, namely, Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
Republic of Ireland, Portugal, the U.S.S.R., Union of South Africa,
India, Australia, and New Zealand. Packages which cannot be for-
warded during the war are held for later delivery. Because of the
limited space at the Institution, arrangements were made to store
the large accumulation of such material at the Library of Congress.
In April 1942 the Office of Censorship placed a ban on the sending
abroad of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register; in
February 19438 this ban was lifted, and the Record and Register were
again forwarded to those countries that could be reached.

National Zoological Park.—By reducing maintenance work to the
absolute minimum, it has been possible to carry on the primary func-
tion of the Zoo, the exhibition of a wide variety of animal life in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

best possible condition, in spite of the increasing shortages of man-
power, food, and materials. The functioning of the Zoo is thought
to be particularly important in wartime because it provides free
recreation and enjoyment for thousands of war workers and members
of the armed forces. Although automobile traffic to the Zoo prac-
tically ceased, nevertheless a greatly increased number of visitors
walked or came by bus or streetcar. The total number of visitors for
the year was 1,974,500. Officials of the Zoo have furnished much
information regarding animals to the War and Navy Departments,
other Government agencies, and medical groups. Conditions have
precluded expeditions by the Zoo for the collection of animals, and
few animals are offered for sale by dealers. New specimens, there-
fore, have come mainly through gift and exchange. In addition, 101
mammals were born and 83 birds hatched at the Zoo during the year.
Despite adverse conditions, six species never before in the collection
were obtained; these included a specimen of the rarely exhibited
spectacled bear of the northern Andes and a white starling from
Java, also rare in captivity. At the close of the year the collection
contained 2,485 animals representing 684 species and subspecies.

Astrophysical Observatory.—A prediction of the march of solar
variation from 1939 through 1945, based on periodicities revealed by
the solar-constant values published in volume 6 of the Annals of the
Observatory, shows that the years 1940 to 1947 will be the most im-
portant years to study the sun’s variation since the early twenties.
For this reason, every effort has been made to keep the three field
observatories in Chile, California, and New Mexico in operation.
Up to the close of the year, these efforts had been successful. Further
studies of the short-interval changes of solar radiation in their rela-
tion to weather have been even more convincing than previous re-
sults. The weather effects of individual solar changes are found to
last at least 2 weeks. Most of the time of the staff at Washington
has been devoted to war-research problems assigned by the war serv-
ices. In the division of radiation and organisms, the regular research
program was discontinued in August 1942, and since then practically
the entire time of the staff has been directed toward solving war
problems.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

Changes in the Board of Regents during the fiscal year were as
follows:

Senator Charles L. McNary, of Oregon, having been reelected to
the Senate for the term beginning January 3, 1943, was reappointed
by the Vice President on February 4, 1948, as a regent to succeed
himself.

On October 26, 1942, the Honorable William P. Cole, Jr., of Mary-
land, resigned from the House of Representatives, which automati-
cally terminated his term as a regent; on January 12, 1943, the
Speaker appointed Representative Edward E. Cox, of Georgia, to
succeed him.

The term of Dr. Roland S. Morris, of Pennsylvania, as a citizen
regent, expired February 20, 1942. By Joint Resolution of Congress
approved July 28, 1942, he was reappointed to succeed himself for
the statutory term of 6 years.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Harlan F. Stone, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor;
Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the United States; members
from the Senate—Charles L. McNary, Alben W. Barkley, Bennett
Champ Clark; members from the House of Representatives—Clar-
ence Cannon, Foster Stearns, Edward E. Cox; citizen members—
Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; Roland §. Morris, Pennsyl-
vania; Harvey N. Davis, New Jersey; Arthur H. Compton, Llinois;
Vannevar Bush, Washington, D. C.; and Frederic C. Walcott, Con-
necticut.

Proceedings.—The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 15, 1943. The regents present were Chief Justice
Harlan F. Stone, Chancellor; Vice President Henry A. Wallace;
Representatives Clarence Cannon, Foster Stearns, and Edward E.
Cox; citizen regents Frederic A. Delano, Roland S. Morris, Harvey
N. Davis, Arthur H. Compton, and Vannevar Bush; and the Secre-
tary, Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The Secretary presented his annual report covering the year’s
activities of the parent Institution and of the several Government
branches, which was accepted by the Board, as was also the report
by Mr. Delano, of the executive committee, covering financial statis-
tics of the Institution. The Secretary stated that owing to the
exigencies of wartime travel, there had been no meeting of the Smith-
sonian Art Commission during the year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1d

In his special report the Secretary outlined some of the more im-
portant recent activities carried on by the Institution and the
branches, with special emphasis on phases of the work directly con-
nected with the war.

FINANCES

A statement on finances will be found in the report of the execu-
tive committee of the Board of Regents, page 89.

PUBLICATIONS

In normal times the Institution publishes the results of researches
by members of its scientific staff in several series, namely, the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, the Bulletins and Proceedings of
the National Museum, Contributions from the National Herbarium,
the Bulletins of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Annals
of the Astrophysical Observatory. It also publishes the Annual
Reports of the Board of Regents, which contain a selection of articles
summarizing developments in all branches of science, and other oc-
casional publications. In wartime, however, publication has been
restricted largely to material that relates to the war or is of value
in strengthening cultural relations with the American nations to the
south of us. Otherwise only such papers were sent to the printer
during the year as seemed for one reason or another to be of sufficient
importance to the advancement of science to warrant publication
even in wartime. This wartime policy will not be apparent from
the titles listed in this year’s report on publications, however, be-
cause a large proportion of the papers issued went to the printer in
the previous fiscal year before the policy went into effect.

The new series, Smithsonian War Background Studies, begun in
the summer of 1942, was planned for the purpose of making avail-
able authentic information on the less well-known areas and peoples
involved in the war. Twelve numbers had been issued at the close
of the fiscal year, and four others were in press. As the Far East
and the Pacific islands are probably the least well-known of the war
areas, the majority of the papers deal with those regions. A com-
plete list of the papers issued and in press will be found in the
report on publications, appendix 10. The demand for papers in the
series was immediate and much larger than had been anticipated.
The editions of the first few papers had been set at 3,500 copies,
nearly twice as large as the usual editions of Smithsonian papers,
but these were soon exhausted. Reprints of these were issued, and
editions of later papers were successively increased until at the end
of the year 8,000 copies were being printed. The demand, as might
be expected, was greatest from Army and Navy organizations and
personnel and from universities and schools. In addition to the
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

Smithsonian editions, the Army and Navy ordered from 1,000 to
10,000 copies of nearly all the papers in the series.

Aside from the War Background Studies, there was a constant
demand from Army, Navy, and war agencies for other Smithsonian
publications, notably the Smithsonian Meteorological Tables, Smith-
sonian Physical Tables, and World Weather Records. Of the
Meteorological Tables, 5,557 copies were asked for by various Army
units, most of them going to the Signal Corps.

Among the outstanding publications of the year not related to
the war may be mentioned “Compendium and Description of the West
Indies,” by Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa, translated by Charles Upson
Clark, a detailed itinerary of Spanish America written by a Car-
melite missionary in 1628 or 1629; “Fishes of the Phoenix and Samoan
Islands Collected in 1939, during the Expedition of the U. S. S.
Bushnell,” by Leonard P. Schultz, curator of the division of fishes in
the National Museum, who accompanied the expedition; and “The
Native Tribes of Eastern Bolivia and Western Matto Grosso,” by
Alfred Métraux.

A total of 88 publications were issued during the year, and 194,057
copies of these and other Smithsonian publications were distributed.

LIBRARY

The use of the Smithsonian library during the year by the scientific
staff of the Institution was almost entirely in connection with the
war, and more than 85 war agencies have made inquiries, borrowed
books, and sent research workers to use the collections. The branch
libraries of the National Museum and the Bureau of American Eth-
nology especially have been constantly used by war workers because
of their extensive resources of geographical and ethnological material.
Receipt of foreign publications again dropped somewhat but not so
sharply as during the preceding year. The quantity and quality of
scientific publications is still maintained at a high level among our
allies abroad. The publication and receipt of domestic scientific
serials continues to be practically normal. Among the outstanding
gifts of the year were a microfilmed set of the records of Linnean
collections and manuscripts of the Linnean Society of London, and
a collection of 350 books from Ralph G. Packard to accompany the
collection of arms and armor given by him to the Museum. The
record of the year’s activities includes 6,955 accessions, bringing the
total holdings of the library to 907,645; 159 new exchanges arranged;
3,631 “wants” received; 5,012 volumes and pamphlets cataloged;
11,236 books and periodicals loaned; and 2,185 volumes sent to the
bindery.

Respectfully submitted.

C. G. Axssot, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 19438:

Appropriations for the maintenance and operation of the National
Museum for the year totaled $892,630, which was $61,652 more than
for the previous year.

THE MUSEUM IN WARTIME

Although there has been a decrease in the total number of visitors
to the Museum below that normal for times of peace, the number
recorded, 1,355,269, indicates the great interest that exists in the
exhibits. The change in hours to allow the public halls to be open all
day Sunday has permitted many people to visit the buildings whose
time schedules would not have otherwise made such visits possible.
This is particularly true of service men and women, about 2,000 of
whom have been included among the visitors each week end.

Last year’s report indicated steps taken for adequate safeguard
of collections. These precautions have gone forward, and a pro-
gram of training has been initiated among groups of employees for
the protection of visitors, employees, and the various buildings. Air-
raid alarm systems have been installed, fire-fighting, air-raid, and
first-aid equipment procured, air-raid shelters designated, and com-
plete black-out facilities where necessary established. Practice air-
raid drills were held, both in cooperation with the District of Columbia
and independently of the city-wide drills.

Throughout the year members of the staff have been occupied with
considerable work connected with the conduct of the war, either
through direct contact with various war agencies or through the
Ethnogeographic Board. This has included “spot” information in
various fields, research, and experiment. The variety of these subjects
is indicated by the following enumeration of some of the items on
which data were requested : Camouflage plants; natural vegetation of
specific regions; illustrations of poisonous plants and of emergency
food plants and data regarding them; destruction of mosquito-har-
boring epiphytes; distribution of certain plants of known economic

13
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

importance; botanical exploration ; the palatability of the flesh of land,
fresh-water, and marine animals, their use for food, and methods of
capture; the serviceability of hides and skins for various purposes;
disease transmission ; noxious, poisonous, or otherwise dangerous ani-
mals; intermediate hosts of animal and human parasites; aid in the
preparation of survival manuals and other military and naval hand-
books; distributional lists of insects and other animals of medical im-
portance; outlines for insect surveys in foreign areas; instruction in
mosquito identification; collection and preservation of specimens,
especially those of medical importance; supplying duplicate sets of
insect material not otherwise readily obtainable for the use of Army
and Navy medical schools; biological and oceanographic problems;
marine fouling organisms; bibliographic surveys; recommendations
regarding personnel.

Assistance has been given in the identification of tribal culture
patterns chiefly of the island peoples of the West Pacific area and of
continental southeastern Asia. Other information provided, in this
instance obtained from Museum photographic files, related to the need
of our aviators and soldiers to recognize religious caste markings, and,
to assist in the orientation of aviators, the types of house construction
in various parts of southern Asia. A mass of information directly
based on the collections was given to such agencies as the Board of
Economic Warfare and the War Production Board, bearing directly
on the development of the use of substitute materials for civilian use.
Various articles describing the more remote peoples and their cultures
were prepared and published.

COLLECTIONS

The Museum collections were increased by 230,231 specimens, which
were included in 1,177 separate accessions. Because of wartime con-
ditions a decrease of 211 accessions, 54,351 specimens, in comparison
with the number received during the previous year was not unex-
pected. The five departments registered specimens received as fol-
lows: Anthropology, 2,514; biology, 213,823; geology, 9,725; engi-
neering and industries, 2,266; and history, 1,902. Most of the ac-
cessions were acquired as gifts from individuals or as a transfer of
specimens by Government departments. The complete report on
the Museum, published as a separate document, includes a detailed list
of accessions, but the more important are summarized below. Cata-
log entries in all departments now total 17,808,471.

Anthropology.—Transferred to the division of archeology by Gov-
ernment departments were 1,443 specimens of earthenware vessels,
potsherds, and figurine fragments from several localities in Mexico
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

and the United States. Important gifts from individuals included
24 earthenware vessels, clay heads, and projectile points from Mex-
ico; 2 wooden figurines excavated in Florida; and 1 obsidian mirror
from a stream bed in Ecuador. Outstanding among the specimens
donated to the division of ethnology was a ceremonial mace of serpen-
tine from the Island of Maré. This specimen is an excellent example
of the ceremonial weapons described in French scientific literature
on New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. Other ethnological ob-
jects of special interest are weapons, pieces of armor, inscriptions
on bamboo, and musical instruments from the Philippine Islands, and
fishing paraphernalia, tools, utensils, dance masks, a feathered dance
headdress, and hand-woven costumes from various South and Central
American localities. The collection of ceramics was augmented by
porcelain articles from Capo di Monte molds, dating to about 1821,
and examples of painted terra cotta made presumably by Greek colo-
nists at Apulia, Italy, during the fourth century B. C., and excavated
at Pompeii. Interesting examples of American glass included “Bur-
mese” and “Peachblow” articles manufactured in Massachusetts and
“Case” glass from West Virginia. Among the various collections
assigned to the section of period art and textiles were antique jewelry
from Scotland, Hungary, Portugal, France, Egypt, China, Ceylon,
and the Philippine Islands; Spanish, French, and Chinese antique
ornamental fans; and a handsomely ornamented snuffbox bearing
the registry mark of Bergen, Norway, presented by Mrs. Stejneger
at the expressed wish of the late Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, for many
years head curator of the department of biology. Notable gifts to
the division of physical anthropology included Indian skeletal re-
mains from two ossuaries on a farm in Prince Georges County, Md.,
completing a collection from this locality begun in former years, and
a midget’s skull of 485 cc. capacity, the smallest human adult skull
thus far reported.

Biology.—The first complete skeleton of the African bush elephant
(Loxodonta cylotis) to come to the national collections and four
small rodents collected in the endemic plague area in Boliva were
the most noteworthy accessions in the division of mammals.

Particularly welcome among the birds accessioned during the year
were several forms new to the collection: Representatives of the
pheasant genus Anwrophasis and the shrike genus E'ulacestoma from
New Guinea; 2 specimens of the black-lored grass warbler (Cisticola
nigrilora) ; 65 species of Ecuadorian birds; the type of the warbler
Prinia flaviventris delacouri,; and 8 avian specimens from Eritrea, a
hitherto unrepresented locality. Another interesting accession in-
cluded birds from the widely scattered collections of the United States
Exploring Expedition of 1838-42.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

Two rare forms of West Indian snakes were added to the collec-
tion of reptiles and amphibians—Darlingtonia haetiana, from Haiti,
and 7'yphlops richardii, from St. Thomas.

Two large collections of fishes were received, one by transfer from
the Fish and Wildlife Service, comprising more than 50,000 speci-
mens, and one of nearly 35,000 specimens brought from Venezuela
by the curator of fishes. Rare forms accessioned include Ochmacan-
thus reinhardti and Urinophilus erythrurus from South America. To
the type series were added cotypes of Cynopotamus biserialis and
paratypes of Motolepidomyzon intermedius.

A large accession, comprising 4,300 miscellaneous insects, the bal-
ance of the private collection of the late George P. Engelhardt, was
received by the division of insects, accompanied by Mr. Engelhardt’s
extensive and valuable entomological library. As in former years, the
Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine and its Division of
Foreign Plant Quarantines, of the United States Department of
Agriculture, transferred to the Museum collection a large number
of insects, this year the total being approximately 46,000 specimens.
Six specimens of Cycloscosmia truncata, the third known occurrence
of this trap-door spider since it was discovered a century ago, came
as a gift.

To the type collection of marine invertebrates were added the
cotype of Derocheilocaris typicus, upon which a new genus, new
family, and new order of crustaceans were based, and numerous
allotypes, holotypes, and paratypes of crayfishes, worms, ostracods,
and amphibians. A collection of approximately 700 specimens of
miscellaneous invertebrates from the Gulf of Mexico was received
by transfer.

One of the important mollusk collections of North America, com-
prising approximately 10,000 specimens, was bequeathed to the
Museum by Dr. Frank C. Baker, together with 17 bound volumes of
his own published writings. Of special interest was a donation of
1,500 shells, 50 corals, and a collection of echinoderms from New
Caledonia, the first material of consequence received in many years
from this now important part of the world.

Twelve of the seventeen accessions to the collection of helminths
contained type material: Types of Opecoelina pharynmagna, Proto-
strongylus agerteri, P. frosti, Protogynella blarinae, and Diorchis
reynoldsi; cotypes of Parallintoshius tadaridae and Euparyphium
ochoterenai; paratypes, holotypes, and allotypes of Halocercus kirbyt,
Corynosoma obtuscens, and species of Acanthocephala; slides bearing
cotype specimens of Hymenolepis parvisaccata; and additional slides
representing four new species.

Several large collections of plants, mostly from Mexico, Central
America, and South America, were received as gifts or in exchange.
REPORT OF THH SECRETARY 17

Eight of these collections comprised more than 1,000 specimens each.

Geology.—Ten accessions pertaining to minerals—a 1,842-gram in-
dividual of the Harrisonville, Mo., meteorite, and nine lias of meteor-
ites—were added by purchase civonel the income from the Roebling
fund. The largest single accession of minerals was the gift of the
John W. Langsdale collection, including many good examples from
old American and European localities. The outstanding addition to
the gem collection was the 316-carat star sapphire known as Star of
Artaban. This beautiful stone ranks with the finest of the Museum’s
individual gems. Another notable gem stone was a 54-carat blue
Brazilian topaz obtained through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.
Dr. Stuart H. Perry, associate in mineralogy, presented an album of
five volumes containing approximately 1,500 photomicrographs of the
structure in meteoric irons, which, with the negatives received from
Dr. Perry last year, has resulted in the most complete file of the metal-
lurgy of meteoric irons in existence. Dr. Perry also donated a 4,640-
gram specimen of the Modoc, Kans., meteorite.

The most important additions to the collections of invertebrate pale-
ontology and paleobotany were the Devonian invertebrates collected
in the Mississippi Valley States by Prof. A. S. Warthin, Jr., and
Dr. G. A. Cooper. In return for assistance by Dr. C. E. Resser,
Dr. Franco Rasetti, of Laval University, presented a splendid set of
fossils and casts of types from the classic locality at Levis, opposite
Quebec City, Canada. The income from the Springer fund provided
12 Devonian crinoids from Ontario, one of the most important ac-
cessions of the year to the collection of fossil echinoderms. A col-
lection of about 2,000 Triassic fossils from Nevada will undoubtedly
include many types when the study of these fossils has been completed.
Among the accessions recorded in the section of Cenozoic inverte-
brates were topotypes of the foraminifer Pseudophragmina (Porporo-
cyclina) peruviana and holotype and paratypes of the foraminifer
Paranonion venezuelanum.

In the division of vertebrate paleontology a large series of speci-
mens from the Oligocene beds of Niobrara County, Wyo., was acces-
sioned. Specimens worthy of special mention are nearly complete
articulate skeletons of various mammals known as Merycoidodon,
Leptomeryx, Pseudocynodictis, Deinictis, and Hoplophoneus. Good
series of skulls and partial skeletons of the fossil horse Mesohippus,
the small camel Poébrotherium, the early rhinoceros Hyracodon, the
squirrel Jschromys, and the rabbit Palaeolagus were included. Also
added to the collection by exchange were the nearly complete skele-
ton of the primitive deer Hypertragulus calcaratus Cope, to be mounted
for the exhibition series; a skull and lower jaws of the Miocene horse
Parahippus leonensis and a right ramus of P. blackbergi, the type of
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

a fossil bird Geochen rhuax Wetmore; and 297 teeth of the pavement-
toothed shark Ptychodus mortond.

Engineering and industries—From the viewpoint of engineering
history, the most interesting and valuable accession was an original
truss of an iron railroad bridge designed, constructed, and erected
by the Reading Railroad Co. in 1845. The specimen, approximately
34 feet long, is the only remaining part of the first iron-truss, double-
track railroad bridge built in America, also believed to be the first
iron-truss bridge erected in the United States.

Early in the present war there was instituted as part of the train-
ing program of our armed forces the use of accurately made scale
models of the types of airplanes used by the United Nations and
the Axis, to teach recognition at sight of both friend and enemy. Lt.
Paul E. Garber, U. S. Navy, on military furlough from the Museum,
was actively engaged in the development of this program, and through
him the Museum received two groups of these models. Bequeathed
to the extensive propeller collection by the inventor, Dr. S. Albert
Reed, was a full-sized model, known as the D-1, of an aluminum-
alloy propeller that is now recognized as one of the early successful
types. Another accession of historical interest, likewise presented
by the inventor, H. H. Franklin, was comprised of four die castings,
which are excellent examples of early attempts to produce finished
castings in metal dies. Of current interest is the accession of a scale
model of a plant used for producing high-grade motor fuel for aviation
gasoline blending stock. An exhibit of timely educational value in
the section of mineral technology is one of abrasives and grinding-
machine operations. This exhibit, which has been studied frequently
by the personnel of Government war agencies, has been modernized
during the year, and 178 specimens were added.

In the division of crafts and industries there were received several
specimens of special interest because of their bearing on the war:
A new surgical stitching instrument operated as a sewing-machine at-
tachment, together with a felt sampler showing numerous types of
surgical suturing; a sample of cap ribbon of a new type adopted by the
United States Navy, in which letters in gold leaf are fused into a cut
ribbon of acetate rayon, instead of the silk ribbon embroidered with
gold thread formerly used; specimens of nylon and cotton woven
webbing used for the harness connecting the aviator to his parachute;
and new specimens to be used as an exhibit of alternates and sub-
stitutes developed recently to cope with shortages of war materials.
Of special interest in the public-health collections was the addition of
a collection of food models arranged to show the daily food require-
ment. Important additions to the wood collection were 13 samples
of tropical American woods that had been received by the Bureau of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

Ships, Navy Department, for testing in some phase of their wartime
shipbuilding program.

In the division of graphic arts a large collection of war posters
constitutes a valuable addition to the pictorial and historical record of
our participation in the war. Many were designed by outstanding
American artists, a fact that enhances their purely historical value.

The most important accession received by the section of photog-
raphy was a Woodward Solar Camera. No other example is known
to exist, and it came to light largely as a result of the Nation-wide
drive for scrap metal. This type of camera was manufactured under
patents dated between 1857 and 1877, and it was the first means
available to commercial photographers during the latter half of the
nineteenth century for making photographic enlargements on the
then slow bromide paper, using the sun as a source of illumination.

History.—The three most important accessions of the year in the
division of history were in the fields of art, arms, and numismatics.
The first of these, received by bequest, consisted of five paintings of
unusual interest not only because of their artistic and historical value
but also because they complete the collection of paintings on historical
subjects by J. L. G. Ferris, 71 of which were presented by Mrs. Ferris
in 1932, after the death of her husband. The finest accession of fire-
arms, swords, and daggers received by the National Museum in recent
years came as a gift from Ralph G. Packard. The collection illus-
trates the evolution of firearms from the matchlock to the automatic
of the present day and includes all the methods of ignition used
during the past 350 years. The accession of most importance to the
numismatic section was the large collection of coins, medals, medalets,
and tokens presented by the Hon. Frederic A. Delano, a regent of the
Smithsonian Institution.

Additions to the stamp collection of unusual interest were stamps
of Great Britain overprinted “M. E. F.” (Middle East Force) for
use in the former Italian territory of Eritrea, and stamps issued by
the Norwegian Government in London (used on letters carried by
Norwegian warships and merchant vessels), and by the exiled Yugo-
slavian Government in England.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Field explorations for the year were concerned in the main with
matters connected with the conduct of the war or with commitments
dating back to the pre-war period. With the usual program cur-
tailed, the scope of the investigations has been changed, though
valuable results in a variety of directions have been achieved.

Anthropology.—Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, associate curator, division
of archeology, was detailed to the Bureau of American Ethnology
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

from January 16, 1943, to June 1, 1943, in order to assist M. W. Stir-
ling, Chief of the Bureau, in archeological excavations near La Venta,
in the State of Tabasco, Mexico. These excavations, constituting an
important program of research among the Pan American republics,
were sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the Na-
tional Geographic Society.

Biology.—In pursuance of the program for the furtherance of
cultural relations with scientists in the other American republics in
cooperation with the Department of State, three members of the
department of biology—Dr. Remington Kellogg, curator of mammals,
Ellsworth P. Killip, associate curator of plants, and Dr. Waldo L.
Schmitt, curator of marine invertebrates—visited South America for
periods of approximately 3 months each.

Dr. Kellogg left Washington on March 2 for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and returned May 15, 1948. He spent most of his time working in
collaboration with members of the staff at the Museu Nacional at
Rio de Janeiro, with additional contacts at the Departamento de
Zoologia at Sio Paulo and the Museu Goeldi at Belém. The work of
field stations and laboratories engaged in the study and control of
tropical diseases was observed, particular attention being given to
research work involving Brazilian mammals suspected of being, or
known to be, the hosts of vectors of transmissible diseases. Through
the friendly cooperation of the Fundacio Rockefeller, Dr. Kellogg
was enabled to spend a week at its yellow-fever field station near
Therezopolis in the Serra das Orgiaos.

Mr. Killip was occupied during March, April, and most of May in
Venezuela. Part of the time was given to field work and part to work
with Dr. Henri Pittier, director of the Servicio Botanico, and his
associates, in the identification of large collections recently made in
little-known parts of the Republic. Short collecting trips were made
to Santa Lucia in the State of Miranda, Rancho Grande in the Parque
Nacional, Barquisimeto in the State of Lara, and El Junquito in the
mountains near Caracas. At the invitation of O. E. Nelson, in charge
of the Venezuelan office of the Rubber Reserve Corporation, Mr. Kil-
lip accompanied a rubber-investigation party to the Rio Paragua, a
river rising in the Pacaraima Mountains. Most of the plant collecting
was done between the town of La Paragua and the Cerro Guaiquinima,
a region that had never before been explored botanically.

Dr. Schmitt left Miami, Fla., on April 18 for Brazil, Uruguay, and
Argentina, and returned to Washington on June 30, 1943. He con-
sulted with members of the staffs of various scientific institutions and
spent some time examining collections, particularly of fresh-water
crustaceans, some of which have considerable economic importance.
In Brazil he visited the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, the Univer-
REPORT OF THD SECRETARY yA

sity of Sio Paulo and the Departamento de Zoologia at Sio Paulo, and
the Museu Paranaense in Curityba. In Uruguay he studied at the
Museo Nacional, the Museo Instituto Geoldgico del Uruguay, the Museo
de Pedagégico and the Museo de Ensefiaza Secundaria de Univer-
sidad, all in Montevideo, and the museum of the Liceo in Paysandi.
In Argentina he examined collections and visited the staff of the
Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales and the University at Buenos
Aires, the La Plata Museum at La Plata, the Museo Cornelio Moyano
and the Universidad de Cuyo, both at Mendoza, the Universidad de
Cérdoba at Cérdoba, and the Universidad de Tucuman at Tucumin.
The director and staff members of the laboratories of the Direccién
Regional de Paludismo assisted him on numerous occasions through-
out northern Argentina, particularly in Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy.
His field work, accomplished when time and other obligations per-
mitted, included studies in Brazil at Alto da Serra, Sao Paulo, and at
several localities in the vicinity of Curityba, Parana, in Uruguay at
Paso de los Toros, Salto, and Paysandu, and in Argentina at Mendoza,
Tucuman, Salta, San Lorenzo, and Quijano.

Philip Hershkovitz, who before the outbreak of the war had started
his investigations on the mammalian fauna of the northeastern part
of Colombia under the Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholar-
ship, between June 30, 1942, and April 16, 1943, worked mainly in the
Department of Magdalena, Colombia. More recently Mr. Hershko-
vitz has moved camp to the Department of Bolivar.

M. A. Carriker, Jr., under the W. L. Abbott fund of the Smith-
sonian Institution, continued work on the Colombian avifauna in
northeastern Colombia, and Walter A. Weber, also traveling under
the Abbott fund, accompanied the archeological expedition sponsored
jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic
Society to Tabasco, Mexico, during which expedition he obtained
about 600 specimens of birds for the Museum collections. Mr. Weber
also visited the Instituto de Biologia at Mexico City.

Geology.—While field work for upbuilding the exhibits has been

curtailed, researches in general geology were increased. Late in July
Prof. A. S. Warthin, Jr., and Dr. G. A. Cooper left for a survey of
Devonian rocks in Illinois and adjacent States. The purpose of the
trip was to correlate isolated areas of Devonian exposures in Illinois
with the better-known sequences in Missouri and Iowa, and for the
first time such correlations were established in that promising area
for new oil fields. After the return of Dr. Warthin, Dr. Cooper went
to southeastern Missouri to report on a deposit from which several
bones of a dinosaur had been taken.

Later in the year, under the cooperative work between the Depart-
ment of State and the Smithsonian Institution, and as the result of a

566766—44—3
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

special request by Ing. Luis Flores C., of the Instituto Geoldgico de
México in Mexico City, Dr. Cooper was detailed to make an economic
survey in Mexico. This field work, which was in connection with
search for war minerals, resulted in the discovery of a long sequence
of Cambrian rocks associated with ore deposits.

Dr. W. F. Foshag, on detail from the Museum, spent the entire year
in continuation of his work in Mexico supervising surveys for stra-
tegic minerals for the United States Geological Survey.

Only brief mention was made in last year’s report of the field ex-
pedition of the Smithsonian Institution to Wyoming under the direc-
tion of C. W. Gilmore, since it extended well into the present fiscal
year. Accompanied by George F. Sternberg, George B. Pearce, and
Alfonso Segura, of the Museo Nacional in San José, Costa Rica, the
party spent 2% months in a systematic search of the Hat Creek
Basin area, Niobrara County, Wyo., for Oligocene vertebrate fossils.
This work resulted in assembling a collection which, when combined
with the specimens obtained in 1932, gives the Museum for the first
time an adequate representation of this important fauna.

MISCELLANEOUS

Visitors—Curtailment of train and bus travel and the rationing
of gasoline resulted in a further reduction in the number of visitors
at the various Museum buildings. The total recorded during the
year was 1,355,269, as against 2,042,817 for the previous year. The
largest attendance for a single month was in August 1942, with 163,413
visitors, and the second largest was in July 1942, with 136,111. The
attendance in the four Smithsonian and Museum buildings was as
follows: Smithsonian building, 264,117; Arts and Industries build-
ing, 516,910; Natural History building, 424,055; Aircraft building,
150,187.

From November 1, 1942, to June 30, 1943, a separate count was
made of members of the armed forces who visited the buildings dur-
ing the first 7 days of each month. This count served to show that
attendance by servicemen averaged 25 to 35 percent of the total
number of visitors.

Publications and printing.—The sum of $27,750 was available dur-
ing the fiscal year for the publication of the Annual Report, Bulletins,
and Proceedings of the National Museum. Publications issued num-
bered 30—the Annual] Report, 8 Bulletins, 1 Contribution from the
National Herbarium, and 25 Proceedings papers. A list of these pub-
lications is given in the report on publications, appendix 10.

Volumes and separates distributed during the year to libraries,
institutions, and individuals throughout the world aggregated 55,631
copies.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

Special exhibits.—Twelve special exhibits were held during the year
under the auspices of various educational, scientific, recreational, and
governmental groups. In addition the department of engineering
and industries arranged 27 special displays—12 in graphic arts and
15 in photography.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

To afford a more usual description of the functions of Dr. Alexander
Wetmore’s position, on January 16, 1943, his title was changed to
Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, Director, United States
National Museum.

In the department of anthropology Dr. Joseph E. Weckler, Jr.,
associate curator in the division of ethnology, resigned on January 6,
1943.

Following the death of Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of
the department of biology for many years, Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt,
curator of the division of marine invertebrates, was advanced to the
position of head curator of the department on June 16, 1943. Dr.
Doris M. Cochran’s title was changed on March 27, 1948, to associate
curator in charge of the division of reptiles and batrachians. In the
division of mollusks, Dr. Harald A. Rehder was reallocated to as-
sociate curator and Dr. Joseph P. E. Morrison to assistant curator
cn September 1, 1942. On July 1, 1942, Walter A. Weber was ap-
pointed assistant curator on the staff of the division of birds to succeed
S. Dillon Ripley, II.

During the absence of Frank A. Taylor, who is now on military
duty, the head curator of the department of engineering and in-
dustries, Carl W. Mitman, assumed charge of the division. In the
division of engineering Fred C. Reed was appointed acting associate
curator on August 1, 1942, while Paul E. Garber is on military
furlough. Other division of engineering staff appointments, to be
effective only for the duration of the war, are: Kenneth M. Perry,
advanced from exhibits worker to senior scientific aid, August 1,
1942; Burlie Parks, transferred from the Museum property office to
the position of exhibits worker formerly held by Mr. Perry. Dr.
Wallace E. Duncan, assistant curator, section of chemical industries,
resigned on July 31, 1942. The vacancy caused by his resignation
was filled November 2, 1942, by the transfer of Joseph W. Schutz
from the Social Security Board.

An honorary appointment was conferred on Dr. Walter K. Fisher
as associate in zoology on June 25, 1948. The honorary title of Dr.
T. Wayland Vaughan was changed on July 28, 1942, from associate
in marine sediments, department of biology, to associate in paleontol-
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

ogy in the department of geology, to represent his existing activities
more properly.

Employees furloughed for military duty during the year were as
follows: Everett A. Altizer, on July 6, 1942; Paul E. Garber, on
July 6, 1942; Samuel T. Fetterman, on July 20, 1942; Dr. Charles L.

on April 14, 1943. Furloughed for duty in private industry: Ed-
ward Zuranski, on January 28, 1943, and Charles F. Huselstein, on
May 28, 1943.

Through the operation of the retirement act, Joseph H. Boswell,
principal guard (sergeant), on June 30, 1948, retired at his own
option with 17 years of government service.

The year was marked by the death of several staff members long
connected with the Museum. The death of Dr. Leonhard Stejneger
on February 28, 1948, has deprived the Museum of one of its most
widely known scientists. Harry S. Jones, principal mechanic, fore-
man of electricians, died suddenly September 11, 1942; John D. Ray,
junior laborer, died October 28, 1942; and Jennie T. Jackson, char-

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit, on behalf of the Board of Trustees
of the National Gallery of Art, the sixth annual report of the Board
covering its operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943. This
report is made pursuant to the provisions of the act of March 24,
1937 (50 Stat. 51), as amended by the public resolution of April 13,
1939 (Pub. Res. No. 9, 76th Cong.).

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943, the Board was com-
prised of the Chief Justice of the United States, Harlan F. Stone;
the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull; the Secretary of the Treasury,

All positions with the Gallery (with the exception of the executive
and honorary officers) are filled from the registers of the United States
Civil Service Commission or with its approval. By June 30, 1943, the
permanent Civil Service staff numbered 232 employees. Since the
opening of hostilities, 41 members of the staff, or approximately 18
percent, have joined the armed forces.

APPROPRIATIONS

For salaries and expenses, for the upkeep and operation of the
National Gallery of Art, the protection and care of the works of art
acquired by the Board, and all administrative expenses incident
thereto, as authorized by the Act of March 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 51), as
amended by the public resolution of April 18, 1989 (Pub. Res. No.
9, 76th Cong.), the Congress appropriated for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1943, the sum of $563,825.00. This amount includes regular
appropriations of $541,365.00 and a supplemental deficiency appro-
priation for the payment of “overtime compensation” authorized by
the Acts of Congress in the amount of $22,460.00. From this appro-
priation the following expenditures and encumbrances were made:

In addition to the above-mentioned appropriations aggregating
$563,825.00, the Gallery received $32,264.58 from the Federal Works
Agency, Public Buildings Administration, to cover expenses incurred
in connection with the special protection of masterpieces of painting
and sculpture which have been evacuated from the Gallery.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 2%

ATTENDANCE

The total attendance from July 1, 1942, to June 30, 1948, was
1,508,081, a daily average of 4,132 visitors, over 25 percent of this
number being men and women in the uniformed military services.
In spite of war conditions the number of visitors at the National
Gallery of Art has been increasing. The first 6 months of the calendar
year 1943 the attendance was 876,460, as compared with 577,360 during
the first 6 months of 1942, while the attendance during June—the
last month of the fiscal year—was 164,202 in 1948, compared with
91,810 in 1942.

Among the activities contributing to the consistent growth of popu-
larity of the Gallery are the Sunday night openings, the special exhi-
bitions of contemporary art, the variety and excellence of the Sunday
evening musical concerts, the Sunday night suppers for servicemen,
and the Servicemen’s Room, which has furnished a place of relaxation
for many men in the military services who, especially on week ends,
visit the Gallery.

PUBLICATIONS

In the information rooms in the Gallery building, the Gallery con-
tinues to pursue and expand its policy of making catalogs, color repro-
ductions, and similar publications available to the public at moderate
cost. There is also available, without charge, a general information
booklet containing a short account of the history of painting and
sculpture from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as illustrated
by the Gallery’s collections, and clearly marked floor plans to guide
visitors in their study of the various exhibits. The booklet is of great
assistance to visitors and may be obtained at the information rooms
on request.

AIR-RAID PROTECTION

The Gallery staff, which is organized to form five air-raid services,
namely, fire, police (including morale), health (first aid), mainte-
nance, and evacuation, has been kept in constant training through the
medium of weekly building air-raid drills. Drills held in coordination
with the District of Columbia authorities, when visitors were in the
building, gave evidence of the measure of efficiency which has been
reached by the protective organization in the Gallery.

ACQUISITIONS
GIFTS OF PRINTS

On December 29, 1942, the Board of Trustees accepted from Mr.
and Mrs. J. Watson Webb two sets of etchings by James Abbott
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

McNeill Whistler, and on February 8, 1948, the Board accepted from
Mrs. J. Watson Webb an engraving of St. Jerome by Albrecht Durer;
on March 15, 1943, the Board accepted from Lessing J. Rosenwald, a
gift of his collection of prints and drawings, consisting of some 6,500
items; on April 12, 1943, the Board accepted from Mrs. George Nichols
a gift of four prints; and on June 7, 1943, the Board accepted from
David Keppel a gift of a set of Vedute by Piranesi.

GIFTS OF PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURE

On August 1, 1942, the Board of Trustees accepted from The A. W.
Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust a gift of 62 paintings, 2 en-
gravings, and a bronze bust of the late Andrew W. Mellon, by Jo
Davidson; on September 3, 1942, the Board accepted from the Honor-
able Frederic A. Delano a gift of a portrait of “Captain Warren
Delano” by Charles Loring Elliott; on December 1, 1942, the Board
accepted from Mrs. Jesse Isidor Straus a gift of a terra-cotta group,
“La Surprise,” signed by Clodion; also on December 1, 1942, the
Board accepted from Clarence Van Dyke Tiers two paintings, “Henry
Pratt” by Thomas Sully, and the “Duke of Portland” by Matthew
Pratt. On December 1, 1942, the Board accepted from Mrs. Robert
Noyes a bequest of a portrait by Gilbert Stuart of “William Rickart.”
On February 8, 1943, and on June 7, 1948, the Board of Trustees
accepted from Chester Dale gifts of 23 paintings. On June 7, 1948,
the Board accepted from Miss Ethlyn McKinney a gift of a painting
by Childe Hassam, entitled “Allies Day, May 1917”; also on June 7,
1943, the Board accepted from J. H. Whittemore Company a gift
of two paintings, “The White Girl” and “L’Andalouse,” both by
Whistler.

On June 7, 1948, the Board of Trustees accepted from the Works
Progress Administration a donation of the Index of American Design
consisting of 22,000 or more documented drawings and water colors
made under the auspices of the United States Government as a pic-
torial record of American source material in design and craftsmanship
from early Colonial days to the close of the nineteenth century.

Another notable gift was that of Joseph E. Widener, given to the
Gallery in memory of his father, the late Peter A. B. Widener. This
gift was made on September 9, 1942, and consisted of a collection of
paintings, sculpture, tapestries, jewels, furniture, ceramics and other
objects of art. In this collection the National Gallery of Art has
received one of the greatest donations ever made to any museum. The
Widener collection was begun many years ago by Peter A. B. Widener,
who died in 1915. After his father’s death, Joseph Widener continued
te build up the collection, and in his choice revealed a faultless dis-
crimination.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

On March 18, 1948, the National Gallery of Art announced the gift
of the famous collection of prints of Lessing J. Rosenwald. The col-
lection consists of over 6,500 items, including representative examples
of print-making from the fifteenth century to the present, a number
of drawings, original wood blocks and copper plates, letters and valu-
able reference books relating to the history of engraving. The collec-
tion was carefully built up by Mr. Rosenwald during the last 20 years.
Because of his extraordinary knowledge and discrimination, he has
brought together one of the greatest collections of the graphic arts
ever assembled by a private individual.

VARIOUS GALLERY ACTIVITIES

The Sunday evening concerts, which were instituted on June 7,
1942, primarily for the benefit of service men and women and war
workers in the city, have been so successful that they have been con-
tinued. The exhibition galleries have been open from 2:00 to 10:00
p.m. each Sunday evening throughout the year. Concerts of orchestral
music and string quartets have been provided with funds donated
by Chester Dale, and by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Chari-
table Trust, and later from the Gallery’s trust fund received from
The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust. In addition,
concerts have been donated by such well-known artists as Albert
Spalding, violinist, Frances Nash, pianist, and by artists in the
armed forces attached to the Navy School of Music, the Army Music
School, the Army Air Forces Band. The Ballet Russe de Monte
Carlo contributed a performance in the East Garden Court on May
2, 1943, especially for the wounded servicemen from the local hospitals.
oe ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943
CURATORIAL DEPARTMENT

The curatorial work for the year consisted of the installation of
over 600 works of art from the Widener collection, and of 173 other
gifts, and of 18 temporary exhibitions; in giving various lectures
on the collections and related fields in conjunction with the program
of the educational department; and in further cataloging the works
of art. A check list of the works of art in the Widener collection,
with an introduction, was compiled and printed, and a new general
information pamphlet was devised and printed for free distribution
to visitors at the Gallery.

During the past year the staffs of the curatorial and the educational
departments have collaborated in issuing a catalog, a portfolio of
colored reproductions, and nine pamphlets dealing with the Gallery
and its collections. Six members of the staff have contributed twelve
articles to several periodicals and pamphlet series. Two books and
several articles are currently in preparation.

In the course of the year, approximately 9,420 works of art were
submitted to the acquisitions committee (including 1,945 prints from
the Widener collection and approximately 6,500 from the Rosenwald
collection) with recommendations regarding their acceptability for
the collections of the National Gallery of Art; 21 private collections
were visited in connection with offers to the Gallery of gifts or loans;
126 consultations were held concerning over 250 works of art brought
to the Gallery for expert opinion; 11 visits were made outside the
Gallery to give expert opinion; and 32 letters were written in answer
to inquiries involving research in the history of art.

RESTORATION AND REPAIR OF WORKS OF ART

During the year, as authorized by the Board and with the approval
of the Director and Chief Curator, Stephen Pichetto, Consultant
Restorer to the Gallery, together with his staff, has undertaken such
restoration and repair of paintings and sculpture in the collection
as has been found to be necessary. AIl this work was carried on
in the restorer’s rooms in the Gallery except in one case, when an
unusually delicate and complicated restoration was required; this
painting is being restored in Mr. Pichetto’s studios in New York.

WORKS OF ART STORED IN A PLACE OF SAFEKEEPING

Early in January 1942, a limited number of fragile and irreplace-
able works of art in the Gallery collections were removed to a place
of greater safety. These works, stored in a place adapted for the
purpose, have since been under constant guard by members of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

Gallery’s guard force and under supervision and inspection by a
member of the curatorial staff of the Gallery.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

The attendance (97,000) for the educational program was double
that of the previous year (47,000).

The Gallery tours of the collection, conducted twice daily, Mon-
day through Friday, and once on Saturday, have been supplemented
by tours for service men and women on Saturdays. In addition
to these tours, slide lectures on the collection, given by members of
the curatorial and educational departments, were continued, and
more than 22,000 persons attended the consistently popular feature,
the “Picture of the Week,” a 10-minute discussion of single paintings.

New features introduced by the department during the past year
included film lectures, music lectures, and noon-hour concerts of re-
corded music, all of which have been well attended.

Changes in personnel due to wartime conditions placed unusual
responsibilities and added work on the members of the department
and because of this increased pressure it was not possible for the edu-
cational staff to assume extra assignments. The following projects,
however, were completed: cataloging the collection of approximately
8,500 slides; preparation of manuscripts for lectures on the Gallery
for the Federation of Women’s Clubs; slide lecture on the Gallery,
for circulation by the American Federation of Arts; various articles
for publication in art magazines; and the planning and supervision
of the motion picture on the National Gallery of Art. This motion
picture was completed in June 1943, by the Gallery staff in coopera-
tion with the Office of Strategic Services. Accompanied by a special
musical score and commentary, the film includes views of the ex-
terior and interior of the building, air-conditioning and lighting
equipment, and a color sequence showing many of the outstanding
works of art on exhibition. It is expected that the film will be
widely circulated among educational institutions and the general
public in this country and abroad.

LIBRARY

A total of 746 books and 106 pamphlets and periodicals were pre-
sented to the Gallery; 33 books and 110 pamphlets and periodicals
were purchased by the Gallery; 472 photographs and drawings were
presented as gifts; 27 books and 816 pamphlets and periodicals were
acquired through exchange; 1 film was presented as a gift, and 22
subscriptions to periodicals were made.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943
PHOTOGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT

Prints totaling 11,401, 459 black-and-white slides, and 2,034 color
slides have been made by the photographic laboratory. The prints
have been placed on file in the library, where they are for sale and
for the use of the Gallery staff. The slides have been made avail-
able for the staff in connection with the public lectures given in the
Gallery and have likewise been lent to lecturers outside the Gallery
and to other galleries.

OTHER GIFTS

During the year there were gifts to the Gallery of plants for the
garden courts; also certain expenses were paid by others on behalf
of the Gallery, the donors being Mrs. William Corcoran Eustis,
David E. Finley, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection
of Harvard University, Life magazine, The A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust, and the Toledo Museum of Art.
Gifts of money were made to the Gallery during the year by Mrs.
Florence Becker, Maj. Curtis Bryan, Chester Dale, Mrs. William
Corcoran Eustis, David E. Finley, Mrs. David E. Finley, Sr., S. R.
Guggenheim, Samuel H. Kress and Samuel H. Kress Foundation,
Lt. Paul Mellon, Mrs. Stephen S. Pichetto, Donald D. Shepard,
Mrs. Gertrude Clarke Whittall, Joseph E. Widener, Avalon Founda-
tion, and The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust.

AUDIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS OF THE GALLERY

An audit has been made of the private funds of the Gallery for
the year ended June 30, 1943, by Price, Waterhouse & Co., a nation-
ally known firm of public accountants, and the certificate of that
company on its examination of the accounting records maintained for
such funds has been submitted to the Gallery.

Respectfully submitted.

38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

66 pamphlets added by purchase, and 77 volumes of bound periodicals.
The Parke-Bernet priced catalogs accounted for 53 volumes and 60

pamphlets among the purchases.
Miss Anna M. Link was appointed librarian October 16, 1942.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

The following paintings have been cleaned or restored since July
1, 1942:

“The Storm King on the Hudson,” by Samuel Colman, was relined.

“Mountain Scene,” by I’. E. Church, was cleaned.

“Mountain Scene,” by I. Diday, was cleaned.

“Painting Representing Falls, supposed to be Genesee Falls, N. Y.” by William
Winstanley, was relined and restored. From the geologic formation seen in
the painting, it was determined that the falls could not be Genesee Falls of
New York, but could be part of the Great Falls of the Potomac. This painting
belonged to George Washington and is now the property of the division of history
of the National» Museum.

“Moonlight Scene from a Grotto on a Rocky Coast,” by an unknown artist,
was cleaned. This painting belonged to George Washington and is now the
property of the division of history of the National Museum.

“Portrait of Judge Denny,’ by Thomas Sully, was relined. Property of the

Supreme Court.
“Portrait of Col. Timothy Pickering’ was varnished and the frame restored.

Property of the War Department.

Advice and supervision was given the United States Capitol re-
garding the large Halsall naval painting, “The Monitor and Merri-
mac,” painted in 1884.

Eight exhibition cases containing ancient necklaces, rare Persian
paintings, ceramics, jewelry, cameo glass, and miniatures were moved
from the first floor to the ground floor.

Eight of the antique wooden and terra-cotta statues in the Gellatly
Collection are now shown on shelves against a monk’s-cloth back-
ground. The rearrangement made possible the removal of two large
pedestals, greatly improving the general appearance of the large
gallery.

Another rearrangement made possible by the addition of two exhibi-
tion cases has brought together nearly all the rare Chinese glass,
jade, and pottery.

K. T. Wu and C. M. Wang, of the Library of Congress, translated
the inscription on the Northern Wei stele (357, Gellatly Collection),
and made a number of rubbings of this Chinese statue.

The huge vase showing a copy of Guido Reni’s “Aurora” and a
self portrait of Guido Reni (226, Pell Collection) was appropriately
placed in the center of the National Museum rotunda.

The largest task of the year was the making of a sheet catalog with
cross references of the paintings and sculpture of the collection. The

?

Chinese, Japanese, and Syrian objects submitted for purchase. In
addition to this work within the collection, 1,941 objects of Oriental
provenance and 235 photographs of such objects were examined, and
oral or written reports made upon them. Written translations of 105
inscriptions in Oriental languages were made upon request. In addi-
tion to this regular curatorial work, that contributing to the war
services which occupied a major part of the time of the staff is sum-
marized as follows:

WAR WORK

Aside from answering many inquiries from, and supplying infor-
mation to, various Government agencies, a considerable amount of
translation has been made for the Government from both Chinese
and Japanese sources, amounting to hundreds of pages of typewrit-
ten matter. Work upon maps of the war areas has entailed the identi-
fication and transliteration of Chinese and Japanese names to the
number of more than 5,000. This work is continuing.

In May 1943 three lectures on Chinese culture as reflected in the
fine arts were given at the Freer Gallery by the Director in response
to the combined request of the United States Office of Education and
the acting superintendent of the public schools of the District of
Columbia, in furtherance of their plan to disseminate knowledge of
China in the public schools. The audiences were composed of Wash-
ington teachers (total number 264). The subjects of the lectures were
as follows:

May 8: A short discussion of art in general. China and her people.

May 15: Bronze and jade. Purpose and use.

May 22: Chinese painting.

A lecture on Asiatic painting, illustrated with Freer Gallery slides,
was given by Miss Guest on October 2, 1942, in the St. Francis Audi-
torium of the Art Museum, Santa Fe, N. Mex., for the benefit of the
Indian Service Club. The sum realized ($160) made possible the
Christmas boxes sent by the club to its members in the armed forces
in this country and abroad.

DOCENT SERVICE

Eight groups were given docent service in the exhibition galleries
(total 415); four groups were given instruction in the study room
(total 21).

PERSONNEL

It is with great sadness that we have to record the death on
December 29, 1942, of John Ellerton Lodge, Director of the Freer
Gallery from its beginning in the autumn of 1920. Under his wise
administration the Freer collections and endowment were founded
as a public institution for the further prosecution of the study and
the acquisition of Oriental fine arts. Both branches of this work
were developed simultaneously. The first led to the training of
language students and to field work in China, as well as to studies
within the collection; the second, to an immense and very significant
expansion in every field: the sections devoted to Chinese bronzes,
jades, painting, and pottery raised to higher levels of quality; the
sections devoted to Near Eastern and East Indian manuscripts,
paintings, ceramics, glass and metal work created almost in entirety
upon small and, for the most part, unimportant nuclei in the original
collection.

Elizabeth Hill Maltby, librarian since December 17, 1935, resigned
her position on August 15, 1942. On the same day Frances Poncelet,
who had reported for duty July 27, was appointed librarian.

Archibald G. Wenley, associate in research, was appointed Acting
Director on January 1, 1943. On January 16 he was appointed
Director.

William R. B. Acker, language assistant, was placed on furlough
December 31, 1942, being detached for service with the Office of
War Information.

Daisy Furscott Bishop terminated her long service at the Freer
Gallery on January 27, 1948, being transferred to the library of the
Smithsonian Institution.

John A. Pope, formerly Lecturer on Chinese Art at Columbia Uni-
versity, was appointed associate in research on April 1, 1948.

Grace T. Whitney worked intermittently at the Gallery in the Near
East section between October 22, 1942, and June 16, 1943.

Joseph H. Boswell, principal guard, who had been on duty here
since September 1923, retired at his own request June 380, 1948.

Other changes in personnel are as follows:

Appointments: Joseph P. Germuiller, guard, recalled from re-
tirement August 1, 1942; Charles W. Frost, guard, August 25, 1942;
Norman E. Baldwin, guard, November 16, 1942; James W. Burns,
guard, by temporary transfer from the United States National Mu-
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

seum, May 11, 1948; George S. Young, cabinetmaker, employed for
special help in the cabinet shop, February 16, 1943.

Separations from the service: Everett A. Altizer, guard, on in-
definite furlough for naval duty, July 6, 1942; Glen P. Shephard,
guard, on indefinite furlough for military duty, October 15, 1942;
Norman E. Baldwin, guard, resigned February 26, 1943; Charles
W. Frost, guard, by transfer to Airport Detachment No. 5, Gravelly
Point, Va., April 18, 1948; Joseph P. Germuiller, guard, retired
June 19, 1943.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 19438, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of June 27, 1942, which pro-
vides “* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation
and preservation of archeologic remains. * * *”

During the fiscal year, activities concerned with the other American
republics have been emphasized, and the energies of various staff
members of the Bureau have been directed to an increasing extent
to projects bearing on the war effort. In particular, members of the
Bureau staff have cooperated with the Ethnogeographic Board in
preparing information for the armed services, and it is expected that
efforts in this direction will increase as the war continues.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

On January 18, 1943, M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, left
Washington on the fifth National Geographic Society-Smithsonian
Institution archeological expedition to southern Mexico. Excavations
were continued at the site of La Venta in southern Tabasco and re-
sulted in the discovery of numerous new details of construction of
the rectangular stone-fenced enclosure, one of the central features of
the site. Three rich burials of important personages were uncovered
containing offerings principally of jade of unusually high quality.
Two mosaic floors in the form of jaguar masks made of polished
green serpentine were discovered, one at a depth of more than 20 feet.
During the course of the work an exploration trip was made up the
Rio de las Playas, one of the headwater streams of the Tonala River, in
order to verify the existence of a ruin in this vicinity. The collections
obtained during the course of excavations at La Venta were shipped
to the National Museum in Mexico City. Mr. Stirling was assisted
throughout the season by Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, of the division of
archeology of the United States National Museum.

During the course of the fiscal year Mr. Stirling contributed to the
War Background Studies of the Smithsonian Institution an article
entitled “Native Peoples of New Guinea,” which was published as

47
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

No. 9 of that series. He also contributed several articles to the Ethno-
geographic Board for distribution to the armed forces. During the
year Mr. Stirling’s paper entitled “Origin Myth of Acoma and Other
Records” was issued as Bulletin 135 of the Bureau.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, devoted a considerable por-
tion of the year to the reading and correcting of galley and page proof
of his work entitled “The Indians of the Southeastern United States,”
which is being published as Bulletin 187 of the Bureau. This will bea
volume of approximately 850 pages exclusive of the index.

Some further work was done on the materials preserved from the
now extinct language of the Timucua Indians of Florida, but it was
decided to discontinue this for the present. These materials—con-
sisting of a catalog of Timucua words and English-Timucua index
to the same, photocopies of the religious works in Timucua and
Spanish printed in Mexico in the seventeenth century, and typed copies
of these with some interlinear translation—have been labeled care-
fully and placed in the manuscript vault.

Time was also devoted to the extraction of ethnographical notes
from the volumes of Early Western Travels, edited by Reuben Gold
Thwaites. A paper entitled “Are Wars Inevitable?” was contributed
as No. 12 to the War Background Studies of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. A few investigations were undertaken for the Board on Geo-
graphical Names, of which Dr. Swanton is a member.

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was occupied during the first
part of the year in an investigation of the Chilcotin languages of
northern California. The results of this work indicated that Chilcotin
was introduced into California from Canada in pre-European times,
but owing to the varying rate in time reckoning for the accomplish-
ment of linguistic changes, the length of Chilcotin occupancy in Cali-
fornia cannot be estimated. With the exception of a small area south
of the mouth of the Klamath River, Chilcotin occupies the entire
coastal region of northern California to the mouth of Usal Creek
in Mendocino County. In addition to the linguistic connections dis-
covered, local traditions were obtained linking the Chilcotin peoples
with a more northern group. Two separate stories were recorded
deriving the Hupa from the region north of the mouth of the Klamath
River, and one was obtained deriving the Indians of a part of the Eel
River drainage from the Hupa region.

Since his return to Washington, Dr. Harrington has been engaged
in the preparation of material for the linguistic section of the Hand-
book of South American Indians. This work resulted in the discovery
that Witoto is Tup{-Guarani, and also the very interesting finding
that Quechua is Hokan. The Hokan hitherto had been known to ex-
tend only to the Subtiaba language of the west coast of Central
America. Detailed studies of Quechua and of Cocama have been made
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

for the purpose of making comparisons with other South American
languages and with a view to discerning possible further linguistic
affiliations. In addition to this work, Dr. Harrington has also made
an extensive study of the grammar of the Jivaro language of South
America.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
senior archeologist, was engaged in prospecting and testing an in-
teresting site in the Agate Basin, on a tributary of the Cheyenne
River between Lusk and Newcastle, in eastern Wyoming. Dr. Roberts
had been sent to make preliminary investigations at this location,
despite the general policy of no regular field work for the duration
of the war, because of the possibility that much information might
be lost as a result of erosive activities in the area and from disturb-
ance of the deposits by amateur collectors hunting for specimens.
The site gave evidence of having been the scene of a bison kill on the
edges of a marsh or meadow. Animal bones and artifacts were found
in a stratum that breaks out of the bank some 20 feet above the bottom
of an eroding gully. This layer is covered by an overburden that
deepens rapidly as it is followed back into the bank, and at a depth
of 4 feet, where the tests were terminated, was still continuing. All
the bones found, of which there were many, proved to be modern
bison. Associated with these were projectile points, which, although
they suggest an affinity with the Collateral Yuma type—a form that
has been considered relatively early in the Plains area—nevertheless do
not have all the significant characteristics of that type. The points
have unhesitatingly been called Yuma by numerous people who
have examined them, and there is no question of their belonging
in that general category, although they should not be considered
classic forms. All the points found at the site are consistent in
pattern, yet have a considerable range in size. In the seventy-
some points or large and easily identified fragments found there,
no shouldered, barbed, or tanged forms appear. The material un-
questionably represents a cultural unit without intrusions from
other sources. Dr. Roberts dug 32 examples out of undisturbed
deposits. The remaining specimens are in the collections of local
residents, who picked them up as they weathered out of the gully
bank. Only a few end and side scrapers have been found, prob-
ably because of the fact that the camp proper has not yet been
located, but they are typical of those associated with the so-called
early hunting complexes. Geologic studies have not yet been made
of the deposits. They indicate some antiquity, but that they are
not as old as the age formerly postulated for Yuma remains is demon-
strated by the fact that the bison represented are all modern forms.
It is hoped that when present conditions are over, the site can be
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

thoroughly excavated and detailed studies made of the material. The
site was found by William Spencer, of Spencer, Wyo., and was re-
ported to the Smithsonian Institution by Robert E. Frison, deputy
game warden, Wyoming State Game and Fish Commission of New-
castle. Permission for the investigations was granted by Leonard
E. Davis, owner of the land.

Leaving Newcastle, Wyo., on August 1, Dr. Roberts proceeded to
Tucumcari and San Jon, N. Mex., for the purpose of disposing of some
of the equipment stored there at the close of the 1941 season and ar-
ranging for storage of the remainder for the duration.

On his return to Washington, Dr. Roberts resumed his office activi-
ties. Galley and page proofs were read for his report, “Archeologi-
cal and Geological Investigations in the San Jon District, Eastern
New Mexico,” which appeared in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, volume 103, No. 4. Manuscript was prepared and galley
and page proofs were read for a paper entitled “Egypt and the Suez
Canal,” which was published as No. 11 in the Smithsonian Institu-
tion War Background Studies. By request, an article, “Evidence for
a Paleo-Indian in the New World,” was written for the Acta Ameri-
cana, an international quarterly review published by the Inter-Ameri-
can Society of Anthropology and Geography. During the period from
October 1 to June 80 a series of survival articles was prepared from
data furnished by members of the Smithsonian staff. These articles
were made available to the armed forces through the office of the
Ethnogeographic Board. Dr. Roberts devoted considerable time to
the task of gathering this information from the Institution’s authori-
ties in the various fields of science and working it into articles for
general reading. He also furnished information on various subjects
in response to requests from numerous members of the armed services.
At the close of the fiscal year he was engaged in assisting in the prepa-
ration of a survival manual for the Ethnogeographic Board.

On April 1, 1948, Dr. Roberts was designated as Acting Chief of the
Bureau of American Ethnology whenever the Chief, by reason of
absence, illness, or other cause, is unable to discharge the duties of his
position.

Dr. Julian H. Steward, anthropologist, continued his activities as
editor of the Handbook of South American Indians, one of the Smith-
sonian projects conducted under funds transferred from the State
Department for “Cooperation with the American Republics.” He also
prepared a number of articles for publication in the Handbook. The
Handbook, which is three-fourths completed, will consist of four
volumes of text and a two-volume bibliography. Material has been
contributed to it by 100 specialists on the Indian tribes of Central
and South America and the Antilles.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OM

Dr. Steward took an active part in the creation of the Inter-Ameri-
can Society of Anthropology and Geography, the purpose of which
is the development of cooperative anthropological and geographic re-
search. Dr. Ralph L. Beals was appointed to take over the work of
organizing and developing the society. The society has approxi-
mately 700 members throughout the Americas, and the first issue of its
quarterly journal, Acta Americana, was in press at the close of the
fiscal year.

Plans were developed for cooperative Institutes of Social Anthro-
pology to assist in training students and in carrying on field work
in the other American republics.

Dr. Steward served as a member of committees concerned with co-
operative work in the field of inter-American relations and was a
member of the Board of Governors of the National Indian Institute
of the United States. He also represented the Smithsonian Institu-
tion at the inauguration of Dr. Everett Needham Case as president of
Colgate University.

Dr. Alfred Métraux, ethnologist, continued his work as assistant to
Dr. Julian H. Steward in preparing the Handbook of South American
Indians. In addition to editing materials furnished by other contribu-
tors, Dr. Métraux completed a large amount of manuscript material
of his own for use in the, Handbook. Through an arrangement with
the National University of Mexico, Dr. Métraux went to Mexico City
to teach from March until the end of the fiscal year. During the year
Dr. Métraux’s paper entitled “The Native Tribes of Eastern Bolivia
and Western Matto Grosso” was issued as Bulletin 184 of the Bureau.

During the fiscal year Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., ethnologist, was
engaged in work relating to the war, for the most part in connection
with the Ethnogeographic Board. Early in July 1942 Dr. Collins
was detailed by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and by
the Chief of the Bureau to assist in handling requests for regional
and other information received by the Ethnogeographic Board from
the armed services and other war agencies. On February 28, 1943,
he was elected Assistant Director of the Board and in this capacity
continued in charge of research relating to the above-mentioned re-
quests.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. William N. Fenton, as-
sociate anthropologist, was engaged, at the request of the Pennsyl-
vania Historical Commission, in a brief field trip among the Seneca
Indians on the Cornplanter Grant in northwestern Pennsylvania.
The object of this work was to collect Indian geographic names and
traditions on hunting and fishing along the Allegheny River.

Following his return to Washington, Dr. Fenton devoted most
of his time during the remainder of the year to projects received
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

by the Ethnogeographic Board from the armed services and other
war agencies. One of the results of his work has been a strategic file
of personnel in the United States familiar with foreign countries.
Growing out of the Roster of Personnel, World Travel, and Special
Knowledge Available to War Agencies at the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, as first compiled by the Smithsonian War Committee early
in 1942, the present World File of Regional Specialists at the Eth-
nogeographic Board now includes over 2,500 names of individuals,
their travel and special knowledge. Cross-indexed by name, as well
as by country, this index has enabled the Director of the Board to
locate promptly any person in response to requests from the armed
forces for authorities who might possess unusual information, photo-
graphs, maps, and knowledge of languages of a given area. Certain
officers as well as civilian specialists have returned repeatedly to the
Smithsonian building to consult this file. In recognition of this
work, in February Dr. Fenton was elected a research associate of
the Ethnogeographic Board.

At the request of the War Department, Office of Chief of Engi-
neers, to the Institution, Dr. Fenton delivered a lecture on “The
Nature and Diversity of Human Culture” to a class in Psychology
of Administration.

Dr. Fenton has continued membership on the Smithsonian War
Committee, acting as its secretary.

Work on the Indian place names of western New York and west-
ern Pennsylvania has continued by correspondence with Messrs. M.
H. Deardorff, Warren, Pa., and Chas. E. Congdon, of Salamanca,
N. Y. At the end of the fiscal year, another correspondent, Dr.
Elizabeth L. Moore, of Meredith College, had about completed the
translation of J. F. Lafitau’s Moeurs des Sauvages Amériquains (2
vols., Paris, 1724), a project reported last year.

Publications for the year include: Songs from the Iroquois Long-
house: Program Notes for an Album of American Indian Music
from the Eastern Woodlands, published jointly by the Smithsonian
Institution and the Library of Congress as vol. 6 of Folk Music of
the United States (Archive of American Folk Song) ; Contacts be-
tween Iroquois Herbalism and Colonial Medicine, in Smithsonian
Report for 1941; Last Seneca Pigeon Hunts, en Warren County Penn-
sylvania Almanac, 1943; and Fish Drives among the Cornplanter
Seneca, in Pennsylvania Archaeologist; also several book reviews in
professional and other journals. At the close of the fiscal year, the
paper entitled “The Last Passenger Pigeon Hunts of the Cornplanter
Senecas,” which had been prepared with M. H. Deardorff for the
Anthropological Papers of the Bureau, had been accepted for pub-
lication in the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Do

In December 1942 Dr. Philip Drucker, assistant ethnologist, re-
ceived a commission in the United States Naval Reserve and was
granted a military furlough. Dr. Drucker had spent the preceding
portion of the fiscal year in preparing final reports on archeological
work previously conducted in Mexico by the National Geographic
Society-Smithsonian Institution archeological expeditions. These
reports, in press at the end of the fiscal year, will appear as Bulletins
of the Bureau.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau, continued
work on the study of Indian music by completing two large manu-
scripts—Seminole Music, and Music of Acoma, Isleta, Cochiti, and
Zuni Pueblos. She also devoted considerable time to a study of the
traces of foreign influences in the music of the American Indians,
During a portion of the year she was engaged in writing a handbook
of the Smithsonian—Densmore collection of sound recordings of Ameri-

Miss Densmore presented to the Bureau a record of her field work
on Indian music and customs for the Bureau from 1907 to 1941, and

presented the original phonograph record of a speech in the Ute
language by the famous Ute chief Red Cap, made in 1916, and a
similar record of a speech in the Yuma language by Kacora, made in
1922, with accompanying information.

In 1943 Miss Densmore completes 50 years’ study of the music,
customs, and history of the American Indians,

LIBRARY

Accessions during the fiscal year totaled 321. There has been a
sharp decrease in all classes of accessions, owing to reduced funds in
the case of purchases and to war conditions in the case of gifts and
exchanges.

The Library of Congress cards for nonserial matter on hand at the
beginning of the fiscal year, amounting to several thousand, have
been prepared and filed. Cards for foreign periodicals and society
transactions have been prepared and filed, including shelf-list cards.
A record of holdings appears on each of these shelf-list entries and
some are now in their permanent form.

Several thousand pamphlets, including a number of valuable ones
pertaining to the Indian Territory and the Five Civilized Tribes,
were reclassified and reshelved.

The library has been much in use as a source of material for the
Ethnogeographic Board and the war agencies.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1943:

From the appropriation “General Expenses, Smithsonian Institu-
tion” there was allocated for the expenses of the Service $45,808.
This amount was reduced by the Bureau of the Budget by setting aside
a reserve of $10,000, making the sum available $35,808. This latter
included $928 to meet within-grade promotions to certain employees
as provided for by the Ramspeck Act.

In addition to the above, $1,500 was allotted to the Institution by
the Department of State from a special Congressional appropriation
to that Department for carrying on its work of promoting the cultural
relations between the United States and other American republics.
The money transferred to the Institution was used by the Exchange
Service to send packages of publications by mail directly to their
destinations in Argentina and Brazil, the only countries in South
America with which there are no reciprocal arrangements for the ex-
change of publications under governmental frank.

The number of packages received during the year for distribution
at home and abroad was 513,460, a decrease from last year of 47,691.
These packages weighed a total of 248,648 pounds, a decrease of
77,758 pounds. This material is classified as follows:

Packages are forwarded abroad partly by freight to exchange bu-
reaus for distribution, and partly by mail directly to their destina-
56
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57

tions. The number of boxes shipped abroad was 643, an increase over
last year of 44 boxes. Of these, 418 were for depositories of full
sets of United States governmental documents, and 225 were for de-
positories of partial sets and for various establishments and indi-
viduals abroad. The number of packages sent by mail was 100,074.

As has been stated in previous reports, the war has made it nec-
essary for the Institution to suspend shipments to many foreign
countries. However, since last year’s report was issued, shipping
conditions have improved sufficiently to make it possible to add a
few countries in the Eastern Hemisphere to those to which consign-
ments are being transmitted. ‘The countries to which shipments were
being made at the close of the fiscal year 1943 were as follows:

Hastern Hemisphere:
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Republic of Ireland (formerly Irish Free State).
Portugal.
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Union of South Africa.
India.
Australia.
New Zealand.
Western Hemisphere: All countries.

It was stated in the last report that packages for places in the
Western Hemisphere were sent by,mail and that there was some de-
lay in transit due to examination of their contents by the censor. The
Office of Censorship has been good enough to make special arrange-
ments whereby packages mailed abroad by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution now pass the postal censor with little delay.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official publications received
for transmission abroad through the International Exchange Service
is 91 (55 full and 36 partial sets). On account of war conditions it
is possible at this time to forward only 54 of these sets. The remain-
ing 37 sets are being withheld for the duration.

Through arrangements with the Librarian of Congress, the large
number of boxes of governmental documents that had accumulated
at the Institution and were overtaxing the limited space here, are
now stored in the Library of Congress.

The partial-set depository of the Dominican Republic has been
changed to the Library of the University of Santo Domingo, and the
depository in Paraguay, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Library
Section, Asuncién.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL

In the last report it was stated that the sending of the daily issues
of the Congressional Record and the Federal Register was discon-
tinued in April 1942, at the request of the Office of Censorship. The
ban placed on the forwarding of these journals was lifted in Febru-
ary 1943, and the regular transmission of the Record and the Register
were resumed. Copies of the back numbers were forwarded, in order
that the series of the journals would be complete in the files of the
depositories. The number of copies of each of these journals de-
livered to the Institution for this interparliamentary exchange was
reduced from 71 to 58—the number that it was possible to forward
under the curtailed operations of the Service.

The Biblioteca Benjamin Franklin, Mexico, D. F., was added to
those countries receiving the Record and Register. A list of the
countries to which these journals are now being forwarded follows:

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AGENCIES

As a matter of information for those making use of the facilities
of the International Exchange Service in the distribution of their
publications in India, it should be stated that since the inauguration
of the Provincial Autonomy authorized in the Government of India
Act of 1935 (which did not come into force until several years there-
after), the Superintendent of Government Printing and Stationery
in Bombay no longer acts as the distributing exchange agency for
British India, which work it had conducted since 1918. Except in
a few instances where the governments of other provinces reimburse
the Bombay Agency for expenses incurred in transmitting publica-
tions to governmental offices, the exchange activities of the Super-
intendent of Government Printing and Stationery now are confined
to the distribution of packages in the Province of Bombay. To other
provinces packages are sent direct from Washington by mail.

There is given below a list of bureaus or agencies to which con-
signments are forwarded in boxes by freight when the Service is in
full operation. To all countries not appearing in the list, packages
are sent to their destinations through the mails. As stated previously,
shipments are sent during wartime only to the agencies in those coun-
tries listed on page 57.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sm: have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1943:

The regular appropriation made by Congress was $261,510, all of
which was expended. Legislation that became effective during the
year provided for salary increase in certain classes and grades and for
overtime payments for increased hours of work. This resulted in
a considerable increase in cost for personal services, which, however,
was largely offset by savings through delay in filling positions or
failure to fill them, as well as by savings in regular operating costs
and special items. Asa result, the deficiency amounted to only $7,690,
which was supplied through the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation
Act, 19438.

Money was provided in the 1948 Appropriation Act for the construc-
tion of an incinerator and for the purchase of two trucks, but priorities
could not be obtained. Plans and specifications were completed for the
incinerator, and the project will go forward as soon as funds and ma-
terials are available.

The primary function of the Zoo is to exhibit a wide variety of
animal life in the best possible condition, and in order to accomplish
this aim under wartime conditions it was necessary to curtail all phases
of maintenance work about the Zoo that could be slighted without
harm to the animals. In this way it has been possible to keep the
Zoo going in a satisfactory manner in spite of the shortages of man-
power, food, and materials incident to wartime.

Because of the longer evenings due to the change to war time, the
time of closing the Zoo buildings and gates has been delayed 1 hour,
the opening hour remaining the same. It is believed that this length-
ening of hours in the evening has materially contributed to the en-
joyment of the Zoo by the public.

PERSONNEL

As in most other agencies, there has been a considerable personnel
turn-over at the Zoo, several employees having gone into agencies
more directly concerned with the war and others having gone else-

65
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

where or retired. In spite of efforts to fill vacancies, many positions
have remained unfilled for some time. The abolition of the Satur-
day half-holiday, however, has made it less difficult to maintain fairly
adequate care of the Zoo.

MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS

No extensive improvements have been attempted during the year.
Activities have been confined to maintenance work, and because of
the difficulty in obtaining critical materials this has frequently been
of a temporary or makeshift nature. Many things that should be
done have been postponed until circumstances are more propitious.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The needs of the Zoo remain the same as outlined in previous re-
ports. On account of war conditions no request is being made for
unusual expenditures at this time.

VISITORS FOR THE YEAR

The attendance for the year was:

The sharp curtailment in driving occasioned by gasoline rationing,
tire mileage restrictions, and the prohibition against pleasure driving
brought about a drastic reduction in the number of visitors coming
to the Zoo by automobile, but an increased number of visitors walked
cr came by bus and streetcar.

In previous years a census has been made each day of the cars parked
in the Zoo at about 3 p. m., for the purpose of determining the propor-
tional attendance by States, Territories, and foreign countries. Owing,
however, to the almost total cessation of automobile traffic to the Zoo,
the record from such a census would have been of no value during the
past year. It may be pointed out that in the previous year District
of Columbia cars comprised about 39 percent; Maryland, 22 percent;
Virginia, 15 percent; Pennsylvania, 4 percent; the remaining 20 per-
cent were from other States, Territories, and foreign countries.

Prior to the curtailment of automobile and bus travel, numerous
groups and classes came to the Zoo from a distance of several hundred
miles. Of course these have been almost completely eliminated, and
there has been a reduction in the number of groups and classes from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

Maryland, Virginia, and the District, although this attendance has
held up fairly well.

Many of the wartime residents in Washington who have not previ-
ously had an opportunity to visit a large zoo, now take their rest
and recreation in the National Zoo. The ease of reaching the Park
and the fact that it is open every day practically from daylight to
dark and without cost enable many people to obtain relaxation they
could not otherwise enjoy. Service men and women constitute a sub-
stantial proportion of the visitors. It is plain to be seen that many
of the service people anticipating going overseas are endeavoring to
learn something of the animal life that they might find in the region
to which they may be sent. There is also an increasing attendance by
servicemen recuperating from injuries or sickness.

Medical groups have come to the Zoo specifically for the purpose of
studying certain types of animals and to receive instruction regarding
snakes. The Zoo officials receive many requests from various agencies
of the Government including the War and Navy Departments for in-
formation to assist them on biological problems.

The Zoo continues to be a regular study ground for art and biology
classes, as well as an important focal point for letters, telephone calls,
and queries regarding care of animals, their behavior, and methods to
be followed in preventing or remedying injuries from animals.

AIR-RAID PRECAUTIONS

As pointed out in the last report, it is anticipated that in the event
of air raids the Zoo will be one of the safest places in the city. How-
ever, plans were made and have been kept up to date for meet-
ing such contingencies as may arise in the event of air raids or other
emergencies.

ACQUISITION OF SPECIMENS

Specimens are usually acquired by purchase, gift, deposit, exchange,
natural reproduction, or collecting expeditions by members of the
Zoo staff. Conditions have prevented travel by the Zoo personnel
for collecting specimens, and the customary array of animals offered
for sale by animal dealers has been greatly reduced both in kinds and
numbers; therefore the importance of gifts and deposits is relatively
greater than before. The return of members of the armed forces
from foreign lands has resulted in a gratifying number of gifts of
smal) animals that have been picked up by these persons as pets or,
specifically for the Zoo. When Army and Navy personnel evince an
interest before going abroad in obtaining specimens for the Zoo, efforts
are made to arrange for importation permits to facilitate entry of the
animals into this country. Such permits are required by a law which
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

rigidly excludes all animals except under permit in order that this
country may be properly safeguarded against introduction of animals
or disease pests that might become serious menaces.

NATURAL REPRODUCTION

Although the Zoo does not have ideal conditions for animals to
raise their young in captivity, there is generally a fairly satisfactory
increase from births and hatchings. During the year 101 mammals
were born and 83 birds were hatched. Noteworthy among the
former was a litter of five woolless sheep, an unusually large litter;
unfortunately, none of the little ones lived. There were also births
among the reptiles which, however, are not recorded.

. The births and hatchings are listed below:

DEPOSITS

The more outstandingly interesting and desirable animals that were
deposited during the year were a spectacled bear, the first ever exhib-
ited in this Zoo, deposited by Louis Ruhe, Inc.; a beautiful West
African guenon monkey, which we have so far been unable to identify,
deposited by H. Allender; a great gray kangaroo deposited by H.
B. Harris; a wallaby and a West African palm civet deposited by
H. L. Shaw; a group of four yellow-handed tamarins and seven mar-
mosets deposited by Miss Martha G. Hunter; a West African crowned
hawk-eagle deposited by Louis Ruhe, Inc., and another specimen of
the same species deposited by C. P. Haskins; an electric eel, Indian
python, and several regal pythons, including one unusually large
specimen that weighs 320 pounds, all deposited by Clif Wilson.

EXCHANGES

Among the more desirable animals received by exchange were two
cape hyraces obtained from the Philadelphia Zoo, five Dybowsky deer,
and one tahr goat.

PURCHASES

The more outstanding animals obtained by purchase included a
pair of woolless domestic or Barbados sheep which are natives of West
Africa; a laughing falcon; and a pair of klipspringers, a remarkable
little antelope from southern and eastern Africa.

The Hershey Estates Zoo at Hershey, Pa., which depended for its
attendance on people coming by automobile, suffered such a sharp
curtailment in number of visitors that the management decided to
dispose of most of its stock, which permitted us to obtain from that
organization a number of interesting and desirable additions.

SPECIES NEW TO THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION

Despite the few animals purchased and the factors militating against
obtaining outstanding additions, the Zoo was fortunate enough to
obtain six species never before in the collection. These were a spec-
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

tacled bear (Zremarctos ornatus), which inhabits an indefinitely
outlined range in the northern Andes and is very rare in captivity; a
pair of klipspringers (Oreotragus saltator), a beautiful little cliff-
inhabiting antelope that originally ranged from southern Africa to
Abyssinia; five Dybowsky deer (Sika hortulorum), which inhabit
Manchuria; one laughing falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), a beau-
tifully marked falcon of medium size that inhabits the forested parts
of tropical America from Mexico to northern Argentina; two quetzals
(Pharomachrus mocinno), the state bird of Guatemala, which inhabits
the higher mountains from Guatemala to Panama; and a white
starling (Graculipica melanoptera), which inhabits Java and is rare
in captivity.

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the Astrophysical Observatory, including the Division of
Astrophysical Research and the Division of Radiation and Organisms,
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948:

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

The study of the solar-constant values published in March 1942
as table 24, volume 6 of the Annals of the Observatory, confirmed the
discovery that the variation of the sun’s output, seemingly irregular,
is really made up of numerous regular periodicities, all being closely
aliquot parts of 273 months. By combining their influences a pre-
diction was made of the march of solar variation from 19389 through
the year 1945. This appears in figure 14 of volume 6 of the Annals.

In this way it was shown that the years 1940 to 1947 would probably
be the most interesting and important years to study the sun’s varia-
tion since the early twenties. As the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory is the only agency in the world which follows the varia-
tion of the sun’s output of radiation, it therefore seemed of extreme
importance to keep the record unbroken through these critical years.
Hence, despite demands of the war manpower situation, every avail-
able means has been used to keep the three field observatories at Mon-
tezuma, Chile, Table Mountain, Calif., and Tyrone, N. Mex., in opera-
tion. Thus far these efforts have been successful, notwithstanding ,
the loss of three experienced observers from a total field staff of six.

Considerable progress has been made at Washington in the study
of short-interval changes of the solar radiation in their relation to
‘weather. As first shown in Smithsonian publications Nos. 3392 and
3397 in the year 1936, the sun’s short-interval variations, though aver-
aging only 0.7 percent, are important elements, even governing ele-
ments, in weather. The weather effects of individual solar changes
are found to last at least 2 weeks. These studies of the year 1936 have
been repeated this year employing the improved and enlarged “solar
constant” data published as table 24, volume 6 of our Annals. The
new results are even more convincing than the provisional ones just
referred to. They have been extended to deal with the weather of
several cities in different parts of the world, for both temperature
and barometric pressure. It is expected to publish soon on this
subject.

At Washington two computers have continued reductions of solar-
constant observations, but have not, of course, been able to keep up
to date with the results, inasmuch as these computers were also called

75
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

on frequently for work relating to war problems assigned by the
Army and the Navy, or requested by outside agencies engaged in war
work. It is hoped that with the return to Washington of Mr. Hoover,
who has been carrying on measures at Tyrone Observatory for 2 years,
the solar-constant computations can be pushed along more rapidly
so as to disclose the remarkable changes of solar radiation expected
for the years 1940 onward, as referred to above.

Most of the time of Messrs. Abbot, Aldrich, and Kramer has been
devoted to problems assigned by the war services on which no report
can be made at this time.

Personnel.—Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Moore completed their term of
service at Montezuma. Mr. F. A. Greeley succeeded Mr. Moore in
June 1948 as field director there with Mrs. F. A. Greeley as his as-
sistant. Mr. Stanley C. Warner continued as field director at Table
Mountain with Mr. Kenneth G. Bower as assistant. Mr. W. H. Hoo-
ver acted as field director at Tyrone Observatory. Mr. Alfred G.
Froiland, bolometric assistant there, was inducted into the army in
June 1948, after which Mr. Hoover carried on alone. Mr. Moore will
take over at Tyrone, and Mr. Hoover will return to Washington. No
changes in personnel occurred at Washington.

DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS
(Report prepared by Dr. Earl S. Johnston, Assistant Director)

The regular research program of the Division was discontinued
early in August. Since that date practically the entire time of the
members of the Division has been directed toward solving problems
relative to the Nation’s war activities. By far the largest percentage
of this work has dealt with problems submitted by the Naval Re-
search Laboratory. Because of the nature of some of this work, it
is obvious that a detailed report cannot be submitted at this time..
The personnel and laboratory equipment of the Division was such
that adaptation to this new work in physics, chemistry, and biology
was very readily made. However, the efficiency of the Division as a
unit has been decreased somewhat through loss of personnel.

At the request of the Annual Review of Biochemistry, a review ar-
ticle on photosynthesis was prepared last summer by Dr. Johnston of
the Division and Dr. Jack E. Myers of the University of Texas. This
paper has now been published in volume 12 of the Review.

Personnel—On August 1, Mrs. Phyllis W. Prescott, the junior
clerk-stenographer for the Division, was transferred to the admin-
istrative office as assistant clerk-stenographer.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 9
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943:

Intensification of the war effort, so evident throughout the whole
Institution, has been both reflected in, and shared by, the library dur-
ing the difficult year just past.

The library has been confronted by two major responsibilities that
have motivated its work: How best to adjust policies and adapt pro-
cedures to wartime changes and demands, and how to maintain, as far
as possible, the basic continuity of the collections.

Urgent as is the first of these, experience during and following the
First World War has shown that the second cannot be neglected with-
out serious weakening of the library’s service to the Institution. In)
wartime, normal growth is inevitably diminished, and a certain amount
of change of emphasis in acquiring material is necessary and even de-
sirable, but the responsibility that the library has for implementing
the deep-rooted and continuing work of a scientific institution cannot
be overlooked even in an emergency of the present heroic proportions.

WAR WORK

Never before in the history of the library have its collections and its
staff been called upon to give aid in so many different kinds of re-
search, virtually all of which were concerned in some way with the
war effort. Regular use of the library by the scientific staff of the
Institution has been almost entirely in connection with the war, and
more than 35 of the war agencies have made many direct inquiries,
have borrowed more than 500 books, and have sent research workers,
some of them for extended periods of time, to use the collections.
Indirectly too, through the use of the library by the staff of the Ethno-
geographic Board, still other of the war agencies have been repre-
sented. Rich in certain kinds of geographical and related material,
and in ethnological works, the branch libraries of the National Museum
and the Bureau of American Ethnology especially, have been con-
stantly visited and called upon by war workers.

It has been most gratifying to find that the Institution has not in-
frequently been able to supply data of urgent importance that could
not be found elsewhere.

77
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

The index of foreign geographical illustrations begun last year as
a special war service and originally planned to cover only the publi-
cations of the Institution itself was later enlarged, at the request of
the Smithsonian War Committee, to include files of selected journals
on special subjects containing incidental geographical illustrations
likely to be overlooked in any routine search for pictures. The selec-
tion of these journals was made by the scientific staff of the Institution
and the indexing was done in their offices, the library serving as the
coordinator and keeper of the file, which now contains more than
12,000 entries.

As another aid to the war agencies in making use of the library,
the librarian prepared a brief account of its resources, mimeographed
copies of which were distributed to key personnel in Washington and
elsewhere by the Ethnogeographic Board.

The cordial response of the whole Institution to the library’s plea
for books in the Nation-wide Victory book drive for men and women
in the armed services, is worthy of record. More than 500 fine clean
copies of highly readable contemporary books were contributed.

It may be of interest to note here the transfer to the Library of
Congress of an uncataloged collection of miscellaneous war pamphlets
accumulated by the library during the First World War. This col-
lection, numbering some 3,000 pieces, largely the so-called ephemera
of the period, though valuable as historical source material, had no
direct bearing on the scientific work of the Institution.

ACCESSIONS

Receipt of foreign publications dropped somewhat, but not nearly
so sharply as during the preceding year, after shipments from enemy
and occupied countries ceased. Through the International Exchange
Service, 355 packages, or only 70 fewer than last year, were delivered.
Even this decline was more apparent than real, for a good: many
foreign serials came directly by mail. Fortunately there have been
comparatively few actual losses, and not many prolonged delays in
the arrival of the most important of those scientific serials that are still’
being published in the allied and neutral countries, though some of
the foreign institutions and societies are postponing shipment of their
publications until after the war. The maintenance of both the quan-
tity and quality of scientific publication at a high level among our
war-torn allies abroad is worthy of remark.

The publication and receipt of domestic scientific serials continued
to be practically normal.

In the Museum library an accession of special importance was a
selection of 250 books and 2,300 separates and pamphlets, mostly on
the subject of reptiles, from the library of the late Dr. Leonhard
Stejneger.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

Received in the sectional library of the division of fishes, by trans-
fer from the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the
Interior, was the large collection of manuscript records of the dredg-
ing and hydrographic stations of the U. S. F. 8. S. Albatross and
other fisheries vessels.

By regular and special exchange, and by purchase, considerable
progress has been made in filling gaps in the serial sets, some of
them of long standing, and in strengthening certain collections on
special subjects, for example, the published results of scientific sur-
veys and travels. The importance of such material, always apparent,
especially in connection with the work of the curators in the Museum,
has been doubly emphasized by the increased wartime demand for it
both within and from outside the Institution.

One of the larger special exchanges of duplicates, with the Marine
Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, yielded a good many parts
of periodicals needed in the Museum library, while from Cooper
Union came 35 publications on art for the National Collection of Fine
Arts library.

Among purchases, wartime deviations from the normal have been
the unusually large number of requests for atlases, descriptive geog-
raphies, and foreign-language dictionaries.

GIFTS

There have been a number of especially notable gifts during the
year. One that is invaluable in itself, and noteworthy as well for
being the library’s first considerable accession of microfilmed material,
was the very generous gift of the Linnean Society of London of the
records of its Linnean collections and manuscripts, the copying of
which was made possible by a grant to the society from the Car-
negie Corporation. This is one of two sets deposited in American
libraries, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University having re-
ceived the other. We are much indebted to Dr. Elmer D. Merrill,
the administrator of botanical collections there, for his good offices
in arranging the whole matter. All the actual specimens in the
Linnean herbarium are said to be covered in the 60,000 exposures of
the set, as well as records of the mollusks, fishes, and insects, of vari-
ous manuscripts, and those of Linneaus’ own publications to which
he had added corrections and emendations.

To accompany the very fine collection of arms and armor given by
him to the Museum, Ralph G. Packard presented also his collection of
350 books on the subject, many of them rare and beautiful volumes.

The sectional library of the division of marine invertebrates received
another special collection of great usefulness in connection with speci-
mens previously received from the donor, by the bequest of the late
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

Dr. Frank Smith of his working library of oligochaete literature,
1,103 pieces in all.

A unique gift to the sectional library of the division of minerals was
a five-volume set of phetomier gravis of meteoric irons presented by
Dr, Stuart H. Perry.

As always, the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, and many other
members of the Smithsonian staff made generous contributions of
books and papers. From the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science came 578 publications. Among other donors were
the American Association of Museums, the American Committee for
International Wild Life Protection, the American Wildlife Institute,
Barton A. Bean, Mrs. Arthur 8. Blum, Hon. Usher L. Burdick, the
Detroit News, Haydn T. Giles, Daniel C. Haskell, J. Cramer Hudson,
the International Association of Printing House Craftsmen, Mrs, Vera
F, Lewis, Fritz Lugt, Dr. John P. Marble, Dr. Salvador Massip, Dr.
Riley D. Moore, Olaf Nylander, W. J. Orchard, Hon. Chase S. Osborn
and Miss Stella Brunt Osborn, the Pan American Union, the Pennsy]l-
vania Academy of Fine Arts, the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy
and Science, Dr, A. E. Porsild, Dr. L. A. White.

CATALOGING

Cataloging of the regular inflow of current accessions was excep-
tionally well kept up under the handicap of the understaffing of the
catalog division, but there was no time that could be devoted either
to the older material so badly in need of attention, or even to some
of the larger recent gifts of special collections. There are at least
15,000 uncataloged volumes in special collections scattered throughout
the Institution, while in the Museum library many more thousands
of volumes have never been cataloged by subject and are represented
in the catalog only by antiquated author cards. The difficulty, or
actual loss of use of much important material by this lack of adequate
cataloging is a serious matter, and one that should receive first con-
sideration in post-war planning of the library’s work.

PERSONNEL

Changes in personnel were the retirement for disability of Miss
Marian W. Seville, senior library assistant, on August 31, 1942, after
many years of faithful service; the appointment of Miss Minna Gill
as assistant librarian in charge of the catalog, on September 2, 1942;
the appointment of Mrs. Daisy F. Bishop as under library assistant on
February 17, 1943, and the resignation of Miss Marion Blair, junior
clerk-typist, on April 21, 1943. Since January 21, 19438, W. B. Green-
wood has been absent Fro the library of the Piere of American
Xthnology on military duty.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Sl

There were a number of promotions and reassignments to duties
among the staff. Miss Anna Moore Link was given charge of the
National Collection of Fine Arts library and Miss Elizabeth G. Mose-
ley was promoted to Miss Link’s former position in charge of the
serial collections in the Museum library ; Mrs. Hope H. Simmons was
promoted to be assistant librarian in charge of accessions and Miss
Marjorie R. Kunze was promoted to be chief assistant in the accessions
division.

The loss of one position and the time lag in filling other vacancies
have been serious obstacles in the way of keeping work up to date. The
fine spirit of the whole staff in meeting emergencies, in taking on extra
work, and in accepting temporary assignments to new or unaccustomed
duties is much to be commended.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects of
art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by Whistler,
Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave funds for the
construction of a building to house the collection, and finally in his
will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and securities to
_ the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment fund for the
operation of the Gallery. From the above date to the present time
these funds have been increased by stock dividends, savings of in-
come, etc., to a total of $5,836,772.01. In view of the importance and
special nature of the gift and the requirements of the testator in re-
spect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the other funds of
the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them is stated sepa-

rately.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 95

The report of the audit of the Smithsonian private funds is given
below:

SEPTEMBER 23, 1943.
WXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, BOARD OF REGENTS,
Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. OC.

Sirs: Pursuant to agreement we have audited the accounts of the Smithsonian
Institution for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1948, and certify the balance of
cash on hand, including Petty Cash Fund, June 30, 1948, to be $673,598.48.

We have verified the record of receipts and disbursements maintained by the
Institution and the agreement of the book balances with the bank balances.

We have examined all the securities in the custody of the Institution and in
the custody of the banks and found them to agree with the book records.

We have compared the stated income of such securities with the receipts of
record and found them in agreement therewith.

We have examined all vouchers covering disbursements for account of the
Institution during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1943, together with the authority
therefor, and have compared them with the Institution’s record of expenditures
and found them to agree.

We have examined and verified the accounts of the Institution with each trust
fund.

We found the books of account and records well and accurately kept and the
securities conveniently filed and securely cared for.

All information requested by your auditors was promptly and courteously
furnished.

We certify the Balance Sheet, in our opinion, correctly presents the financial
condition of the Institution as at June 30, 1943.

Respectfully submitted.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1943

97
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Gznzrat Appenpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the Secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1948.

SOLAR RADIATION AS A POWER SOURCE?

By C. G. ABBOT
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

[With 3 plates]

This major power source of the world is as yet almost unused by
engineers. The intensity of solar radiation at mean solar distance
outside the earth’s atmosphere is about 1.94 calories per square centi-
meter per minute. Expressed in English measures, this is 7.15 B. t. u.
per square foot per minute. Actual supplies of sun heat, however,
vary with the season. Owing to the ellipticity of the earth’s orbit,
we are about 3 million miles nearer the sun in January than in July,
and the actual intensity of the sun’s rays outside the atmosphere is
about 6 percent greater in January than in July. As there is less hu-
midity and clearer air in winter, it follows that the sun’s heat at the
earth’s surface in the Northern Hemisphere is a good deal more intense
in winter than in summer for equal solar altitudes above the horizon.
The reason winter is cold is because the sun lies so far south that its
rays shine very obliquely, so that the average intensity on a horizontal
surface is thereby greatly reduced.

Thick clouds reflect away about 75 percent of the sun rays which
strike them. Much of the area east of the Mississippi is 50 percent
cloudy, so it follows that in these sections a third of the sun’s radia-
tion is reflected out to space. Besides this cloud loss there is an
actual absorption by the water vapor and other ingredients of the
atmosphere. This amounts in humid localities to from 15 to 25
percent. Accordingly, solar power propositions would operate at
great disadvantage in most of the States east of the Mississippi, ex-
cepting Florida, as compared to the arid and generally high-altitude
regions of the Southwest.

Measurements of solar radiation made at the earth’s surface upon
a receiver at right angles to the beam, and with the sun at 15° or more
above the horizon, range from 1.5 calories per square centimeter per
minute down to 1.0 calorie, or even less, depending on the clearness
of the atmosphere. In favorable localities a value of about 1.35

100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

calories may be assumed as the average for the day of solar energy
on a surface normal to the beam, except while clouds obscure the sun.
This corresponds in ordinary power units to 1.15 horsepower per
square yard.

Whether or not it is worth while to employ the solar energy for
power depends on the efficiency which can be achieved in converting
solar radiation into mechanical energy. On that factor depend the
size and cost of the equipment. An efficiency of only 1 to 5 percent
would be apt to involve prohibitively cumbersome and costly equip-
ment. But a solar engine with an efficiency of 10 to 15 percent might
be commercially competitive with other sources of power, even at
present. As times goes on, it is to be supposed that the cost of the
major power sources, coal and oil, will rise, though the limited supply
of water power may remain relatively unchanged in cost. Hence,
in the future, unless some as yet unused source of power becomes
important, it is probable that solar power will be extensively employed.

If such a change in the major sources of power should occur, it would
tend to alter very much the distribution of population. Such a State
as New Mexico would become a great manufacturing center. With
machines of the type already devised, that State could furnish from
solar radiation more power than is now used for heat, light, trans-
portation, and manufacturing in the United States, and at a cost not
perhaps exceeding the present cost of power from coal.

There are two major difficulties in the way of utilizing solar radia-
tion. First, except on overcast days, the sun’s rays come from a moon-
sized spot, which moves daily through the sky from the eastern to the
western horizon, and yearly from 28° north to 28° south of the celes-
tial equator. Second, from sunset to sunrise the sun’s rays are wholly
cut off.

EARLY EXPERIMENTS

In one interesting series of experiments, reported by Willsie and
Boyle in Engineering News, May 18, 1909, the first difficulty was
avoided by employing a stationary horizontal receiver. This, how-
ever, is at great cost in thermodynamic efficiency, owing to the low
temperatures of operation, and to losses of radiation by reflection, due
to the very oblique incidence of the rays during many hours of the
day and year. It would seem fatal to sacrifice so much efficiency.

The work of Shuman at Tacony, Philadelphia, also reported in that
same issue of Engineering News, led on at length to the very different
experiments of Eastern Sun Power, Ltd., described by Ackermann in
the Smithsonian Report for 1915. These experiments came nearer
being a commercial success, I believe, than any others on solar power
up to that time. A large plant was erected near Cairo, Egypt, and
used for a time for irrigation from the Nile. It appears to have been
SOLAR RADIATION AS A POWER SOURCE—ABBOT 101

abandoned during and since the World War of 1914-18. In these ex-
periments the sun’s rays were roughly focused upon boilers, and thus
from the thermodynamic viewpoint more eligible temperatures were
attained than those of Willsie and Boyle’s experiments.

Some inventors have attempted to employ thermoelectricity or
photoelectricity as means of escaping from the necessity of working
through gaseous heat cycles to achieve mechanical motion. It is diffi-
cult to conceive that thermoelectric couples could ever be a valuable
expedient for this purpose. The electromotive forces available are so

small that the multiplication of couples is necessarily great, and the
apparatus required would contain enormous numbers of parts. The
wires used would all be metallic conductors of heat, so that a very large
fraction of the solar input would be dissipated in useless heat losses.
As for photoelectricity, it seems to be limited to comparatively narrow
regions of the spectrum, so that large fractions of the solar rays would
be wholly useless to these devices. Of the remaining useful rays, no
inconsiderable part would be converted into heat, and would also be
useless. I cannot think that at present these direct electrical conver-
sions of solar radiation seem promising solutions of the solar-power
problem.

INSTRUMENTS

Within the past quarter century, so much progress has been made
in the commercial use of aluminum products, and also of high-vacuum
technique, that it is possible for one who is familiar with the astrono-
mers’ solution of their problem of following the heavenly bodies with
telescopes to design types of apparatus for utilizing solar radiation
for power, combining minimum expense with maximum efficiency.

Formerly the choice for solar mirrors lay between mirror glass and
metals of rather low reflecting power and short reflecting life. Such
materials for mirrors were heavy, costly, inefficient, and quickly
deteriorating. We can now purchase commercially the bright reflect-
ing product called Alcoa in thin sheets of large size. It is a special
preparation of aluminum, long retaining its reflectivity, and with a
coefficient of reflection for solar rays slightly exceeding 80 percent.
Frames of suitable curvature being made from duralumin shapes,
these may be covered with the thin Alcoa sheets to make up cheap,
light, and fairly permanent solar mirrors.

In consideration of best design, we come to the question of waste
of heat. It is well known that heat is lost by three processes: conduc-
tion, convection, and radiation. Of these, metallic conduction would
be very important, as stated before, if one should be using a great
number of thermoelectric elements, but it is possible almost entirely
to eliminate losses by conduction with boilers of certain forms. With
moderate temperature differences, and for objects in the open air,
convection is a far greater dissipater of heat than radiation. But
direct convection may be eliminated almost altogether if the body
to be cooled is enclosed by highly evacuated space as commonly
practiced in the thermos bottle. In that case cooling proceeds almost
wholly by radiation from the inner to the outer wall of the enclosing
evacuated sheath, and thence by convection and radiation to the
surroundings. This consideration leads us to see at once that the
advantage of employing an evacuated sheath becomes less and less
as the temperature of the solar boiler rises higher and higher. For
radiation increases as the fourth power of the temperature for the
so-called black body or perfect radiator. Since we must use a trans-
parent sheath to admit rays to the boiler, it is not practicable to cut
down radiation by fully plating the inner wall of the evacuated
sheath, as in the thermos bottle. We must, therefore, regard the inner
wall of the sheath as approximately a “black body.” Hence the inner
wall of the evacuated sheath, when at high temperatures, will radiate
strongly to the outer wall, which conducts the heat to its outer
surface and there loses it by convection.

On this account it follows that although the sun’s temperature is
so high that boiler temperatures up to the melting point of materials
SOLAR RADIATION AS A POWER SOURCE——ABBOT 103

could readily be attained, this is not advantageous. For though the
thermodynamic efficiency factor 7,—7:/7, would gain, this would
be more than offset by the increased heat losses of the boiler. Fur-
thermore, though quartz glasses like Pyrex enable us to use transpar-
ent evacuated sheaths at fairly high temperatures, high vacua lose
their excellence with very high temperatures, so that convection
becomes serious.

On these accounts it is not desirable in solar-power machines to
employ boiler temperatures much above 200° C,. (392° F.). If oper-
ating to a condenser at 30° C., such a temperature of the boiler gives
a thermodynamic factor of 473—303/473=36 percent, which, for
reasons just explained, may be regarded as the maximum to be ex-
pected if due regard is paid to loss of heat from the boiler.

Another fundamental consideration in designing solar-power de-
vices is that the loss of heat from a body through convection or radia-
tion is directly proportional to the external area of the surface of the
body. Hence it is of importance for diminishing the waste of heat
that the boiler surface should be as small as possible, by using fairly
accurate optical mirror forms.

Astronomers have long ago agreed that the simplest mechanical
motions that could be devised for following celestial objects are those
of the equatorial telescope. This scheme involves mounting the in-
strument which is to follow the celestial object upon an axis parallel
to the earth’s axis, and imparting to this “polar axis” a uniform
motion of 15° per hour. If the instrument is to be adapted to follow
objects at different distances north or south of the celestial equator—
that is, of different declinations—there must be a second axis at right
angles carried by the polar axis. This second axis, called the decli-
nation axis, carries the telescope or other following device and is to
be set by hand to the position of any desired celestial object, and
clamped there. If the sun remained stationary with regard to the
celestial equator, no second axis would be needed in solar-power ma-
chines. But the sun travels through 47° north and south during the
year.

It is highly desirable to operate with a stationary boiler. The
withdrawal of steam from a moving boiler involves costly and un-
satisfactory connection. It is clear that a spherical boiler placed
in the intersection of the two axes of an equatorial mirror mounting
could be stationary. But it would be impossible to enclose thoroughly
with an evacuated sheath. The mirror in this case would be circu-
lar and preferably of parabolic curvature, which is an awkward
shape for fabrication.

It has seemed to me preferable to neglect the north-to-south mo-
tion of the sun, using a mirror rotating uniformly at 15° per hour
104 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

about a single polar axis. The boiler then becomes a tube of small
diameter lying in the axis. The vacuum sheath is an elongated
Pyrex thermos bottle, of which about one-third the circumference of
the outer surface of the inner wall is gold-plated. The mirror is
a rectangular concave cylindric mirror, of parabolic curvature, whose
equation, as I prefer it, is y? = 36z. The mirror is long and narrow
and rotates about its focus, the polar axis. Being long compared to
its width, the deliberate end-loss of light at the solstices, June 20 and
December 20, from neglecting the sun’s motion in declination, is not
serious, and this loss becomes zero at the equinoxes. The metallic

boiler tube is blackened by painting with a suspension of lampblack
in alcohol with a slight addition of shellac. At the low temperatures,
not exceeding 200° C., this paint does not burn. It absorbs about 95
percent of the solar radiation.

The mirror in my small model comprises several castings of alu-
minum, machined to accurate parabolic curves and joined by L-string-
ers of duralumin to form a cradle. To this cradle are attached Alcoa
sheets not previously bent, and held down by narrow metal straps
screwed through the sheets to the parabolic frames. At the ends the
mirror frame supports steel hanger bars which carry hollow trun-
nions, and supports above a counterbalance bar of metal, set edgewise
to the beam and extending from end to end of the mirror as a stif-

to carry rollers on which the trunnions rest with their axis parallel
to that of the earth. The elongated Pyrex thermos bottle enclosing
the boiler tube rests axial to the hollow trunnions and is closed at
the lower end.

To drive the mirror most conveniently, a worm-and-wheel mecha-
nism is attached to one end of the mirror and its support. The worm
is driven at the correct speed by a tiny 60-cycle electric motor. Where
alternating electric current is difficultly available, a weight drive may
be substituted, regulated by an escapement controlled by an ordinary

alarm clock. I have used such a contrivance successfully for a large
mirror on Mount Wilson.

For solar power, I prefer the “flash boiler” principle because of its
economy of fair skies? Even in the desert regions, cumulus clouds
occasionally hide the sun. If the boiler had a considerable ca-
pacity for heat, a series of such clouds might prevent getting full
steam pressure at all on a day when the sun shone clearly one-half
the time. But when the flash boiler is properly designed, full steam
pressure comes on within 5 minutes after the sun emerges from such
acJoud. This design involves the automatic regulation of the water
supply, to be completely turned to steam as fast as supplied while

106 |§ ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

the sun shines and to be completely cut off when the sun is obscured.
This requires a pump able to force water in against full steam pres-
sure, and so regulated by the temperature of the boiler that the water
flow ceases when the boiler cools, and reaches a maximum when the
boiler temperature reaches the point for the desired pressure of
steam.

I accomplish these objects by employing a diaphragm pump, whose
stroke is governed from zero to maximum displacement by a rotating
cam of regularly increasing throw, operating through a pitman upon
the pump. The cam is driven from the 60-cycle motor, above-men-
tioned, and is mounted on a longitudinally displaceable carriage. The
position of the carriage, and hence the throw of the cam, is governed
by the differential heat expansion between the boiler tube and a tape
of the nonexpansible alloy, invar, attached thereto.

The water is forced through a small tube centrally to the lower
end of the boiler tube, where it is guided by a spreader tube into a
thin sheet bathing the inner wall of the boiler tube. The water bursts
immediately into steam, which flows out to the engine through con-
nections from the upper end of the boiler tube. A maze of heat-con-
ducting copper vanes extends throughout the upper part of the boiler
tube, so that only dry steam can escape therefrom. In large solar-
power installations, no doubt it would be desirable to use auxiliary
superheaters.

The efficiency of such a device is a matter of critical interest for
the future of solar power. It may be estimated as follows:

Recalling, as stated above, that the average receipt of solar energy
throughout cloudless days in a favorable region corresponds to 1.15
horsepower per square yard of surface normal to the beam, we con-
clude that it will require a mirror of not less than 5.4 square yards, or
48.6 square feet, surface per horsepower under the most favorable of
circumstances. Such a mirror might well be 10 by 5 feet in projection.
When we consider wind resistance and other limitations, including
especially the glass tubing of the evacuated sheath, it seems difficult
SOLAR RADIATION AS A POWER SOURCE—ABBOT 107

to suppose that units of more than 5 horsepower (area of mirror
projection 121% by 20 feet) would be found desirable.

Such units could be assembled in groups of 30, occupying a ground
area 150 feet, east-west, by 250 feet, north-south, without undue
mutual shading, so as to give a maximum of 150 horsepower per
group. Such a group of machines could be mechanically operated
in common as regards rotation of mirrors and pumping of feed water.
They could also deliver steam to a common superheater for use.

It is estimated that the United States uses the equivalent of ap-
proximately 10 trillion horsepower hours of power annually for light,
heat, transportation, and manufacturing. Assuming, as above,
37,500 square feet of space required for 150 horsepower from the solar
source, there would be required 380,000 square miles of territory to
supply this entire requirement, assuming only 8 hours’ sunshine per
day of the average solar intensity stated above, namely, 1.35 calories
per square centimeter per minute. The State of New Mexico alone
has approximately four times this area.

COST AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The cost of solar power is difficult to estimate. It depends on the
quantity used. With large installations, care and upkeep would
become nearly negligible, so that, with a 10-percent return on invest-
ment, the cost of power at the plant might be estimated as less than
one-third cent per horsepower-hour.

There remains to consider the serious drawback that direct solar
power is unavailable at night. [or certain purposes, as irrigation,
this is not a serious objection.

However, since writing the above I have thought that the means
shown in United States Patent No. 2,247,830, of July 1, 1940, could
be expanded to include a strong insulated reservoir of water. Solar
heating would be conveyed to the water, by gravity circulation
through a coil immersed therein, from a black high-boiling liquid
filling a vacuum-sheathed glass focus tube. In this way all the ex-
pense of the flash boiler would be eliminated, all moments of solar
heating would be utilized, the water in the reservoir would be main-
tained in a superheated state night and day, and superheated steam
would issue to the engine on opening a cock.

SOME BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION 1

By Brian O’Brien
Institute of Optics
The University of Rochester

[With 1 plate]

Man and the higher animals depend for their very existence upon
sunlight. The temperature of the earth’s surface and of the earth’s
atmosphere is maintained within limits which can support life only
by the flood of radiation which comes to us from the sun. The power
supply for all air movement, all winds, everything that goes to make
up weather, is this same solar radiation. Most of the higher animals
and land plants can survive only with a supply of fresh water, a
supply which exists simply because of sunlight. Without the constant
working of the distillation plant which evaporates water from the
sea and condenses it as rain and snow there would be nothing but salt
water on the face of the earth. This distillation plant runs purely
by solar heat.

But our dependence upon the sun goes far beyond this. Animals
cannot by themselves synthesize food and fuel. Even man with all
his ingenuity has not yet learned to do this. He can convert food
from one kind to another, as he can convert fuel into altered and
more convenient forms, but he cannot yet create either. This job
is reserved for the green plants. The green coloring matter, chlo-
rophyll, permits a plant to utilize sunlight in converting carbon
dioxide and water vapor into sugars, starches, and cellulose. This
process, which literally unburns our coal as rapidly as an active
human race can burn it, supplies, directly or indirectly, all the food
and fuel available on the earth. Here again, through the medium
of plant life, man and the higher animals are dependent upon radia-
tion from the sun.

These relations of sunlight to man have been discussed in previous
Arthur lectures. Tonight I would like to discuss some less evident
effects of sunlight, which, though subtler, are important too. These

110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

have to do with biological effects, direct or indirect, of sunlight upon
the animal organism. They are specific and depend upon the wave
length and character of the ight. For this reason we must start by
considering something of the nature of the radiant energy which we
receive from the sun.

The light from most sources is made up of many different frequencies
or wave lengths, and sunlight is no exception to this rule. Such light
may be analyzed into a spectrum with a prism and the wave lengths
separated from each other, much as a chemist might make a qualitative
analysis to determine the elements of which some material or com-

pound is composed. If light from a narrow source or slit is allowed
to pass through a prism, a series of images will be produced corre-
sponding to the several wave lengths present, and so a spectrum is
formed, This spectrum shows the familiar sequence of colors of the
rainbow from violet at the short-wave-length end through blue, green,
yellow, orange, to red at the longest wave length which can be seen.
There are, of course, wave lengths beyond the range to which the eye
is sensitive. At longer wave length than the red is the infrared
extending for many octaves, and at shorter wave length than the
violet is the ultraviolet, a region which will be of particular interest
to us here.

It is of interest to know what wave lengths are present, but it is
even more important to know how much of each. This can be deter-

mined in a variety of ways. The most fundamental method consists
in converting the radiation into heat by absorption in a blackened
surface, and measuring the amount of heat produced in each narrow
region of the spectrum by the rise of temperature of a delicate elec-
trical thermometer. This is analogous to quantitative analysis by the
chemist. The energy in each wave length having been determined,
it may be plotted as a graph of energy against wave length, such a
plot representing the spectral-energy distribution of the light from
the particular source measured.

Fortunately, this has been carried out for solar radiation very
completely and with high accuracy by Dr. Abbot and his associates at
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, so that the spectral-
energy distribution of sunlight is now well known. Although the
measurements are made at the earth’s surface and are thus measure-
ments of sunlight after loss by transmission through the earth’s atmos-
phere, there is a perfectly definite procedure by which the amount of
this loss is determined, and so the spectral energy outside the earth’s
atmosphere as well as that at the earth’s surface is known. These
are plotted in figure 1. It will be seen that in sunlight the greatest
energy occurs in the visible region of the spectrum, the intensity falling
off rapidly as one passes beyond the violet into the ultraviolet region,
and falling off more slowly as one goes beyond the red into the infra-
red.

In order to act upon living matter, solar radiation must be absorbed
by some part of the living organism. In the case of micro-organisms,
this absorption occurs throughout the volume of the whole animal or
plant, much of the radiation passing entirely through the organism.
In the higher animals and man, practically all the radiation is ab-
sorbed in the skin, no significant amount penetrating to an appreciable
depth. In animals, even the skin is protected by the hair, which thus
becomes the principal absorber of light. Oddly enough, this absorp-
tion by hair is utilized by animals in at least one important vitamin
reaction. When radiation of wave length in or near the visible spec-
trum is absorbed by living matter, the energy is either converted into
heat or enters directly into a photochemical reaction. Either or both
of these effects constitute the first step in the direct action of sunlight
upon a living organism. Since this energy transformation must oc-
cur when and where the light is absorbed, we may expect a primary
action anywhere within a small organism. In larger organisms, and
in particular in higher animals and man, the primary action must oc-
cur at the surface; that is, in the skin.

Human skin is somewhat different from that of any animal, al-
though the gross structures are roughly comparable. Even unpig-
mented human skin absorbs ultraviolet light strongly, while at the
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

red end of the spectrum, unpigmented skin is a relatively poor ab-
sorber, reflecting back much of the light energy received. This is
shown by two photographs of unpigmented human skin which are
reproduced in plate 1. The first photograph was made with ultra-
violet radiation, while the second was made with infrared radiation at
a wave length just beyond the visible spectrum. For comparison a
block of white magnesium carbonate was held in the hand in both
photographs. This was a good diffuse reflector (i. e., “white”) in the
ultraviolet and infrared as well as in the visible spectrum.

Although unpigmented skin reflects much of the visible light near
the red end of the spectrum as well as the infrared just beyond, that
which is absorbed appears to produce a rather specific thermal reac-
tion. If one examines a cross section of human skin, it will be seen
that the overlying layers contain no pigment materials that absorb
red or near-infrared radiation strongly. Reflection does take place in
these regions, owing to the many discontinuities in refractive index
produced by the cell boundaries in the epidermis, but no measurable
absorption occurs until the level of the capillaries is reached at 1 milli-
meter or so beneath the surface. Here the blood pigments absorb
strongly, with the result that the temperature of this layer is elevated
above the surface temperature of the skin, and even above the depth
temperature of the body when the skin is exposed in not-too-cool air to
intense radiation. This effect was first observed by Carl Sonne, who
measured the temperature at successive depths beneath the skin’s sur-
face with a delicate needle thermocouple and found a marked rise in
temperature under intense illumination. The conversion of radiation
to heat at this level in the skin raises the temperature of the capillaries
above adjacent layers, heat being conducted both to the cooler skin
surface and the cooler tissues at a depth. Since the more sensitive
innervation is above the capillary layer, it should be possible to pro-
duce without discomfort a higher temperature in the capillary blood
by the direct absorption of radiation in it than by conduction of heat
from the skin surface inward, as would occur with a hot object held
against the skin. In the latter case, with the temperature gradient in-
ward, the nerve endings would be at a higher temperature than the
capillaries. Sonne reports capillary temperatures produced by light
absorption comparable to high fever temperatures, yet without dis-
comfort to the patient, and without a corresponding increase of either
surface or depth temperature. The significance of this effect is not
yet determined. It must occur in only moderate degree when human
skin is exposed to sunlight, since several times the intensity of sunlight
may be borne without discomfort.

With the exception of this thermal effect in the red and the near-
infrared, and excepting also the action of visible light upon the eye,
EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 113

there appear to be no other specific effects of sunlight upon any por-
tion of the animal organism until the ultraviolet limit of the sun’s
spectrum is reached. Effects of visible light upon the eye are, of
course, most important and profound, but except under destructively
intense illumination, the response of the eye appears to be limited

Most of you, I am sure, have experienced sunburn, or erythema,
produced by light, but have you considered how it comes about? In

spite of its name, sunburn is not a heat reaction, but a photochemical
reaction, produced without heat by ultraviolet light. Moreover, it is
not produced by all the ultraviolet spectrum, but only by a very nar-
row region at the extreme ultraviolet limit of the sun’s spectrum
confined to wave lengths less than about 3150 angstrom units. This
reaction appears to be a type of photo-oxidation, produced with the
aid of certain enzymes present in normal skin. Hausser and Vahle,
and later Hausser, determined the spectral sensitivity of this re-
action, obtaining a reaction curve showing two maxima and ap-
proaching zero for wave lengths longer than about 3150 angstroms.
This is shown in figure 2. These results have been confirmed by
Luckiesh, Holliday, and Taylor. The significance of erythema and
114. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

the subsequent pigmentation or tanning of the skin has been a dis-
puted point. The pigment of tanned skin is melanin, which appears
physiologically inert, produced by an oxidation reaction following ex-
posure to light. It seems most reasonable to suppose that the pri-
mary function of pigment is the protection it affords the underlying
portions of the skin and blood stream from further excessive exposure.

It is worth while to examine in more detail the ultraviolet end of
the sun’s spectrum responsible for this reaction. The area under a
spectral-energy distribution curve represents the energy in that
spectral region. It will be evident from figure 1 that the area under
the solar-energy distribution curve for all wave lengths shorter than

3150 angstroms represents less than one-thousandth of the area under
the total curve. The small energy involved renders the effects pro-
duced by this region of the spectrum the more remarkable.

It is noteworthy that at the earth’s surface the sun’s spectrum ter-
minates very abruptly at about 2900 angstrom units. The spectrum
of the stars and all known heavenly bodies terminates at about this
same wave length, and long ago the conclusion was inevitable that
something in the earth’s atmosphere must be absorbing abruptly at
this point. It is easy to produce much shorter wave lengths from
artificial light sources, and there is no reason to attribute this abrupt
termination to anything characteristic of the emission spectrum of
the sun and stars. More than 50 years ago Hartley correctly attri-
buted this abrupt termination to absorption by the gas ozone, tria-
EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 115

tomic oxygen, located somewhere in the earth’s atmosphere. Since
only traces of ozone could be detected in the atmosphere at the earth’s
surface, Hartley concluded that the ozone must be at a considerable
elevation. In 1920 Fabry and Buisson, at the University of Mar-
seilles, measured the ultraviolet end of the sun’s spectrum very care-
fully, and from these measurements and previous laboratory measure-
ments which they had made upon known amounts of ozone, concluded
that the total amount in the earth’s atmosphere was equal to a layer of
the pure gas about 3 millimeters thick at standard temperature and
pressure. Subsequent measurements have confirmed this, and we now
know that ozone is distributed in the earth’s atmosphere in amounts
dependent upon the latitude and the season of the year. This is im-
portant to us, since fluctuation in this amount of ozone causes a very
large fluctuation in the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the earth’s
surface at the limit of the sun’s spectrum.

The profound effect of ozone is evident from an examination of its
absorption spectrum. This is shown in figure 3 in the form of a plot
of optical density (logarithm to the base 10 of the reciprocal of the
transmission) as a function of wave length. The very rapid increase
in absorption at wave lengths below 3200 angstroms is evident from an
inspection of this curve.

Recently automatic instruments have been devised for measuring
by spectroscopic means the amount of ozone over any given station and
recording this amount from hour to hour. As might be expected, fluc-
tuations do occur, although the average amounts for any given week
or month appear to follow the general seasonal and latitude distri-
bution. In figure 4 is shown the day-to-day variation of ozone in a
zenith atmosphere over Rochester, N. Y. (latitude 43° 7’ N.), for 4
weeks in the summer. The two curves labeled “3050 A.” and “3110 A.”
are simply independent determinations of the same quantity and will
be seen to be very consistent.

Not only the amount of ozone in a zenith atmosphere but the angle
at which the sun’s rays pass through the atmosphere is of importance
in determining the ozone absorption. This will be evident from con-
sidering the path of solar rays through the atmosphere when the sun
is, say, 80° above the horizon. For this condition (a zenith angle of
60°) the light path will be increased by the secant of 60°, or by a
factor of 2. This is referred to as air mass 2, air mass 1 being the
mass of air through which light must travel in passing through a
zenith atmosphere.

A striking example of the influence of sunlight upon man is found
in the disease of rickets. Affecting infants and young children, it
was long known to be associated with dietary deficiencies and par-
ticularly with a deficiency of fats. Cod-liver oil was known to be an
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

important remedy and to be much superior to other fats for this
purpose. In 1890 Palm, observing that rickets was more prevalent
in the Temperate Zones than in the Tropics, and that there appeared
to be seasonal variations, attributed this to the influence of sunlight.
However, for many years thereafter little attention was paid to
Palm’s work, and the relation of light to rickets was considered inci-
dental. In 1919, however, Huldchinsky, working with undernour-
ished children in Vienna following the war, found that rickets could
be cured by exposure of the affected child to ultraviolet light from a
mercury arc. This surprising result was soon confirmed by work-
ers in various parts of the world, notably by Hess and his asso-
ciates. This discovery that exposure of a child to light could com-

pensate for a deficiency in diet was of great significance. Closer
attention was directed to the fats, and in 1924 Steenbock and, inde-
pendently, Hess reported that fats and oils which were not curative
in rickets could be rendered potent by exposure to ultraviolet light.
It became evident that the active principle, or vitamin D as it was
called, was being formed from some provitamin by the action of
light. Numerous investigations by Hess and his associates, by Rosen-
heim and Webster, by Windaus, and by others too numerous to men-
tion here, demonstrated that ergosterol, first isolated by Tanret in
1889, is a parent substance from which vitamin D is produced by
ultraviolet radiation.

At first it appeared that only from ergosterol could vitamin D be
formed. However, discrepancies were soon noted in the vitamin-D
potency of irradiated preparations when tested on birds (usually the
EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 117

chicken) as compared to tests on mammals (usually the rat). This
led to the discovery that at least one other substance, 7-dehydro-
cholesterol, could be converted into vitamin D by exposure to light.
Ergosterol is a characteristic plant sterol, while 7-dehydro-cholesterol
is a sterol found in animal substances. It seems probable therefore
that it is 7-dehydro-cholesterol and not ergosterol which is acted upon
when human skin is exposed to sunlight, and so converted into vitamin
D, which, entering the peripheral blood stream, prevents or cures
rickets in the child so exposed. It was first shown by Kon, Daniels,
and Steenbock that the quantum efficiency of the photochemical reac-

tion converting the sterol into vitamin D is substantially independent
of wave length, and there is reason to expect such a result. This
would mean that the energy efficiency of the reaction could be arrived
at from the characteristic absorption of the sterols as a function of
wave length. ‘These absorption curves are shown in figure 5, and it
should be necessary only to divide the ordinates by the energy value
of the quantum at each wave length (i. e., multiply the ordinates by
the wave lengths) to obtain the spectral-response curve. However,
such a spectral-response curve would be correct only when the sterol
was irradiated in dilute solution and in the absence of other con-
taminating substances exhibiting masking absorptions in the same
spectral regions. In animal skin the condition of dilution is no doubt
566766—44—_9
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

fulfilled, but many other light-absorbing substances are present. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the spectral response for the anti-
rachitic effect of ultraviolet radiation directly upon the animal’s skin
should be modified somewhat from the response of the pure sterol.
Knudson and Benford have measured this response in albino rats,
their results being shown also in figure 5. The response in human
skin may not be identical with that occurring in the albino rat, but
may well be very similar, so the results of Knudson and Benford pre-
sent the best approximation to date.

In order that we may calculate the antirachitic effect of sunlight °
under a variety of conditions when acting directly upon animal skin,
it is necessary that we know more than the spectral response per unit
energy shown in figure 5. In addition, it is necessary to have the
spectral-energy distribution at the short-wave-length end of the sun’s
spectrum for the several conditions under which we wish to calculate
the effect. Because of the strong selective absorption by ozone in
this region of the spectrum, the energy is dropping rapidly as one
proceeds to shorter wave lengths. For this reason the usual thermal
method for measuring spectral-energy distribution is not as satis-
factory as are certain photographic procedures. In these, suitable
precautions must be taken as have been described elsewhere, and a
double dispersion spectrographic instrument must be used to eliminate
the effects of scattered light. The details of these measurements will
be published elsewhere. The results are shown in figure 6 for the
spectral intensity of solar radiation as received at the earth’s surface
at sea level through a clear zenith atmosphere (air mass 1) for two
ozone quantities. The upper curve is for total ozone in a zenith
atmosphere equal to 2.0 millimeters of the pure gas at standard tempera-
ture and pressure, while the lower curve is for 2.8 millimeters of ozone
under the same condition. These curves have been smoothed to
eliminate the Fraunhofer structure while still preserving the correct
average ordinates over any small wave-length interval. This is to
simplify the graphical integration to be carried out as described below.

In general, sunlight must reach the earth’s surface after passing
obliquely through the earth’s atmosphere at some angle Z with the
zenith. This results in an increase in path through each stratum of
the atmosphere in the ratio of the secant of the zenith angle. The
resultant increase in absorption by the ozone and increase in scattering
by the air molecules can be calculated. The result is shown in the
curves of figures 7 and 8 for a series of air masses (i. e., secants of the
zenith angle), and for two quantities of ozone, 2.0 and 2.8 millimeters
S. T. P. in a zenith atmosphere.

EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 119

The antirachitic effect of sunlight for the several conditions of
ozone and air mass can now be calculated at each wave length by
multiplying the antirachitic response per unit energy (fig. 5) by the
solar energy at that wave length (figs. 7 and 8). This has been done
and the product at each wave length plotted to form the family of
curves in figures 9 and 10. For each condition of ozone and air mass
the solar antirachitic effect is represented by the integral of the

relative efficiency as a function of wave length. This is represented
by the area under the appropriate curve of figure 9 or figure 10. The
functions are not analytic, so the integration must be carried out by
graphical or mechanical means, but this is easily done with the aid
of a planimeter. The results of this integration are plotted in figure
11 in which the antirachitic efficiency of solar radiation is shown as a
function of air mass for 2.0 and 2.8 millimeters of ozone S. T. P. in
the atmosphere.
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

The significant feature of the curves of figure 11 is the rapid falling
off of the antirachitic effectiveness of sunlight, with increase in atmos-
pheric ozone and with increase in the air mass resulting from obliquity
of the sun’s rays. For air mass 2 corresponding to the sun 30° above
the horizon it will be noted that the antirachitic effect is less than
one-tenth that of the sun in the zenith under otherwise identical con-

ditions. For air mass 3 corresponding to the sun about 20° above
the horizon the effect has fallen to about one-eightieth that of the
zenith sun.

It now becomes possible to predict the antirachitic effectiveness of
sunlight for a clear day at any point on the earth’s surface at any
season and at any time of day, providing only that the zenith ozone
over the station be known. This has been carried out for latitudes
33°, 38°, and 43°, and for the conditions of 2.0 and 2.8 millimeters of
ozone, representing average low and average high ozone quantities

for the Temperate Zones. The results are shown in figures 12 and 13
for clear days at noon as a function of time of year. The scale of
months is for north latitudes, but exactly similar curves will apply
to south latitudes except that the scale for time of year must be
shifted by 6 months from the indicated values. In order to show the

two selected quantities of ozone, it is necessary to plot six families
of curves. These are shown in figures 14 to 19, inclusive. It will be
noted that near midsummer the spread in latitude between 33° and
43° results in only a slight drop in the effectiveness of sunlight near
noon, providing that the ozone is constant. In midwinter the effective
change of latitude is far more important, the 10° difference between
33° and 43° resulting in a change in effectiveness of sunlight of more
than fourfold.
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

The seasonal and geographic differences in antirachitic effect are
more impressive when one considers the actual exposure to sunlight
necessary to protect a child against rickets. This figure is not easy
to arrive at, since it is difficult to control the factors in any single
direct experiment with sufficient accuracy. However, there is indirect
evidence from which we may arrive at 15 minutes’ exposure per day
of a nude child to zenith clear-day sunlight under tropical (2.0 milli-
meters ozone) conditions as entirely adequate to protect against
rickets, even in the absence of other vitamin-D intake. A Negro

child may require somewhat greater exposure because of loss of radia-
tion in the skin pigment, although this is by no means demonstrated.
If we use the above figure of 15 minutes per day, the scale is immedi-
ately set for figures 11 through 19. Thus for sun in the zenith and 2.8
millimeters ozone in the atmosphere, 27 minutes per day (clear sky)
would be required. For midwinter conditions at the higher latitudes
the exposures become so long as to be entirely out of the question.
For example, in midwinter at 48° latitude with 2.8 millimeters ozone
in the zenith atmosphere the exposure required even at noon on a
clear day would be 66 times 15 minutes, or more than 16 hours, and
even with only 2.0 millimeters of ozone in the atmosphere the expo-
EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 123

sure required would be more than 7 hours! Evidently even in ideal
weather one cannot rely upon direct exposure to winter sunlight in
the higher latitudes, and it is upon the winter food supply that the
population must depend except in tropical or semitropical latitudes.
Actually much of the vtiamin D in the food may have been sunlight-
produced, but this topic lies outside of our present discussion.

The calculations thus far have been limited to the three latitudes
33°, 38°, and 43°. In figure 20 is shown a reproduction of a United
States Geological Survey map upon which these three latitudes have

been drawn. It will be seen that these latitudes are fairly represent-
ative of the United States, although significant areas of the country
lies above 48° and below 33°. Similarly in figure 21 latitudes 33° and ©
43° north and south of the Equator have been drawn on a Mercator
projection of the earth’s surface. It will be seen that a substantial
portion of the populated areas is included within these latitude belts.
If one desires the antirachitic effect of sunlight outside these belts it
is only necessary to determine the zenith angle of the sun for the
place, time of year, and time of day with the aid of a nautical almanac.
The secant of this zenith angle determines the air mass from which
the relative antirachitic effect may be determined by reference to
figure 11.

The phenomenon of sunburn is probably of less physiological im-

worth while to calculate the relative erythema production by sunlight

43° and 3.0 millimeters of ozone in the zenith atmosphere. The ex-
posure to sunlight necessary to produce an erythema varies greatly
among individuals and is dependent upon the condition of the skin.
The skin of a sensitive individual not previously exposed to ultra-
violet radiation will show an erythema reaction if exposed for about
15 minutes to zenith sunlight through 3.0 millimeters of ozone.

In contrast with the effects just discussed, the destruction of bac-
teria by ultraviolet light is a typical example of the influence of
radiation upon micro-organisms. Also it is probable that its impor-
tance to the human race is as great as any of the reactions mentioned
above, for by this means sunlight keeps bacterial growth in check.
Because of the small size of the individual bacterium most of the ultra-

EFFECTS OF SOLAR RADIATION—O’BRIEN 131

As early as 1877 Downes and Blunt investigated the destruction of
putrefactive bacteria by sunlight and made rough measurements of
the relative action of different colors. There followed many investi-
gations of the effect of ultraviolet light on bacteria, but the spectral-
response curve for this reaction was not determined for more than 50
years. It was measured by H. W. Lyall and myself in 1926 and inde-
pendently by Sonne in 1927. We had expected the spectral-response
curve to be quite different for different bacteria, but to our surprise
eight pathogenic and two saprophytic organisms showed surprising
similarity in spectral response, although those selected included cocci,
Gram-negative baccili, and two acid-fast strains. Our most complete

work was done with a strain of Staphylococcus aureus. 'The spectral
response of this organism is shown in figure 25. It is interesting to
note that Sonne’s measurements on the colon bacillus agree almost
perfectly with this curve, although the characteristics of the colon
bacillus are different in every respect from those of Staphylococcus
aureus. More recently similar measurements have been made by
Gates, with good agreement over part but not all of the spectral range.

We may calculate the seasonal variation in the bactericidal effect
of sunlight by following the same procedure already applied to the
antirachitic and erythema reactions. This has been carried out to
form the product curves of figure 26, for the condition of 3.0 milli-
meters of ozone in the zenith atmosphere. The integrals of these

plotted the bactericidal effect as a function of time of year for clear

curve with time of year is similar to the curve for antirachitic and
erythema effects, it will be noted that the summer-to-winter differ-
ence is even greater. Because of this the effective bactericidal action
of sunlight is even more dependent upon short air path (sun near

zenith) than are the antirachitic and erythemal reactions. Thus the
effects of latitude, time of year, and time of day are all more
pronounced.

In spite of the similarity in the spectral sensitivity of different bac-
teria to ultraviolet light, there is a considerable difference in the ab-
solute exposure necessary to destroy different strains. Acid-fast or-
ganisms, such as the tubercle bacillus, are relatively resistant to ultra-
violet ight and require for their destruction an exposure of about 14
minutes to zenith sunlight through 3.0 millimeters of ozone. Certain
Gram-negative organisms, such as the colon bacillus and particularly
Baccillus paratyphosus B, require an exposure of only about 2 min-
utes to sunlight for complete destruction. Most pathogenic bacteria
appear to lie between these two extremes as regard sensitivity to
ultraviolet light. From this the scale can be set for figures 27 and 28.

It will be seen that even very resistant bacteria are quickly destroyed
by summer sunlight, but that even the more sensitive organisms will
not be destroyed by all-day exposure to midwinter sunlight in the
higher latitudes.

It is difficult to evaluate the full significance to the human race of
this solar bactericidal action. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun
and desiccation are the two great natural agencies for destroying bac-
terial growth, and of these the former is probably the more im-
portant. Here again man’s very existence must depend upon ultra-
violet radiation, without which bacteria and other micro-organisms
would crowd him from his place in the sun.

THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE?

By H. F. Armsrrone, D. Sc., F. R. S.

[With 4 plates]

In an island country the quest for relaxation normally brings the
great majority of us to the coast for holidays, where we make ac-
quaintance with the sea and perhaps also with some of its wonders and
the things which live and grow in it. Many people cross the narrow
seas to the continent, in others the urge of discovery takes them across
the oceans: all are conscious of the immensity of the sea and the fact
that it is salt.

Saltness is an indication that substances in some quantity are dis-
solved in the water, largely common salt, which in many lands is won
from the sea by solar evaporation. Sea water contains appreciable
quantities of other salts besides sodium chloride, in particular of mag-
nesium and potassium sulfates and chlorides. More complete analy-
sis has disclosed the presence of quite minute quantities of other ele-
ments present to the extent of 1 part in 1,000 or less, and still others
present in even more minute quantity; and a little reflection shows that
this must be so, for the oceans are the ultimate receptacle of everything
that is washed from the land by the rain and carried by the rivers into
the sea. This includes both dissolved and suspended matter.

The wind and the rain and frost—the agencies of destruction and
denudation—break down the hills and scour the valleys. Acid waters
on the moors, neutral or alkaline waters on the plains, salt water in
the sea, all act to bring into solution traces of the most sparingly solu-
ble substances. The quantity of any one of the rarer constituents of
the earth’s crust in a million parts of sea water is minute and, indeed,
many are only detectable by the most refined methods of the analytical
chemist. Some, indeed, can only be found in the ashes of plants.

About three-fourths of the earth’s surface is water. In bulk this
is estimated to amount to 300 million cubic miles.

A cubic mile seems to be a handy unit for statistics regarding the
content of minerals. It is, however, a gigantic unit, for in round fig-
ures it will contain 6 million tons of magnesia, 4 million tons of potash,

1 Reprinted by permission from Discovery, March 1943.
135
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

117 million tons of common salt, and some 300,000 tons of bromine,
which is present to the extent of less than 70 parts per 1 million of sea
water.

Such quantities, if extracted, would satisfy the world for a con-
siderable time, while a cubic mile of sea is not out of range of a
single plant located on an ocean seaboard. The sea clearly forms
an inexhaustible storehouse of minerals, provided that man can find
out how to recover them individually at prices comparable with the
cost of winning the same substances from the earth.

THE COMPOSITION OF OCEANS

Before describing what has been done in this direction, it is well
to devote a few words to the composition of the oceans. One theory
is that they have been salt from the beginning rather than the alter-
native theory that they have become so by washing out of salts from
the land and gradual concentration by evaporation of the oceans.
This hypothesis is based on the great similarity between the salts of
the ocean and the gaseous products of volcanic eruptions rich in chlo-
rides and sulfates of all kinds. The theory explains the main con-
stituents, though it does not necessarily apply to the trace elements
where any postulate of constancy of composition is untenable.

Apparently the first quantitative analyses of sea water were made
by Lavoisier in 1872.

It transpires that the variations in the proportions of individual
salts to the total salts are very small; sea water may be regarded as of
constant composition, the individual ingredients being considerably
dissociated in the dilute solution. This interdiffusion accounts easily
for the uniformity of composition of sea water throughout the
whole ocean, so that the only appreciable difference from point to
point is the total salinity of the mixed solutions.

In each of the three oceans the salinity is lower in the equatorial
regions where the rainfall is high; there are two maxima—one in the
north, the other in the south tropical belts where evaporation pre-
dominates; at the Poles there are regions of lower salinity. The North
Atlantic maximum is the highest at 37.9 parts per 1,000 salinity; as
a whole, the Atlantic has the highest salinity of 35.37. The average
of the whole surface of the oceans may be taken as 34.5. There is a gen-
eral increase of salinity with depth.

Common salt is essential to both man and beast; we need more salt
as the proportion of meat we eat diminishes. In Britain and else-
where there are large deposits of pure salt resulting from the drying
up of inland seas in past geological ages. This is recovered by mining
or more generally by dissolving the salt underground, pumping up
the brine, and evaporating it. The export of salt from England has
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 137

long been a significant part of our overseas trade: it is the founda-
tion stone of the heavy chemical industry, and salt and the “heavy
chemicals” made from it have helped to make Liverpool one of the
world’s greatest ports.

Less favored countries where, however, evaporation exceeds precipi-
tation of water are driven to making an impure salt from thé sea by
allowing it to evaporate in basins in the heat of the sun until it
crystallizes. This is termed solar salt.

In England the deposits of salt are not capped with beds of mag-
nesium and potash salts, but at Stassfurt in Germany there is a great
thickness of these; and it would seem that in geological times a lake
approximating closely in composition to sea water had dried up
completely here leaving everything behind. Stassfurt in consequence
enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the production of potash salts and of
bromine.

The Dead Sea, and certain lakes in America, represent inland seas
evaporated almost to the point of crystallization in which, however,
the salts have a different composition than in sea water. Sulfates,
for example, are absent from the Dead Sea, a fact which makes the
isolation of the other salts more simple. In such lakes it is possible
to assume that the salt is derived from rivers or underground springs,
which themselves pass through and leach out earlier deposits.

At Seales Lake in California, where evaporation is nearly complete,
the salt crust has the appearance of a frozen waste and is so hard
that a motorcar may be safely driven over it. At first potash and
borax were made from the deposits; a byproduct is burkeite, a remark-
able double salt of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate. This lake
also serves as a source of more than half the world’s very tiny pro-
duction of lithium salts. Lithium is an odd element; it is allied to
sodium and is beginning to find commercial applications which will no
doubt multiply when it is available in quantity at an attractive price.
Sea water contains about 1 part in 10 million lithium.

BROMINE

Apart from the quite minor amount of solar salt produced, the
mineral reserves of the ocean had not been tapped until a start was
made with the recovery of bromine in 1924. There is the same element
of romance in tapping the resources of the ocean as in turning to
practical use the rare gases of the atmosphere: in both the elements
sought are present in minute proportions, beth are all around us in
unlimited quantities.

Bromine in the past was largely a Stassfurt monopoly and ex-
pensive; it was used in photography, drugs, and dyestuffs in quan-
tities measured in pounds rather than tons. The need for it in
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

quantity arose out of the search for substances which could be added
to petrol to prevent the engines of automobiles knocking. Midgley
solved this problem with a chemical known as tetraethy! lead dissolved
in ethylene bromide—the substance marketed as “Ethyl.” At once
very large quantities of bromine were needed, and a new cheap source
out of the control of the monopoly had to be found.

Work was begun in 1924 by a process which involved the addition
of aniline to chlorinated sea water to form tribromoaniline. After
laboratory trials the process was operated on board a boat, the S. S.
Ethyl, fitted out as a chemical factory.

This sailed off the coast of North Carolina and the voyage was
successful though it was not repeated. The experience gained was
applied to an alternative method which consists in (a) oxidizing
the bromide in brine with clorine, (6) blowing the free bromine out
of solution with air, (c)absorbing the bromine with an alkali car-
bonate solution from which it can be recovered in a commercially
desirable form.

Every stage in this process had to be carefully worked out in the lab-
oratory. Sea water is alkaline, the equivalent of 1 ounce of caustic
soda in 1,000 tons of water. Even this small quantity gives con-
ditions unsuitable to the oxidation. Acid must be added, the right
quantity being 0.27 pound of 96 percent sulfuric acid per ton of sea
water. These figures are quoted to show the layman how sensitive
chemical reactions are to small things, in particular to the acid-alkali
reaction of the medium. The biochemist has of late years discovered
that the reactions in the living body are even more sensitive to these
acid-alkali variations.

The conditions of the operations having been settled by the chemist,
the next step is for the engineer to design a plant (a) to carry out the
chemical changes, (6) to bring the water from the sea in the required
large quantity.

It requires 4,000 gallons of sea water to yield 1 pound of bromine, so
that a factory making 15,000 pounds a day must be able to pump 60
million gallons. The engineering problem of the intake of such quan-
tities, the freeing of the water from extraneous matter and sedi-
ment and its delivery continuously to the plant, all at low cost, has
been one of the first magnitude; it required great ingenuity and fore-
sight. It is clear that it would not do to put the extracted water back
in the sea. It has to be discharged some way off, for example, on the
other side of an isthmus where the set of the currents prevents its
mixing with the untreated incoming water. Obviously the choice of
location of a sea-water plant is both all-important and limited.

When the operations are all finished the bromine is obtained in
liquid form. Its transport requires special bottles and is costly. It
is therefore at once converted on the same site into ethylene bromide.
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 139

The first bromine recovery plant, started in 1934, worked efficiently
from the outset, producing 15,000 pounds of bromine per day; the
yields over all were high. Many thousands of tons are now produced
per annum, and bromine today belongs to the class of substances of
which the cost is reasonable and the supply assured for all time. The
chemical engineer and the Dow Chemical Co. have had their first vic-
tory over the sea.

Calculations indicate that there are nearly 1 billion tons of bromine
in the Dead Sea. As this sea is evaporated to the point of crystal-
lization of the sodium chloride the concentration of bromine is nearly
90 times that in the seven seas, and the ease and cost of its recovery
should be less. However, the possibilities of obtaining low costs are
superior in industrial America to what they are in Palestine; more-
over, any bromine produced here is a long way from the user. It is
probable therefore that bromine from the sea will always remain com-
petitive with that produced in Palestine, while users will have the ad-
vantage of reasonable prices brought about by such rivalry.

Dr. Ernst Bergmann in his paper before the recent British Asso-
ciation Conference on Mineral Resources, reminds us that the Mid-
dle East shows a certain affinity to bromine. He recalls that the an-
tique purple, used in the Imperial toga, manufactured in Sidon and
Tyre, is a coloring matter containing bromine. Tyrian purple is one
of the few known organic bromine compounds found in a living cell.
The purple snail from which it was obtained is one of the several
known strange instances, of which more anon, of selective affinity of
cells to a special element.

Dr. Bergmann makes the interesting suggestion that in past ages
vast numbers of maritime organisms containing bromine have decayed
in the soil in Palestine, and that today the hot springs of the Sea of
Galilee derive their bromine from this source. It is probable that all
the bromine in the Dead Sea is derived from these springs.

MAGNESIUM

This success with bromine partly prepared the way for the next
problem, the recovery of magnesium. On January 21, 1941, the first
commercial ingot made in America from sea water was produced in
the plant of the Dow Company at Freeport, Tex. The urge was again
economic; the demand for magnesium for aircraft parts suddenly
reached vast proportions, for as much as 1,000 pounds may enter into
the manufacture of a single plane. Magnesium, the lightest of metals,
cost a sovereign a pound in 1915 and barely a shilling last year. The
metal was first made around 1869, mainly as a source of high-intensity
light for photographic purposes. Later sundry other uses, including
fireworks, came along. It awaited war to start its use in airplanes,
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

incendiary bombs, and military pyrotechnics. Today tens of thou-
sands of tons are required.

Magnesium in combination is one of the most abundant elements
on the earth’s crust. The most favored source is magnesite, which in
particular is used for refractories. Other sources are dolomite, which
consists of calcium and magnesium carbonates, and carnallite from
Stassfurt, which is a double chloride of magnesium and potassium.

If the metal is to be made by electrolysis—hitherto the favored
process—magnesite has to be converted into chloride by briquetting
the calcined material with carbon and binding substance and exposing
to the action of chlorine in an electric furnace. Since in the course of
electrolysis chlorine is evolved, the process becomes in theory cyclic,
although in practice there is waste through formation of hydrogen
chloride.

Faced with the large new requirements, the sea seemed an obvious
source of magnesium chloride. The knowledge about the intake of
sea water and the location of a plant was available. In addition,
cheap power and plentiful supplies of lime, the other necessary raw
material, were requisites. The latter also came from the sea in the
form of oyster shells dredged from the bottom of Galveston Bay,
which, when washed, go straight to the lime kiln. Some 300,000,000
gallons of sea water per day are drawn into the plant.

Though in practice the recovery of magnesium metal from sea
water involved comparatively simple operations chemically, it is far
from being an easy task economically to utilize a raw material which
contains only about 1 part of magnesium in 800 of water. Quite
unusual chemical engineering methods, equipment, and control, had
to be invented. Such work involves research on the grand scale by
large teams of chemists and engineers. It is Discovery with a capital
D, and costs very large sums of money.

The magnesium is precipitated as hydroxide by means of lime.
This is collected on special filters and converted into chloride using
for this operation a 10 percent aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid
which is largely derived from a later stage of the operation. The
magnesium chloride is evaporated and dried until anhydrous, when
it is electrolyzed in suitable cells to produce metallic magnesium.
Natural gas is used as the source of power and heat. The effluent water
is discharged 7 miles from the intake, which is almost 30 feet below the
surface so as to obtain the highest concentration of salts. The current
of sea water is always in the same direction, which prevents mixing.
There is a bromine factory on the same site and the two effluents, the
one acid and the other alkaline, mingle.

We have been able to describe the work done in the United States
on these materials since it has been widely published in the technical
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 141

press. Their manufacture has not been neglected in this country and
great credit is due to the British Periclase Co. and to Dr. H. H. Chesny,
and no doubt to others of whom we shall hear more after the war,
for their achievements.

There are no oyster shells on the British beach; it was evidently not
the one chosen by the Walrus and the Carpenter for their walk. But
there was a convenient source of dolomite which is quarried and
calcined in shaft kilns and the resulting mixed lime slaked with suf-
ficient water to give a thin slurry.

This slurry is allowed to react with sea water previously treated
and filtered to remove bicarbonate hardness and suspended matter in
a special reaction vessel. The calcium hydroxide precipitates the
magnesium salts in the sea as magnesium hydroxide while the mag-
nesium oxide from the dolomite remains unchanged and in suspension.
The resultant mixture is pumped into large circular tanks, where the
magnesia settles out and the spent sea water passes to waste.

The settled magnesia slurry is filtered off by means of rotary
vacuum filters, and the paste obtained burned in pulverized-coal-fired
rotary kilns. The temperature of firing is varied according to whether
it is desired to produce reactive caustic magnesia for the magnesium
industry, or dead-burnt magnesium oxide for the manufacture of
refractories.

By this ingenious modification magnesium is obtained from dolomite
and from the sea by one and the same operation.

POTASSIUM SALTS

It would be possible to recover a potassium salt from the sea, but
here the economics are not yet favorable. The main use for potash
salts is as fertilizers, which command a low price. Moreover, there
is a source of potash in the Dead Sea, now under rapid development,
which will insure sufficient supply of these to meet world demand at
competitive prices and will destroy the Stassfurt monopoly. There
are also similar sources of supply in the United States. The quantity
of potassium chloride in the Dead Sea is estimated at 2 billion tons.

As the concentration of salts is greater at the bottom of the Dead
Sea than at the surface, the solution is pumped from depth and
evaporated fractionally in shallow natural pans which have an im-
pervious clay bottom. First, common salt crystallizes, then a some-
what impure double salt of potassium and magnesium chloride termed
carnallite, and finally magnesium chloride; the mother liquors go
to the bromine plant. The chemists of the Palestine Potash Co. have
made a very thorough study of the sequence of events involved in the
evaporation and crystallization, and by an ingenious application of
the knowledge of the solid equilibria of the salts concerned coupled
142 § ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

with first-class chemical engineering technique are able to produce
highly purified potassium chloride.

Over 40 years ago the distinguished Dutch chemist, Van’t Hoff, and
his pupils, made a profound study of the sequence of events on con-
centrating sea water at 25° C. The order in which the various salts
are deposited was found to be in very fair agreement with the geologi-
cal succession as observed at Stassfurt, though there are indications
that these dried up at a slightly higher temperature. These celebrated
deposits consist of an immense thickness of rock salt, interspersed at
fairly regular intervals with narrow bands of anhydrous calcium sulfate
capped with beds rich in magnesium and potassium salts. The beds
are obviously of marine origin, but a constant flowing-in of water con-
taining salts during the period of evaporation must be assumed to
account for the magnitude of the deposit. The inland sea ultimately
dried up completely.

The extensive salt beds in Cheshire have no potassium or magnesium
salts, and it must be assumed that in this locality the remaining waters
went elsewhere before final evaporation.

In the Dead Sea the process of salt accumulation and evaporation
go on at the same time. The level is roughly constant, though it
varies a little from season to season and decade to decade. Evapora-
tion thus keeps pace with the inflow of fresh water. The Jordan and
other rivers bring in 40,000 tons of potassium chloride per annum.
The ratio of the various salts remains constant. The relative quanti-
ties differ from those in the sea and in salt deposits; in particular there
is no sulfate.

The magnesium content of the Dead Sea is some eight or nine times
that of the oceans, but here again it is the relative costs at the two sites
and the cost of transport to and from them that settle the competitive
effort. It is quite clear that given a demand for large quantities of
magnesium its manufacture from the ocean will continue.

Dr. Bergmann and the Palestine Potash Co. draw an attractive
picture of the potentialities of establishing a large chemical industry
there from which the markets in the Middle and Far East can be
supplied. The factors are there—and who knows what the future
may produce?

PHOSPHATES

It may well be that the minerals in the sea can be considered in two
classes, namely, (a) those present in constant proportion to each other
and in relatively large amount, i. e., the salts formed from the elements
sodium, potassium, magnesium, chlorine, bromine, sulfur in the form
of sulfates, and (0) those present in traces and though universal are
possibly in variable amount locally. Fresh supplies of these are being
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 143

received all the time from the land and returned, as we shall see, to the
bottom of the ocean.

Analyses of sea water showing the amount of the rarer minerals
are so far scanty, and it cannot, for example, be said that a particular
compound is present everywhere to the same extent. Evidence is
also lacking whether some of them are accumulating or whether they
are being deposited either as such or after absorption into the struc-
ture of some marine organism. The occurrence of minerals in veins
or lodes in sedimentary rocks gives support to the idea of deposition.
Moreover, the vast deposits of limestone and chalk so characteristic
of southern England are all derived from organisms which have
taken up the traces of calcium salts from the sea. Elsewhere calcium
has been deposited as sulfate.

At this stage therefore one can state purely as a working hypothesis
that while the ocean is constant in composition in regard to its main
constituents it is variable and even local in regard to the trace
elements.

Quite another problem is the fate of those minerals the world
over which are constantly reaching the sea either from sewage or by
the leaching out of cultivated lands. While these in the aggregate
total far less than what is produced by denudation, they are of im-
portance because they represent the constituents which are of primary
value to man.

One of the most interesting of these is phosphate, of which the
mineral deposits are limited in amount and may well become ex-
hausted. Many of the agricultural soils of the world are definitely
short of phosphates and their crop-bearing qualities impaired in
consequence. A new widely distributed source of phosphate would
therefore be of great value and importance.

It has been calculated that the sewage from 5 million people is
equivalent to 17,000 tons of rock phosphate in a year, and this happens
to be the quantity present in the annual export of meat from New
Zealand, which Dominion is the loser of the same amount. The popu-
lation of Great Britain discards as sewage the equivalent of 150,000
tons of rock phosphate, most of which reaches the sea. An estimate
of the annual losses of phosphate from all sources to the sea in the
United States amounts to the equivalent of 60 million tons of rock.
The world’s consumption of phosphate rock is said to be 18 million
tons; there are of course other sources of phosphatic fertilizers.

The question may well be asked, what is happening to the phos-
phate; is it being concentrated and removed or deposited? Here is
an interesting problem for study. The concentrations of nitrates,
phosphates, and silicates in sea water are subject to considerable
fluctuation depending on the activity of the marine organisms, and
144. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

although the absolute figures may appear insignificant these fluctua-
tions may have a strong effect on the population of the sea. Indeed,
this is subject to regular cyclic changes very pronounced in planktonic
forms.

The annual crop of plankton depends on the amount of phosphates
and nitrates, and there is an apparent relation beween the quantity
of phosphate available at the beginning of each year and the number
of young fish which have had enough food and survived during the
ensuing summer months. In temperate seas almost all these salts have
been used up during the summer and continued growth depends on
new supplies brought up from below by vertical mixing caused by
convection currents during the winter, when a rather thorough re-
newal takes place.

SOFTENING SEA WATER

The chemist is already searching for materials capable of selectively
absorbing and retaining substances present in small quantities in
large volumes of water. Such base-exchanging materials are widely
used in the softening of hard waters, a process which involves the
replacement of soap-destroying and scale-forming calcium and mag-
nesium by relatively innnocuous sodium. Natural zeolites were first
used for this purpose and later supplemented by artificial zeolites
and by sulfonated carbonaceous materials. These last offer the addi-
tional advantage of replacing the calcium or magnesium with hydro-
gen instead of sodium if desired. In this way the dissolved salts can
be removed altogether instead of merely replaced. Such a process
is particularly valuable in water for boilers. They are made by treat-
ing coal or lignite with strong reagents such as fuming sulfuric acid,
sulfur trioxide, chromic acid, etc. The active group in these zeolites is
believed to be a sulfonic acid group.

Much the same principle explains the action of polyhydric phenol
formaldehyde resins. These contain hydrogen (in an hydroxyl group)
which readily goes into solution to replace calcium or sodium ions
and forms acids. Such resins are reported as physically more stable
and faster in action than the other softeners mentioned. There is
another group of resins described as amine-formaldehyde, which
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 145

achieves actual removal of the acids just mentioned. The mechanism
is obscure, but it may include both surface absorption and reaction of
the acids with the amine group. Resin treatment may convert an
ordinary hard water into something approaching distilled water.

Naturally experiments have been made along these lines with sea
water with the hope of being able to convert it into drinking water
for shipwrecked mariners in apparatus small enough to be carried in
lifeboats. The amount of salt in the sea makes this problem a very
difficult one and the solution is not yet in sight.

It seems clear that in these base exchangers the chemist has useful
tools to effect the concentration of small quantities of dissolved sub-
stances. Some technical applications are already known, but we
would illustrate what it is hoped to achieve by citing some results
obtained with copper by Professor Furnas and R. H. Beaton working

at Yale.
COPPER

The ideal conditions using carbonaceous zeolites have been deter-
mined. The absorption for copper is a function of the ratio of cop-
per ions to hydrogen ion concentrations, or in more simple language
there are ideal conditions of acidity favoring the transfer of copper
from solution to zeolite. The collection of copper is complete and
takes place at a rapid rate of flow of the very dilute solution over
the columns of the exchanger. The recovery of the copper when the
zeolite is saturated is effected by fairly strong solutions of sulfuric
acid. At the same time the zeolite is regenerated for another cycle.
There remains as final product a strong solution of copper sulfate.

Putting the results in plain figures rather than in the form favored
by the chemist, it appears that a solution which contained 1 pound of
copper in 6,300 pounds of water is turned into one of copper sulfate
containing 1 pound of copper in 6.87 pounds of water. To do this
1.54 pounds of sulfuric acid (100 percent strength) are necessary, and
simple arithmetic indicates that 1 pound of acid performs the same
duty as the evaporation of 4,200 pounds of water. This illustrates
the tremendous difference in energy requirements between the base
exchange process and evaporation for the concentration of very dilute
solutions and is evidence of the unique possibilities of the use of
zeolites.

The Yale achievement of increasing the concentration of copper
in dilute solutions is rivaled by that of the oyster which we must be
prepared to treat with greater respect after learning that it gargles
a barrel of water per day. Around the British Isles and in certain
sections of the Atlantic coast oysters become green due to the forma-
tion of a pigment containing copper. The amount of copper which
an oyster can accumulate is variable; it varies in the Cape Cod variety
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

from 0.16 to 0.24 mg. per oyster, and from 1.24 to 5.12 mg. per oyster
in Long Island Sound, where the average is 2.5 mg. This last figure
has enabled someone to calculate that in Long Island Sound the
oysters accumulate about 7.5 tons of copper every year from the sea.

The average content of copper in the sea appears to be of the order
of 0.01 part per 1 million. There is more copper in the fresh water
coming into Long Island Sound than in the sea; indeed, the amount
there fluctuates between 1 part per 1 million at high water and 0.5
part per 1 million at low tide.

Copper salts apparently have a peculiar effect on oyster larvae,
inducing their attachment to the substratum and initiating their
metamorphosis. The result is that the best settling areas are found
on bottoms affected by fresh water, while natural oyster beds occur
mainly in the mouths of rivers. It has been estimated in the United
States that 200 tons of copper are lost in sewage each year per 1 mil-
lion people, together with 50 tons each of such metals as magnesium,
lead, aluminium, and titanium. The 10 million people of New York
City provide on this recovery ample copper for their oysters.

Copper is well known as the metal in the respiratory pigment,
haemocyanin, which is present in lobsters, shrimps, crawfish, and
other shellfish and plays the same part as iron does in haemoglobin,
the respiratory pigment of human red blood corpuscles. It is found
in sardines, herrings, salmon, and other sea animals, and is obviously
quite an essential element in marine life notwithstanding its lowly
proportion in the sea.

A considerable proportion of the trace elements seem to be con-
cerned in the life history of marine organisms. Where there is plenty
of an element the organisms flourish, where it is scanty they are ab-
sent. When the organisms flourish they live their allotted span and
die, their skeletons falling to the depths of the ocean and decom-
posing into their constituents. Where there are vertical currents the
trace elements are brought to the surface once more and there is
renewed growth of organism; when there is no upward current a
deposit is formed rich in the trace element. New reactions resulting
in the formation of sedimentary rocks take place. We pass from
the science of biology to geology. Some of these elements enter direct
into the structure of the organism, others—in particular the heavy
metals—are believed to be largely taken out of solution by absorption
on the surface of the protoplasm, a purely physical phenomenon.
This applies to gold and silver.

GOLD

A matter in which the more credulous portion of the public is inter-
ested is the possibility of obtaining gold from the sea. Gold is said to
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 147

be present to the extent of 1 part in 1 billion (1 mg. per cubic meter),
but the Haber expedition found very much smaller amounts—often
none. Gold has actually been extracted from the sea during a month’s
working at one of the American bromine plants, but the cost of doing so
was several times more than the value of the gold and it would appear
that it will always be cheaper to mine gold in South Africa and else-
where even when the present mines are exhausted and the reefs have to
be followed deeper into the earth at an increased cost of production.

Gold is probably one of the elements which does not stay in the
sea, but is being removed by absorption onto the surface of organisms
and taken down to the bottom. In agreement with this the bottom
sludges obtained by dredging in certain localities contain very much
larger quantities of gold than there is in the sea. Indeed, the amount
is most variable; estimates in the literature vary from 23 to 1,200
tons of gold in 1 cubic mile of sea.

One may perhaps answer this interesting question by saying that
gold will continue to be mined rather than won from the sea, particu-
larly since it has few uses other than as a financial token.

IODINE

An element of universal distribution in air, sea, and land is iodine
which is of fundamental importance alike to man, animals, and plants.
It is a constituent of the thyroid gland and if we lack it in sufficient
quantity we are afflicted by goitre. Many marine plants have the
power of concentrating it, thus the dry matter of deep-water sea-
weed, such as Laminaria, contains as much as 0.5 percent. Iodine was
in fact first discovered by Courtois in 1811 in the ash of sea kelp.
Kelp, or Varech as it is called in France, has been used for many years
for the commercial extraction of iodine even though this practice
cannot compete economically with the production of iodate from the
caliche in Chile. Certain coral species are said to contain up to 8
percent of iodine and it is of interest that it is present both here and
in the bath sponge in the organic state as di-iodo-tyrosine.

The question of the form of iodine in the sea is still indefinite: it
may well be organic. The sea contains 0.001 percent and is much
richer in this rarest of the halogens than the land. It is obviously
in a continual state of change, being oxidized and reduced, and pass-
ing into marine plants and animals. When the seaweed moves lazily
to and fro at our feet large quantities of iodine are being withdrawn
from circulation. Some of it is constantly being lost through vapori-
zation into the atmosphere, and this is why people living sufficiently
near the coast, as the great majority of the population of this island
do, do not suffer from goitre in the same way as the population of the
great central plains of the United States.
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943
ARSENIC AND CALCIUM

The arsenic in the sea exists apparently in organic form and, like
jodine, is concentrated in animals and plants. The lobster has 40-50
parts per 1 million and Laminaria twice as much.

There are many points of interest connected with the calcium in the
sea; in fresh water it is the most abundant of the three cations—cal-
cium, magnesium, and sodium; in sea water it is the least abundant
as all the time animals and plants are removing it, a fact to which the
white cliffs of Dover bear abundant testimony. It is related to the
carbon dioxide content of the oceans which is some 15 to 30 times the
amount present in the atmosphere, and it may be well that the carbon
dioxide content of the air is regulated by the oceans acting as a reser-
voir. There is a continual exchange between the air and the surface
of the sea which, among other things, controls the acidity of the sea
water to which much of the life of the ocean is acutely sensitive.
Further, in the sea, as on land, plants use carbon dioxide as the basic
source of carbon for the building up of organic compounds.

When the carbon dioxide in solution in sea water is reduced, the
conditions are favorable for the deposition of calcium carbonate. The
building of shells by animals which live on the sea bottom and of the
smallest Protozoa is an interesting subject. It accounts for an an-
nual deposition of 1,400 million tons of calcium. Shells are of two
classes, those containing calcium carbonate alone or with magnesium
carbonate, and those containing calcium phosphate. As yet we have
no clue to the reactions involved in building shells. One minor point
is that in tropical waters the percentage of magnesium carbonate is
higher. :

The relative abundance of the alkaline earths in the sea in the order
calcium, strontium, barium, is about 4000:100:1. The temperature of
the water may also have an effect on the presence of strontium in-
stead of, or together with, calcium in shells. In very cold waters
strontium may replace calcium and there is a report of a radiolarian
from the Antarctic whose shell is composed almost entirely of stron-
tium carbonate. In other shells both are present in much the same
proportion as that in which they occur in sea water.

The sea is the greatest potential source of raw materials. It con-
tains traces of every element ready to hand so that marine plants or
animals can adapt them to their purpose. There is true symbiosis be-
tween animal, vegetable, and mineral. Our approach to this subject
has been from the mineral aspect, to ascertain what minerals can be
economically won from the sea in competition with land sources of
the same materials deposited in bygone geologic ages. The sea gives
us a great quantity of food in fish of all kinds. The study of these is
THE SEA AS A STOREHOUSE—ARMSTRONG 149

an important branch of science, for it is certain that in times to come
we shall not only require more fish but make better use of the catch.
The great medicinal value of the liver oils as a source of vitamins is
an example. Less use is so far made of seaweeds, but here also re-
search is beginning to show that novel and perhaps useful and valuable
substances are present, and before long there will have been worked
out methods of harvesting the weed and fabricating diverse products
from it.

PROGRESS IN NEW SYNTHETIC TEXTILE FIBERS’

By HERBERT R. MAUERSBERGER
Technical Editor, Rayon Textile Monthly

It is again my privilege to report on the subject of Progress in New
Synthetic Textile Fibers. My previous report made on October 17,
1940, has been reproduced in the General Appendix of the 1941 An-
nual Report of the Smithsonian Institution, showing that our Gov-
ernment takes cognizance of our activities in identification, nomen-
clature, and technology of our new textile fibers and materials. It
also appeared in the American Society for Testing Materials Stand-
ards on Textile Materials.”

The information in the present paper is an addition to that given in
the previous one. Much of the previous information is today quite
inadequate, so fast has this industry grown and these developments
taken place. My information has been obtained from sources be-
lieved to be authentic and reliable. Some of these developments are
already well known and are only included for the record; others have
taken place quietly and may have escaped notice or attention.

Some of them are gigantic and could be dealt with at great length,
which is not permitted here, whereas others are still in the formative
stage and data must be withheld owing to the war. No matter what
your own experience is with these individual fibers, or what your opin-
ion of them may be, remember at all times that practically all these
fibers, yarns, and materials are custom-made to meet any domestic
technological demand that may arise. Their versatility of use and
flexible properties have been of tremendous value in the war effort
and will be after the war.

IMPORTANCE IN WAR EFFORT

Even in your fondest dreams could you imagine that insect and
mosquito screens could be woven actually better with a synthetic
monofilament yarn than with copper wire? Again, just imagine for
a second where we would be in this war if it had not been for nylon

parachutes and shroud lines, high-tenacity rayon bomb chutes,
“Bubblfil” life preservers, Vinyon screen printing cloths, nylon tooth
brushes, rayon paint brushes, and Velon or plastic-coated window
screens ?

These certainly are not laboratory or experimental ghosts or guinea
pigs; they are absolute realities and accomplished facts! A fine
tribute to American ingenuity and the product of arduous and per-
sistent research by American chemists, chemical engineers, and tech-
nologists.

Time and space limitations preclude the inclusion in this paper of
many technical details, and only the most important and outstanding
advances in new synthetic fibers can be given. Only those fibers
that have gone beyond the experimental stage and are in actual pro-
duction now or will be immediately after the war are dealt with.

Nothing new or of interest can be reported on nylon, fibroin, fibers
from corn, chitin, ossein, lichenin, Iceland moss, alginates, or agar-
agar. There are, however, developments of great significance in the
protein-base fibers such as casein and soybean, which have been de-
veloped to a considerable extent in the past 3 years. There has also
been a rapid advance in the vinyl resin group and in the thermoplastic
resin groups.

THERMOPLASTIC RESINS

When Dow Chemical Co. produced saran in 1939 (mentioned only
briefly in my 1940 paper), no one believed that it would have any
significant possibilities in the textile industry. It has seen many new
textile applications since then.

The raw materials for these monofilament yarns are a group of
resins from unsymmetrical dichlorethylene, known as vinylidene
chloride resins, made from petroleum and brine. Ethylene is made
by cracking petroleum, while chlorine comes from the electrolysis of
brine. They are combined to form trichlorethane, which is converted
with lime into the vinylidene chloride monomer. This product can
be readily polymerized to form the long-linear-straight chain poly-
mers. By careful selection of copolymers and control of the poly-
merization conditions, many different polymers can be formed. These
resins range from a flexible, moderately soluble material, having a
melting point of about 158° F. to a hard, tough thermoplastic, having
a softening point of 350° F. or more. The basic resin is odorless,
tasteless, and a nontoxic powder.

One of the several methods of extrusion is the one of crystal orien-
tation, which produces long continuous monofilaments, tapes, bands,
and ether shapes. The oriented form is produced by extrusion, sub-
sequent plastic deformation as by stretching, and by heat treatment.
SYNTHETIC TEXTILE FIBERS—-MAUERSBERGER 153

The material may be heat treated after or during stretching to affect
the desired degree of crystallization. It produces monofilament yarns
of considerable toughness and tensile strength, abrasion resistance,
and chemical resistance to water, acids, alkalies, and many organic
solvents.

Little of textile interest was done with these yarns until Mr. Sted-
man, of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio, took up the
development and gave the name “Velon” to these products and estab-
lished the Velon Department. A unit for production was set up at
the Worldbestos Plant in Paterson, N..J., where monofilament yarns
are being made as fine as 0.007 inch in diameter running from 10,000
to 12,000 yards to the pound. Experiments for the extrusion of
multifilament yarns are under way and it is expected that yarns as
fine as 100 denier can be produced eventually.

At first, flat continuous bands were made to imitate rattan in the
seat covers of buses and subway cars, and next, shoetop fabrics were
woven for evening and sport shoes, using the Velon threads as warp
and cotton yarns for filling.

As soon as round, monofilament yarns of sufficient fineness were
produced, Mr. Stedman interested August Hafner, president of Haf-
ner Associates, who is a well-known specialty and experimental weav-
ing expert in this country, to work out the textile possibilities. Mr
Hafner could see the potentialities of these yarns at once, and sug-
gested their use for handbag, trimming, and millinery fabrics of un-
usual color, design, and weave variations.

Then came the war with its restrictions on copper, steel, aluminum,
and metals in general. This brought about replacements of metals
in making mosquito and fly screens. These fly screens are now made
successfully with vinylidene chloride resin yarns in 16 by 16, 12 by 12,
and even 20 by 21 mesh. Window screens made from this yarn are
supposed to provide better vision due to their greater transparency.
At present, it is restricted for civilian use and its application in dress
goods and wearing apparel will have to await the end of the war.

NEW ELASTIC VINYON E

Late last year, the Vinyon Department of American Viscose Corpo-
ration in addition to Vinyon filament yarn, explained in my earlier
paper, offered a new vinyl resin yarn with considerable elastic prop-
erties known as Vinyon E. It possesses many characteristics of rub-
ber and opens an entirely new field of applications. For some pur-
poses it has been found superior to rubber, because it has exhibited
better resistance to sunlight, tropical heat, and humidity and is not
affected by body acids. At present it is restricted to military uses,
where it replaces rubber. However, after the war we will see many
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

textile applications such as elastic webbing, tapes, cords, girdles,
brassieres, surgical stockings, suspenders, and supporters, and many
articles now made of sponge rubber.

CASHIN FIBER

The next remarkable development has been in casein fiber. The
National Dairy Products Corporation has further developed and made
remarkable progress with its trade-named product “Aralac.” The
company has now formed Aralac, Inc., an entirely new division of the
National Dairy Products Corporation, which has increased its pro-
duction almost eightfold since 1940.

The original 4,000-pound-a-day plant at Bristol, R. I., was moved in
July 1941 to Taftville, Conn., with an output of 15,000 pounds per
day. The product, originally used by the felt-hat trade, was then
investigated by textile manufacturers. The advent of the war with its
WPB restrictions on civilian wool use boomed interest in Aralac, so
that in 1942 the plant capacity was doubled to 30,000 pounds per day.
The felt usage being relatively stable, a much larger percentage of this
fiber now goes to the textile trade.

Aralac is offered in finenesses corresponding approximately to 50’s
60’s, and 70’s wool grades and in staple lengths from 1% to 6 inches.
Specialty uses include stuffing for pillows, comforters, and quilted
goods, interlining for cool-weather garments, and protection for
milady’s hair, when it is given a permanent wave. The last-mentioned
is in the form of a highly crimped combed top, and is known under
the trade name “Wavecrepe.”

Casein, the basic raw material from which Aralac is made, is a by-
product of the milk industry. National milk production is upward
of 117 billion pounds of milk annually. About 50 percent of this is
skimmed for its cream. The skim milk thus formed yields over
1 billion pounds of casein a year or over 3 million pounds of casein a
day, a pound of casein making roughly 1 pound of Aralac fiber.

Casein fiber, unlike nylon, Vinyon, and acetate rayon, is made by a
wet spinning process, somewhat similar to viscose rayon. Even these
two processes are similar only at one point, namely, the extrusion
through a spinnerette into a coagulating bath. Before this point,
the Aralac process is much simpler than viscose; afterward, it is
many times more complicated. The casein is dispersed in water by
means of an alkali; the dispersion is clarified, spun, coagulated, and
the tow treated to give the filaments flexibility and hot-water resist-
ance. The fiber is then washed, dried, cut to staple length, and baled
for shipment to textile mills.

The properties of Aralac are in some instances similiar to those of
wool and it is being used entirely in mixtures with wool, rayon, and
SYNTHETIC TEXTILE FIBERS—MAUERSBERGER 155

cotton fibers. It is not affected by organic solvents. It is not thermo-
plastic below charring temperatures. It withstands sulfuric-acid car-
bonization as well as wool. Its alkali resistance at higher temperatures
is somewhat lower, so low temperatures and mild alkaline or neutral
detergents are recommended for scouring and washing. Considerable
research has been done on dyeing this fiber and the dyeing problem
is now well in hand.

Uniformity has made rapid strides and is now well under control.
Being an animal base, it burns with the same odor and bead formation
as wool and silk. Its strength, both dry and wet, is the same as last
reported, about 60 and 20 percent, respectively, that of wool. Regain
at 70° F. and 65 percent relative humidity is 12.6 percent. Commer-
cial regain is established at 13 percent.

The largest textile use of Aralac at present is in dress goods, but it
is expanding into other uses, where a resilient, lofty hand is desired.
The hat trade absorbs large quantities and practically every man’s felt
hat in this country and Canada, which has been made within the past
3 years contains some Aralac fiber.

It looks as if this fiber will go far, especially under present war
conditions and with pressing needs for fiber conservation in the textile
industry.

SOYBEAN FIBER

Ford Motor Co. of Dearborn, Mich., has considerably enlarged
the production of this staple fiber which was explained quite fully
in my 1940 paper. The company has now given this staple fiber
the trade name “Soylon,” and I understand is offering it to the cotton
and worsted spinning, weaving, and knitting trade in volume. Robert
A. Boyer has been in charge of this development at Dearborn and
reports that the new plant has now reached 5,000 pounds a day or
1,825,000 pounds annually. All machinery and equipment were
designed by Ford engineers and are supposed to incorporate the
latest mass-production principles and devices. The fiber has been
improved in strength and other physical, chemical, and microscopical
properties.

PEANUT PROTEIN FIBER

It appears that casein of animal origin and soybean of vegetable
base points to the future use of other vegetable proteins for textile
fiber manufacture. An instance is a textile staple fiber from peanut
protein.

Reports indicate that Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., of Glas-
gow, Scotland, has done considerable research work, and D. K. Baird

*Since delivery of this paper Ford Motor Co. has sold this entire equipment to The
Drackett Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio, and has discontinued the manufacture of this fiber.
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

of the above company brought a sample of peanut protein fiber and
cloth (made of 50 parts peanut fiber and 50 parts wool) to this
country in 1939.

I am informed by the New York office of Imperial Chemical In-
dustries, Litd., that this work is at present still in the experimental
stage. There has been no commercial development of the fiber in
England or in any other country, neither could they state when such
commercial development is likely to be achieved.

The only public knowledge of this work is in United States patent
No. 2,230,624, applied for on February 4, 1939, and granted on Febru-
ary 4, 1941, to Andrew McLean, Saltscoats, Scotland, and assigned
to Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., England. There are seven
claims.

From what I have seen in very small samples the fibers have an
excellent appearance, are softer than wool and fine, and take dyes
even better than wool. It might be stated also that the above
company has produced satisfactory fiber from castor seed and edestin,
a crystalline globulin found in many edible seeds such as wheat,
rye, maize, etc. This indicates that we may see more of these
protein fibers after the war.

PLASTIC-COATED TEXTILE YARNS

Another unusual development, which has gone forward quietly and
is now assuming considerable proportions and importance in the war
effort, is the coating of cotton, rayon, and fiber-glass yarns with in-
finitely fine coatings of plastic solutions to give them added and almost
unlimited strength, brightness or dullness, color, to make them com-
pletely waterproof and moisture-resistant, flame-retarding or self-ex-
tinguishing, or to make them resistant to mild acids, perspiration, oil,
and grease, as desired. This may seem difficult of accomplishment but
is now a reality and has found many interesting and technical applica-
tions in the textile industry.

It is the invention of two Frenchmen, Roumazeilles and Girard, and
was patented in France in 1925 and in the United States in 1930. The
American patent rights to the now-called Plexon Process were pur-
chased by Freydberg Bros.-Strauss in 1938. The first Plexon yarns
were introduced here in 1939 after making many improvements in the
methods and machinery required. At first quite expensive, the speeding
up of the process and finding suitable and practical plastic formula-
tions resulted in price reductions, which now brings these yarns within
reach of many new applications.

In 1942 the entire procedure was revamped again, both as to ma-
chine construction and speed of production, so that today these yarns
SYNTHETIC TEXTILE FIBERS—-MAUERSBERGER L57

are made five times as fast as on the original French machine, a tribute
to American engineering practice and genius.

It is possible by this process to apply as few coatings as 6 or as many
as 24, depending on the ultimate use of the thread. It is possible, for
instance, to make a plastic-coated yarn as fine as 0.008 inch in diameter
and up to approximately 0.09 inch in diameter. The dimension of
the uncoated yarn could be almost anything within this range. It is
possible to get an absolutely round thread by using graduated round
disks. It is also possible to obtain different shapes such as elliptical,
triangular, or square threads by using dies shaped to these forms. The
process also envisions the application of plastic coatings and impreg-
nations to flat tapes, bands, cords, and even wires.

In addition to shaping the coating, the yarns can be made in various
finishes. They can be made stiff or soft, or any graduation in between.
They can be made transparent, translucent, or opaque, smooth or rough,
by changing the plastic coating. Color ranges take in the entire scope
of pigments available, the current color line consisting of more than
120 different shades. Such plastic-coated yarns can be made com-
pletely waterproof, moisture-resistant, verminproof, weatherproof,
rotproof, flameproof, as well as resistant to mild acids, perspiration,
oil, grease, gasoline, and even to withstand extremes of temperatures
as in tropical or Arctic climates.

Such plastic-coated yarns can be and have been woven, knitted,
braided, twisted, plaited, or crocheted into many types of sheer and
dress materials, drapery, auto upholstery, slip covers, curtains, hand-
bags, and shoe fabrics. A notable contribution to the war effort was
made by developing a special type of coated yarn as a complete sub-
stitute for steel and copper wire in the weaving of insect and fly screens.
Through intensive research a Plexon wire yarn was perfected, which
used noncritical materials both in the support (a cotton yarn) and in
the chemical formulation of the coating. A stiff, wirelike coated
cotton yarn was introduced to the insect-screen industry, woven on
ordinary wire looms without many change-overs or adjustments. The
resultant insect screen was tested by the National Bureau of Standards
and found completely satisfactory. These screens will not rust, can
withstand high tropical temperatures, and require no painting, lac-
quering, or brushing, and are in actual use now.

While there are several other developments, most of these are in the
formative or experimental stages, and they may not bear fruit until
sometime after the war. However, they bear watching. It may be
pointed out here that America at this rate need never again experience
a shortage of textile fibers will have a greater diversification of
fibers for every purpose, demand, or use after this war.
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

NEW CLASSIFICATION OF MAN-MADE FIBERS

Concurrent with these facts given in this and my previous paper
and as a summary thereto, I wish to present a new classification for all
man-made fibers, which, I believe, will aid in clarifying this picture
and serve to place the fibers in a logical grouping.

In the past few years, it has become more and more apparent that
the word “synthetic” is not the best or an all-inclusive word for the
fibers I have discussed but has been used for lack of another or more
suitable word or words. It has become very clear to me that we have
now two distinct types or groups of man-made fibers.

One large group distinctly derives from natural sources such as wood
pulp, cotton linters, cow’s milk, soybeans, peanuts, and silicate glass.
I should like to term these “regenerated natural fibers.” (See fig. 1.)
They are not really synthetic at all. The dictionary defines synthetic as
“of or pertaining to synthesis” and again synthesis “is the art or
process of making a compound by combining elementary ingredients.”

Furthermore, I suggest that these regenerated natural fibers be
broken down into three distinct subdivisions according to the bases
from which they originate, namely, (a) cellulosic bases, (6) protein
bases, (¢) mineral or inorganic bases.

Under the cellulosic bases we have, first, the viscose and cuprate;
second, the cellulose esters; and third, the cellulose ethers, all in fila-
mentous and fibrous conditions.

Under the protein bases, we have, first, the animal protein fibers,
namely, casein and Aralac; and second, the vegetable protein fibers,
where we have soybean and peanut fibers and others.

Under the mineral or inorganic bases, we have fiber glass (filament
and staple) and the mineral wools, such as rock wool, glass wool, and
slag wool.

None of these products or fibers are made by true synthesis, there-
fore should not be termed synthetic fibers at all. I should like to
recommend that we drop the word “synthetic” entirely for this group
at least. I merely suggested the words “regenerated natural fibers”
because to regenerate means “to produce anew, to give new life,
strength, or vigor to, to reproduce.” Is that not exactly what we do
with these fibers? If someone can think of a more appropriate word,
I should be delighted to substitute it for the above.

In the second main group of man-made fibers belong all filaments
and fibers produced by a combination of elementary or complex chemi-
cals through synthesis, polymerization, copolymerization, heat treat-
ments, stretch and setting operations, all of which are complicated,
strictly chemical processes. Such materials as nylon, Vinyon, saran,

Velon, and synthetic rubber yarns belong to this group. I should like
to suggest the words “synthesized fibers” for this group, instead of
synthetic fibers, although the latter could be used here justifiably.

This second main group I should like to subdivide, for the present at
least, first, into the polyamids, which cover Du Pont’s nylon filaments,
staple fiber and bristles; second into the polyesters, which cover
Vinyon filament and Vinyon E, the new elastic yarn; third, into the
thermoplastic resins, under which would come saran, Velon, Permalon,
and others; fourth and last, the hydrocarbons, which are to include
all new synthetic rubber filaments, threads, and cords in full develop-
ment now.

This classification separates the main products, and subordinates
none. I recommend it to you for consideration.

INTRODUCTION

Among the various substances which are found in the earth’s crust,
petroleum and natural gas occupy a unique position in that they are
combustible fluids. The highly distinctive and interesting properties
of petroleum would alone have led to close investigation of its origin
and occurrence, but its widespread distribution and great usefulness
to mankind have made it the objective of many lines of scientific
research and have gained for petroleum geology a leading position in
geologic science.

The geology of petroleum may be considered from either of two
standpoints. In the field of economic geology it has become one of
the most important branches and has attracted to it the largest group
of specialists concerned with any mineral resource. Apart from its
economic importance and in its proper relation to other divisions of
geologic science, petroleum geology may be regarded as a branch of
sedimentary petrology, coordinate with hydrology or the geology
of coal deposits.

A distinction may be made between the science of petroleum geology
and the art of oil finding and development. The latter lies in the
field of applied science or engineering. ‘The line between the two is
not sharply drawn, and the association between the science and the
art is so intimate that the advance of both has been hand in hand.
The need for advancing the art has stimulated the progress of the
science. New scientific concepts have soon been tried out in practice.
As a part of a survey of the advances made in geologic science during
the last half century it is fitting that this account of the progress in
petroleum geology should emphasize the scientific rather than the
engineering aspects, and the writer has approached the subject from
that direction. Geographic distribution of petroleum deposits and
other matters which are primarily economic in character will not be
considered in this paper.

Petroleum geology is, in point of age, one of the younger divisions
of geologic science. It has not attained the senatorial dignity of
paleontology nor even the maturity of the geology of ore deposits.
It spans but little more than the half century of American geology
that this symposium commemorates. Some eminent living petroleum
geologists were born before the first oil well was drilled in Pennsyl-
vania in 1859. Petroleum geology is still making the rapid strides
of youth.

The writer is faced with difficulties in making proper acknowledg-
ment of his deep indebtedness to his professional fellows. The ideas
of others have been incorporated in this paper without hesitation in
an endeavor to present as completely as space permits the progress
and status of petroleum geology. Where the writer is conscious of
having drawn on specific sources he has endeavored, through appro-
priate reference, to give due credit. If, unconsciously, he has failed
to do so, indulgence is asked. Grateful acknowledgment is made to
Dr. L. C. Snider for constructive criticism.

PETROLEUM GEOLOGY IN 1890

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In the geologic world of 50 years ago two men, Edward Orton and
Israel C. White, were the foremost authorities on the geology of
petroleum. Both were original Fellows of the Geological Society
of America, Orton having served on the committee which drafted the
constitution and White on the first committee on publications. The
first paper on petroleum geology published by the society was by
Orton (1890), and, in the discussion of that paper, Dr. W J McGee
(1890), of the United States Geological Survey, paid the following
tribute to the work of these two men:

But within the past 3 years the laws governing the origin, distribution, and
pressure of rock gas have become as well known as are the laws governing
artesian water supply; so that today the geologist prognosticates rock gas nearly
if not quite as definitely and certainly as he prognosticates artesian water; and
it is not only just to our associates and to American science to say that this
great advance in geologic science was due almost wholly to two of our fellows—
to Professor Orton, the author of the communication before us, and to Professor
White, who has already spoken upon it. To these men we are indebted for this
unparalleled stride in American geology. Others, indeed, contributed facts, but
they philosophy ; and science was immeasurably enriched by their contribution.

To the papers of White and Orton one must therefore turn for the
ablest presentation of the geology of petroleum and natural gas of
that day.

Peckham (1884) had compiled for the Tenth Census a summary of
the previous literature on the origin and accumulation of petroleum,
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 163

but it remained for Orton (1888) to publish the first treatise which
critically studied and compared the evidence and reached consistent
conclusions on this subject. As this report best presents the state
of knowledge of petroleum geology as of 50 years ago, its conclusions
will be extensively quoted.

ORIGIN

After reviewing the various theories that had been advanced by geol-
ogists and chemists to account for the origin of petroleum and natural
gas, Orton presented the following summary (1888, pp. 82, 83) :

1. Petroleum is derived from organic matter.

2. It is much more largely derived from vegetable than from animal substances.

3. Petroleum of the Pennsylvania type is derived from the organic matter of
bituminous shales and is of vegetable origin.

4, Petroleum of the Canada type is derived from limestones, and is probably of
anintal origin.

5. Petroleum has been produced at normal rock temperatures (in Ohio fields)
and is not a product of destructive distillation of bituminous shales.

6. The stock of petroleum in the rocks is already practically complete.

After showing that petroleum is almost universally present in small
quantities throughout the limestones and shales of Pennsylvania and
Ohio, he concluded:

It is obvious that the total amount of petroleum in the rocks underlying the
surface of Ohio is large beyond computation, but in its diffused and distributed
state, it is entirely without value. It must be accumulated in rocks that serve as
reservoirs before it becomes of economic interest.

RESERVOIRS

He then summarized the existing knowledge concerning petroleum
reservoirs. As to sandstone reservoirs, he contrasted those of Pennsy]l-
vania, as described by Carll, with those of Ohio. The Venango sands
of Pennsylvania were standstones of medium or coarse grain, or even
in some cases conglomerates, ranging from a shell to 100 feet in thick-
ness. The productive fields were found to extend in length for a score
or more miles in some cases, while their width was confined to 1 or 2
miles. The reservoirs were lenticular in transverse section. The
coarser the sand and the more open, the greater the amount of oil; and,
in like manner, the thicker the stratum, the larger was its production
likely to be, other things being equal. The sandstone reservoir of east-
ern Ohio was “a stratum of sandstone that rests on and is covered by
shales, but the stratum, so far from being lenticular in character, is
wonderfully persistent, though varying in thickness and grain from
point to point and occasionally nearly disappearing for short spaces.”
He concluded his remarks on sandstones as reservoirs with the
following:
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

In all of these fields [Pennsylvania, New York, and eastern Ohio], without im-
portant exception standstones buried in shales have proved to be the reservoirs
of oil and gas when the latter are found in large quantity. The overlying shale
is the cover or roof of the reservoir; the underlying shale appears to be the source
from which the bituminous products are derived.

As to limestone reservoirs, Orton was more fully informed than any
geologist of his time, in view of his studies of the Trenton. The fol-
lowing is quoted from the same report (p. 86) :

The limestone has been penetrated for about 550 feet without being exhausted.
Through most, if not all of its extent, it is petroliferous, as is shown by the
drillings, but the accumulated stocks of both oil and gas are always found in the
uppermost beds of the stratum, and generally not more than 15 feet below its
upper surface. * * * ‘The oil rock carries, at a lower level than that in which
the oil is found, but sometimes dangerously near, a brine of unusual character.
It has, in fact, the composition of a bittern, or a water left over from the con-
centration of ordinary brine. * * * ‘The facts as to the occurrence of oil and
gas in this stratum seem reconcilable with the theory that they have risen through
the limestone rock until they find themselves arrested in their ascent by the
overlying shales, and their accumulation therefore takes place at this point.

PERMEABILITY

Orton had noted the difference in permeability of these main classes
of oil reservoirs and also the variations which occurred ineach. It had
been early established in Pennsylvania that different portions of the
oil sands communicated with some degree of freedom, for adjacent wells
were found to affect each other’s yields. As an example, he cites the
Bradford sand and its division into gas, oil, and salt-water zones, the
gas holding the highest and the salt water the lowest levels, and found
“the conclusion well-nigh irresistible that the entire rock is permeable
and that, in the course of ages, the various contents have been differenti-
ated as we now find them, under the influence of gravitation.” In con-
trast, he found that in other areas “there was no necessary and absolute
connection between different portions of an oil sand”; the stratum
might be divided into lenticular masses which might be nearly or en-
tirely disconnected. “The rapid changes in thickness of the oil-sand
in adjacent wells furnishes conclusive proof upon this point. We can
follow the stratum down to a feather edge by these records.” In the
Berea sand of eastern Ohio he observed that such interruptions occurred
frequently. “Communication through a few square miles of the rock
can be occasionally inferred, but beyond this we have, thus far, found
no warrant for going.” It was Orton’s observation that in the lime-
stone reservoirs the same freedom of communication did not exist as
in the sandstones. He noted, however, that the gas wells at Findlay
affected each other noticeably. He recognized that there could not
be as free communication through massive limestones as through sand-
stones. In the case of sandstones, however, he did not apparently
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 165

realize that lack of porosity was one of the reasons for lack of com-
munication but rather attributed it to changes in thickness and lensing.

The presence of an approximately impervious roof over the oil reser-
voir was, to Orton, the primary requisite of oil accumulation. Source
beds were plentiful and widely distributed, and various kinds of rocks
were suitable as reservoirs, but “more interest centers in the roof shales
or cover than in any other part of the system.” The Utica and Hud-
son River shales overlying the Trenton, the Niagara shale overlying
the Clinton, and the Cuyahoga shale overlying the Berea were con-
vincing examples. “It is apparent that the composition and order
of arrangement of a series of strata have a vitally important relation
to the accumulation of oil and gas that may take place within it.”

Orton accepted the conclusion of Carll (1880) that the yield of oil
wells was fully accounted for by the presence of the oil in the pores of
the reservoir and that there was no necessity for resorting to other ex-
planations, such as “crevices” in the rocks, to account for their
productivity.

STRUCTURE

The principles of petroleum geology which have just been outlined
appear to have been quite generally accepted by the geologists who
were contemporaries of Orton. But in the field of the relation of
structure to the accumulation of petroleum there was dissension of the
first order. .

I. C. White was connected with the Second Pennsylvania Geological
Survey from 1875 to 1883, when he resigned and entered commercial
work. Two years later (1885a) he published his epochal statement
advocating the anticlinal theory of oil accumulation. The observation
that accumulations of oil were associated with anticlinal axes had been
made 25 years before by several geologists, including Hunt (1861),
Rogers (1860), and Logan, but their opinions had been forcefully
opposed by the Director of the Pennsylvania Survey, J. P. Lesley, and
probably had little influence on oil discovery or development. So im-
portant was White’s revival of this theory that Orton (1888, p. 93) pro-
claimed that his applications of the theory “mark a new period in our
study of the geology of oil and gas.” The following quotation gives
White’s (1885a, pp. 521-522) views in his own words.

After visiting all the great gas wells that had been struck in western Pennsyl-
vania and West Virginia, and carefully examining the geological surroundings of
each, I found that every one of them was situated either directly on, or near, the
crown of an anticlinal axis, while wells that had been bored in the synclines on
either side furnished little or no gas, but in many cases large quantities of salt
water. Further observation showed that the gas wells were confined to a narrow
belt, only one-fourth to 1 mile wide, along the crests of the anticlinal folds. These
facts seem to connect gas territory unmistakably with the disturbance in the
rocks caused by their upheaval into arches, but the crucial test was yet to be

566766—44—12
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

made in the actual location of good gas territory on this theory. During the
last 2 years, I have submitted it to all manner of tests, both in locating and
condemning gas territory, and the general result has been to confirm the anti-
clinal theory beyond a reasonable doubt.

But while we can state with confidence that all great gas wells are found
on the anticlinal axis, the converse of this is not true, viz, that great gas wells
may be found on all anticlinals. In a theory of this kind, the limitations be-
come quite as important as, or even more so than, the theory itself; and hence I
have given considerable thought to this side of the question, having formulated
them into three or four general rules (which include practically all of the limita-
tions known to me, up to the present time, that should be placed on the state-
ment that large gas wells may be obtained on anticlinal folds) as follows:

(a) The arch in the rocks must be one of considerable magnitude; (b) A
coarse or porous sandstone of considerable thickness, or, if a fine-grained rock,
one that would have extensive fissures, and thus, in either case, rendered capable
of acting as a reservoir for the gas, must underlie the surface at a depth of

several hundred feet (500 to 2,500 feet) ; (c) Probably very few or none of the
grand arches along mountain ranges will be found holding gas in large quantity,
since in such cases the disturbance of the stratification has been so profound that
all the natural gas generated in the past would long ago have escaped into the
air through fissures that traverse all the beds. Another limitation might possibly
be added, which would confine the area where great gas flows may be obtained
to those underlaid by a considerable thickness of bituminous shale.

Very fair gas wells may also be obtained for a considerable distance down
the slope from the crest of the anticlinals, provided the dip be sufficiently
rapid, and especially if it be irregular, or interrupted with slight crumples.
And even in regions where there are no well-marked anticlinals, if the dip be
somewhat rapid and irregular, rather large gas wells may occasionally be found,
if all other conditions are favorable.

Ashburner (1885), of the Second Pennsylvania Geological Survey,
replied promptly to White’s announcement. While conceding that a
relation existed between the position of anticlinal axes and the loca-
tion of gas fields, he regarded the problem as more complex and cited
other factors which he considered to be controlling, as follows:

Although it is a fact that many of our largest Pennsylvania gas wells are
located near anticlinal axes, yet the position in which gas may be found, and
the amount to be obtained, depend upon (@) the porosity and homogeneousness
of the sandstone which serves as a reservoir to hold the gas; (b) the extent to
which the strata above or below the gas-sand are cracked; (c) the dip of the
gas-sand and the position of the anticlines and synclines; (d) the relative pro-
portions of water, oil, and gas contained in the sand; and (e) the pressure under
which the gas exists before being tapped by wells.

Lesley, in a paper published the following year (1886, pp. 654-655),
strongly opposed White’s theory; the following quotation states his
views:

Quite recently the location of the anticlinal lines in the Pittsburgh region has
become a sort of popular mania, produced by a theory. The whole community

interested in the subject of natural gas has been carried away by a theory
* * * the anticlinal theory of gas.
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 167

Stated in a few words, it is a theory that oil, being lighter than water, must
rise to higher levels. If the application of this theory was confined to bottles
no one would dispute it; the water in a bottle must collect at the bottom, the
oil in the middle and the gas on top. But the earth is not a bottle. It has no
great caverns in it. More than that, the arrangement takes place naturally
under the pressure of only one atmosphere; while any arrangement of water,
gas, and oil, made at depths of a thousand or 2,000 feet, must be made under
pressures of from 100 to 400 pounds to the square inch. * * * It therefore
seems to me irrational to assign any importance whatever to the extremely
gentle anticlines of the gas-oil region.

To this I add the important consideration that the movements of oll and
water have been shown by actual practice to be governed entirely by the char-
acter of the rock in which they take place, and that they are effectually stopped
at fixed geographical lines where porous rock changes into sandstones and
sandstones into shales. And these changes of character in the rock itself have
no fixed relation whatever to the anticlinal waves, which, on the contrary, cross
them transversely or diagonally.

White, in replies to these criticisms (1885b; 1886), again emphasized
his position that not all anticlines would be gas-bearing, especially
such subordinate anticlinal folds as occurred within the synclines. He
pointed to the success which had attended development along eight
anticlines in the vicinity of Pittsburgh and the failures which had
resulted from drilling in the intervening synclines. Thus the im-
portance of structure as a factor in the accumulation of oil and gas
came to be recognized by the geological profession and by practical
operators.

With the extension of oil and gas production to areas other than
western Pennsylvania, it was soon found by the geologists working
in them that modifications of White’s theory were required to explain
all the structural problems that arose. Minshall, by careful surveys
along the White Oak anticline in West Virginia, had shown that the
axis itself was undulating, with pronounced domes or summits at
some points and sags or depressions at others, and that the commercial
gas accumulations were confined to the domes. In Ohio, Orton (1888,
pp. 93-95) found that anticlinals were of infrequent occurrence but
that oil and gas accumulation was controlled by another type of
structural deformation, which he termed “arrested anticlinals,” or
terraces.

PRESSURE OF GAS

One other major problem in connection with the occurrence of oil
and gas greatly concerned the petroleum geologists of a half century
ago—to find a satisfactory explanation for the pressure exerted by
the gas upon the reservoir within which it was contained. Closed-in
pressures ranging up to 1,000 pounds per square inch had been ob-
served, and the enormous expulsive force of the gas, frequently caus-
ing the drilling tools to be violently thrown from wells, was well
168 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

known to operators. One explanation was that the gas formed in
the earth much as steam is formed in a boiler and that the pressure
resulted from the confinement of the gas. The theory most commonly
held was that the weight of the overlying rocks caused the compres-
sion of the gas, and the resulting pressure was accordingly called “rock
pressure.” Lesley (1885) exhaustively studied this theory and dem-
onstrated that the pressure of gas did not accord with the weight of
the overburden. Orton seems to have been the first geologist clearly
to understand the function of artesian pressure in relation to the
pressure of oil and gas in the same stratum. He says (1888, p. 99):

In the porous rock that contains them there is always, outside of the pro-
ductive fields, a body of water, and in almost every instance, salt water. This
water occupies the rock as it rises to day in its nearest outcrops. Communi-
eating there with surface water or with rainfall, a head of pressure is given
to the gas and oil that are held in the traps formed by the anticlinals or
terraces into which the stratum has been thrown. The amount of pressure would
thus depend on the height to which the water column is raised, in case con-
tinuous porosity of the stratum can be assumed.

Later Orton (1890) published a paper on the origin of the rock
pressure of the Trenton limestone which laid the foundation for all
later studies in dynamic geology as related to oil and gas.

SUMMARY

The preceding review of the status of petroleum geology in 1890,
though brief, may, nevertheless, demonstrate that this division of the
science had been placed on a sound foundation by the pioneer work
of the men whose writings have been cited. The difficulties which they
encountered and the differences of opinion which developed among
them were in large measure the result of an endeavor to oversimplify
their science.

The tracing in detail of the evolution of these various ideas and
theories and of their development into those which make up the present
content of petroleum geology would unduly extend this paper. The
writer accordingly passes to a review of its present status without
attempting to follow closely all the changes in thought during the
intervening period.

GENESIS OF PETROLEUM

GENERAL PROBLEM

Starting with an accumulation of factua] information concerning
the nature and occurrence of petroleum, and following the scientific
method of thought, petroleum geologists have sought to discover the
sources from which it has come and the manner in which it has origi-
nated. Most of them have held the opinion that oil and gas have been
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—-HEROY 169

derived from organic matter deposited in sedimentary rocks. Some
chemists and, more rarely, geologists have sought to explain the origin
of these hydrocarbons as due to inorganic processes. Through the
years this smaller group has diminished in numbers, and at the present
time the organic origin of petroleum is “generally accepted” (Snider,
1934, p.51). But agreement on the general principle has proven much
simpler than the collection of pertinent and adequate supporting evi-
dence. Like the broader biologic principle of evolution, precise knowl-
edge of its mechanism is attained only by many years of intensive
investigation.

The general problem of the conversion of the organic material de-
posited in sedimentary rocks into oil and gas may be divided into more
specialized fields of investigation, such as:

1. The character of the organic material which ultimately becomes petroleum.

2. The characteristics which give to a sedimentary deposit the capacity to pro-
duce petroleum.

3, The steps of chemical change whereby the organic matter of animals and
plants has been converted into the various hydrocarbons of which petroleum is
composed. n

4. The nature of the forces which have been instrumental in, or have con-
tributed to, the transformation of organic matter into petroleum.

5. The manner in which widely disseminated and minute quantities of such
derivatives have been aggregated into appreciable quantities of fluid.

In attacking these problems most geologists and chemists have con-
sidered that the doctrine of uniformity of Lyell (1842, pp. 323-327),
which assumes that the geologic processes and conditions of the present
are essentially the same as those of the past, was applicable to the
formation of petroleum. This is questioned by Woolnough (1937, p.
1106) who considers that petroleum may have been formed under “con-
ditions of accumulation not now exhibited, on a major scale, in any part
of the world.” Any progress in the solution of problems of origin
must, however, rest upon detailed examination of present processes on
the assumption that, at least in kind if not in degree, they were opera-
tive in past ages.

NATURE OF ORGANIO MATERIAL

As to the kind of organic matter that is requisite to the production
of petroleum, there is much divergence of view. Trask (1938, p. 384)
considers that petroleum is a very special substance and that only
certain types of organic material can be changed into petroleum, while
Snider (1934, p. 62) holds the opinion that almost any kind of organic
matter buried in sediments may, under proper conditions, be changed
to petroleum and natural gas. These are wide extremes of thought
which have been developed through quite different lines of approach.

Trask (1932), in an intensive study of the organic constituents of
recent sediments, found that oils and fats form a very small part of the
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

organic matter present; that cellulose compounds derived from higher
plants are also present in small quantities; and that nitrogenous com-
pounds and complex compounds of lignin and humus form the bulk
of the organic matter. He therefore reasons that petroleum must come
from these complex organic compounds rather than from the very small
quantities of oils, fats, and cellulose. However, no evidence is pre-
sented by him which suggests that, to the extent that they were pres-
ent, these other substances may not also have become constituents of
petroleum.

Whereas Trask’s work has been primarily concerned with quantita-
tive determinations of the presence in sediments of particular types of
organic matter, other investigators have been attempting, through the
analysis of individual oils and through the isolation of particular or-
ganic constituents, to develop suggestive relations with living organic
matter. The presence in crude oils of a wide variety of microscopic
objects, such as diatoms, Foraminifera, insect scales, and petrified
wood, may be significant (Sanders, 1937). The identification in crpde
petroleum of chlorophyll porphyrins suggests a direct relation with
higher forms of vegetable life (Triebs, 1935). Hlauschek (1936) con-
siders that plants, producing lignin, form the principal source of cyclic
hydrocarbons and that the life of the sea has been the source of the
straight-chain type of hydrocarbons. Brooks (1936) regards fatty oils
as the principal source materials, with other types of organic sub-
stances such as cellulose, starches, sugars, proteins, lignins, and waxes
as additional sources. He points to the presence of heptane in pine
trees and to the close relation between the terpenes and certain petro-
leum hydrocarbons. Berl (1938) also regards carbohydrates and
derivatives thereof as the chief parent material of crude petroleum.

In the evolution of life from the earliest times to the present the
dominant types of plants and animals have been different at various
periods. It is probable, therefore, that the chemical characteristics of
the remains of such life have also varied. Modern plants, for example,
doubtless contain more lignin than Paleozoic plants.

Most geologists will probably accept the thesis that petroleum has
been formed at all times in the earth’s past by the transformation of
the then existing organic matter and that the distinguishing character-
istics of the petroleum found in deposits of different ages are related
to the nature of the particular organic matter present in the area where
the petroleum was formed at the time of its origin.

SOURCE BEDS

The concept that certain sedimentary deposits had greater capacity
than others to originate petroleum is as old as petroleum geology itself.
Dana (1871) taught that shales and argillaceous sandstones were the
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—-HEROY BAL

most common original source and that the oil found in arenaceous sand-
stones was supposed to have been derived from the shales above or
below. Black shales were thought to be rich in oil, probably because
“coal oil” had been distilled from them. A relationship was thus early
assumed to exist between the amount of organic matter present in sedi-
ments and their capacity to originate petroleum. The term “source
beds” gradually came into use to distinguish those rocks from whose
organic matter petroleum has originated. As the science advanced,
however, it became apparent that such generalizations were not com-
pletely true, and about 20 years ago the need for experimental investi-
gation of source beds began to be recognized. This took definite form
in 1926 when the American Petroleum Institute sponsored a research
program which is still continuing.

Investigation of so complex a subject was initially faced with in-
herent difficulties. The assumption that the source beds were strati-
graphically closely associated with the reservoir beds depends for its
validity on the premise that oil has accumulated near the zone and
area of origin and has not migrated horizontally or vertically for long
distances, a premise on which petroleum geologists are by no means
in agreement. If organic matter in the form of petroleum has origi-
nated in particular strata, then the movement of the petroleum out
of these strata will leave them poorer in organic matter than they
were originally; hence present organic content may not be conclusive
as to whether or not a particular bed has acted as a source of petroleum.
On the other hand, if certain strata were originally sufficiently rich in
organic matter to originate petroleum they may still, even after giving
up some of their organic content, be richer in organic matter than other
sedimentary deposits. If the geologic forces to which an area has
been subjected subsequent to the deposition of the source beds are an
important factor in the genesis of petroleum, then the amount and
character of the organic matter originally present in the sediments
may not be the major factor; the dynamic history may be controlling.
These and other questions complicate the problem of recognizing source
beds. Work on details of the problem has led to some specific con-
clusions, and in the following paragraph the writer has attempted to
summarize present prevailing opinion on this subject.

Recent marine sediments contain as high as 7 percent organic matter
with the average around 2.5 percent. Some older rocks, such as Mon-
terey shale, may have had a higher organic content than recent sedi-
ments at the time of deposition. All ancient sediments have probably
lost some of their original organic content, and the loss through aging
may be as much as 40 percent. The proportion of the original organic
content that may have been converted into petroleum is unknown but
has been estimated at from 5 to 10 percent. In recent sediments the
172 § ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

organic matter consists of about 60 percent carbon, 7 percent nitrogen,
and the remainder chiefly hydrogen. In ancient sediments the pro-
portion of nitrogen increases, indicating that there has been loss of
hydrogen and carbon through geologic change (Trask, 1932, p. 222).
Dark sediments generally have a higher organic content than lighter
ones, and the blackness of many marine shales is chiefly due to con-
tained organic matter (Twenhofel, 1939, p.1181). Hence, dark marine
shales are generally regarded as good source beds and, when near oil
reservoirs, are considered as the most probable source of the petroleum
(Snider, 1934, p. 62).

The organic matter in recent sediments consists of a highly complex
group of substances (Trask, 1932, p. 198). Oils and fats constitute
only 1 percent; waxes, resins, alkaloids, and alcohols comprise about
5 percent; carbohydrates form less than 1 percent; sugars, starches,
and other water-soluble substances, chiefly organic acids, form 3
percent. Nitrogenous compounds form the largest group, comprising
about 40 percent, about half being proteins and the remainder more
resistant nitrogenous compounds. Finally, about 30 percent of the
organic matter consists of lignins and humic complexes. It is from
such source materials that hydrocarbons must have been derived.

The organic matter of recent sediments is nearly all present in solid
form. The proportion soluble in hot water comprises only about
3 percent, and all the material extracted from such sediments by solu-
tion in carbon tetrachloride appears to be solid in nature (Trask,
1932, p. 178).

CONVERSION OF ORGANIC MATTER TO PETROLEUM

The problem of when, where, and how the organic content of sedi-
ments was converted into petroleum is a refinement to which the geolo-
gist of half a century ago had not advanced and which received very
little attention until 20 years ago. From the time that the problem
assumed definite form, geologists have been primarily concerned
with the time and place of conversion, while the manner in which the
change occurred has been left largely to the chemists and biologists.

The uppermost layers of newly deposited sediments have a dense
bacterial population, and such microorganisms are probably an im-
portant factor in the generation of hydrocarbons. Bacteria func-
tion to remove nitrogen and oxygen from the organic matter con-
tained in the sediments, which is thus changed in composition so as
more nearly to resemble petroleum (Hammar, 1934). This trans-
formation probably occurs very early in the history of the sediments,
and there is little if any evidence to support the view that bacterial
action continues after sediments have been deeply buried and subjected
to dynamic action (David White, 19385).
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 173

Up to quite recently such evidence as was available to geologists
tended to show that petroleum was formed at the time of deposition
and buried with the sediments (McCoy, 1926, p. 1022). However,
extensive chemical examination of recent marine sediments indi-
cates that petroleum is not present in them and consequently is not
formed at the time of deposition or shortly thereafter (Trask and
Wu, 1930). Recent sediments, therefore, appear to have reached
a stage in their history at which the bacterial action has largely run
its course but at which petroleum has not yet been formed. The
organic matter, the “mother substance” of petroleum, as it is some-
times called, presumably is present in such sediments in solid form,
analogous to the solid bituminous material, called “kerogen,” found
in oil shales (McCoy and Keyte, 1934, p. 271). Berl (1938, p. 2)
considers that, after bacterial action has ceased, carbohydrates,
humic acids, and lignin are converted into intermediate substances
which he calls “protoproducts” and which he considers the parent ma-
terials for petroleum. Other chemists, notably Hackford (1932),
have also sought to trace the transformation of vegetable matter into
petroleum. Most chemists consider that only moderate temperatures,
such as are within the bounds of geologic probability, are required to
effect such changes. Time, of which the geologist sees an abundant
supply, is also thought to be an important factor in the conversion.

Much work remains to be done before the various steps in the
conversion of organic matter into petroleum can be accurately traced.
At some stage in the process the solid organic matter laid down with
the sediments is converted into fluids, and it is only then that move-
ment from source bed to reservoir becomes possible.

As a result of studies of crude oils in the Gulf Coast, Barton (1934)
concluded that petroleum, when first formed, is heavy and viscous and
has, as the result of the operation of heat, pressure, and perhaps other
forces, evolved into progressively lighter oils. He has, however, also
observed that deeper oils have lower specific gravity than those nearer
the surface. To what extent this relationship may be explained by
loss of volatile constituents through escape to the surface is unknown,
but the inference of recent intensive geochemical studies is that there
is a definite upward movement of hydrocarbons from the reservoirs
to the surface, even though the cover rocks may appear highly im-
pervious to such migration.

GEOLOGIC FORCES OPERATING TO PRODUCE PETROLEUM

The chemical reactions required to produce petroleum from the
“mother substance” have presumably not occurred spontaneously but
have been brought about by competent physical forces, such as heat,
pressure, and movement. All these forces are operative in deeply
174. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

buried sediments, and geologists, contrasting conditions in such sedi-
ments with those occurring at the surface, have naturally sought in
some way to relate the origin of petroleum to them.

As a section of sedimentary rocks is deposited, the weight of the
overburden progressively increases, and the deeper beds become
heavily loaded.. The pressure thus created causes compaction of
the sediments, which become more dense with increase in depth
(Athy, 1930a). Compaction is accompanied by closer spacing of the
grains and by the gradual displacement from the sediment of most
of the interstitial water. The friction resulting from movement of
the grains may produce some heat (Pratt, 1934, p. 242), and chemical
reactions, such as the oxidation of pyrite, may be another source,
but it is probable that the internal heat of the earth is the chief
cause of increase in temperature with depth. Whatever the cause,
recent drilling in sedimentary basins to depths approaching 8 miles
has revealed the existence of temperatures of nearly 300° F. Such
temperatures are greater than those which chemists have usually
considered would be available for geochemical reactions leading to
the formation of petroleum. The opinion (McCoy and Keyte, 1934,
p- 269) that most of the known oil fields were formed at temperatures
lower than 140° F. may, therefore, require revision. Even tempera-
tures of around 300° F. are, however, lower than those usually
considered to be within the “cracking range,” and the reactions by
which petroleum has been formed may still, from the chemist’s
standpoint, be considered low-temperature changes. The reactions
by which organic matter is converted to petroleum are essentially
endothermic, and the energy present in the form of heat in the sedi-
ments where petroleum is being formed accordingly facilitates them.

Pressure may have had an important effect in the formation of
petroleum by favoring polymerization (Brooks, 1938, p. 51). Hy-
drogenation and other types of chemical transformation of hydro-
carbons are also facilitated by pressure (Pratt, 1934, p. 241). In
addition to the weight of the overburden, pressure in sediments may
be due to hydrostatic head, the presence of petroleum gases in porous
reservoirs, and possibly other factors such as cementation and
chemical metamorphism. As water-free sedimentary rocks have an
average specific gravity above 2.5, the weight of the overburden
might be expected to result in pressures at depths greatly in excess
of the weight of a column of water of equivalent height. Measure-
ments indicate, however, that the hydrostatic pressures existing in
underground reservoirs normally correspond to the weight of such
a column of water (Versluys, 1932) rather than to the weight of
the overlying sediments. This has been found true in wells drilled to
depths of over 13,000 feet in which the reservoir pressures exceed
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 175

6,000 pounds per square inch. When pressures of that magnitude
occur in combination with temperatures of 300° F., their potency
to effect chemical changes must be great.

Recent unconsolidated sediments contain large amounts of water.
As compaction progresses, fluids in the strata which are being com-
pressed are forced from them. While this movement may be of
great importance in connection with the migration of petroleum
(Athy, 1930b), it may also be a significant factor in the chemi-
cal reactions which produce petroleum by facilitating molecular
rearrangement.

AGGREGATION

The work of Trask and others has indicated that there is great varia-
tion in richness of organic content between types of sediments and be-
tween beds in the same geologic section. Vertical variation in organic
content is generally greater than horizontal variation. But, after full
allowance has been made for such differences, the fact remains that
organic matter is quite universally distributed throughout sediments of
marine origin. The sediments which are usually richest in organic
matter are fine-textured shales, and the organic matter is minutely
disseminated through them. The pore spaces of such sediments are of
capillary dimensions, and older sediments of this character are highly
impervious to the movement of fluids. When first deposited, such sedi-
ments were clays and silts with large volumes of interstitial water
(Trask, 1932, p. 77; Twenhofel, 1932, p. 258).

It is in such an environment that the solid organic matter laid down
with the sediments has been transformed into other compounds which
are capable of being transported by water. If the organic matter were
water-soluble its movement through capillary spaces would occur more
readily than if it were in the form of minute globules of hydrocarbons
insoluble in water. It is conceivable that the solid organic matter
which is later to become petroleum has at first been converted into
water-soluble or water-miscible intermediate compounds and that it
was in some such state when it first left the place of original deposition.
In that case the further chemical change of such intermediate com-
pounds to petroleum might occur after the organic matter had been
removed from the point of original deposition and had, in the course
of its movement, come into contact with solutions or forces which had
caused further reactions to produce the hydrocarbons which collec-
tively form petroleum and natural gas. No experimental work with
which the writer is conversant clarifies this problem.

Whatever the precise process of chemical change may have been, it
seems necessary to postulate that somewhere in the very early history
of petroleum there must have been an aggregation of finely divided
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1943

material into appreciable quantities of hydrocarbons which would be
present in the water-saturated sediments either as a solute or in the
form of globules physically distinct from the water. While the mecha-
nism of this process is unknown, it appears to be an essential link in
the chain of the origin of petroleum.

The available evidence indicates that this aggregation occurs within
the source rock. Older sediments of marine origin, both dense and
porous, are impregnated with small quantities of petroleum, in con-
trast with recent sediments in which it is rare or absent. This was
well known to Orton (1888, p. 83) who estimated the quantity of
petroleum present in this diffused condition in some of the rocks
of Ohio. Surprisingly little detailed investigation of the quantity
and distribution of petroleum in older rocks has been carried on.
Trask has determined the organic content of many samples of older
rocks from wells, but the analyses do not disclose the amount of organic
matter present in the form of petroleum. Stout (1936, p. 799) studied
various Ohio limestones and shales and found that the content of hydro-
carbons was about 0.5 percent. Most geologists will probably be in
accord with the statement of Illing (1938b, p. 209) that

There can be no doubt that a still larger amount of oil and gas occurs as a more
widespread but less concentrated impregnation of the denser rocks, the clays,
marls and limestones surrounding the reservoir rocks.

In concluding this discussion of the genesis of petroleum, the state-
ment seems justified that the conversion of the complex organic sub-
stances deposited with the sediments into the petroleum found in older
rocks takes place within the source bed and results from the various
chemical and physical forces to which the organic matter has therein
been subjected.

MIGRATION OF PETROLEUM
GENERAL STATEMENT

The accumulation of petroleum in immense concentrations in oil
pools is in contrast with its wide diffusion through the source beds in
which it had its origin. The movement of petroleum from source to
reservoir has resulted from the operation of physical forces, and
geologists are vitally concerned with the character of these forces and
the extent of their effectiveness. This movement is collectively called
migration, but the use of such an inclusive term is deceptive, for the
process is doubtless highly complex. In its simplest form it may
be resolved into a consideration of (1) movement of oil from source
bed into carrier bed; and (2) movement through the carrier bed to
the reservoir.
PETROLEUM GEOLOGY—HEROY 177

MIGRATION FROM SOURCE BED TO CARRIER BED

The compaction of sediments by the increasing load of younger beds
deposited in succession is accompanied by the loss of a large part of the
interstitial water they originally contained (Athy, 19380). The con-
nate water remaining in the sediments adheres closely to the individual
grains and fills the intervening voids. Because of the presence of this
film of closely adhering water, which is present even in well-saturated
oil reservoirs, it is probable that petroleum normally does not wet the
grains but remains in the interstitial passages in the form of minute
globules (Schilthuis, 1937, p. 200). The movement of the interstitial
water is regarded as the principal cause of the migration of oil from
the source beds. The outward movement of water from such sedi-
ments will be in the direction of least resistance, from the clays and
marls into the more permeable strata. If at the time this outward
movement is in progress petroleum has already formed in the sedi-
ments, it may be expected to move with the expressed water into the
more porous beds which are competent to act as carriers (Illing, 1933).

With the passage of time and the completion of the cycle of deposi-
tion the sediments gradually become lithified and a condition will ulti-
mately be reached in which the compaction of the deeper beds will cease.
The more competent members of the series will acquire strength to sus-
tain the load of the overlying sediments, and the fluids which they
contain will reach a state of equilibrium.

Capillarity has also been thought competent to cause the movement
of petroleum from the source bed to the carrier bed. McCoy (1926, p.
1027) concluded, on the basis of experimental evidence, that there is
an interchange of fluids between the source bed and the carrier bed,
the oil in the source bed being expelled into the more porous bed and
replaced by an equal amount of water. This interchange was thought
to occur in the capillary spaces of the source rock and to be caused
by the superior surface tension of the water ; the water, having a greater
adhesive tension for the wall of the capillary than does the oil, and
its adhesive tension for the wall of the capillary being greater than the
surface tension of the oil, the oil column in the capillary would be
broken, and minute globules of oil would be split off and moved through
the capillary in the direction of the more permeable bed.

Other forces which have been considered as contributing to the move-
ment of oil from denser to more porous rocks are artesian circulation
and diastrophic movements in the sedimentary basin. The effective-
ness of the first-mentioned is questionable, for artesian flow is likely
to take place through the most porous beds and is unlikely to be effec-
tive in the denser sediments. Diastrophism may have been effective
in creating compressive forces which may, in turn, have acted on the
