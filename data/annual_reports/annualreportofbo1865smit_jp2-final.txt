PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION

OF THE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]

LN TR: O:D/UjG2) 1-0; Ni.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan
of Organization.

1. Witt oF Suiruson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, ‘‘to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and diffu-
sion of knowledge among men.’’

2.The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government
of the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of
the testator.

3. The Institution is: not a national establishment, ‘as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and
perpetuate his name.

4. The objects of the Institution are, 1st, to increase, and 2d, to
ditfuse knowledge among men.

5. These two. objects ‘should not be eonfounded with one another.
The first is to enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men. .

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge ; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

7. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths ; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press,

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the Institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally ; can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or
be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

~
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION,

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
a considerable portion of the interest which has accrued should be
added to the principal.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small.. Economy should, therefore, be consulted in the
construction of the building ; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of the organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be
benefited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expen-
diture on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations, deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
a museum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To INCREASE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and,

2. To appropriate annually a portion ef the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

TO DIFFUSE KNOWLEDGE. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge ; and,

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.

I. By stimulating researches.

1. Facilities afforded for the production of original memoirs on all
branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of vol-
umes, in a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 9

publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research ; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected. »

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
the branch to which the memoir pertains; and to be accepted for
publication only in case the report of this commission is favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a favorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the Trans-
actions of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to
all the colleges and principal libraries, in this country. One part of
the remaining copies may be offered for sale ; and the other carefully
preserved, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand
from new institutions.

7. Antbstract, or popular account, of the contents of these memoirs
to be given to the public through the annual report of the Regents to
Congress.

II. By appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different objects; so that
in course of time each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be published,
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge.

4. Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving
the problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determina-
tion of the weight of the earth, of the moeety of electricity, and of
light ; chemical analyses of soils and plants ; collection and publica-
tion of scientific facts, accumulated in the offices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches, and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in Amertcan history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the
different races of men in North America; also, explorations and ac-
curate surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people
of our country. ~~
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I. By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year im
all branches of knowledge not strictly pi ‘ofessional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally in-
teresting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some
of the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals,
as the income ot the Institution or the changes in the branches of
knowledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publi-
cations, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his
report ; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on
the title-page of the report.

4. The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress, for partial distri-
bution, tlfe remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific in-
stitutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports :*

I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to arts.

H. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &e.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world ; penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.

10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.

12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

Il. By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the

*This part of the plan has been but partially carried out.
»

PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. tik

direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges, previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a library and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation
of a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

3. These two plans are not incompatible with one another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, a library will be re-
quired, consisting, Ist, of a complete collection of the transactions
and proceedings of all the learned societies in the world; 2d, of the
more important current periodical publications, and other works
necessary in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

3. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those
mentioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the
United States should be procured, in order that the valuable books
first purchased may be such as are not to be found in the United
States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should7be collected for rendering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind. *

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art
casts of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of
expense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

12. A small appropriation should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act.as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties ot librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art. Distinguished individuals should also be invited
to give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has be-
come the settled policy of the Institution. The only material change
is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted January 15,
1855; viz:

Resolved, That the Tth resolution passed by the Board of Regents,
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the
income between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed,.be, and it is hereby, repealed.

Resolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and‘proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT-OF THE SECRETARY.

To the Board of Regents :

GENTLEMEN : The principal object of the annual report of the Sec-
retary is to present to the Board of Regents, at the beginning of their
session, such an account of the events and operations of the previous
year as may serve as the basis of their deliberation, as well as
furnish the materials for a connected history of the Institution. Be-
sides this, however, it is desirable that each report should contain
such brief expositions as may tend to keep the ever-changing public
informed as to the true character of the establishment and of the re-
sults it is intended to produce. The importance of these repetitions
will be evident when it is recollected that these reports follow each
other after a considerable interval of time, are in great part distribu-
ted to different persons, and that now, after an interval of little less
than twenty years since the first one was published, but few indi-
viduals can obtain access to an entire set. Indeed, it is often a mat-
ter of surprise to meet so many intelligent persons, even in the city
of Washington, who are entirely ignorant of the terms of the bequest
on which the Institution is founded, and of the plan which has been
adopted to execute the trust thereby devolved upon the government.
It can, therefore, scarcely be too often repeated that the Institution
is not, as our foreign correspondents often suppose, an association of
learned men similar to the scientific societies of Europe and America;
that it is not a university for the education of youth, nor an agency
for the diffusion of useful knowledge among the people of the United
States, but primarily a foundation for enlarging the boundaries of
science by stimulating and assisting the researches of original inquir-
ers, wherever found, and for gratuitously diffusing the results of such
researches wherever they may conduce to the intellectual or material
interests of men.

The general plan adopted for the realization of these benevolent
purposes, and steadily pursued from the beginning, has been repeat-
edly explained in the successive reports, and might, indeed, be gath-
ered from almost any one of them by an attentive consideration of
the account given of the operations of each year. In the last report
a brief sketch was presented of all that had been accomplished in the
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

way of advancing science through the agency of the Smithsonian be-
quest, and in the present report it is purposed to continue this histor-
ical account to the close of the year just passed, accompanied with
such other particulars as may be needed for better illustration, and
such suggestions as may seem necessary in regard to the policy of the
Institution.

The most important event of 1865 was the destruction of a part of
the building and its contents by the fire of January 24. This event
must continue to form an epoch in the history of the Institution; and
though it cannot but be considered a most serious disaster,it may yet
lead to changes of importance in the correction of tendencies which
might ultimately have absorbed the annual income and neutralized
the more liberal policy which has thus far been pursued. In view,
therefore, of the character of the event, as well as the continuity of
the history, it is deemed expedient, before proceeding with an ac-
count of the operations of the year, to repeat briefly the facts con-
nected with the origin and results of the fire.

It may be well, however, for the better information of those not
acquainted with the Smithsonian building, to premise in regard to it
the following particulars: It consists of a main edifice two hundred
feet long and fifty wide, with two large wings and two connecting
ranges, having in allanextreme length, in an east and west direction,
of four hundred and fifty feet. In front and rear of the middle
portion.are projections, terminated by high towers, two on the north
and one on the south side; moreover, on each corner of the middle
building is a smaller tower, and also one on each of the two wings.

The whole of the first story of the main building, in a single room,
is devoted to the museum; the upper story, in three apartments,
was assigned to the lecture room, the gallery of art, and the cabinet
of apparatus. The west wing is entirely appropriated to the library;
the east wing to the residence of the Secretary and a storeroom for
publications and specimens of natural history. The east connecting
range contains the laboratcry and office rooms; the west range is an
extension of the museum. In the large towers were the Regents’
room, the offices of the Secretary, storerooms, and workshop.

Though the original plan was much admired for its architectural
effect, it was soon found that, in relation to the means at the disposal
of the building committee, it was too expensive to admit in its con-
struction of the exclusive use of fire-proof materials; hence, while the
exterior was to be constructed of cut freestone, it was concluded to
finish the interior in wood and stucco. Fortunately this plan, which
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

was carried outin regard to the wings, the connecting ranges,and
the towers, was abandoned before the completion of the main build-
ing. After the exterior of this, including the roof, had been finished,
and the framing of the interior was in place, the latter suddenly
wave way and was precipitated into the cellar—a mass of broken
timber. The attention of the Regents having been called by this
accident to the insecurity of the wood-work, they directed that
the further progress of the building should be stopped until means
could be accumulated for finishing the remainder of the edifice in a
more stable manner and with fire-proof materials. In accordance with
this direction, after an interval of several years, the construction
was recommenced under the direction of Captain (now General) B. 8S.
Alexander, of the Engineer corps, and the whole of the main building,
except the inside of the towers and the framing of the roof, which
had previously been completed, was finished in a substantial manner
in iron and brick work. The architect advised the removal of the
roof, but as this would have swelled the cost of the building still fur-
ther beyond the estimate and the means at command, and as the cov-
ering was of slate,the framing under it was thought to bein no danger
from fire. This, however, was destined to be the part on which the
first attack of the element was tobe made. Through a mistake in
some workmen, the pipe of a stove which had been temporarily used

in one of the upper rooms was introduced through the wall into a
furring space resembling a flue, but which discharged the heated air
from the combustion into the loft immediately under the roof, in-
stead of into the air, through the true chimney. The rafters were
set on fire, and before the burning was discovered the entire wood
work under the covering was in flames. The progress of the fire
was so rapid, that but few of the contents of the upper rooms could
be removed before the roof fell in. The flames soon extended to
the large towers, and as these acted as high chimneys, they greatly
increased the intensity of the combustion. The conflagration was
only stayed by the incombustible materials of the main building. Had
the original plan of constructing the interior of the edifice in wood-
and plaster been fully carried out, the whole structure would have
been destroyed, and the valuable library and rich collections of speci-
mens of natural history entirely lost.

The aperture which deceived the workmen was probably made by
those who originally plastered the building. It occupied a middle
point between two windows, and from its position, would naturally
lead to the inference that it was designed to conduct the products of
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

combustion directly into the chimney, from which it was only separated
by the thickness of a single brick. For what reason it had not been
placed in the middle between the two windows is unknown. It is
remembered that some ten years previous to the fire this opening
was, during several weeks, used for the insertion of a stove pipe,
without suspicion of accident at the time; but in the interval the
wood had undergone a process of drying which rendered it more
combustible.

Constantly impressed with the fact that the interior of the two
wings and the connecting ranges were constructed of combustible
material, I have always telt great anxiety on account of the lability
to conflagration of these parts of the building. ‘The rest of the edi-
fice, with the exception of the interior of the towers, was supposed
to be secure from injury of this nature. A night watch was con-
stantly kept, barrels and buckets filled with water were placed at
suitable points, and strict rules were adopted prohibiting the carry-
ing of exposed lights, as well as the practice of smoking,in any part
of the edifice. That these precautions were unavailing has been
seen; thefire having been communicated ut a point where danger
was least suspected, and in a manner which rendered its occurrence
sooner or later almost inevitable.

The weather at the time was extremely cold, and before the engines
could be brought into operation the whole of the roof was in flames.
Commencing at the west end of the centre building, the’ flames
were driveg by the wind, which blew from that direction, east-
wardly, and fortunately away from the library, in the west wing.
The destruction of the roof of the main building involved that of
the contents of the rooms immediately beneath-it, and also those of
the three principal towers adjacent. In the former were the Indian -
portrait gallery, the lecture room, and the apparatus room. The first
of these contained the large collection of paintings by Mr. Stanley
and a series of Indian portraits belonging to the government. The
lecture room was constructed on acoustic and optical principles, and
not only answered perfectly the ends for which it was immediately
intended, but had served also as a model for lecture rooms in various
parts of the country. The apparatus room contained the principal
part of the articles presented by the late Dr. Robert Hare, and a
large number of instruments of recent construction, intended both for
illustration and original research. ;

The losses in the south tower were, first, the contents of the Regents’
room, including the personal effects of Smithson; second, those of a

large room above it, in which were stored the private library of Rev.
Dr. Johns, of Virginia, and the public library of Beaufort, S. C.,de-
posited there at the request of Hon. Mr. Stanton, for preservation
until the end of the war; and third, in the attic, a large collection of
public documents and complete sets of the Smithsonian Reports, in-
tended for distribution. The effects of Smithson had but little in-
trinsic value, and were chiefly prized as mementoes of the founder of
the Institution. They consisted of a number of articles of chemical
and physical apparatus, such as were used by him in his perambula-
tory excursions, two small cabinets of minute specimens of miner-
als, a silver-plated dinner service, and a trunk filled with manu-
scripts. The portrait of Smithson while a student at Oxford, a me-

_ dallion likeness of him in bronze, his library, consisting of 150 vol-

umes, and a small painting were saved. The manuscripts consisted
principally of notes on scraps of paper, intended apparently for alpha-
betical arrangement in a common-place book, after the manner of a
philosophical dictionary.

The losses in the north towers were the contents of the offices of
the Secretary, including the records and copies of the correspondence
of the Institution, the wood-cuts to illustrate the publications, the
steel plates of an expensive memoir, several boxes of stereotype
plates, a large number of manuscripts of the Secretary on scientific
subjects, four memoirs accepted for publication, about a hundred
volumes of valuable books from the library, used for constant and
immediate reference; a large number of copies of the Smithsonian
Reports and duplicate documents; the contents of the workshop, con-
sisting of a lathe, forge, a full set of tools, and an assortment of
hardware and materials for the construction and repair of apparatus;
and of the upper room of the highest tower, including the clock-work
of an anemometer for recording the direction and force of the wind.
Not only was this instrument itself lost, but all the records which had
been obtained by the use of it for the last seven years. Fortunately,
nearly all the other meteorological records, which were in a lower
room, were saved.

The Indian portraits,as far as they were the likenesses of particu-
lar individuals, in most cases can never be reproduced, but we are
gratified to learn that the extensive collection of Mr. Catlin, of a sim-
ilar character, has been purchased in Europe by Mr. Harrison, of
Philadelphia, and will be rendered accessible to the student of eth-
nology. Besides this, there are in existence, particularly in Canada,
other portraits, sufficient in number and variety fully to illustrate the

heavily upon Mr. Stanley, the painter and owner of this collection.
It was the result of the labor of many years among the Indians; it
constituted the pride, as it has been the crowning effort, of his life,
and he ardently desired that it might be transmitted to posterity as
a monument of his enterprise and industry. The hope is entertained
that the government will see fit to give him an order to paint a pic-
ture for the Capitol, in which the principal figures of this collection
and the characteristics of the Indian race may be portrayed.

The apparatus presented by Dr. Hare was interesting on account
of its association with the history of the advance of science in this
country. The collection contained most of the articles invented by
the donor, and which are described in the scientific journals of the
first half of the present century. Among the chemical implements
were those used by that distinguished chemist, in procuring for the
first time, without the aid of galvanism, calcium, the metallic basis
oflime. A number of the articles of apparatus presented by Dr. Hare,
though injured by the fire, may be repaired, and I have taken meas-
ures for their restoration.

Among the articles of historic interest which were lost is the lens
used by Priestley for the evolution of oxygen from the oxide of mer-
cury, and by means of which the first distinct recognition of this ele-
mentary substance was effected.. It had been presented to the Insti-
tution by the nephew of the celebrated philosopher, as was also the
apparatus employed by Priestley in his experiments on bodies in con-
densed atmospheres. The latter was but slightly injured, and can
readily be repaired. The other articles of apparatus may be re-
placed at an expense of about ten thousand dollars.

The most irreparable loss was that of the records, consisting of
the official, scientific, and miscellaneous correspondence, embracing ~
35,000 pages of copied letters which had been sent, at least 30,000
of which were the composition of the Secretary, and 50,000 pages of
letters received by the Institution; the receipts for publications and
specimens; reports on various subjects which have been referred to
the Institution; the records of experiments instituted by the Secre-
tary for the government; four manuscripts of original investigations,
which had been adopted by the Institution for publication; a large
number of papers and scientific notes of the Secretary ; a series of
diaries, memorandum and account books. Fortunately, however, a
detailed history of the general operations of the Institution is pre-
‘served in the printed reports; and a large amount of correspondence
connected with natural history and meteorology was saved,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

Since the occurrence of the fire all the operations have been car-
ried on in the lower story of the east wing of the building, (the upper
part still continuing to be the residence of the Secretary,) and in the
several rooms of the adjoining east range. Connected with an office
in the latter, the lower story of the tower attached to the southeast
corner of the main building has been converted into a fire-proof
vault, in which all the valuable papers and records are constantly
kept, except for the usually short time they are required for con-
sultation. To insure the wakefulness and fidelity of the watchmen,
we have introduced the use of an instrument called a ‘detector,’ which
records the number and the times of his visits to the several parts
of the building. For this instrument, which has rendered good ser-
vice during the past year, we are indebted to the liberality of its
inventor, Mr. J. E. Bauerk, of Boston, who, in consideration of the
loss which the Institution has sustained by fire, kindly presented it
free of charge.

A circumstantial account is given by the building committee of
what has been done toward the reconstruction of the edifice. From
this it will be seen that the plan adopted contemplates not merely
the repair of the damage by the fire, but the restoration of the
several parts in fire-proof materials, and with such alterations in the
division of the interior space as will better adapt it to the uses of
the Institution.

The plans have been prepared and the work superintended by Mr.
Adolph Cluss, an architect who was warmly recommended by the
mayor of Washington as having been successful in designing and
erecting the public school-houses of the city as well as a number of
churches and other buildings. These plans have been critically ex-
amined and, in some cases, modified by the chairman of the building
committee, General Delafield, who, by his knowledge and experience
in the line of engineering, has rendered the Institution valuable
service.

No appropriation has yet been made by Congress to aid in the
restoration of the building. Considering, however, the large amount
of government property intrusted to the care of the Institution, it
can scarcely be doubted that in a normal condition of the national
_ finances an appropriation for such purpose would have been readily
granted.

In consideration of the extraordinary outlay required for the recon-
struction of the building, an effort has been made to reduce as much
as possible the miscellaneous expenses, and to engage in no enter-
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

prise that is not absolutely necessary to the continuance of the general
operations. So many articles, however, of furniture and stores of
hardware and stationery were to be replaced that we have not been
able to reduce the expenditures to as low a point as we could wish;
yet it will be seen that they fall somewhat below those of the pre-
ceding year.

A reference to the report of the Executive Committee will show
that the following is the present condition of the fund:

First. The whole amount of money originally derived from the
bequest of Smithson is still in the treasury of the United States,
bearing interest at six per cent., paid semi-annually, and yielding
$30,910 yearly.

Second. Seventy-five thousand dollars of an extra fund are in
bonds of the State of Indiana, at five per cent. interest, also paid
semi-annually, yielding $3,750.

Third. Fifty-three thousand five hundred dollars of the same fund
are in bonds of the State of Virginia, twelve thousand in those of
Tennessee, and five hundred in those of Georgia, fpom which nothing
has been derived since the commencement of the war.

The southern State stocks have increased during the year in mar-
ketable value, though no interest has been derived from them.

The interest on the original fund for the past year has been paid
by the Secretary of the Treasury in coin, under the advice of the
Solicitor of the department, who, having investigated the subject, de-
cided that in accordance with the usages of the government the
Institution was entitled thus to be paid.

At the end of last year there was a balance in the hands of the
treasurer of unexpended interest of $29.484 08, which, with the in-
come on the original bequest and premium on coin, made a disposable
fund of $84,956 37; of this sum $39,121 77 have been expended on
the building, and $32,115 97 for the maintenance of the establish-
ment and for carrying on all the operations of the Institution, leaving
a balance of $13,718 63 to be further applied to the building.

In view of the great expenditure of the government on account of
the war, the Institution did not at first claim, as it justly might have
done, the payment of the annual income of the bequest in specie; but
after the great loss sustained by the fire, the necessity could not be ~
avoided of calling the attention of the Secretary of the Treasury to
this subject. The claim, after consideration, was allowed, so far as
related to the current income, but the question relative to the differ-
ence between the payment of the interest which had previously
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ae

accrued in currency or in coin has not been settled by the depart-
ment. That the Institution is entitled to the benefit resulting from
this difference was the unanimous opinion of the Board of Regents at
their last session, and among them of Chief Justice Chase. This
learned jurist has since stated, that when Secretary of the Treasury
he had in several cases ordered the currency received by parties who
after investigation were found justly entitled to be paid in coin, to be
again returned into the treasury, and had directed payment to be
made to them in specie nominally of the same amount.

It has been mentioned in the two preceding reports, that a part of
the original bequest had been left in England as the principal of an
annuity payable to the mother of Smithson’s nephew. The annui-
tant having died, a power of attorney signed by Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, was sent to Fladgate, Clarke & Finch,
solicitors, in England, authorizing them to collect the money and pay
it to the order of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The
proceeds from this, deducting the expenses of collection, were £5, 262
Qs. 3d., which were temporarily deposited with George Peabody &
Co., who not only transacted the business without charge, but allowed
four per cent. interest-on the money while it remained in their hands.
The total amount of this residuary legacy received by the Institution,
including the interest, £153 19s. 4d., was $26,210 63 in gold, which
being sold at the current premium, (about 207,) yielded $54,165 38 in
United States currency. This sum was invested in government bonds,
bearing interest at T 3-10 per cent., and deposited for safe-keeping
with General Spinner, the Treasurer of the United States.

It was at first supposed that the interest on this fund could be
immediately applied to the uses of the Institution, but upon a critical
examination of the enactments of Congress in regard to the bequest,
it was found by the Solicitor of the Treasury that the act of Congress
of 1846 appropriated only that portion of the money which was
then in the treasury, and made no provision for the disposition of the
residuary legacy. The Secretary of the Institution was therefore
called upon by Mr. Fessenden, Secretary of the Treasury, to deposit this
fund to his order in the treasury of the United States until Congress
should authorize the appropriation of it to the maintenance or use of
the Institution.

The cost of the restoration of the building in fire-proof materials
without changing the external appearance has, as formerly stated,
been far greater than was anticipated. Whether the portion of the
work yet to be executed will much exceed in cost that which has
ap REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

already been completed, will depend upon the price of materials and
oflabor. The Institution may in time be able to finish this work with-
out encroaching on its present capital, provided the Secretary of the
Treasury shall recognize the inadequacy of the payments of interest
which for three years were made in the depreciated currency of the
time. If this allowance be not made, and no assistance be received
from Congress, then, in order to secure the building and its contents
from injury by the weather, the Institution will be obliged to sacrifice
a portion of its extra fund, and to the extent of this forever diminish
its power to ‘‘increase and diffuse knowledge among men.”’

I have always been opposed to asking appropriations from Congress
for the maintenance of the Institution, believing that the government
is called upon to do nothing further in its behalf than carefully to guard
the original bequest, and see that it is faithfully applied in an efficient
manner to the purposes intended by the donor. But the government,
after having voluntarily accepted the trust, is bound in good faith to
carry out the intentions of the testator, and to make up for any en-
croachments upon the funds which may have resulted from improvi-
dent or defective legislation. From abundant experience of at least
the last fifteen years, it has been shown that the cost and maintenance
of a building of the character which has been erected, so far from
being necessary to the most efficient realization of the intentions of
the founder, have been a constant source of extraneous expense, and
have absorbed a large amount of money which ought to have been
added to the active capital; and the question may now be asked
with propriety, whether, since this building was erected by its
own agents, in conformity with a law of Congress, an appropriation
should not be made to restore it in fire-proof materials, and to devote
it in whole or in part to purposes of the government. A single wing
of the edifice is sufficient to carry on all the essential operations of
the Institution, and the whole remaining part of the building might
be applied to the national collections, which have been greatly en-
riched at the expense of the Institution, to the accommodation of the
Army Medical Museum, or to the uses of the Agricultural Department.

Publications. —During the past year the general operations of the
Institution have been continued with unabated energy, although,
on account of the increased cost of paper and printing, the number
of copies of publications distributed has not been so great as in some
previous years. The papers, however, which have been printed are
stereotyped, and all our domestic institutions will be supplied as soon
as a reduction of prices or an increase of the income of the Institu-

Smithsonian Contributions.—The first paper which has been re-
ceived for publication in the quarto series, and which has not yet
been described, is that on the planet Neptune, by Professor New-
comb, of the National Observatory.

It will be recollected by those who are familiar with the histery of
the operations of the Institution, that shortly after the discovery of the
planet Neptune, the first ephemeris of, or, in other words, a table for
indicating, its position in the heavens at any time during the year was
prepared and published at the expense of the Smithsonian fund. This
ephemeris was computed from an orbit based on a remarkable dis-
covery of Professor Sears ©. Walker, then of the Washington Obser-
vatory. Beginning with observations of the movement of the planet
during a period of four months, Mr. Walker traced its path among
the stars through its whole revolution of 166 years, and was thus
enabled to carry its position backward until it fell among a cluster of
stars, each of which had been accurately mapped by the celebrated
Lalande, near the close of the last century. From a critical scrutiny
of these stars, Mr. Walker was led to conclude that one of this clus-
ter observed by Lalande on the night of the 10th May, 1795, was the
planet Neptune. Availing himself of this discovery, Mr. Walker
had now a series of observations, embracing not merely a few
months of the movement of the planet, but its entire motion during
a period of fifty years. From these data he was enabled to deduce
a perfect elliptical orbit, or one which the body would describe were
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

there no other planets in the system, and from this to calculate an
ephemeris.

The motion of Neptune was further investigated by another of our
countrymen, Professor Peirce, of Cambridge. He calculated the
action of all the other planets on Neptune, and obtained results
which enabled Mr. Walker to correct his elliptical orbit, and to com-
pare the calculated places of the planet with its actual position in the
heavens. This led to a further correction of the orbit, and to a more
perfect table of calculated places. The Ephemeris was published
annually for several years, until the establishment of the American
Nautical Almanac, when, in accordance with the general policy of
the Institution, it was transferred to that work.

During the last nineteen years, which have elapsed since the investi-
gation of Professors Peirce and Walker relative to the orbit of this
planet, a series of accurate observations have been made upon its mo-
tion at the principal observatories of the world, and these have now
been discussed by Professor 8S. Newcomb, of the Washington Observa-
tory, a young mathematician in whose progress and advancement this.
establishment has taken great interest.

The objects of Mr. Newcomb’s investigations, as stated in the in-
troduction of his memoir, are as follows:

1. To determine the elements of the orbit of Neptune with as
much exactness as a series of observations extending through an are
of forty degrees will admit of.

2. To inquire whether the mass of Uranus can be deduced from
the motions of Neptune.

3. To inquire whether these motions indicate the existence of an
extra neptunian planet, or throw any light on the question of the
existence of such a planet.

4. To construct general tables and formule, by which the place
of Neptune may be found at any time, and more particularly between
the years 1,600 and 2,000.

The work is divided into five chapters.

The first is introductory, giving a brief review of the previous la-
bors of astronomers in perfecting the theory of Neptune. The only
approximately correct theory which had been published is shown to
be that of Professor Sears C. Walker and Professor Benjamin Peirce,
whose labors were given to the world in the second and third vol-
umes of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, and in the first
volume of the Proceedings of the American Academy. The elements
of this theory were, however, far from correct, owing to the insufti-
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ciency of the observations which had been made when the theory was
constructed. On account of the extremely slow motion of Neptune,
the errors of the observations would be multiplied several hundred
times in the final elements of the orbit.

The second chapter contains the computation of the perturbations
of Neptune arising from the attractions of the other planets. This
was the most difficult and laborious part of the work, the difficulty
being greatly increased by the circumstance that the attraction of
Uranus causes the orbit to pass through a regular change of form in
a cycle of about 4,300 years.

The third chapter gives a discussion of the meridian observations
of Neptune, made at the observatories of Greenwich, Paris, Wash-
ington, Cambridge, Hamburg, and Albany.

In the fourth chapter, the positions of the planet given by the ob-
servations are compared with a provisional theory, for the purpose of
correcting the elements, after which, supposing Neptune to be attracted
only by the known planets, its motions, as observed during the nine-
teen years since its discovery, are compared with the results of the
theory of gravitation, and the greatest difference between the theoreti-
cal and observed longitudes is less than a quarter of a second in space,
a minuteness so inconsiderable that, if multiplied by 300 times, it would
still be too small to be perceptible by the naked eye, and the discre-
pancy is as likely to be due to the errors of the observations them-
selves as to that of the assumption of no exterior planet.

It is therefore concluded that there is no evidence of any unknown
cause influencing the motions of Neptune, and consequently no evi-
dence of the existence of an extra neptunian planet. At the same
time, this is only negative evidence; for supposing the extra planet
to exist, centuries might be required for its attraction to exert any
appreciable influence upon the motions of Neptune. For a similar
reason there are no reliable data for correcting the mass of Uranus.

The fifth chapter is devoted to the tables, which are founded on
the theory finally concluded upon, and will probably not be subject
to errors of more than a very few seconds during the remainder of
the present century.

The history of the planet Neptune in relation to the perfection of its
orbit exhibit a series of facts alike creditable to the science of this
country and the policy of the Smithsonian Institution.

The next paper for the ‘‘ Contributions’ is an exposition of the re-
sults of the discussion of the observations made during the expedition
under the direction of Dr. I. I. Hayes in the arctic regions, by Chas.
A. Schott, of the United States, Coast Survey.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. i

The expedition, during which these observations were made, was
organized and principally equipped through the enterprise of Dr.
Hayes, assisted by contributions of a number of liberal gentlemen
interested in the advance of physical geography. The principal ob-
ject of the enterprise was the extension of the explorations of Dr.
EB. K. Kane north of Baffin’s Bay, and to make such observations as
would add to our knowledge of the physical condition of the arctic
regions. The expedition was mainly furnished with instruments by
the Coast Survey and the Smithsonian Institution, and after its re-
turn the records of its observations in their rough state, or as they
were made, were presented to the Institution for reduction and dis-
cussion.

It is scarcely necessary to mention that scientific truths are not
generally immediately deduced from the simple observation of phenom-
ena, but that these require in most cases corrections to free them
from the effects of extraneous and other causes. Thus in observing
the place of the moon or a planet, the position as given directly by
the instrument must be corrected for refraction, for parallax and
for instrumental errors. So with the observations of the baro-
meter, a correction must be applied for the relative expansion of the
mercury and of the brass case in which the glass tube is contained,
and also for capillarity, and in many cases for the elevation of the
instrument above the level of the sea.

After the observations have been submitted to the process of
correction, to which the name of reduction has been applied, they are
then in a condition for scientific analysis, or for what is technically
called discussion. It seldom happens that any phenomenon is the
result of a single approximate cause. In almost all cases the effect
observed is the result of a series of concurring causes, and it is the
object of the scientific inquirer, if possible, to ascertain the separate
effect of each. For example, the height of the tide at a given place
and time is due to the conjoint action of the sun and moon modified
by the form and direction of the coast, to concurring or adverse tidal
waves, and also to the direction of the wind. In a successful discus:
sion each of these effects should be separately exhibited, and the
amount of the several influences of each critically ascertained. With-
out such reduction and discussion the crude observations exhibit a
mass of figures without apparent connexion, and give no indication
‘of the relation of phenomena. Unfortunately the labor attending
these processes is so great, and in many. cases the skill required so
unusual, that individual enterprise and ordinary attainment are in-
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sufticient to accomplish the end, and on this account immense masses of
physical observations are of little value to science. Even those
made by Parry, Ross, and the other explorers in the arctic regions
have not yet been subjected to the analytical processes by which all
the interesting truths relative to the physical geography of the globe
are to be deduced. It is in this line that the Smithsonian Institution
has especially rendered good service in the way of advancing science.
Of this fact the memoir in question, with those which the Institution

‘has published relative to the observations made by the expedition

—

under the direction of Dr. Kane, and that under Sir F. L. McClin-
tock, and the discussion of the observations made at Girard College
by Professor A. D. Bache, are obvious illustrations.

For investigations of this kind the Institution has been fortunate in
obtaining the services of a computer so expert and sagacious as Mr.
Schott, since few persons are to be found who combine the varied
qualifications necessary to so difficult an undertaking.

The results of the observations made under the direction of Dr.
Hayes are presented in four parts: the first relates tothe astronomi-
cal and geodetic; the second, to the magnetic; the third, to the tidal;
and the fourth, to the meteorological observations.

The first part contains all the geographical positions determined
by the explorers, including a series of observations to ascertain the
latitude and longitude of Port Foulke, the winter quarters of the ex-
pedition in 186061; also a general survey of Kennedy channel, and
a minute survey of Smith’s straits. The memoir presents a table of
eighteen geographical positions, all determined with astronomical ac-
curacy, by means of which, and the help of angles and solar bearings,
the outlines of a large map were traced. It is highly gratifying to
find, says Mr. Schott, that a remarkable agreement exists with the
prominent points observed during Kane’s expedition, and, indeed,
that the exploration of Dr. Hayes is truly an extension and verifica-
tion of the labors of his predecessor in the same regioa.

Nor is this all; it is proper to state that a new sound was dis-
covered, opening to the westward near Cape Sabine, and also that
two points noticed by Kane and described as headlands were found
to be parts of two islands at the entrance of a bay; also the shore-
line of Whale sound was fully developed, as well as the whole of the
western coast of Kennedy channel. All these results, with the posi-
tions of the glaciers, are exhibited on a general chart of the regions
explored, and on a special chart of Smith’s straits. ,

The agreement of the results of the observations under Dr. Hayes
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

and Dr. Kane is due to the fact that in both expeditions the greater
portion of the observations were made by Mr. August Sonntag, well
known to sciepee by his previous labors in astronomy and physics.
By his early death the expedition sustained a great loss, since through
his aid still greater additions would have been made to our knowl-
edge of the regions explored.

Included in the first part of the reductions is also an account of
the pendulum observations, intended to furnish information as to the
relative intensity of the force of gravity, and, consequently, of the
figure of the earth. The pendulum used in these observations is a
simple bar of brass, five feet seven three-fourth inches in length and
one inch and four-tenths in breadth, and seven-tenths in thickness,
weighing nearly twenty-two pounds. It is furnished with two steel
knife-edges, placed at 14.2 inches from either end, so that it may
be vibrated first with one end downward, and then with the other,
affording in each position a series of independent observations. The
direction of the face of the pendulum could also be reversed, by means
of which the results of their regularities of the knife-edge could at
least in part be eliminated.

For comparison of the observations which had been made in the
arctic regions, a series was instituted, previous to the sailing of the
expedition, with the same pendulum, at the Harvard Observatory, in
Cambridge, by the late director, George P. Bond. The result ob-
tained by the comparison indicates a smaller value for the polar de-
pression of the earth than that deduced from all previous pendulum
observations in the northern region. If combined with these, it will
bring the resulting figure of the earth nearer to that previously de-
duced from the measurement of arcs of the meridian in various parts
of the world.

The compression, as deduced by Mr. Schott from all the observa-
tions of the expedition under Dr. Hayes, is 37a part of the polar ra-
dius. The excess of the number of vibrations in a day at Port Foulke,
over the number made by the same pendulum in the same time at
the Harvard Observatory, was 1293. Tie observations were cor-
rected for the height above the level of the sea, for the expansion of
the metal on account of variation of temperature, and other devia-
tions from anormal condition. It is highly desirable that the same
pendulum be vibrated at several points on the eastern coast of the
United States, as nearly as possible, under the same meridian as Port
Foulke, in order to obtain a series of independent determinations of
the curvature of the earth; and for this purpose the instrument has
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been lent to the Coast Survey, to be vibrated at New York, Wash-
ington, and Key West. The observations at New York will afford
the means of connecting the results of a similar kind in Europe and
other parts of the Old World, through the series of observations made
by General Sabine in that city in 1822-23, at the old site of Colum-
bia College.

The observations of part second, which relate to magnetism, are
of two kinds, namely, differential and absolute; the first made at Port
Foulke, between November and March, 1860-’61, on fifteen days,
during each hour of the twenty-four, being intended to ascertain the
diurnal variation of the magneticneedle. The results of these ob-
servations are presented in connexion with those of Dr. Kane, in
the form of a curve in which the agreement is strikingly exhibited.

From both series it appears that the north end of the needle at-
tains its greatest westerly deviation at one p. m.; its greatest easterly
deflection, between two and three o’clock in the morning; its normal
position, at seven in the morning, and at the same hour in the evening.
From these additions to our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism we
have been enabled to state the fact that when simultaneous observa-
tions are made at different places, the motions of the needle are found
to be governed by the local time at each place. From this it has been
inferred that the cause of the daily motion of the needle is connected
with the diurnal motion of the sun. The one o’clock greatest western
excursion is common to all localities in the northern magnetic hemi-
sphere, and is the most constant feature of the daily motion of the
needle.

The declination was determined at fourteen localities on the coast
of Greenland, between latitudes 72 and 80. These have been dis-
cussed in combination with the observations of Dr. Kane, and the
result is given on a magnetic chart of the vicinity of Smith’s strait.
The horizontal component of the magnetic intensity was determined
at seven stations, and these, combined with those by Dr. Kane, are
also represented on the same chart. The inclination or dip was ob-
served at six localities, and were similarly combined with Kane’s
determination, and likewise exhibited on the same chart.

It isa remarkable fact that but three auroras of sufficient brilliancy
to attract the attention of the observers were seen at Port Foulke
during the winter of 1860—61, though many were noticed during the
same period in lower latitudes; and this fact is the more interesting
since the position above mentioned is very nearly the centre of the
auroral belt as marked out by Professor Loomis, and exhibited in the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

appendix of the report for this year. Although the aurora is now
known to be an electrical phenomenon, it is certain that its region of
greatest activity is not the magnetic pole of the earth, but isin a
vone of several degrees in breadth, including the geographical poles
eccentrically; nevertheless, it is also clear that it is influenced in its
motions by the magnetism of the globe.

The third part, which relates to tidal observations, consists of
two series: the first were made during November and December, 1860;
the second in June and July, 1861. In the first series the height of
the tide was noted every half hour; in the second series it was ob-
served at every ten minutes about the time of high and low water.
The apparatus employed consisted of a rope to which a stone was
attached at the lower end resting on the bottom and passing over a
pulley attached to a movable weight at the other. The pulley was
supported by a tripod standing over a hole in the ice at a short dis-
tance from the vessel, and the changes of the height of tide were
indicated by the vertical motion of the smaller weight. Corrections
were applied for the irregular stretching of the rope and also for the
errors of the watch. From the records thus corrected, Mr. Schott
has determined the height of the average sea level for each day, and
has compared this with the moon’s declination parallax, or distance
from the earth, the atmospheric pressure, and the direction and force
of the wind. It is found that a variation of between one and two
inches in the height of the water is due to the changes in the moon’s
declination from zero to its maximum value; also that a rise of one inch
in the mercury of the barometrical column is accompanied with a fall of
nearly four inches in the level of the sea. The effect of the wind,
though small, is apparent. With a northeast wind there was a de-
pression, and with a southwest an elevation, of the level; one proba-
bly blowing the water into and the other out of the strait.

The general character of the tide at Port Foulke is similar to that
at Van Rensselaer harbor, exhibiting two ebbs and two flows each
lunar day, with considerable diurnal variation, producing at Port
Foulke at certain times the character of a single daily tide—the two
waves as it were running into each other. The establishment, or, in
other words, the average lagging behind of the high water, after the
passage of the moon across the meridian of the place, is here half an
hour earlier than at Van Rensselaer harbor, which is distant 55 miles
in a northeast direction. This indicates a motion in accordance with
the general direction of the tidal wave, which in this region is not
due to the direct attraction of the moon, but is derived from the
great tidal wave of the Atlantic ocean,
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The investigation of the half-monthly inequality, or of the effect of
the action of the sun in modifying the effect of the moon in time as
well as in height of tide, gave the following results: The range of
the inequality in time is one hour and twenty-six minutes. The mean
establishment of high water is found to be eleven hours thirteen min-
utes and eight-tenths, and that of low water seventeen hours nineteen
and a half minutes. The range of the variation in the height of the
water, due to the action of the sun and moon, is two feet and a half. The
absolute average variation in the height of water at Port Foulke is
7.1 feet, while Dr. Kane found at Van Rensselaer harbor 7.9 feet as
the variation at that place. The extreme fluctuation observed in the
water level was 13.8 feet, The retardation or the difference between
the theoretic and observed time of high water is comparatively small.

The effect of the greater or less distance of the moon or parallax
on the half-monthly inequality shows that diminution of distance
produces a decrease in the time of the lagging of the water, and that
the range of the tide is increased by three-tenths of a foot for an
increase of one minute of parallax. The action of the sun must ev-
idently be relatively less, with an increase of the declination of the
moon, and the amount of this is found from the discussion of the
observations to be in height of the value of only a fraction of a foot,
and in time but a few minutes.

The moon, as it is well known, produces ae high tides, at nearly
the same moment, on opposite sides of the earth, and these must vary
in altitude and extent from day to day, with the change of position
of the moon in the heavens. The difference of these two tides in time
and height is called the diurnal inequality. Mr. Schott has made
of this phenomenon a special graphical study, and has found that the
diurnal variation in height is greater for high water than for low
water--that is, two successive high waters differ from each other
more than two successive low waters. The maximum variation in
height is found at Port Foulke to be 3.8 feet, and only 2.4 in low
water, while this variation entirely disappears about two days after
the moon passes the equator. This is for the high water ; but for
low water the disappearance does not take place until after a lapse
of nearly ten days, and this fact is connected with a remarkable one
relative to the magnitude of the variation. On the one hand, the less
interval of time between two tides is accompanied in high water
with a greater difference of height, while in low water a greater
interval of time is connected with a smaller difference in the level
of the two tides. ‘The diurnal inequality is due to two waves, a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. oo

diurnal and a semi-diurnal, which are exhibited by a diagram and
fully analyzed.

Next, the form of the tide was investigated, and found to occupy
a longer time in rising than in falling, or, in other words, its posterior
slope is more rapid than its anterior—the difference in time is thir-
teen minutes at Port Foulke, and fifteen at Van Rensselaer harbor.

Finally, an investigation is given of the velocity of the tide wave
in passing up along Baflin’s bay. From this it appears that the crest
of high water occupies eight hours in passing from the southern cape
of Greenland to Smith’s strait, at the head of the bay. From these
investigations the velocity of the wave in Davis’s straits is 194 statute
miles per hour, correspoding to an average depth of 418 fathoms. In
Baffin’s bay the velocity is 1TT miles, corresponding to 349 fathoms.
In Smith’s strait the velocity is 157 miles per hour, corresponding
to 277 fathoms of depth. It may be interesting to state, as one of the
results, that the free tide-wave in Davis’s strait and Baffin’s bay is
about 2,300 miles in length, and only 73 feet in height from hollow
to crest.

These statements will serve to give some idea of the complex
nature of the investigation of the phenomena of the tides, resulting
not alone from the direct action of the moon and sun, but also
modified by the superposition of the derived tide of the Atlantic, and
by the influence of the configuration of the channels through which
the waves are propagated.

Part fourth gives the observations and discussion of the meteoro-
logical investigations. It is divided into three divisions—tempera-
tures, atmospheric pressures, and winds—with an appendix giving a
record of the weather during the whole voyage, and miscellaneous
remarks.

Port Foulke, the locality of the winter quarters, was in the vicinity
of open polar water, which exercises a marked influence on the cli-
mate of the region. The comparative mildness of the station is illus-
trated by the fact that the simultaneous recorded observations at
Port Foulke and Van Rensselaer harbor show that the tempe-
rature was 26 degrees lower at the latter than at the former place,
though distant only 53 miles. The continuous records at Port Foulke
extend over a period of eleven months, and were made at every other
even hour, day and night, witha few exceptions, (as to the pressure, )
during the whole time.

The expedition was provided with about two dozen thermometers,

consisting of spirit, mercurial, and metallic, of which the index errors
38
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

were several times ascertained by immersion in buckets of ice- water,
and by comparison among themselves in the air, at very low tempera-
tures. From all the records of these observations a table of correc-
tions was made out by taking the mean of the temperatures as indi-
cated by the several thermometers. The result was found to indicate
temperatures nearly corresponding with those given by standard No.
3, which had been previously selected as the most trustworthy of the
series of instruments. All omissions inthe records were supplied by
the known methods of interpolation.

The first results obtained are those which relate to the annual fluc-
tuations of temperature. From these it appears that the warmest
day was the 15th of July, with a temperature of 41°.6 Fabr., and the
coldest the 16th of February, with a temperature of —28°.

The mean annual temperature falls on the 22d of April and the
14th of November, and is +6°.06. It must be observed that this
difference in the temperature of the two localities, as we have said
before, is due to the open water, and reached its maximum on the
20th of March, 1861, when the thermometer stood 463 degrees lower
at Rensselaer harbor than at Port Foulke.

The diurnal fluctuation—that is, the difference between the warm-
est and coldest hour of the day—exhibits also a remarkable accordance
at the two places, its amount being 3°.38 at Port Foulke and 3°.64 at
the harbor. At Port Kennedy itis 4°.12. Inthe month of December
the diurnal variation almost vanishes, there being a difference of only
two-tenths of a degree between the highest and lowest hour of the
twenty-four. It attains its maximum value in March, when it is 8°.9.
The fact.that this greatest effect of the day influence of the sun
takes place in March, Mr. Schott is disposed to attribute to the great
amount of vapor which formed at a later period and obscured the di-
rect action of the sun. On the average for the whole year the tem-
perature rises until 23 p. m. and falls till 23 a. m., and the average tem-
perature of the day is reached at 8 o’ clock morning and evening.

The dependence of the temperature on the phases of the moon was
also attempted to be deduced, but the situation of Port Foulke rela-
tive to the disturbing influence of the open water of Smith’s straits
rendered the result unsatisfactory.

The relation of the temperature to the direction of the wind was
next studied, and it was found that the northeast and east winds, or
those which flow over Greenland, are the coldest, while those from the
south, southeast, and southwest, or those which pass over ocean
surfaces, are the warmer. The northeast wind always depresses,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. $5

while the southwest always increases the temperature, especially in
the winter season. The most intense cold was experienced when the
air was perfectly calm, and this appears to be the general rule in the
arctic regions. The effect of the various winds on the whole is small,
not exceeding an elevation or depression of more than a degree and
a half from the mean.

The effect of the snow and rain on the temperature is far greater
than that of the wind. On an average in winter, during every fall of
snow, the temperature was elevated 8°.6, and in summer fell a degree
and a half during a fall of snow or rain. The number of days in which
snows fell was 94, those in which it rained were 15, during the whole
period of eleven months.

The effect of clear and cloudy weather on the temperature is next
considered, and from the result of 82 clear days in winter, it is found
on an average 3} degrees below the normal temperature of these:
days. In summer, from the observations of 41 clear days, the tem-
perature was higher eight-tenths of a degree. In winter, during 31
cloudy days, the temperature was seven degrees above the normal; and
in summer, during 48 cloudy days, the temperature was 2°.1 lower
than the normal.

From the foregoing it appears that a clear atmosphere produces.op-
posite effects in summer and in winter, and this is, without doubt, due
to the greater amount of vapor in the former than in the latter season.
During a clear day in winter the air is almost. entirely deprived of
vapor, and radiation goes on with full energy, uncompensated by
rays from the sun, except those which are very oblique; while insum-
mer the more intense rays of the sun penetrate the vapor, while the
less intense heat from the earth cannot escape through the aqueous
stratum.

The last discussion relates to the direct heating power of the sun
and the record of temperatures observed during the excursion to the
extreme northern point reached. The temperature in the month of
May, 1861, was ten degrees lower along the coast of Kennedy chan-
nel, indicating a colder climate as the explorer went north, but whether
this would be the case during the other parts of the year remains
yet to be verified.

The observations on atmospheric pressure are not as complete as
those on the temperature, the observations between 10 p.m. and 6
a. m. being frequently wanting. All the readings were reduced to
the temperature of 32° Fahrenheit.

The diurnal fluctuation as given by these observations, as well as
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

by those of Dr. Kane, is extremely small, scarcely exceeding one-hun-
dredth of an inch. The maximum pressure occurs during the day
at about 63 p. m., and the minimum about 3 in the morning. These,
however, agree generally with those indicated in other arctic locali-
ties. :
At Port Foulke there is also a secondary maximum and minimum
occurring at 8 and 10$.a.m. The annual monthly fluctuation of the
barometer is fully twenty times greater thanthe diurnal variation. In
spring there is a well-marked maximum pressure, and in the autumn
an equally well-exhibited minimum.

It is found from all the observations that the mean atmospheric
pressure of the mercurial column at the temperature of 32° is 29.83,
which accords well with the observations of Kane and McClintock,
and is considerably above the minimum pressure found in about 12
degrees lower latitude. The fluctuation was 1.8 inch—the highest,
30.74; the lowest, 28.93.

The effect of the direction of the wind on the barometer is that of
a depression of .07 of an inch during the northeast, and an elevation
of .04 during the southwest, and a similar elevation during the calms.
The oscillations of the barometer during three storms are illustrated
graphically, and an attempt is made to determine the elastic force of
vapor, but the observations recorded were insufficient; the amount was
very small, not exceeding .02 of an inch.

The direction of the wind was invariably recorded with reference
to the true meridian, and its force estimated by an arbitrary scale
between zero and ten. The general result was, that the quantity
of the stream of air which passed over the place of observation in
the course of a year was nearly 60,000 miles.

The resultant direction during the year is largely from the northeast.
The relative frequency of the wind is given, the northeast being 47
per cent. of the whole, the southwest 17, and the calms 27 per cent.
The average velocity of the wind was 19 miles per hour.

During the eleven months of the observations 25 storms were re-
corded, 19 from the northeast and 6 from the southwest.

Another paper presented for publication, also in the ‘‘ Contribu-
tions,’’ is an account of geological observations in China, Japan,
and Mongolia, by Raphael Pumpelly, of New York. This paper was
read before the National Academy of Sciences, and recommended by
that association to the Smithsonian Institution for publication. In the
summer of 1863 the author passed from Shanghai to Hunan and the
boundary between Hupeh and Sz’chuen, and in the autumn and

winter and following spring from Peking through the mountains of
western Chihli,and again from Peking, beyond the great wall of China,
and westward on the plateaus along its southern edge to its 112th me-
ridian, returning by a route south of the great wall. In the winter
of 186465 he went from Peking across the plateau of Central Asia
to Siberia. . ;

The almost total absence of observations of a geological character
throughout this wide field, renders any information in regard to it of
considerable interest. The facts:stated are principally derived from
the personal observations of the explorer, together with such inform-
ation as could be obtained from Chinese works which treat of the
geography of the empire, or bear upon its mineral productions. The
principal results arrived at are as follows:

There is reason to believe that there exists throughout China an
immense development of Devonian limestone, which rises to the-sur-
face in all the larger ridges, and attains in some places a thickness of
over 10,000 feet. The formations beneath this limestone, as far as
they were seen, are either granitic rock or metamorphic schist un-
conformably stratified as regards the limestone. Overlying the lime-
stone there exists in almost every part of the country a great coal-
bearing formation of sandstones, shales, conglomerates, &c., in
nearly, if not quite, conformable stratification as regards the floor on
which they rest. The fossil plants obtained from this formation are
considered supra-carboniferous, and it is supposed that the coal
fields of China, which vie with our own in extent, are referable to
the Triassic period. Although from the limited range of actual ob-
servation it would be too much to assert that there is a total absence
of any later formation than these coal measures, still the author failed
to observe any traces of them.

Only two systems of elevations occur in China of sufficient import-
ance to have left a marked impress on the surface. These are the
northeast-southwest and east-west.

The northeast system determines the outline of Asia east of the
110th meridian, and coincides with the middle course of the Yangtse
Kiang and the lower course of the Amur.

The east-west system exists in western Chinain the Min mountains
and in the Nanling range, and determines the general course from
west to east of the three principal rivers of the south of China.

The upheaval of the northeast system began after the deposition
of the great Devonian limestone formation, and appears to have risen
slightly during the formation of the coal measures, but its greatest
elevation was after the latter had been deposited.

a
Oo

8 REPORT OF TIIE SECRETARY.

The east-west system appears to have risen later than the other,
since it has elevated the limestone and overlying rocks which rest
upon its sides. Evidences are presented of recent oscillations ex-
tending over great areas in the form of terraces.

In the great plain of northeastern China is a delta deposit extend-
ing over nearly eight degrees of latitude, which is yearly increasing
in extent. Through this delta the Hwang Ho varies its course every
few centuries, emptying into the sea alternately to the north and to
the south of a mountainous peninsula, thus presenting the remarka-
ble phenomenon of one of the great rivers of the earth not only
shifting its course through several degrees of latitude, but also of
returning to the same bed after the lapse of a number of years.

The great table-land which lies between China and Siberia, where
the author crossed it,consists of basins of undisturbed strata of sand-
stone, containing beds of gypsum. In the south this table-land gen-
_ erally terminates in a precipitous wall, formed of an immense devel-
opment of lava, in some places more than 1,500 feet thick.

The abrupt termination of the plateau is owing to a great disloca-
tion which marks approximately the coast-line of a former ocean to
the north, in which the most recent deposits of the plain originate,
and along whose southern shore there existed an extensive region of
volcanic activity. The plateau is terminated on the east by parallel
ridges, which descend by successive terraces to the low land.

Among the more economical results obtained may be mentioned a
large number of extensive coal basins and the deposits of other use-
ful minerals, which are so widely distributed throughout the empire
as to warrant the belief that China scarcely stands second to any
other country in regard to the quantity and quality of its coal and
its other mineral resources.

Such gifts of nature, says the author, combined as they are with a
variety of favorable circumstances, cannot long be unappreciated.
They are the elements of the civilization of the present age, and in
the natural course of events the country possessing them cannot long
avoid being drawn into the stream of industrial and intellectual pro-
@ress.

Among the papers which have been offered for publication is a vo-
cabulary and grammar of the Nootka Sound language, by the Rev. C.
Knipe. This was the result of a residence of a year and a half
among the tribes inhabiting that portion of the northwest coast of
America. The same language extends southward to Cape Flattery,
and is one upon which very little correct information has been ob-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

tained. The present work contains lists of more than twelve hundred
native words; with remarks on the genius of the language, and an ac-
count of rogts, terminals, derivations, comparisons, &c. In the report
of one of our collaborators, Mr. George Gibbs, to whom this memoir
was referred, it is stated:

‘‘The Nootka language is an exceedingly interesting one, not only
as the earliest of those of Northwestern America with which we
had any acquaintance, and which enters largely as an element into
the ‘jargon’ of the coast, but also because the people who speak it in
its various dialects form one of five great northern tribes of the Pa-
cific, whose intelligence, courage, and ingenuity have rendered them
conspicuous, and whose industrial arts and physiognomy have fur-
nished an argument with many in favor of their Asiatic origin. The
existing vocabularies of that language are very imperfect and mea-
gre, and the more extended one of Mr. Knipe will be of great value
to comparative philologists.’’

We had decided to put this production to press, when the author
unexpectedly informed us that he was obliged to leave the country
for England, and could not, therefore, give his personal attention to
the work as it was passing through the press. As this was consid-
ered essential, it was thought better that he should withdraw his
manuscript, and endeavor to procure its publication through some
society in England. If he should fail in this, the Institution would
at some future time undertake its publication, since it is intimately
connected with other works of a similar character already given to
the world through the agency of the bequest.

Another paper presented to the Institution for publication is by Mr.
James G. Swan, upon the manners and customs of the Makah Indians
of Washington Territory, a tribe belonging to the Takwaht or |
Nootka Sound family, illustrated with many drawings and accom-
panied by a vocabulary of their language. The size and cost of
publication of this work has prevented us from considering its adop-
tion at present as one of our series.

Miscellaneous Collections. —Under the class of publications called
“ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,’’ previous to the war,a series
of manuals, intended to facilitate the study of different branches of
natural history, were projected and a number of them actually com-
menced; but the subsequent diminution of our income, and the ad-
vance in the cost of materials and workmanship in the line of print-
ing, has greatly interfered with the rapid completion of this enter-
prise. Of the works of this series as given in the report for 1860,

some have been completed, others are still under way, and one or
two not yet commenced, The following is a statement of their
present condition: 5

9. Bibliography of North American Conchology to the year 1860,
by W. G. Binney, parts land II. This work, which isa supplement
to those previously mentioned, has been stereotyped and copies dis-
tributed to institutions.

Another work belonging to the octavo series, but not included in
the above list, is the Review of American Birds in the Collections of
the Smithsonian Institution—part I. Northern and Middle America.
By Professor 8. F. Baird. é

This work is intended to present a descriptive account of the very
large collection of American birds in charge of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, with an enumeration of such other specimens as may serve
to illustrate the geographical distribution of the several species.
In 1858 Professor Baird prepared an account of the birds sent to the
Institution by the different expeditions for surveying the railroad
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

routes to the Pacific, which was published in the series of reports
ordered by Congress. To this was added an account of all the birds
of the Atlantic States, and it thus formed a systematic and descrip-
tive work on the ornithology of North America, which has since be-
come the principal standard manual on this subject. A reprint by
the Institution, from this volume, of the catalogue of species has
been widely distributed and much used for labelling collections and
preparing lists for distribution of specimens.

The number of specimens of birds of America in the collection of
the Institution at the time the work was published, and upon which
it was based, was less than 10,000; it now exceeds 40,000.
Many portions of North America unexplored at that time—the
whole arctic region, the recesses of the Rocky mountains, Cape St.
Lucas, &c.—have since been investigated; the migration and distri-
bution southward in winter of the species have been established by
numerous collections from the West Indies, Mexico, Central and
South America, and information generally has been collected, during
the interval of seven years, which tends to complete the knowledge
of the ornithology of North America. In this same period the spe-
cimens received from all parts of Mexico and Central America and
the West Indies are so numerous as to represent nearly all the
known species, and to embrace many new ones, forming, according
to Professor Baird, an aggregate of species much larger than that of
any other single collection.

In order, therefore, to bring up the subject to the present date,
and at the same time to exhibit a connected account of the birds of
Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies, Professor Baird un-
dertook the work referred to, and 320 pages of it have thus far been
published, each signature being dated,to show the time of actual is-
sue. The portion printed embraces an account of the oscine or sing-
ing birds, with synoptical tables and detailed descriptions of the
families, genera,and species, excepting where these have already ap-
peared in the Pacific Railroad Report. As the account of each family
is completed, the duplicate specimens are set aside for distribution
to the principal museums at home and abroad as types of the ‘‘re-
view.”’ .

The work of Professor Baird has met with much commendation
from ornithological writers in this country and Europe. The editor
of the London Ibis, a journal devoted exclusively to ornithology, re-
marks: ‘‘that it will be the book of authority on North American
ornithology for a long time to come, there can be little doubt. The
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

immense series of specimens, whether only temporarily lent or de-
posited permanently, (but the latter out of all proportion to the for-
mer,) in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, gives him an
advantage, such as probably no other ornithologist of what country
soever has at any time previously enjoyed; and the professor, as our
readers need not be told, is not the man to neglect opportunities of
this kind. We are almost inclined to regard this work as the pre-
cursor of a new era in natural history. Hitherto a zoologist has
thought he has done very well if he has closely examined some half
dozen specimens, presenting the different appearances depending
upon age, sex, or the like, of one species. He will now find, from
an inspection of Professor Baird’s labors, that an acquaintance with
a much larger number of individuals, especially from different local-
ities, is requisite if he intends to advance his science. One result of
this attention to increased material,if generally followed, we suspect
will be the very desirable one of nullifying the species makers—
species makers, of course we mean, in a bad sense, for there are no
more useful men, if they will but keep their hobbies under com-
mand.”’

From the limited funds of the Institution and its plan of organiza-
tion it cannot afford to support individuals while they are devoted
exclusively to the advance of any branch of science; and were this
to be done in one case, it might be demanded in many. But there
can be no objection to an officer of the Institution availing himself of
the materials which are gathered through its agency for prosecut-
ing as an extra labor any investigation to which he may be inclined;
provided that at the same time he faithfully discharges all the essen-
tial duties which pertain to his position. In the preparation of the
work above mentioned every facility has been given to Professor Baird
which the establishment could afford, and with this view special
attention has been paid to the collection of specimens of ornithology,
with the view that, after this work has been completed, similar atten-
tion will be given in succession to other branches of science.

Another paper in the Miscellaneous Collections is entitled
Researches upon the Hydrobiine and allied forms, chiefly from mate-
rials in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, by Dr. William
Stimpson. This memoir gives the results of an investigation relative
to the structure of agroup of small and little known fresh-water Gaster-
opods, which Dr. Stimpson had undertaken to study with a view to their
classification and arrangement in the museum of the Institution. Un-
der the name of Gasteropods are included mollusks, with a distinct
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

head, and which generally have a flat foot, adapted to crawling, and
are also usually provided with a univalve shell. The search for the
affinities and relations of these animals led to an examination of the
allied types inhabiting the sea and brackish water. The results of
the investigation were a more exact definition of the family to which
they belong, and the extension of it so as to include otber forms pre-
viously scattered; also the establishment on anatomical bases of a
number of subordinate groups or sub-families, and the suggestions as
to many new genera distinguished by peculiarities in the structure of
the soft parts as well as the shell. This memoir not only furnishes
an interesting addition to descriptive natural history, but a method
of investigation which may be advantageously applied to other fami-
lies of the class.

Dr. Stimpson, who was the naturalist to the Northwest Pacific
Exploring Expedition, under Commodore John Rodgers, is now in
charge of the Museum of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. He has
spent several years, while preparing his report on the collections of
the expedition, in the building of the Institution, and, without salary
from the Smithson fund, has rendered us essential service in the clas-
sification and naming of specimens.

The work on the Myriapoda of North America, by Dr. H. C. Wood,
jr., mentioned in previous reports, was completed and was awaiting
its turn for publication, when it was unfortunately destroyed by the
fire. It was subsequently rewritten, and as our funds did not per-
mit its being immediately put to press, it was, with the consent of
the Institution, offered to and accepted by the American Philosophi-
cal Society, and printed in the thirteenth volume of its transactions.
The wood-cuts (about sixty) which had been prepared for the work
were lent to the society to facilitate the publication. These facts are
stated in the memoir, and full credit given to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution for the aid thus rendered.

The close of the war having released Dr. John Le Conte from his
medical duties in connexion with the army, he has resumed his labors
in entomology, and has already written a considerable portion of his
‘‘List of North American Coleoptera,’’ andthe ‘‘ Description of New
Species,’’ which will be published during 1866. When these works
are completed, he will commence the second part of his classification
of coleoptera.

fteports.—During the last three years the government printing office
was so busied with the preparation of documents connected with
the war that the Annual Report of the Institution was inciden-

tally delayed, but the report for 1864 was finished and distributed
at an earlier period than had been possible for several previous
years. The demand for these reports is every year increasing, and we
learn from the members of both houses that no document printed by
Congress is more frequently called for.

It is greatly to be regretted that the extra copies of all the volumes
of the reports previous to 1863, which were stored in the rooms of
the towers, were destroyed by the fire, and that we are therefore
unable any longer to furnish complete sets or to supply missing vol-
umes to various institutions and correspondents that have applied for
them. The reports since 1861, inclusive, have been stereotyped, so
that at any future time an edition of any of these volumes may be
printed; but with the high price of paperand press-work, and with
the heavy demands on the Institution, this is at present impracti-
cable.

The report for 1864 contains in the appendix a eulogy of Delambre,
the eminent astronomer, translated by C. A. Alexander, esq., and a
continuation of the series of memoirs of distinguished members of the
French Academy of Sciences; an essay on the velocity of light, by
M. Delaunay, translated by Professor A. M. Mayer; an original com-
pilation on ozone and antozone, made for the Institution by Dr. Charles
M. Wetherill; translation of Jamin’s essay on vegetation and the at-
mosphere; extract of a memoir on the preservation of copper and
iron in salt water, by M. Becquerel, furnished by Admiral C. H.
Davis, United States navy; translations of articles on the preservation
of wood and caoutchouc and gutta-percha, from the German periodi-
cal ‘‘ Aus der Natur;’’ an article on gun-cotton by Lieutenant Von
Karolyi, with notes by Dr. B. F. Craig, of this city; a translation by
Professor Ten Brook of a description of Pettenkofer’s apparatus for
testing the results of perspiration and respiration; a translation by the
late Professor Hubbard, of the Naval Observatory, of Lamont’s report
on the solar eclipse of July 18,1860; a report of the transactions of
the Society of Physics and Natural History of Geneva, 1861 and
1862, translated by C. A. Alexander; a letter from F. Troyon on the
crania Helvetica, with illustrations; a continuation of Plateau’s
researches on the figures of equilibrium of a liquid mass withdrawn
from the action of gravity, with numerous illustrations; an original
article on the artificial shell deposits in Monmouth county, New Jer-
sey, and a continuation of Baegert’s account of the aboriginal inhabi-
tants of the California peninsula, translated by Professor Charles Rau;
an article on the ‘‘intermixture of races,’’ by George Gibbs; a lec-

ture on the first steps in the study of high antiquity in Europe, pre-
pared for the Institution by A. Morlot, of Switzerland; the prize
questions proposed by various scientific societies in Europe; a report
on the French scientific exploration of Mexico; an account of a jour-
ney to the Youcan, by W. W. Kirby, of an exploration in Upper
California, by John Feilner, of an exploration of Western Missouri,
by Dr. P. R. Hoy, with tables of weights and measures and chemi-
cal equivalents.

From this list it will be seen that the articles in the appendix con-
sist principally of translations from foreign scientific publications not
generally accessible to readers in this country, and of original articles
prepared especially for the Institution.

At an early period it had been proposed to establish a printing
office in connexion with the Institution, and the experiment was
eventually tried. The result, however, conclusively proved that the
expense of keeping up an establishment of this kind was far greater
than the cost of having the printing done elsewhere. The ‘‘Contri-
butions’? and “Miscellaneous Collections’? have principally been
printed by Mr. T. K. Collins, of Philadelphia, whose execution of the
work has been highly satisfactory, and who has had at his disposal
unusual facilities for performing the various kinds of printing required
in our diversified series of publications.

In consideration of the high price of paper and printing, and in
order that it might be always in our power to issue neav editions of any
of our works, it has been thought advisable for the last four years to
stereotype all our publications, and, for the security of the plates, to
store them in a fire-proof receptacle. In view of this latter object,
application was made to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila-
delphia for the use of a portion of the extensive fire-proof basement
of its building. This proposition was cordially acceded to by the
curators of the academy; a separate room was set apart for our ac-
commodation, and all the plates not in actual use by the printer are
now deposited in an apartment entirely secure from fire, and under
the exclusive control of the Institution. The favor thus conferred
by the academy is an illustration of the friendly relations which
exists between this Institution and other establishments for the ad-
vancement of knowledge; andI scarcely need say that special thanks,
in behalf of the Board of Regents, have been given to the society for
its liberality and kindness in this matter.

Ethnology.—As we have stated in previous reports, this has beena
subject to which the Institution has given particular attention. In-
‘AG REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

deed, it is one which especially commends itself to the science and
literature of this country, since it is intimately connected with our
history and politics. Unfortunately, however, the subject of races
is one which involves questions as to their origin and characteristics
which can scarcely be discussed at the present time with that dispas-
sionate logic and strictness of induction which is necessary to the
establishment of truth. Still, much can be done in the way of col-
lecting and recording facts which may serve as the basis of future in-
vestigation. Some of these, such as those relative to the Indians, are
rapidly passing into oblivion; and others, which regard the negro,
require to be disentangled from much prejudice and misrepresenta-
tion. “The peculiarities of these races should be critically examined
and truthfully recorded; to do this is a duty we owe to science and
humanity.

One of the most important clues we have to guide us in the laby-
rinth of ethnological research is language; and this is essentially the
case with regard to the aboriginal races of this continent. The re-
mains of their implements, and even their earthworks, may, in a
considerable degree, be referred to the common wants and instincts of
humanity, as in the use of the bow and arrow; but their language affords
indications of affiliation or diversity not otherwise attainable. It has
therefore been considered an important object to devise a system of
general characters which would express to philologists in every part
of the world identity of sounds. Unfortunately, however, though
much labor has been expended on attempts to construct such
a system, none has yet been presented which is entirely sat-
isfactory, or has been generally adopted. Indeed, either from trans-
mitted peculiarities or acquired habits, commencing with the instinct-
ive use of the mother tongue, men of different languages apparently
become incapable of accurately discriminating particular vocal sounds
with which early usage has not familiarized them, and on this account
a system of characters as a general alphabet which will give universal
satisfaction is scarcely to be hoped for. We must therefore be con-
tent, at least for the present, to represent the sounds of the remains
of the language of the red men of our continent in such characters as
shall best serve to preserve their general features, with a view to fu-
ture comparison and discussion. Such an alphabet has beenadopted
on the recommendation of Professor Whitney, of Yale College, and
Mr. George Gibbs, of this city, to whom the subject was referred.
It is accompanied by a vocabulary to be filled up with the equivalent
words of the dialect under consideration, expressed in common letters,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

the sounds of which are fixed by reference to well-known English
words in which these letters occur. In this way an attempt is made
to express the several sounds without confusing the inquirer with
new characters or numerous marks.

That the number of dialects which exist on this continent should
be great is not surprising, when we reflect on the condition of the
people previous to the advent of the Europeans. They had, without
doubt, for a long time occupied the soil, and bad probably arrived at
that condition as to numbers in which the struggle for life is carried
on with the greatest intensity, and in which sufficient food from the
chase can only be obtained by separation into small tribes, or even
families; a condition in which various dialects of one prevailing lan-
guage would necessarily be produced.

Instructions for researches relative to ethnology in general have
been prepared by Geo. Gibbs, esq., and were published in 1863, and
a large number of copies distributed to officers of the United States
government and others, particularly to those residing in the western
portion of the continent. During the past year an appendix to these
instructions, together with blank forms for systematic records, has
been prepared by the same author and published by the Institution.
The instructions and blank forms which have been sent out have
produced a valuable return in vocabularies, weapons, implements,
dresses, and other illustrations of the arts, manners and customs, and
mental advancement of the aboriginal races of this continent. The
vocabularies received have been given in charge to Mr. Gibbs, to
whom the Institution is largely indebted for months of labor gratui-
tously rendered. :

lt is proposed, as soon as the funds will permit, to publish a descrip-
tive catalogue of all the ethnological specimens in the possession of the
Institution. These include, beside those from different parts of this
country, those collected by the United States Exploring Expedition un-
der Captain (now Admiral) Wilkes, from the islands of the Pacific, the
East Indies, Africa, China and Japan, and Central and South Amer-
ica. Such a catalogue, properly illustrated with wood-cut engravings,
from photograph drawings, would be an acceptable addition to the
literature of ethnology.

At the commencement of the war preparations were made by the
Institution to obtain records of the physical characteristics of the
soldiers composing the army of the United States, embracing a large
number of measurements of different parts of the body, to ascertain
the peculiarities of the different nationalities represented. This work
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

was afterwards prosecuted on a much more extended scale than was
compatible with the means of the Institution by the Sanitary Com-
mission, and the observations have since been discussed by Dr. B, A.
Gould, of Cambridge, who has deduced from them a series of novel
and interesting results, which were lately presented to the National
Academy. It is proposed to extend similar measurements to the
Indian tribes, and it is very desirable that the negro should be em-
braced in the same investigation. We have in this country at
the present time a better opportunity to study the peculiarities of
a number of races than is perhaps to be found in any other single
portion of the earth, and the most casual observer cannot but be
struck with the marked difference which exists between the Indian,
the negro, and indeed between the descendants of the civilized in-
habitants of different parts of Europe, thousands of whom are now
flocking to our shores.

The stubborn self-reliance and impatience of control of the Indian
are strikingly contrasted with the docility and imitative qualities of the
negro. The inflexibility of the characteristics of the former, with the
gradual changes and amelioration of the character of the latter in his
association with the white man, are worthy of special attention.

It may be proper here to mention that we have received a commu-
nication from Dr. E. H. Davis, one of the authors of the first volume
of Smithsonian Contributions, pointing out an error in Lubbock’s ac-
count of Smithsonian publications on ethnology, copied from the Nat-
ural History Review, of London, in our report for 1862. In this
article (page 322) the sculptured stone pipes found in the mounds are
classed under the head of pottery. This error, says Dr. Davis, does
injustice not only to American aboriginal art, but also misleads Euro-
pean ethnologists in regard to a series of sculptures pronounced by
all who have seen them to be illustrations of the highest stage of art
attained in the stone age of America. The same mistake is now re-
produced in the publications of the Anthropological Society of Lon-
don, and in Lubbock’s Prehistoric Times. The fact is that the pipes
described in the first volume of the Smithsonian Contributions were
not of terra-cotta. None of this kind were found in the mounds, and
but few anywhere in the country.

Intimately connected with ethnology and anthropology is arche-
ology, or the study of remains of the ancient inhabitants of a coun-
try. To those who have paid any attention to the subject, it is well
known that recently very interesting discoveries have been made of
the remains of lacustrine villages in Switzerland, Italy, and Germany;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

and also that memorials of the early inhabitants of the Scandinavian
peninsula have been recognized in the extensive heaps of shells,
mostly those of the oyster, which were for a long time considered as
formations of the sea, but which have been shown by the Danish
savans to be the accumulated household refuse of populations who
lived in ages ascending beyond the records of history. The indica-
tions of the artificial origin of these accumulations consist in the
total absence of stratification which always characterizes marine de-
posits, and in the fact that the rubbish contains rude flint imple-
ments, charcoal cinders, and the bones of various animals, some of
which are, at present, extinct in the districts in which these mounds
exist.

In our own country, besides the well-known Indian mounds con-
structed for special purposes, such as for sepulture and religious
observances, and as monuments of events, there are found on various
parts of the coast shell mounds, which, like those of Denmark, are
composed of the refuse of the repasts of the aborigines, and which
will undoubtedly reward the research of the archeologist with inter-
esting facts in regard to the ancient inhabitants of the land we now
inhabit. Among the first essays in this line are those of Mr. Charles
Rau, of New York, published in the last report of this Institution.
They relate to an examination of mounds of this kind on the shores
of New Jersey. These indicate the places where the aborigines
were accustomed to feast upon the spoils of the neighboring beach,
remarkable for the abundance of oysters, clams, and other edible
mollusks. The places selected for this purpose were at some dis-
tance inland, and sufficiently elevated to be out of reach of high
tide. The direct evidence that these shell accumulations are of an
artificial character consists in the presence of numerous fragments of
pottery and stone implements.

In one of the heaps and in the adjacent fields Mr. Rau obtainéd
more than 300 specimens of Indian manufacture, consisting of stone
axes, arrows and spear points, flint knives, and many pieces of broken
crockery. The axes are of greenstone, or of sandstone, of the usual
shape, and encircled by a groove for the attachment of a handle. That
the manufacture of arrow heads was carried on in this place is evi-
dent from the great number of flint chips and unfinished arrow heads
which lie scattered among the shells. These places were probably
camping grounds at certain seasons of the year. It is said that
similar shell-beds occur on Long Island, where the shells are used
for burning lime. They also exist in Georgia, on the coast of Mas-

4s
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sachusetts, in Newfoundland, and in California; and now that atten-
tion has been specially directed to the subject, they will probably
be found and examined in various parts of this continent.

The occurrence of the Danish shell-heaps, whose history is merged
in the twilight of civilization, and those of a similar character in
America, show that the early condition of man is everywhere essen-
tially the same, while the rude implements which are obtained
from them indicate a similarity of wants and an identity of mental
characteristics by which these wants are supplied.

The Institution has given special attention to the collection of
specimens to illustrate the archeology of this country, and now pos-
sesses, with those procured by the Exploring Expedition under Cap-
tain Wilkes, those obtained from the various expeditions under the
auspices of the Institution, and from the Hudson’s Bay Company, a
more valuable series than any to be found elsewhere in the United
States. An effort will be made during the present year to properly
arrange and fully display them for study. The comparison of the
early savage implements in different countries is full of interest. We
see from this that what is called the stone age is not a period of
absolute time, but a stage of civilization, long past in one portion of
the earth, while existing at present in another.

Meteorology.—lt has been aptly said that man is a meteorologist by
nature. He is placed in such a state of dependence upon the atmo-
spheric elements, that to watch their vicissitudes and to endeavor to
anticipate their changes become objects of paramount importance.
Indeed the interest in this subject is so absolute that the common
salutation among civilized nations is a meteorological wish, and the
first introduction to conversation among strangers is a meteorological
remark. Yet there is no circumstance which is remembered
with so little exactness as the previous condition of the wea-
ther, even from week to week. In order that its fluctuations
may be preserved as facts of experience, it is necessary that they
should be continuously and accurately registered. Again, there is,
perhaps, no branch of science relative to which so many obser-
vations have been made and so many records accumulated, and
yet from which so few general principles have been deduced. This
has arisen, first, from the real complexity of the phenomena, or, in
other words, from the number of separate causes influencing the pro-
duction of the ordinary results; second, from the improper methods
which have been pursued in the investigation of the subject, and the
amount of labor required in the reduction and discussion of the ob-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

servations. Although the primary causes of the change of the
weather are, on the one hand, the alternating inclination of the sur-
face of the earth to the rays of the sun, by which its different parts
are unequally heated in summer and in winter, and, on the other, the
moisture which is elevated from the ocean in the warmer and precip-
itated upon the colder portions of the globe; yet the effects of these
are so modified by the revolution of the earth on its axis, the condi-
tion and character of the different portions of its surface, and the
topography of each country, that to strictly calculate the perturba-
tions or predict the results of the simple laws of atmospheric
equilibrium with that precision which is attainable in astronomy, will
probably ever transcend the sagacity of the wisest, even when as-
sisted by the highest mathematical analysis. But although such
precision cannot be looked for, approximations may still be obtained
of great importance in their practical bearing on the every-day
business of life.

The greater part of all the observations which have been recorded
until within a few years past has been without system or co-ordina-
tion. It is true that the peculiar climate of a given place may be
determined by a long series of isolated observations, but such obser-
vations, however long continued, or industriously and accurately made,
can give no adequate idea of the climate of a wide region, of the
progress of atmospheric changes, nor can they furnish an approxi-
mation to the general laws of the recurrence of phenomena. Tor
this purpose a system of observation must be established over widely
extended regions within which simultaneous records are made and
periodically transmitted to a central position, where, by proper
reduction and discussion, such general conclusions may be reached as.
the materials are capable of yielding.

In discussing the records,the empirical method does not suffice. It
is necessary that @ prior? assumptions should be provisionally adopted,
not, however, at random, but chosen in strict accordance with well-
established physical principles, and that these be finally adopted, re-
jected, or modified, as they are found to agree or disagree with the
records. Itisonly by this method that the different causes which co-
operate in the production of a series of complex phenomena can be dis-
covered, as is illustrated in the history of astronomy, which, previous to
the investigations of Kepler, consisted of an unintelligible mass of
records of observations. But even with the application of the best
possible process of discussion, the labor necessary to: be expended
on such large masses of figures, in order to deduce simple results, is
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

far beyond any individual effort, and can only be properly accom-
plished by governmental aid. |

The importance of a combined system of meteorological observa-
tions extending over a large area, and the peculiar advantages pre-
sented by our country for this object, were early appreciated, and
such a system was commenced in 1819, under the direction of Dr.
Lovell, Surgeon General of the army. The stations embraced the
principal military posts, from which reports were made at the end
of each month as to the temperature, the pressure, and the moisture
of the air, the amount of rain, the direction and force of the wind,
the appearance of the sky, besides casual phenomena, such as the
aurora, thunder-storms, shooting stars, &c. In 1825 a similar system,
of more numerous stations in proportion to the area embraced, was
established in the State of New York, the points of observations
being the several academies, under the direction of the board of
regents of the university, an establishment having charge of the
higher institutions of learning in that State.

In 1837 the legislature of Pennsylvania made an appropriation of
four thousand dollars for instruments, which were distributed to vol-
untary observers. This system was continued about ten years; that
of New York has been kept up with more or less efficiency until the
present time; while the army system was continued until the com-
mencement of the war.

The lake system, established by the engineer department, under
the superintendence of Captain (now General) Meade, consists of a
line of stations, extending from the western part of Lake Superior to
the eastern part of Lake Ontario, and has been efficiently continued
for several years.

The Smithsonian meteorological system was commenced in 1849,
and, with occasional aid in defraying the expenses, has continued in
operation until the present period. It was, however, much diminished
in efficiency during the war, since from the southern States no records
were received, and many of the observers at the north were called to
abandon such pursuits for military service in the field. The efforts
of the institution in this line have been directed to supplementing and
‘harmonizing all the other systems, preparing and distributing blank
forms and instructions, calculating and publishing extensive tables for
the reduction of observations, introducing standard instruments, and col-
lecting all public documents, printed matter, and manuscript records
bearing on the meteorology of the American continent, submitting
these materials to scientific discussion, and publishing the results. In
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

these labors the Institution has been in continued harmonious co-ope-
ration with all the other efforts made in this country to advance
meteorology, except those formerly conducted by the Navy Depart-
ment under Lieutenant Maury. These were confined exclusively to
the sea, and had no reference to those made at the same time on land.
Without desiring to disparage the labors of Lieutenant Maury, I may
say that his results would have lost nothing of their value by the
adoption of a less exclusive policy on his part. The meteorology of
the sea and that of the land pertain to a connected series of pheno-
mena which can only be properly studied by a combined system of ob-
servations relating to both. The method pursued by Lieutenant Maury
consisted in dividing the surface of a map of the ocean into squares of
ten degrees on a side, and in recording within each of these the di-
rections of the winds obtained from the log-books of the vessels which
had traversed the several regions. In this way he accumulated a large
amount of data, which, though published in connexion with many
crude hypotheses, are of great value in the study of the meteorol-
ogy of the globe.

In 1853 a meteorological system was commenced in Canada, the
senior grammar school in each county being provided with instru-
ments, and the observations have been continued to the present
time. In regard to this system, Mr. Hodgins, of the educational de-
partment, remarks: ‘‘ We have never lost sight of the great practi-
cal importance to a new and partially settled country, of establish-
ing early in its history, before its physical condition is materially
changed, a complete and comprehensive system of meteorological
observations, by which may be tested theories of science which are
yet unsettled,and which may be solved, relating to natural phenomena
which have long remained among the sealed mysteries of nature.’’

The observations thus far have been taken without remuneration,
but the importance of the system has become so well recognized
that the Canadian government has decided to establish ten perma-
nent stations, in addition to the observatories at Toronto and Kings-
ton, distributed so as to afford the most complete information relative
to the climatic features of the whole province. The points selected
are Windsor, Goderich, Stratford, Simcoe, Barrie, Hamilton, Peter-
borough, Belleville, Pembroke, and Cornwall; that is, two stations
on Lake Erie, one on Lake Huron, three on Lake Ontario, one on
Lake Simcoe, one on the Ottawa river, one on the bay of Quinté,
one on the St. Lawrence, near the eastern,extremity of the province,
and two in the interior of the country. The records made at the
public schools of Canada have been furnished to the Smithsonian In-
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

stitution, as well as to the committee on immigration of the House
of Assembly, for the purpose of furnishing facts relative to the
climate, of importance to settlers, and recently the department of
royal engineers has applied for the returns, with a view to the con-
sideration of their bearing on questions of defence.

To secure a greater degree of responsibility, and to promote the
efficiency of the system, the government has provided for the pay-
ment of fifty cents a day to the teachers of the grammar schools at
the stations before enumerated, as remuneration for the service ren-
dered.

Under the direction of the distinguished academician Kupfer, there
is established over the vast Russian territory a network of thirty
meteorological stations, where are noted the various changes of the
atmosphere as to temperature, pressure, moisture, &c. The most
northern of these stations is at Hammerfest, in 70° 41’ north latitude,
21° 26’ east longitude from Paris, and the most southern is at Tiflis,
in 41° 42’ north latitude, and 42° 30’ east longitude. <A similar
system of simultaneous observations has been for several years in-op-
eration in Great Britain and Ireland, in connexion with the Board of
Trade, and under the direction of the late Admiral Fitzroy. Other
and like systems have been established in France, Italy, and Holland.
From these different organizations, as well as from insulated observa-
tories, telegrams of the weather are sent every morning, at seven
o’ clock, from the principal cities of Europe to Paris, where, under the
superintendence of the celebrated Leverrier, they are discussed, and
the results transmitted by mail to all parts of the world in the suc-
cessive numbers of the daily International Bulletin. A similar publi-
cation is periodically made in Italy, under the direction of M. Mat-
teucci, so well and favorably known by his discoveries in physics.
The British government has also establisked a system of observations
for the sea, and furnished its navy with accurate instruments, care-
fully compared with the standards of the Kew observatory. It is es-
timated in a report to Parliament that, through an annual appropria-
tion of about fifty thousand dollars, statistics may be collected in
fifteen years sufficient, with what has already been obtained, to deter-
mine the average movement of the winds on every part of the ocean.

From the great interest which has been awakened in regard to me-
teorology throughout the world, and the improved methods which
have been adopted in its study, it can scarcely be doubted that in a
few years the laws of the general movements of the atmosphere will
be ascertained, and the causes of many phenomena of the weather,
which have heretofore been regarded as little else than the capricious
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

and abnormal impulses of nature, will become adequately known; al-
though, from the number of these causes, and the complexity of the
resultant effect, it may never be possible to deduce accurate pre-
dictions as to the time and particular mode of their occurrence.

Indeed, the results which have been already derived from the series
of combined observations in this country, fully justify the wisdom and
forethought of those who were instrumental in establishing them.
Although their organization was imperfect, the observers, in most
cases, untrained, and the instruments of an inferior character, yet
they have furnished data which, through the labors of Redfield, Espy,
and Hare, whose memories are preserved in the history of science,,
have led to the establishment of principles of high theoretical inter-
est, as well as of great practical value. Among these I need here
mention only-the fact now fully proved that all the meteorological
phenomena of at least the middle and more northern portions of
_ the temperate zone are transmitted from west to east. The passage
of storms from one part of the country to the other was noticed by Dr.
Franklin on the occasion of observing an eclipse of the moon. He
showed that our northeast storms are felt successively later and later
as the point of observation is further to the northeast; that they
arrive last at the extreme northeastern portions of our continent,
We now know, however, that the successive appearance of the
storm at points further along the coast is due to the easterly move-
ments, sideways as it were, of an atmospheric disturbance, greatly
elongated north and south, and reaching sometimes from Canada to
the Gulf of Mexico. Hence to persons residing along the seaboard
the phenomenon would appear to have a northwardly progression, on
account of the northeasterly trend of the coast; yet the storm not un-
frequently reaches Bermuda simultaneously with Nova Scotia.

Few persons can have failed to observe the continued motion of the
higher clouds from the west, or to have recognized,the just meteor-
oscopy of Shakspeare in a well-known passage:

‘‘The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And by the bright track of his fiery car
Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.’’

The breaking forth of the sun just before his setting shows that
the rear of the cloud which has obscured his beams has, in its east-
erly course, reached our horizon, and will soon give place to an un-
obscured sky.

It must be observed, however, that all the storms which visit our
coast are not of this nature; those denominated cyclones, and which sel-
dom extend far into the interior, are probably of a rotatory character.
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

These usually commence in the Caribbean sea, move first toward the
northwest, and gradually curving round before they reach our lati-
tude, take an easterly direction, as has been shown by Redfield and
others.

The first practical application which was attempted of the prin-
ciple we have mentioned was made by this Institution in 1856;
the information conveyed by telegraphic despatches in regard to
the weather was daily exhibited by means of differently colored
tokens, on a map of the United States, so as to show at one view the
meteorological condition of the atmosphere over the whole country.
-At the same time publication of telegraphic despatches was made
in the newspapers. The system, however, was necessarily discon-
tinued at the beginning of the war, and has not yet been resumed.
Similar applications have since been made.in other countries, par-
ticularly in England, under the late Admiral Fitzroy; in France, un-
der Leverrier; and still later, in Italy. In the last-mentioned country .
tabular statements are to be published annually, comparing the pre-
dictions with the weather actually experienced.

The British government has also recently introduced the system of
telegraphic meteorological predictions into India. The cyclone of
October, 1864, which did such damage to the shipping in Calcutta
and destroyed the lives of sixty thousand persons, called special at-
tention to the subject. The Asiatic Society of Bengal estimated the
cost of such a system at 67,090 rupees, (about $30,000,) a sum which
the government hesitated to appropriate, though it decided to fur-
nish the necessary instruments and an allowance of fifty rupees a
month to the assistant at the telegraph station at Saugor, on the sea-
board to the southward of Calcutta, in the direction from which the
most severe storms approach that port.

It must be evident, from what we have said in regard to the move-
ment of storms, that a system of telegraphic meteorological predic-
tions would be at once more reliable and of more benefit to the
eastern coast of the United States, than those made in England and
France, on the western coast of Europe, could possibly be to those
countries, since the disturbances of the atmosphere which reach them
advance from the ocean, while the majority of those of a similar nature
which visit especially the middle and eastern portions of our coast,
come overland from a westerly or southwesterly direction, and their
approach may be telegraphed in some cases many hours before their
actual arrival.

But the expense of the proper establishment of a system of this kind
=
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Aq

can only be defrayed by the general government, or some organiza-
tion in possession ef more ample means than can be applied by the
Smithsonian Institution to such a purpose. This will be evident from
the fact which we have mentioned of the cost of the establishment
of a similar system in India, and from a report of a committee of the
two houses of Parliament appointed to consider certain questions
relating to the meteorological department of the Board of Trade.
From this it appears that the amount expended during the eleven
years ending with 1865 was 45,000 pounds sterling, or an average
of about $20,000 a year. The same committee recommend that
meteorological observations at sea be continued under the direc-
tion of the hydrographic office of the admiralty, and an appropria-
tion of £1,500 annually be made for instruments, and for discussion
and publication of results, £1,700; making a total of £3,200.
For weather statistics on land, the annual sum of £4,250, includ-
ing instruments, discussion, and publications, is recommended, and
for telegram storm warnings, £3,000; making a total annual ex-
penditure of £7,450 for the land, and a grand annual total for land
and sea of £10,450, or $52,250.

The present would appear to be a favorable time to urge upon
Congress the importance of making provision for reorganizing all the
meteorological observations of the United States under one combined
plan, in which the records should be sent to a central depot for dis-
cussion and final publication. An appropriation of $50,000 annually
for this purpose would tend not only to advance the material interest
of the country, but also to increase its reputation. It would show
that although the administration of our government is the expression
of the popular volition, it is not limited in its operation merely to
objects of instant or immediate utility, but that, with a wise prevision
of the future, it withholds its assistance from no enterprise, however
remote the results, which has for its end to advance the well-being of
humanity.

It is scarcely necessary at this day to dwell on the advantages which
result from such svstems of combined observations as those which the
principal governments of Europe have established and are now con-
stantly extending. I may, however, in passing, briefly allude to some
facts which may not at once occur to the mind of the general reader.
They enable the mariner to shorten the time and diminish the danger
of the passage from one port to another by indicating to him the
route along which prevail, at a particular season of the year, the
most favorable winds for his purpose. They also furnish the means
7
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

by which the sailor is taught the important lesson, which has saved
thousands of lives and millions of property, namely, that of finding
the direction of the centre of the cyclone, and of determining the
course in which he must steer in order to extricate himself from the
destructive violence of this fearful scourge of the ocean. To the
agriculturist they indicate the character of the climate of the country,
and enable him, with certainty, to select the articles of culture best
adapted to the temperature and moisture of the region, and which,
in the course of a number of years, will insure him the most profita-
ble returns for his labor. They furnish the statistics of the occur-
rence of sterile years and of devastating storms, which may serve as
the bases on which to found insurance institutions for protection
against the failure of crops, and thus give to the husbandman the
same certainty in his pursuits as that possessed by the merchant or
the-ship-owner. They may also afford warning of the approach of
severe frosts and violent storms in time to guard, at least in some
degree, against their injurious effects. To the physician, a knowledge
of such results as can be obtained from an extended system of obser-
vations is of great importance, not only in regard to the immediate
practice of his art, but also to the improvement of his science. The
peculiar diseases of a region are principally dependent on its climate;
an extreme variation of temperature in a large city is invariably at-
tended with an increase of the number of deaths. The degree and
variation of the moisture at different times and in different places
have also a great influence on diseases, and the more the means of
studying the connexion of these elements and the corresponding con-
dition of the human body are multiplied, the more will the art and
the science of medicine be improved. I may mention that scarcely
a week passes at the Institution in which application is not made for
meteorological information relative to different parts of this country,
with the hope to improve the condition, if not restore the health, of
some patient. The knowledge, however, which at present exists as
to the connexion of climate and disease, particularly in relation to
our own country, is, in comparison to what might be obtained, of
little significance.

No other part of the world can at all compare with this country in
the conditions most favorable to the advancement of meteorology, by
means of a well-organized and properly sustained system of combined
observations ; such a system extending from east to west more than
two thousand miles would embrace in its investigation all the phe-
nomena of the great upper current of the return trade-wind, which,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

continually flowing over us at a high elevation, carries most of the
disturbances of the atmosphere eastward. It would also include the
effects produced by the polar and equatorial currents as they contend
for the mastery along the broad valley which stretches without inter-
ruption from the arctic circle to the Gulf of Mexico, and would settle
with precision the influence of the great fresh-water lakes in amelio-
rating the climate of the adjacent regions. But above all, in a popu-
lar view, it would furnish the means more effectually than any other
system of predicting the approach of storms and of giving the ships
of our Atlantic coast due warning of the probability of danger.

Collections. —In the preceding reports an important distinction has
been made between the collections of the Institution intended for
the immediate advance and diffusion of a knowledge of natural his-
tory, and the museum intended for popular exhibition; while the for-
mer is in strict conformity with the catholic spirit of the bequest,
and can be prosecuted in due relation to the various other branches
of knowledge, having each an equal claim on the bounty of the fund,
the latter is principally local in its character, and demands a per-
petual outlay of a portion of the annual income, which tends contin-
ually to increase with the additions to the number of objects exhib-
ited, and finally to absorb all the resources of the establishment.
Although the museum has been principally restricted to the mainte-
nance and exhibition of the articles of the exploring expeditions of the
government, and to such type specimens as might serve to illustrate
the publications of the Institution, yet its cost has exceeded that of
all the active operations which have rendered the name of Smith-
son favorably known in every part of the civilized world. This
statement will not be thought incorrect when it is considered that to
its account may justly be charged the absorption of the annual inter-
est of the money expended on the building, a sum which will now
be greatly enhanced by the cost of the restoration.

I have thought it important to refer to this point in almost every
annual report, in order that what I deem a fundamental policy of
the Institution should be kept constantly in view, namely, the preser-
vation of the income of the Smithsonian fund as untrammelled as possi-
ble, and free tg be applied to assist in the solution of any scientific
problem which may present itself, or in any other way to extend the
present bounds of human knowledge. A well replenished purse, un-
incumbered with debt and free to be applied to any purpose, is a
source of power as important to an establishment for the advance or
diffusion of knowledge as it is to an individual.
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

By these remarks I do not intend to disparage the value of public
museums; so far from this, I can freely say that I consider them of
great importance as a means of intellectual improvement, of rational
enjoyment, and as receptacles of interesting materials for the use of
the student in any branch of learning. By the foregoing remarks I
merely wish to urge the fact that an establishment of this kind,
worthy of the seat of government of the United States, can only be
supported by appropriations from Congress, and to express the
opinion that so large an expenditure in the imperfect attempt to
found a museum by means of the Smithson bequest will in time be
abandoned, and the whole of the income devoted to the more cosmo-
politan objects of the Institution.

In the last report a general account is given of what has been
done by the Institution towards forming such collections, and
during the past year this portion of the general operations has been
carried on with unabated success. Although it might appear that
the older settled portions of the country had been thoroughly laid
under contribution, yet new questions are continually arising, and
attention is devoted to less obvious features, as the subject of natural
history is more minutely pursued. But still there are vast portions
even of the United States which remain in a considerable degree un-
explored. In the eastern portion the explorations in 1865, under
the auspices of the Institution, have been chiefly confined to the col-
lection of materials for the illustration of the work on North Amer-
ican Oology, in preparation by Dr. Brewer. In the west, the labors
interrupted by the death of the lamented Captain Feilner have been
resumed, under the direction of General Sully, in the neighborhood
of Devil’s lake, Dakota. From Idaho, collections made by Dr. Hitz have
been received, and from Arizona the valuable series collected by As-
sistant Surgeon Coues. The latter consist of mammals, birds, rep-
tiles, insects, and plants. Doctor Coues has also made minute notes
on the habits and peculiarities of the animals of the region explored,
and is now engaged upon a report of the results of his labors.

It has been frequently stated in previous reports that the Institu-
tion has entered into friendly relations with the officers of the Hud-
son’s Bay Company, and, from the active co-operation which has taken
place, large collections of interesting specimens relative to the nat-
ural history of the country, valuable meteorological observations, and
ethnological records have been derived.

In March last the Institution received upwards of thirty large cases
from this source, containing immense numbers of specimens illustra-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

ting the flora, fauna, and the anthropology of these northern regions.
For the larger portion of these collections we are specially indebted
to Mr. R. R. Macfarlane of Fort Anderson.

The services of Governor Mactavish, in forwarding his own and
other valuable notes which accompany the collections, were also of
ereat importance, and, as in previous cases, the boxes were delivered
by the Hudson’s Bay Company at Fort Garry, after thousands of
miles of transportation, free of charges. °

The opportunity afforded of adding to the collections of the Insti-
tution by the expedition to connect the United States and Russia by
a line of telegraphic communication, was too important to be neg-
lected. The directors of the company engaged in this enterprise
early called upon the Smithsonian Institution for information in re-
gard to the contemplated route, and besides receiving maps and
other data relative to the geography and climate of the country,
Mr. Kennicott, who had spent several years under the auspices of
the Institution in Arctic America, was warmly recommended to them
as a person well qualified to assist in the undertaking. The company
also received valuable suggestions as to the best line from Professor
Baird, and, in return for these services, facilities have been afforded,
under Colonel Bulkley, in charge of the expedition, for making col-
lections in natural history, &c., on a liberal scale. A prominent po-
sition was given to Mr. Kennicott in the survey, and a number of
assistants were selected from young men who had also been in
training in this Institution; the notes and collections which may be
made by them will be transmitted to Washington for discussion and
the publication of such results as may be important in the advance of
science.

The telegraph company not only afforded facilities for making the
collections, but also contributed, as did the Chicago Academy of
Sciences, to lessen the expense to the Smithsonian fund in the pur-
chase of the necessary articles comprising the outfit of the natural.
ists of the expedition. The first set of duplicate specimens will
properly belong to the Chicago Academy, and the remainder will be
distributed in the manner best adapted to facilitate the researches of
those who are engaged in the study of the special branches of science
to which the specimens may pertain.

In the southern part of the continent, explorations have continued
to be made. Colonel A. J. Grayson, who has previously been a
contributor, has examined the islands off the coast of Mexico, and
has discovered a number of new species of birds; also Mr. Charles
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Laszlo and Dr. Sartorius, to whom we have been indebted for me-
teorological observations, have continued their contributions to the
natural history of Mexico.

A scientific survey of the Isthmus of Yucatan has been undertaken
by Governor Salazar y Ilarregui, and, on the recommendation of the
Institution, Dr. Arthur Schott was engaged to superintend the nat-
ural history branch of operations; and the collections, of which many
packagés have already reached us, are all to be sent to this Institution
for examination previous to the publication of an account of the re-
sults obtained.

Dr. H. Berendt has commenced, under the auspices of the Insti-
tution, an exploration of British Honduras and the interior of Gua-
temala. The outfit of physical instruments and apparatus, and
supplies, for collections of natural history, were principally furnished
from the Smithsonian fund, while the personal expenses were borne
by a subscription of a number of gentlemen interested in the advance
' of science, and by the Academies of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
and Chicago.

The explorations in Costa Rica by Dr. Von Frantzius and Mr.
Carmiol have continued to add large numbers of specimens to our
collections, no region of America, according to Professor Baird, hav-
ing yielded of late years so many new species of birds.

Valuable collections have been made by Mr. Holland, Captain Dow,
Mr. Hicks, and Mr. Chapman, in Central America.

From South America collections have been received from Mr.
Walter 8. Church and Professor W. E. Nation, in Peru; Dr. Her-
ing, from Paramaribo; Mr. De Lacerda, Mr. Goodwin, and the Natural
History Museum of Rio, in Brazil. For the latter donation, made by
order of the Emperor of Brazil, we are specially indebted to the
kindness of Mr. Lisboa, former Brazilian minister to the United
States.

Large collections have also been received from the West Indies,
principally made by Mr. Charles Wright, Mr. N. H. Bishop, Dr.
Gundlach, Mr. March, Professor G. N. Allen, Mr. Robert Swift, and
Mr. George Latimer, the deficiencies in our series from this region
having been largely supplied during the year.

In accordance with the policy of the Institution, collections are not
generally requested from the Old World, except in certain cases where
they are desired for comparison by those who are engaged in special
investigations. We have, however, during the last year, received a
series of the eggs and skins of the birds of Palestine, presented by
Mr. Tristram.
*REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

Disiribution and use of Specimens.—The policy of rendering the
specimens as conducive as possible to the immediate promotion of sci-
ence has been constantly observed, and for this purpose not only
have new specimens been furnished to those engaged in original in-
vestigations, but the duplicates of such as have been examined have
been made up into sets for distribution.

From the materials principally furnished by the Institution, Dr.
Gill has prepared a synopsis of North American seals, about to be
published by the Essex Institute of Massachusetts, and has continued
the description of new species of fishes. He has also examined the
skulls of Mammals in the collection, and among them has made the re-
markable discovery of a peculiar generic type of tapirs, still living
on the Isthmus of Panama, but which has escaped the notice of pre-
vious investigators.

Ample materials have also been furnished Professor Baird for the
preparation of an additional part of his review of American birds,
and the means have been furnished Dr. Bryant, Mr. Cassin, and Mr.
Lawrence, for prosecuting their investigations in relation to orni-
thology. A large number of reptiles have been sent to Professor
Cope, of Haverford College, Pennsylvania, including a series from
Arizona and Central America; the new species will be described in
the proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences,
and amore elaborate monograph of the whole is to be presented
for publication to the Institution. Dr. Brewer has been supplied with
eggs and nests of birds, for the continuation of his work on North
American Oology, the first part of which was published in the eley-
enth volume of Smithsonian Contributions.

In all cases where assistance is thus extended to individuals in the
prosecution of their particular studies, there is an implied understand-
ing that full credit shall be given to the Institution for the facilities
afforded. This condition has generally been properly observed, al-
though in some few cases the acknowledgment has not been quite so
explicit as the benefits received would appear to demand.

So extended has become the field of modern science that divi-
sion of labor is here as essential as in the mechanic arts, and a mas-
tery of principles and details can only be the reward of attention con-
centrated on a few branches; as, therefore, the organization of this
Institution does not contemplate the support of a corps of professors
engaged in a comprehensive cultivation of science in all its branches,
but would rather invite the aid and procure the collaboration of
those who may be disposed to render gratuitous service for the fur-
therance and advance of knowledge for its own sake, many of the
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY..

specimens which are sent to us for identification, particularly those
of a rare character, are forwarded for examination to persons ata
distance, During the past year the insects received, as usual,
have been placed in charge of the Entomological Society, of Phila-
delphia; the plants have been sent partly to Dr. Torrey, and partly
to Dr. Gray, for study and arrangement. The minerals have been trans-
mitted to the School of Mines of Columbia College,New York. In all
cases the specimens are to be assorted and labelled, the most perfect
suite to be returned to the Institution, and the remainder properly
divided into sets for distribution.

References have also been made during the past year of questions
in the line of natural history to Professor G. J. Brush, Isaac Lea,esq.,
Dr. Jos. Leidy, A. Agassiz, J. P. Lesley, Dr. Haldeman, Dr. Allen,
Thos. Bland, W. G. Binney, G. W. Tryon, jr.. Dr. W.Stimpson, Dr.
J. Le Conte, S. H. Scudder, P. BR. Uhler, W. H. Edwards, Edw.
Norton, E. T. Cresson, and Dr. H. C. Wood, jr.

It is gratifying to be able to state that in no case has a favor of
this kind been refused by any one qualified to render the desired ser-
vice ; indeed the time and labor bestowed on the affairs of the Insti-
tution by its collaborators might well be a matter of surprise to
those who are themselves scarcely influenced by other motives than
the pursuit of gain. In this respect the liberalizing tendency of sci-
entific studies is strikingly manifest.

In the winter of 1859-60 Mr. P. P. Carpenter, a well known con-
chologist, who had been requested by the British Association for the
Advance of Science to prepare a report on the shells of the northwest
coast of America, visited Washington, and was requested to arrange
and label the extensive collection of shells of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, preparatory to the distribution of the duplicates. These con-
sisted of the specimens collected by the United States Exploring
Expedition, under Captain Wilkes, and other expeditions instituted
by government, together with those collected by individuals under
the direction of the Institution:

The work, however, proved far too extensive to be completed by
Mr. Carpenter before his return home,and it was therefore concluded
to send the collection to him in England, where he would have an
opportunity of performing the work under the more favorable con-
dition of comparison with the great collectigns of that country. The
boxes were transported across the Atlantic gratuitously, through the
kindness of Sir E. Cunard, passed through the English custom-house
without search, and arrived safely at the Warrington Museum, of
‘ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

which Mr. Carpenter was at the time one of the scientific cura-
tors.

“Tn one respect,” says Mr. Carpenter, “it was fortunate for the future
interests of American malacology that the work was undertaken at
the time. It was part of the plan to duplicate, for American stu-
dents, names in the celebrated Cumingian collection, the largest in
the world, and containing the principal part of the types described
and figured in the modern monographs. Mr. Cuming himself liber-
ally and kindly undertook to compare the shells of the Institution
with his own. This great and wearisome labor he performed gra-
tuitously, in order that he might give a fair starting point to Ameri-
can students. The only expense was that of transportation and
clerk-hire. Shortly after the completion of the work, Mr. Cuming
died, to the irreparable loss of the students of malacology, to whom
he was always ready to render assistance whenever the interests of
science would be thereby advanced.’’ ‘‘ When the duplicates of the
Smithsonian collection shall have been distributed to the schools, col-
leges, and museums of the American continent, and students not yet
born shall be thereby enabled to make an accurate beginning in this
interesting and useful branch of study, it is hoped that the name of
Hugh Cuming will be remembered with grateful respect, as the man
to whose incessant labors during a long life is due the gathering
together of the largest series of known forms of shells, and to whom
they owe the naming of the principal part of their collection.”’

Mr. Carpenter does not claim for the naming of these specimens
entire freedom from error; the names given represent simply, neither
more nor less, those in Mr. Cuming’s cabinet, as identified by him-
self during the years 1861 to 1865, that is, the names of the more re-
cent monographer, whether right or wrong. It is believed, however,
that there is no other collection of shells on the continent of Amer-
ica of an equal number of species which can lay claim to even this
moderate standard of accuracy.

The several objects to which Mr. Carpenter’s attention was directed
were as follows:

First. To make the permanent collection of the Institution as com-
plete as possible by advantageous exchanges in England and else-
where. ;

Second. To arrange the first-class duplicates of those which had a
special scientific value for distribution to the establishments where
they would be most generally useful.

58
66 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ;

Third. To make up the remaining specimens into series for dis-
tribution to colleges and other educational establishments.

Of the first-class series, the following distribution has been made,
viz: Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge; Academy of Sci-
ences, Philadelphia; State Cabinet of Natural History, Albany; Geo-
wgical Survey of Canada, Montreal; Academy of Natural Sciences,
San Francisco. The specimens of these sets, as we have said before,
are of great scientific value for original comparison in the way of
determination of species, since they have been labelled after careful
comparison by Mr. Carpenter and other authorities in conchology.

A very inadequate conception was at first entertained of the amount
of labor which would be required to complete the assorting and la-
belling this part of the Smithsonian collection of natural history. It
was thought that it might be completed in the course of a few
months. Mr. Carpenter has, however, devoted to it about four years
of continued labor. It must be observed at the same time that per-
haps « considerable portion of this period was devoted to a comple-
tion of the series intended to be preserved in the Smithsonian mu-
seum.

The specimens examined by Mr. Carpenter have all been returned
to the Institution, made up into sets, in accordance with the arrange-
ment previously described. The number of these sets and of other
collections of shells for distribution to colleges, academies, &c., is
about 1,000, the whole including about 60,000 species and 250,000
specimens. Of these about one-fourth have been distributed.

According to the statement, of Professor Baird, the whole number
of specimens, including shells which have been distributed, amounts
to upwards of 124,000, of which 19,000 have been presented to va-
rious establishments during the past year.

Museum.——As the public museum of the Institution occupied the
portion of the building constructed of fire-proof materials, it escaped
destruction by the fire; yet the smoke and water to which they were
exposed caused some damage to the specimens, and much labor and
expense were requisite to restore them to their proper appearance.

The museum has continued to be an object of interest to the citi-
zens and visitors of Washington, and should the library of the Insti-
tution be transferred to the Capitol, space will be found in the cases
of the west wing for increasing the number of articles placed upon
exhibition. Among the collections we have a large number of speci-
mens to illustrate ethnology. In addition to those collected by the
Exploring Expedition under Captain Wilkes, are all those which
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

have been obtained in the various explorations across the continent;
from the Hudson’s Bay Company; from the region of Nootka sound,
Mexico, Central and South America. We regret that on account of
the additional labor required in the renovation of the museum, and
for want of space, these interesting collections have not yet been fully
arranged and labelled for exhibition.

We may add, in this connexion, that if Congress shall adopt the
proposition now under consideration to take charge of the library,
we shall entertain the hope that it will in due time make provision
for the establishment and care of a museum worthy the government
of the United States, and thus relieve the Smithsonian fund of a bur-
den to which, in strict accordance with what I have always conceived
to be the proper interpretation of the will of the founder, it ought
not to be subjected. |

In the report for 1863 mention is made of the presentation of a
large and remarkable meteorite to this Institution, to which the name
had been assigned in California of the ‘‘ Ainsa’’
knowledgments were duly made to Dr, J. D. Irwin, surgeon United
States army, for his services in behalf of the Institution in procuring
this interesting specimen; but from additional facts which have come
to our knowledge we are induced to add the name of this gentleman
to the specimen, and to label it the ‘‘ Irwin-Ainsa meteorite.”’

For an account of the work done in the museum, a complete list of
donors to the museum and collections since the commencement of the
Institution, I would refer to the annexed statement of Professor Baird.

Laboratory and experiments.—The conflagration which destroyed
the cabinet of apparatus of physics did not extend to the chemical
laboratory, and consequently the operations connected with the latter
have not been interrupted. The series of experiments which were
mentioned in the last report in relation to the examination of the air
of the Capitol has been continued by Dr. C. M. Wetherill, anda
very elaborate report prepared on the subject to be submitted to the
Secretary of the Interior. This report not only gives the result of the
observations made in the halls of Congress, and the experiments at
this Institution, but also a synopsis of all the authentic facts from the
bibliography of the subject, which it is believed will be considered
of value to those who are practically engaged in those departments
of mechanical construction which require attention to temperature
and ventilation. From the investigations it appears that there is an
abundant supply of fresh air forced into the chambers of the Capitol,
but that in winter this is greatly deficient in the quantity of moisture
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

necessary to form a comfortable and salubrious atmosphere. It must
be evident that if in an isolated space in winter we desire to have
air of the same salubrity and temperature as in an open space in
pleasant weather in summer, we must artificially impart to this air
not only the same degree of heat, but also an equal amount of mois-
ture.

In an atmosphere entirely devoid of moisture the human body ex-
hales with great energy from every pore of the skin, and especially
from the lungs, and all the more delicate parts of the mucous membrane.
Such an exhalation of moisture in the ordinary condition of the body
would be far too great to allow of a healthy equilibrium between the
natural excretion and assimilation, and it is witb prevision, derived
from long experience, that the savage anoints his body when exposed
to an atmosphere rendered arid by refrigeration, to prevent excessive
exhalation. The tendency of vapor to exhale from the body diminishes
with the force of vapor already in the surrounding atmosphere, and a
perfect equilibrium can only take place with air entirely saturated, at
a temperature of 98°. Butatthe temperature of zero almost all the
moisture of the atmosphere is condensed, and hence the tendency of the
body in the open air in winter to give off its vapor would be excessive,
were it not for the condensation of the vapor immediately around the
body and retained in the interstices of the clothing. If, however, the
surrounding air, without additional moisture, be heated to 70°, all
obstruction to evaporation is removed, and excessive exhalation is
the consequence. Beside this the equalization of the temperature is
much more perfectly effected in case of air properly supplied with
moisture.

These considerations, we think, are very much neglected in the
processes which are adopted for warming and ventilating in this
country. At least in the public buildings in the city of Washington,
the means of supplying an adequate amount of moisture have not
been provided, or, if provided, are not habitually employed. It is
intended, however, during next winter, to continue the observations
in regard to this matter, and to extend them to the principal public
buildings connected with the government.

It has been mentioned in previous reports that a series of experi-
ments was made in regard to the physical qualities and economical
values of different kinds of illuminating materials for light-house pur-
poses. Unfortunately all the notes of the experiments which had
been made on this subject were destroyed in the fire, and during the
past year the principal portion of time which I could spare from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

other duties was devoted to the reproduction and extension of the re-
sults previously obtained.

During the past year I devoted about three weeks, in connexion
with Commodore Powell and Mr. Lederle, of the light-house service,
to investigations in relation to sound as applicable to fog signals,
and obtained results of sufficient practical value to determine with
considerable precision the policy of the Light-house Board in regard
to this branch of aids to navigation.

As usual, various questions have been referred to the Institution by
different departments of the government for solution, and these have
in all cases received proper attention, and such reports have been
made as would suffice to an intelligent decision in regard to them.

The Institution is constantly applied to for the examination and
analysis of specimens of ores. Where such examination requires no
special labor, the information has been gratuitously given; but where
quantitative analysis is desired, and the information is for the ad-
vancement of private interests, a charge is always made suflicient to
repay the actual cost of the investigation.

Exchanges. —The system of international scientific and literary
exchanges has been maintained and extended by the Institution dur-
ing the past year. Seventy-seven large boxes, containing 1,176 par-
cels, were sent to our foreign agents in 1865, and 60 boxes, contain-
ing 5,000 parcels,received from them.

These packages, as in former years, contain the publications of the
Institution, public documents, transactions of societies, and scientific
works, by individuals, besides specimens of natural history. The
cost of this branch of the general operations is very large, and would
indeed far exceed the means of the Institution were it not for the
liberal aid received from various parties interested in the advance of
science. For favors of this kind thanks continue to be due to the Bre-
men, the Hamburg, the Cunard, and the Pacific steamship lines, and
to the Panama Railroad Company; all these have generously transport-
ed the packages of the Institution free of cost. Acknowledgments are
due to the Adams, Harnden, and Wells & Fargo express lines for
the carriage without charge of smaller packages, and of larger ones
at a very reduced rate. To Sir E. Cunard, F. Probst & Co., Oelrichs
& Co., and Kunhardt & Co., of New York, and to Leffman & Gut-
heil, of Vera Cruz, thanks have been tendered for important privi-
leges granted by them or through theirinfluence. Mr. George Hillier,
of New York, and Mr. Samuel Hubbard, of San Francisco, agents of
the Institution in those cities, have continued their valuable services.

It may be proper to state that great care is exercised in the
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

instructions which have been given to our agents to transmit nothing
in the boxes to the Institution which is not a donation, all purchases
being excluded on account of the present tariff regulations.

For the statistics of the exchanges see the annexed tables in the
report of Professor Baird.

Library.—The library has received during the past year, through
our system of exchanges, 547 octavo, 201 quarto, and 19 folio vol-
umes, 3,256 pamphlets and parts of volumes, and 183 maps and charts,
making a total of 4,206.

The work on the catalogue of transactions of learned societies and
of scientific journals has advanced so far that all those of foreign
countries have been finished, while those of America are now in the
hands of the printer.

The suggestion has been made in previous reports that consid-
erable relief might be afforded to the Institution by the transfer of
its library, under certain conditions, to the new and spacious halls
which Congress is providing for its own library, and the importance
of the proposition has been much enhanced by considerations con-
nected with the recent disaster. The west wing of the building, in
which the library is now contained, is not fire-proof, and is already
filled to overflowing. To provide another depository for it, which
shall render it entirely secure from fire and be sufficient for its con-
tinued increase, will far exceed the means of the Institution, and,
although some inconvenience would be experienced in regard to
ready access to the books, yet, in consideration of the great value
of the collection, by far the most perfect of its kind in the United
States, it has been thought proper to ask Congress to allow the de-
posit of this library to be made in one of the new fire-proof rooms
preparing for the extension of its own collection of books.

Iam informed by Mr. Spofford, the librarian of Congress, that
these two new rooms will be sufficient to accommodate the Smithson-
ian library and to furnish space for the growth of the Congressional
library for the next fifteen or twenty years. The object of the
transfer is, of course, not to separate this unique and highly prized
collection of books from its relations to the Smithsonian Institution,
for it must still bear its name and be subject to its control, but merely
to deposit it where its preservation will be more certain and its use-
fulness more extended .*

* Since the preparation of this report an act of Congress has been passed authorizing the
deposit of the library in one of the new rooms of the Capitol. This arrangement, while it
secures the safety of the books, will facilitate the researches of the student, since, in the same
suite of apartments, he will have free access to two libraries. (See Proceedings of the Board
in this volume.)
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (i

‘* Personnel” of the Institution. —In the annual reports for a number
of years past no other account has been given of the personnel of the
Institution than a reference to the principal assistants or a casual
allusion to the others ; but as special inquiry on this point has been
made by some of the new Regents, and as some changes will probably
take place on account of the fire and the transfer of the library, it is
deemed advisable on this occasion to give the official position and the
duty of the several persons connected with the establishment. This
information is perhaps the more necessary in order to prevent mis-
apprehension, and in some cases to protect the public from the
representations of designing persons, who, though never having had
any connexion with the Institution, or only a very temporary or sub-
ordinate one, have assumed to belong to the corps of its officers.

The act of Congress which organized the Institution directed the
appointment of but one executive officer, who, under the name of
the Secretary, should have ‘‘charge of the building and property
of said Institution,’’ be keeper of the museum, and perform the duties
of librarian, thus confiding to him the general direction of affairs,
under the control of the Board of Regents,and investing him with the
sole respousibility for the judicious and the efficient conduct of all
transactions of the Institution within the prescribed conditions. In
order, however, better to enable him properly to discharge the im-
portant and arduous duties devolved upon him, he is allowed, with
the consent of the board, ‘‘ to employ assistants.’’ By the adoption
of such an arrangement it was no doubt intended to secure unity of
action and efficiency of co-operation among all who might be actually
engaged in carrying out the novel and interesting objects of the be-
quest. The importance of this provision of the law was, however,
either not apparent at first or was lost sight of in the early proceed-
ings of the board. The Secretary, instead of being allowed the selec-
tion of assistants upon his own judgment and responsibility, when
permission had once been obtained for making the appointments, was
required to submit his choice to the approval of the Regents, and thus,
in a considerable degree, to abridge his power of control. As might
have been anticipated, this deviation from the original intention of
the act did not succeed in practice; dissensions soon arose as to the
exact apportionment of the income by the Secretary to the several
objects of the programme, in which the superintending parties were
differently interested, as well as in regard to the direction which each
assistant might exercise as head of a department, and maintaining a
separate and independent direction and official correspondence. To
2 - REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

obviate these difficulties, and to determine for himself and his
successors the character of his official position, the Secretary was con-
strained to resort to a rightful exertion of his authority, as plainly ex-
pressed in the law, and, without an appeal to the board, to reorganize
his corps of assistants. The majority of the Regents fully approved
of this course, and, to prevent difficulty in the future, repealed the
regulation relative to the division of the income, adopting at the same
time a resolution offered by the late Judge Douglas, that no official
letter or communication pertaining to ¢he affairs of the Institution
should be written except under the authority and by the direction of
the Secretary. Under this arrangment, which has now been in opera-
tion twelve years, all the affairs of the Institution have been con-
ducted with harmony, and, as I venture to think, with an efficiency
which evinces the wisdom of the provision for securing conformity
of purpose and unity of action.

In the reorganization of the personnel of the establishment, the
Secretary employed as his first assistant Professor Spencer F. Baird,
and as chief clerk William J. Rhees, each of whom receives a perma-
nent salary, affixed by a resolution of the Board of Regents to their
respective offices. Other assistants are employed on such terms as
the Secretary may think just.

It is evident, from the plan of organization, that the duty required
of the assistants is of a clerical rather than a scientific char-
acter, since service of the latter kind, as has been fully shown,
can always be obtained from the collaborators without charge, or
from experts employed for the occasion and paid in proportion to the
time of engagment. Although the terms of the reappointment of Pro-
fessor Baird prescribe that he shall render assistance in any line of
duty in which the Secretary may require his aid, yet on account of
his zeal in the cultivation of natural history, and his skill and expe-
rience in the collection and arrangement of specimens, his labors have
principally been assigned to such objects. He has likewise had
charge of the business of exchanges, and in part also of the print-
ing and correspondence. To Mr. Rhees has been assigned the duty
of superintending the accounts and auditing all the bills of expendi-
tures made by the Secretary and authorized under the general ap-
propriation of the Regents, while he has at the same time acted as
paymaster and assisted in the official correspondence.

Another assistant, Mr. William Q. Force, of this city, who has
been for several years connected with the Institution, has charge
of the meteorological materials which are constantly accumulating,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

and of the preparation of the monthly account of the weather for
publication in the bulletins of the Agricultural Department ; one half
of his salary is paid by the Commissioner of Agriculture and the
other half from the Smithson fund.

An assistant is also required to attend to the care of the books in the
library, and another to prepare the catalogue of the transactions of
learned societies now in the press, and to perform the clerical duties
connected with the system of foreign exchange. The former ser-
. vice for the last few years has been rendered by Dr. Theodore Gill,
who, at the same time, has continued his investigations in regard to
zoology. The latter duty has been performed by Miss Jane Turner,
the sister of the lamented Professor Turner, whose name occurs so
frequently in the previous reports of the Institution.

As one of the maxims to be observed in the policy of the Institu-
tion, but few persons are to be permanently supported by its funds.
This maxim has been strictly observed in regard to the principal as-
sistants, butit must be evident that, in the case of so large a building
and its contents, and so many and various operations to be attended
to, a number of employés will be constantly required. The con-
nexion of these, however, with the Institution is considered of
a temporary character, their numbers being increased or diminished
as circumstances may indicate. Of this class the following is an
enumeration of. those employed before the fire. The number has
since been reduced:

1. A janitor, who resides in the building, on the grounds, gives
information to visitors, acts as messenger, and has a general care of
the property at all times. 2. A curator of the museum, who keeps
the specimens in a proper condition for exhibition, performs the work
of a taxidermist in setting up specimens of birds, mammals, and
other animals. 3. A machinist, who assists in preparing experi-
ments for the illustration of lectures or for original research, who
has charge of the apparatus, the gas and water pipes, the furnaces,
and the repairs of the metal parts of the building. 4. A carpen-
ter, to make cases, trays, packing boxes, furniture, and to attend to
the repairs constantly required for the building. It has been found
from experience that the salaries of the last two employés are much
less than the annual cost of repairs of carpentry and metal work by
the employment of outside parties. 5. Night watchmen. Previous
to the fire but one of these was employed, but it was found that
the service was too much for the health of an ordinary individual,
and consequently it has been necessary to employ another, the whole .
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

twenty-four hours being nearly divided between them. 6. Laborers,
daily required for cleaning the building after the hours in which it is
open to the public, attending to fires, &c.

Besides the assistants who receive a salary, a large amount of Jabor
has been given the Institution, without pay, by persons interested in
the study of natural history, or who have been engaged in explora-
tions and make use of the facilities afforded by the library-and col-
lections in preparing their reports. To most of these, rooms, warmed
and lighted, have been assigned in the building, and lodging apart-
ments in the towers. Among these we may mention the names of
Mr. F. B. Meek, Dr. W. Stimpson, Dr. Gill, Mr. R. Kennicott, Dr.
EK. Coues, Dr. H. Allen, Dr. E. D. Cope, and Mr. A. D. Brown.

The laboratory has been under the care, for the last few years, of
Dr. B. F. Craig, now of the medical department of the army, and
also of Dr. Wetherill, just appointed Professor of Chemistry in the
new college at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The remuneration they
received was either from the government or from private parties, on
account of researches principally of an economical character.

For the purpose of conducting the foreign exchanges, it has been
found necessary to have agents in such central positions as may en-
able us to distribute the books and specimens most effectually to
various parts of the world, and to collect the returns intended for
this country. The following are the agents at present employed :
Dr. Felix Flugel, Leipsic; Gustave Bossange, Paris ; William Wes-
ley, London ; Fred. Muller, Amsterdam.

The collaborators, to whom references have so frequently been
made, include all the prominent cultivators of original science in this
country. They have all,with scarcely an exception, rendered assist-
ance in supporting, directing, and advancing the Institution. Its op-
ponents have been mainly those who have been misinformed as to its
character and labors, or have been disappointed in the desire to ad-
vance personal interests through its means.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, SPENCER F. BAIRD, RELATIVE TO EXCHANGES,
COLLECTIONS OF NATURAL HISTORY, &c.

During the past year 678 principal packages of various kinds—boxes, bales,
or bundles—were received at the Institution, and 508 sent out from it by the
different express, railroad, or steamship lines.

The figures given above, however, do not represent the entire number of par-
cels received by the Institution, or made up and transmitted by it, since, as will
be seen by the subsequent tables, seventy-seven alone of the parcels sent out
were boxes for our agents of exchange, containing 1,176 parcels, thus increasing
the preceding enumeration by 1,100. Again, of the packages received 60 were
boxes from Europe, containing at least 5,000 parcels, making a total of at least
5,600 received, and of about 1,600 transmitted.

As usual, the principal statistics connected with the exchanges of the Institu-
tion will be given in a series of tables, marked, respectively, A, B, C, and D.

As the corresponding receipts in 1864 amounted to 3,686, it will be seen that
1865 exhibits an increase of over 500 volumes and parts of volumes, thus indi-
cating that this source of supply to the library of the Institution exhibits no
symptom of diminution.

Additions to the collections of the Institution.

The total number of different donations in the year has amounted to one
hundred and fifty-five, contained in two hundred and fifty-seven packages.
This number is not equal to that of some previous years, as shown by the fol-
lowing tables; but the character of the collections received is in no way in-
ferior, and embraces much new and unworked material.

The table of receipts for the year, however, by no means expresses the re-
sources in this respect of the Institution.

In addition to the mechanical work of cleaning the specimens which were
exposed during the fire, and in restoring labels, &c., considerable progress has
been made in the identification and systematic arrangement of the specimens.
All the collections received have been unpacked, and proper labels of locality
and other items of personal history affixed, the different specimens placed where
they belonged, and those that would not admit of being immediately put in
hand for investigation, were boxed, labelled, entered in the record-book, and
stored where they will be readily accessible when wanted.

Much of the labor done in connection with the specimens received during the
year, and to a less extent with those previously in the collections, has consisted
in the writing labels for the same, and entering them with corresponding numbers
in the record books of the Institution. The following tables will show what
has been done in this respect, and a reproduction of a similar table from last
year’s report will show what additions have been made. In further illustration
of the progress made in this work, I add also the records of two or three year’s
interval since the commencement of the collections of the Institution.

1864 and 1865, as well as various preceding intervals.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

From the preceding tables it will be seen that the average entries per year,
for fifteen years, have been about 7,450, and that those for 1865 amounted to
15,925, the difference between the summations for 1865 and 1864. ‘This, how-
ever, includes about 7,600 entries of shells made during several years past by
Mr. Carpenter, and only reported in 1865.

As repeatedly explained in previous reports, it is only in ease of the osteo-
logical specimens, the mammals, and the birds, that each entry necessarily re-
lates to but one specimen. In the other departments all of the same kind,
from one locality, and collected at one time from the same donor, may have
but a single entry number, although this number should be affixed to all the
specimens. ‘The average of specimens to each entry cannot be determined ac-
curately, but it is probable that five will not be too high, thus giving as the
total number of specimens catalogued over half a million.

The following tables present an enumeration, somewhat approximate indeed
in some cases, of the specimens of different kinds, as well as the names and ad-
dresses of the parties receiving them, whether public or private. Many of the
latter have made contributions of greater or less value to the Institution, which
were then reciprocated ; and some required the specimens for scientific investi-
gation. From very few of the institutions, however, has anything been ever
received, nor is any expected.

Institution from the beginning to the end of—

The receipts, however, did not actually

come into the hands of the treasurer in full from the government until the 11th

of January, 1866, although credited for 1865.

In accordance with the decision of the Solicitor of the Treasury, the interest .
on the Smithsonian fund, due 1st of January and Ist of July, 1865, and the 1st
of January, 1866, was paid by the Secretary of the Treasury in coin, which,

being sold at the current prices, yielded the following sums, viz:

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. , 809

This sum is placed among the receipts for the past year, which, together with
the balance in the hands of the treasurer at the end of the previous year, made
the total available funds $84,956 37 for the year 1865.

The incidental expenses and the cost of the care of the museum are nearly
the same as in 1864, but in the previous year $4,000 were received from Con-
gress to defray the expenses, in part, of the care of the government collections
of the exploring expeditions, while, owing to the failure of the appropriation bill,
but $2,000 were received for this purpose during 1865.

The great expenditure, therefore, of the year has been on account of the
building, the particulars of which will be given in the report of the building
committee.

The appropriation received for the preservation of the collections of the
exploring expedition of the United States, has been expended, as heretofore,
under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in assisting to pay the
expenses of extra employés in the museum, and the cost of arranging and pre-
serving the articles. ‘Che specimens intrusted to the care of the Institution by
government are in a good condition, and the distribution of duplicates to other
museums has been continued during the year.

From the examination made by the committee it appears that, notwithstand-
ing the loss and inconvenience in consequence of the fire, the operations of the
establishment have been continued with unabated energy, and that especially
the foreign correspondence and exchanges have been increased rather than
diminished during the past year. ;

It appears from the statement of the Secretary, and the aecounts rendered by
Riges & Co., bankers of the Institution, that the remainder of the legacy of
Smithson, which amounted to $26,210 63 in gold, was sold at a premium from
1045 to 1074 per cent., yielding, after deducting the cost of sale and United
States tax, $54,165 38. This amount was expended in the purchase of United
States bonds bearing 7;%, per cent. interest at par. ‘The following is a detailed
statement of the whole transaction :

Balance, which could not be invested on account of

After the Secretary had purchased these bonds and deposited them for safe- .
keeping with the 'l'reasurer of the United States, it was claimed by the Secretary
of the Treasury that this money was not under the control of the Regents of the
Institution, inasmuch as the original act of Congress of 1846, establishing the
Institution, referred to only so much of the bequest of Smithson as was then in
the treasury of the United States, and that a special act of Congress would be
required to apply this money, or the interest on it, to the uses of the Institution.
The Executive Committee would therefore recommend that an application be
made to Congress for such a disposition of this money.

It is impossible to make at this time an exact estimate of expenditures for the
year 1866. The committee would therefore recommend that $34,660, the reg-
ular income of the Institution, be devoted to the maintenance and current ex-
penses of the operations of the establishment, and that the $13,724 63, balance
in the hands of the treasurer on the 1st January, 1866, together with the pre-
miums which may be received for the sale of coin, be applied to the reconstruc-
tion of the building.

The committee have carefully examined the accounts of the treasurer, and the
books as posted by Mr. Randolph for the past year, and find them to be correct.

In conclusion, it appears that the entire bequest of Smithson remains undi-
minished in the treasury of the United States, and that all the expenditures,
from the organization of the establishment to the present time, have been made
exclusively from the interest of the original sum, and from the income on ac-
crued interest invested in State stocks.

Respectfully submitted.

RICHARD WALLACH,
RICHARD DELAFIELD,

. Executive Committee.
WASHINGTON, March, 1866,
REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE,

. It has been stated to the Board that the fire which occurred on the 24th of
January, 1865, destroyed the roof and all the interior of the upper story of the
main building, the interior of the two large north towers, and also of the large
south tower.

The first step toward the reconstruction of the building was to secure the
services of a competent person as architect and engineer to prepare plans and
superintend the work. For this purpose Mr. Adolph Cluss, who had designed
and directed the building of the principal school-houses of the city, was em-
ployed. |

The next thing to be done was the making of a critical survey to ascertain
the actual state of the walls, and to determige what parts it was necessary first
to rebuild. This survey forced upon the committee the conviction that the
original construction of the building, as a whole, was very defective, and, in
many respects, unsuited as a receptacle of records and other valuable articles,
the loss of which could never be repaired. The exterior of all the walls. con-
‘sists of a facing of red sandstone, bound to an irregular backing of bluestone
of very bad workmanship. In the main building, and in the lower portion of
the large south tower, was inserted a four-inch brick lining, separated by an air |
space from the main walls. This lining is not bound to the walls, and, there-
fore, does not add to their strength. It is merely a furring, intended to pre-
vent dampness by the condensation of moisture from the atmosphere. This
furring is open:at the top, and it was into this that the stove-pipe was inserted
which led to the accident by fire. In all the other rooms of the towers the
plastering was upon the rough rubble work.

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower was merely set in place
without fastening, and, consequently could not withstand any disturbing action.

The parts of the building which were not injured by fire, namely, the two
wings and connecting ranges, as far as the committee have had the opportunity
of examining, are defective in materials and construction. The floors, in some
cases, though covered with flagging and filled in with deafening, rest upon
beams of pine wood, which is decayed, and in the course of a few years the
interior of these parts will require renewal.

It is proper to state that the foregoing remarks on the character of the mate-
rials, and the construction of the building, are not applicable to the work on
the main edifice, subsequently executed under the superintendence of Captain
(now General) B. S. Alexander, of the United States engineers. This work, -
which principally consisted in the arching of the basement and main story of
the upper building, was executed in fire-proof materials, and prevented the ex-
tension of the fire, and, consequently, the destruction of the entire edifice and
all its contents.

From the foregoing account of the original construction of the building, it
will not be surprising that the effect of the fire was found to be much more
serious than previous to this survey it had been supposed, and that the work to
be done could not be confined to the mere repairing of the injury caused by the
fire, but would include also the rebuilding of a considerable part of the edifice;
and this was particularly the case on account of the decision of the Board that
the-restoration should be in all parts indestructible by fire.
112 REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE.

The heavy projecting cornice of the south tower had fallen down, in part,
and the remainder was unfit to receive a new roof.

The high brick columns, extending from the cellar to the eayes of the main
building, and supporting the northern wall of the south tower, were so much
damaged by the fire as to require to be removed, and, consequently, with them
the above-mentioned wall itself. The lining of the upper story of the main
building was also so much injured that the greater portion of this will require
renewal. But the most instable portion of the building, and that which gave
rise to most anxiety, was the principal northern tower. ‘This, which is one hun-
dred and forty feet high, starts from a square base, and is gradually transformed -
into a regular octagon of smaller dimensions. Tour sides of this octagon rest
upon the sides of the original square, but project into the interior, while its
other four sides extend diagonally across the angles of the square, and are sup-
ported by rough and impertect corbel work, consisting of masses of bluestone
very seriously affected by the fire. ‘The tower was originally divided intu a
series of stories by transverse wooden beams and plank floors, which were en-
tirely destroyed. The anxiety in regard to this tower was increased by ob-
serving a vertical crack extending a considerable portion of the height of the
tower, but whether this had previously been produced by unequal settling, and
had merely been increased by the unequal expansion of the exterior and inte-
rior walls, due to the fire, or entirely produced by the latter cause, could not be
definitely ascertained. As this part of the building imperatively demanded im-
mediate care, the architect was directed to give it his first attention. After a
due consideration of its then present condition and its future use as a receptacle
of heavy articles, it was considered necessary to erect within it a lining of solid
brick-work nine inches thick, laid in cement, from the bottom to the top, firmly
united to the original wall, and serving as the support to iron beams of the brick
floors. And, furthermore, it was concluded to fill up, in brick-work, a number
of the high, narrow windows in each story, which would add to the strength of
the structure without affecting externally its architectural appearance.

A similar construction was directed in the other principal north tower, and
the work in both has been executed in such a manner as to give assurance that
these parts of the building will not merely be restored, but will also be rendered
more stable than they were before the conflagration. The crack above men-
tioned has been found, by the undisturbed condition of a thin stratum of plaster
placed over it, to have remained the same, and the walls, for several months
previous and during the winter, have not undergone any perceptible change.

While the work immediately required for the safety of the front towers was
in progress, plans were discussed and prepared for the interior of these as well
as for that of the south tower, with a view to their better adaptation to the
wants of the establishment.

The original plan of the building included four principal staircases leading to
the upper story of the edifice, one on each side of the north entrance, and a
similar arrangement on the right and another on the left of the south entrance.
As these occupied a large portion of useful space, it was thought best to increase
the size of those at the north entrance, dispense with those on the southern, and
so arrange the heights of the stories of all the towers as to render them more
available for the business operations of the establishment.

The work which has been done on the southern tower consists in the removal
of the north wall and a considerable part of the upper portion of the other
three walls; the preparation of a part of the freestone, from which to reconstruct
the exterior wall; the greater portion of the brick-work of the basement, and
the furnishing of the cast-iron columns intended to replace the brick piers which
supported the northern wall of this tower.

Immediately after the fire, measures were taken by the Secretary to secure
the property from the weather by a temporary roof over the main building, and
REPORT OF THE BUILDING COMMITTEE. 113

this was effected through the kind assistance of the Hon. E. M. Stanton, Seere-

‘tary of War, who authorized General Meigs, Quartermaster General, to con-

struct, under the direction of General Rucker, the covering required, though at
the expense of the Institution. The work was executed, during the most in-
clement period of the year, in the short space of two days. ‘This temporary
roof, covered with felt saturated with tar, has served the purpose intended. It
will, however, rapidly deteriorate, and, consequently, the first object of the
committee, during the coming season, will be to decide on the character of the
roof, and to hasten its completion as rapidly as the work ean properly be ac-
complished.

In the restoration of the building the committee have been governed by the
following considerations

1st. To render the work entirely stable, both in regard to material and mode
of construction.

2d. To render it thoroughly fire-proof.

3d. In view of the great cost at present of material and workmanship, and
the condition of the funds of the Institution, at first to do such work as should
be necessary to preserve the stability of the several parts of the building, and
prevent injury to the property by the weather.

The following is a detailed account of the expenditures on the building up to
the close of the operations for the winter. It includes not only the items of
expenditure immediately connected with the reconstruction, but also those
which were necessary as preliminaries in the security of the property and the
temporary repair of such parts as could not be deferred :

OF

mo BOARD OF REGENTS,

» WASHINGTON, January 17, 1866.
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, fixing the time of beginning of their annual session on the third
Wednesday of January in each year, a meeting was called for this day.
No quorum being present, the Board adjourned to meet on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 3, 1866.

WASHINGTON, February 3, 1866.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held at 12 m. in the laboratory of the
Smithsonian Institution.

Present: Hon. L. F. S.Foster, Vice-President of the United States, Hon. Garret
Davis, Hon. Lyman Trumbull, Hon. J. W. Patterson, Hon. J. A. Garfield,
Hon. J. F. Farnsworth, General Richard Delafield, Hon. Richard Wallach, and
Professor Henry, Secretary.

Mr. Foster was called to the chair.

The Secretary stated that since the last annual session the following gentle-
men had been appointed as Regents by the Speaker of the ee of Represen-
tatives :

Hon. J. W. Patterson, of New Hampshire; Hon. J. A. Garfield, of Qhio ;
Hon. J. F. Farnsworth of Illinois.

Mr. Patterson was reappointed a Regent, and Messrs. Garfield and Farnsworth
were appointed to succeed Hon. S. S. Cox and Hon. H. Winter Davis, whose
terms as members from the House of Representatives had expired.

The Secretary gave a general account of the objects and operations *6f “the .
Institution, the nature of the will of Smithson, &c.

General Delafield, from the Executive Committee, presented a report of the
financial condition of the Institution, and gave an account of what had been
done towards the reconstruction of the building.

The Secretary presented a notice from Roswell C. Brainard, esq., surrogate
of the county of Kings, New York, requiring the Smithsonian Insti{ution to
appear at his office, in Brooklyn, New York, on the 19th of March next, at
10 o’clock a. m., to attend the final settlement of the account of Francis Vinton,
as executor of and trustee under the last will and testament of Thomas Wynns,
deceased, of whose estate the Institution is a residuary legatee.
116 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

On motion of Mr. Davis, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to have the Institution represented
at the surrogate’s office, Brooklyn, New York, on the 19th of March next.

The Secretary stated that during the past year the interest on the Smith-
sonian fund in the treasury of the United States had been paid in coin; but
that Chief Justice Chase, Chancellor of the Institution, had recommended that
application be made to the Secretary of'the Treasury for the payment of all
the interest in coin, which for the previous three years had been received in
currency, since he had while Secretary of the Treasury authorized a similar
course in regard to other applications of the same character.

On motion of Mr. Garfield, it was

Resolved, That the Secretary of the Institution be directed to apply to the
Treasury Department for the payment 6f the difference between the interest
actually received in currency during the years 1862, 1863, and 1864, and the
amount in coin to which the Institution was justly entitled.

Mr. Patterson addressed the Board in relation to the great value of the library
of the Institution, and recommended that some action be taken to secure it from
danger of destruction, and advised the placing of it, under proper restrictions, in
the library of Congress.

After remarks by Messrs. Delafield, Garfield, Davis, and Trumbull,

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was

Resolved, That a committee be appointed, to consist of one Regent from the
Senate, one from the House of Representatives, one resident member, and the
Secretary of the Institution, to confer with the Committee on the Library of
Congress in relation to an arrangement for the removal of the library of the
Smithsonian Institution to the Capitol.

The Chair appointed Mr. Patterson, chairman, and Messrs. Trumbull, Dela-
field, and Professor Henry as the committee.

The Board then adjourned to meet on Saturday, February 17.

WASHINGTON, February 23, 1866.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution was held
this day at 12 m. in the room of the Senate Commiitee on the Judiciary, United

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. i bp al

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, February 7, 1866.

Sir: I am directed by a resolution of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, adopted at a meeting on the 3d of February, to make applica-
tion for the repayment in coin of the six instalments of interest on the Smith-
sonian fund for the years 1862, 1863, and 1864.

These payments were made in currency, but it has since been decided by the
legal adviser of the ‘Treasury Department that the Institution was entitled, by
the usages of the government in paying the interest on the permanent debts of
the United States, to receive its interest in coin.

The Board of Regents have been informed by Chief Justice Chase that, when
Secretary of the Treasury, he had made several repayments of this kind, and there-
fore they consider that the Institution is not only in justice entitled to this claim,
but that also a precedent has been established by which it can be readily allowed.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

: JOSEPH HENRY, Secretary.
Hon. H. McCuutocn,
Secretary of the Treasury.

The Secretary stated that Joseph H. Patton, esq., attorney, 112 Broadway,
New York, had kindly consented to attend at the settlement of the account of
the executor of Mr. Wynns, that gentleman having from the beginning been
fully acquainted with all the facts of the bequest.

Mr. Patterson, from the special committee appointed at the last meeting, re-
ported that a conference had been held with the Library Committee of Congress,
and that certain propositions had been discussed relative to the transfer of the
library of the Institution, and he recommended the adoption of the following as
the conditions on the part of the Institution :

1. That the Smithsonian library be deposited in the library of Congress,
subject to reclamation when the Regents may so desire.

2. The public to have access to the library for purposes of consultation every
ordinary week day.

3. The Institution to have the use of its own books as at present, and through
its Secretary to have the use of the library of Congress, under the same regu-
lations as senators and representatives.

4, That the books, maps, charts, &c., of the Smithsonian library be properly
cared for as are those of the library of Congress.

After considerable discussion, in which Messrs. Fessenden, Trumbull, Dela-
field, Patterson, and Farnsworth took part, on motion of Mr. Trumbull the fol-
lowing was adopted as a substitute for the first proposition reported by the
committee.

1. That the library of the Smithsonian Institution be placed on deposit with
the library of Congress, not to be withdrawn except on reimbursement by said
Institution to the United States of the expenses incurred in taking care of said
library, or on such terms and conditions as shall be mutually agreed upon be-
tween the United States and the Regents of the Institution.

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was
118 PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Resolved, That a committee be appointed to make the necessary arrange-
ments with the Library Committee of Congress for the proposed transfer.

Mr. Patterson, Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Garfield, and Professor Henry were ap-
pointed the committee.

Professor Henry presented his annual report of the operations of the Institu-
tion during 1865, which was read in part.

On motion, the Board adjourned to meet at the call of the Sander

WaAsHINGTON, March 24, 1866.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day in the laboratory of the
Institution, at 74 o’clock p. m.

Present: Chief Justice Chase, Chancellor; Hon. G. Davis, Hon. J. A. Gar-
field, Hon. R. Wallach, General Richard Delafield, and the Secretary, Professor
Henry.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

The Secretary stated that the Secretary of the Treasury had granted the re-
quest made by the Board relative to the payment of the interest in coin on the
Smithsonian fund, in the following manner: The amount which had been paid
to the Institution for six instalments of interest, from January, 1862, to July,
1864, in currency, was repaid into the treasury of the United States by Riggs
& Co., bankers of the Institution, who received in exchange for it the same amount
in coin. ‘This coin was sold immediately in New York, as follows:

The profit, therefore, to the Institution by the change of the currency to coin,
and the sale of the latter, is $27,081 76.

The report of the Executive Committee was presented by the chairman, Mr.
Wallach, and after explanations in detail by Generald Delafield, on motion of
Mr. Davis, was adopted.

General Delafield, chairman of the Building Committee, presented plans and
estimates for the reconstruction of the building.

The subject of the disposition of the money in possession of the Secretary of
the Treasury, resulting from the residuary legacy of Smithson, was next con-
sidered. ‘The Secretary suggested that so much of this sum as was received
from England, independent of the premium on the coin, viz : $26,210 63, should
be added to the amount originally deposited in the treasury of the United
States by Mr. Rush, making $541,379 63 as the total bequest of Smithson, and
that the premium and the interest since accrued be applied to the current uses
of the Institution, and to assist in defraying the cost of the restoration of the
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 119

building. By this arrangement the interesting fact could be stated that, after
all the Institution has done in the way of increasing and diffusing knowledge,
the entire sum derived from the bequest of Smithson is still undiminished in the
treasury of the United States.

The Chancellor recommended that the sum thus added to the money now in
the treasury of the United States should be sufficient to make up the amount to
$550,000.

On motion of Mr. Wallach, it was

Resolved, 'That the Secretary be directed to apply to Congress for an act by
which the residuary legacy of James Smithson, now in the possession of the
Secretury of the Treasury, amounting to $26,210 63, be added to the sum
originally received; and that also from the income of the above-mentioned
residuary legacy the further sum of $8,620 387 be added, making the total
amount deposited in the treasury of the United States $550,000 as the trust
fund, the interest on which alone is to be applied to the maintenance and uses
of the Institution ; and further, that the Regents be authorized to apply the re-
mainder of the income of the residuary legacy to the current expenses of the
Institution and the reconstruction of the building.

The Secretary stated that at the last annual session of the Board the disposal
of the State stocks held by the Institution was left to the discretion of the
Chancellor, Secretary, and Executive Committee; it having been found that it
was not necessary, in order to meet the expenditures on the building during the
year, to make a sale, it had been concluded not to dispose of these stocks, it
being thought that the value of those of Virginia and Tennessee would increase,
and that the accumulated interest due would in time be paid.

On motion of Mr. Garfield, it was

Resolved, 'That the Secretary present a statement at the next meeting of the
value of the State stocks held by the Institution.

In the absence of Hon. Mr. Patterson, chairman of the Committee on the
transfer of the Library, the Secretary stated that a bill had been presented in
the House of Representatives by Mr. Patterson, which had been referred to the
Library Committee of Congress, who had reported an act providing for the
transfer of the Smithsonian library on the terms agreed to by the Board at its
last meeting.

The reading of the annual report of the Secretary was then continued.

On motion of Mr. Wallach, the report was accepted.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.

WASHINGTON, April 28, 1866.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day, at 11 0’clock a. m., in the

gress which had been approved by the President of the United States, April
5, 1866, relative to the Smithsonian library :

AN ACT to provide for the transfer of the custody of the library of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to the library of Congress.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. 17

On motion of Mr. Trumbull, it was

Resolved, That, in addition to the direction given at the last meeting, the
Secretary be instructed to apply to Congress for an act authorizing the Treasurer
of the United States to receive into the treasury on the same terms as the
original bequest, such sums as the Regents may from time to time see fit to de-
posit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of one million dollars.

On motion of Mr. Patterson, it was

Resolved, That, in case the privilege is granted to increase the capital of the
Institution, the Executive Committee, with the Chancellor-and Secretary,
be authorized to dispose of any or all of the stocks now held by the Institution,
and to deposit the proceeds in the treasury of the United States.

General Delafield presented the report of the Building Committee ; which was
read and adopted.

The Secretary presented a number of communications to illustrate the cor-
respondence of the Institution.

The Board then adjourned to meet at the call of the Secretary.
EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE INSTITUTION TO ILLUS-
TRATE ITS OPERATIONS, ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY, PROFESSOR
JOSEPH HENRY.

From Joseph Leidy, Curator Academy of Natural Sciences.

PHILADELPHIA, May 1, 1866.

Dear Sir: I write in answer to your letter of February 20, in relation to
the donation of shells by the Smithsonian Institution to the Academy of Natural
Sciences. I was obliged to wait until now to give the committee an opportunity
to make out an account of the shells, which account I have just received from
the chairman, Mr. Tryon. He reports as follows:

“The collection of shells recently presented to the Academy of Natural Sci-
ences by the Smithsonian Institution embraces over 1,300 species, of which 793
are new to our collection ; an extraordinary increase, due in great part to the fact
that many of the species are those collected by the Wilkes exploring expe-
dition, (described by Dr. Gould,) never before distributed. There are also a
large number of new species from the west coast of North America, recently de-
scribed by Mr. Carpenter.

“We were indebted to the Smithsonian Institution last fall for a donation of
800 species, including 300 new to our collection, being a first portion of the ex-
pedition shells. Uniting the two donations, we have thus received over 2,100
species, including 1,100 new to us, within six months. The accuracy of the
names and localities renders the collection a valuable addition to our museum.”

From J. Miguel Arroyo, Perpetual Secretary of the Mexican Society of Geog-
raphy and Statistics.

Mexico, March 24, 1865.

EsTEEMED Sir: This society has been highly gratified by the communication
of your note of November last, in which notice is given it of the books which the
Smithsonian Institution has had the goodness to remit. In effect, it has just
received, at: the hands of Sefior D. José Ramon Pacheco, three large boxes con-
taining the said books, which the society, with a high appreciation of the gift,
has ordered to be placed in its library as a valuable addition to the collection
which it already possesses regarding the United States. I shall not forget to
seek, and will very soon send you the “ Registro trimestro,” which you have
had the condescension to inquire for; and begging you to accept for your distin-
guished institution the thanks of this society for the favor conferred, I have the
honor to subscribe myself your obedient servant.

From Jno. Evans, Governor of Colorado Territory.

DeENvrk, July 29,1865.
Dear Sir: The fossil jaw referred to in yours of the 12th instant was pre-
sented to me by Arapahoe Chief ‘ Friday,” who said he found it on Rock ereek,
a tributary of the Republican fork of the Kansas river, about one hundred and
fifty miles nearly due east of this place.
EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE. 123

In September, 1863, I visited that region of country, vainly endeavoring to
get the Indians together in council.

The general character of the country on the head of the Republican, corre-
sponds with other parts of the great plains, in being covered with the buffalo
grass on the clayey soils and bunch grass on the sandy hills.

The valleys along the streams are exceedingly fertile, being covered with tall
grass, rushes, and other growths of luxuriant vegetation common to such locali-
ties in other parts of the country.

On the Whiteman’s fork, Rock creek, and Arickaree fork, I found high bluffs,
bounding rather narrow bottoms, the general surtacé of the country being
slightly rolling on the general level of the bluffs. For some twenty-five or
thirty miles east and west these bluffs show outcrops of a cretaceous limestone,
corresponding with the mauvaises terres north of it.

This region has as yet been but little known. Captain J. C.F rémont crossed
it in 1843, and Lieutenant Bryan, in his explorations for a wagon road from
Fort Riley to Bridger’s pass, in the year 1856, on his return trip, passed down
Rock creek, but they appear to have given the country but a slight examina-
tion, as might be expected on such expeditions. From reports of parties who
have crossed the country south of this region on the dividing ridge between the
waters of the Platte and Arkansas rivers, near the 103° of west longitude, I am
led to believe this cretaceous formation extends for some distance southward
from the place that I visited on the occasion referred to.

It is a mistake to call this region a desert, for throughout my trip across the
region at the head of the Republican, I found it everywhere covered with grass,
furnishing the best of pasturage for stock.

Any further information that I can give will be cheerfully furnished.

MarTINiQuE, St. Pierre, January 6, 1865.

Sir: I have the honor to acquaint you with the circumstances attending a
very remarkable electric phenomenon which occurred in this city on the after-
noon of the 23d of November last, while I was absent in the United States.

A heavy temperature, charged with electricity, had for several days pressed
on the town, during which time there had been many and violent showers of
rain. A sudden and heavy shower of rain had just ceased, when there came a
sharp and short detonation like the booming of a cannon, accompanied by a
flash of red light, and followed by the smell of burnt powder. At the same in-
stavt cries were heard from a house in the principal street, the north end of
which had been struck by the lightning. On this end of the house there was
a projection, which was shattered, and the rubbles and tiles were almost
symmetrically thrown across the street. The fluid then passed along the houses
to the right, and down the front of one of these to a distance some two or three
feet below the level of the pavement; then passing outwardly, without in any
manner deranging the pavement, which was of brick, it extracted from the side
of the gutter a flat stone, nearly half a yard in length by about ten inches wide
and eight thick. This stone was taken out of the gutter at a level with the
bottom without interfering in any way with the surrounding mason-work, and,
being taken by an oblique line upwards, was thrown against the house on the
opposite side of the street. Here it took out six slats of a Venetian window
and falling on the round table of the saloon, shattered its marble slab.

Sir: I have the honor to enclose for the Smithsonian Institution a map, pre-
pared by the Venetian voyager Miani, in which his explorations upon the river
Nile are contrasted with those of the English travellers Speke and Grant. The
object of Dr. Miani in requesting that his map (which is accompanied by a
printed explanation) should be communicated to some of the learned societies
in America is sufficiently explained in his communication to me, of which I
enclose a copy. Should you be able to respond in any way to the wishes of

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEw Mexico,
Santa Fé, N. M., August 23, 1865.

My Dear Sir: Last week I received from Surgeon B. J. D. Irwin, U.S.
amy, the enclosed pamphlet: in relation to two aerolites which were found near
Tucson, Arizona, one of which you have in the Smithsonian, and the other I
had the honor to present to the city of San Francisco.

In speaking of these aerolites to his excellency Henry Connolly, governor
of New Mexico, he informed me that he knows of one far surpassing, in point of
size, either of these. As the one he speaks of is probably larger than any one
now to be found in any cabinet in the world, I should like very much for the
United States to secure possession of it.

In regard to the place where it may be found ; the following are the governor’s
words : :

“In the State of Chihuahua, and at the hacienda of Don Juan Nepumocena
Urquida, say one hundred and eighty miles south of the city of Chihuahua, and
directly on the road from that city to Mexico, and directly among the houses
of the above-named hacienda, on the left-hand side of the road going to the
EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE. 125

city of Mexico, and within from thirty to fifty yards of the main road, is, what
is supposed to be, an aerolite.”’ Governor Connolly saw it nearly every year
for twenty years, the last time in 1846, and he describes it as follows:

“Tt is a large mass of solid iron, standing like a post in the earth, from which
it projects vertically about four feet. Its ‘diameter at the surface of the earth
is from two to three feet. It diminishes in size a little from the earth to its
_ apex, which is irregularly rounded. How far it is imbedded in the earth had
never been ascertained. Some small pieces, or chips, had been detached by
cold chisels and carried off as curiosities; but these pieces were insignificant
in point of size, and their removal has not disfigured the general mass as a
specimen.” ‘The governor says he thinks the portion above ground would
weigh a ton or more.

[1t would appear from this and other information received at the Institution,
that an immense fall of meteorites must have taken place, ina recent geological
period, in New Mexico. ]

From T. A. Conrad.

PHILADELPHIA, February 16, 1866.

“ Chalk has at last been found in this eee ane chalk, with flints
and abundance of fossils.

“Smoky Hill, Colorado, is an outlying mass of chalk, probably the only re-
mainder of a vast mass which denudation has removed. If any expeditions
should be going that route, it is well the scientific members of it should know
this.”

Resolved, That the regents of the University of the State of New York
gratefully acknowledge the receipt of the following valuable additions to the
collections of the State cabinet of natural history, presented by the Smithsonian
Institution, viz:

A series of specimens of rocks, minerals, and building stones, and a collection
of nearly five thousand shells belonging to almost twelve hundred species,
properly labelled and distinguished.

Sr. Paut, MINNESOTA,
January 23, 1866.

My Dear Sir: I have recently received a communication from the Rev.
Charles Reynolds, missionary in New Mexico, in which is the following:
126 EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE.

“T had a call last evening, (September 1, 1865,) from Lieutenant Colonel
Samuel Tappan, who has lived and served as a soldier in Colorado and New
Mexico for several years. He begged me to write you in regard to the Navajo
tribe in New Mexico, 250 miles south of Santa Fé.

«« They are 15,000 strong, on a reserve; are the best farmers in New Mexico;
have no religious instruction; live in good houses; take but one wife; do
the outdoor work, and treat their wives as women; the most hopeful of all
Indians. :

From another source I learn that their language is almost pure Welsh; that a
Welshman can understand them at once; and that the blankets which they
make so beautifully are made in precisely the same way as the domestic blankets
in South Wales.”

The last paragraph of the above is very startling. If true, it suggests
a new train of thought for those engaged in the study of American ethnology.
Nay, it may go far to favor the views of Judge Hall, that the southern Indian
is of Pheenician origin, seeing that the Phcenician impress was strongly made on
the Welsh, while the former were developing the tin mines of Britain. Nay,
there is not a little to favor the idea that the natives of Wales and Cornwall
were themselves of Phoenician derivation.

Now, my dear sir, would it be too much trouble for you to look into the records
of the Indian bureau, and ascertain whether there is any record of the fact of
the Navajo Indians having anything in language, manners, or customs resem-
bling Wales? If you can learn anything of the kind, you will doa great
service to the public, and eliminate, at once, more than half the mysteries
of Indian history. True, this may not, in any way, affect the history of the
more northern tribes, but it will strongly suggest the idea that Indian history,
ix general, is far more simple than Indians themselves think, or would have us
believe.

If you can give me any information on this subject I shall be greatly obliged,
and will endeavor to follow it up. If you should not have time to examine the
matter, Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, might look into it.

Yours, faithfully,

[The following are the remarks of Mr. GEorGE Grpgs, to whom the forego-

WASHINGTON, February 12, 1866.

My Dear Sir: I have the pleasure of acknowledging your request that
IT would answer the queries of Mr. Donnelly’s correspondent, and herewith
submit such information as I can give, without. more research than I now have
time for.

The reports of the existence of Indian tribes speaking Welsh are very old,
and their alleged location has been as fugitive as that of the Amazons. The
story, I presume, took its origin in the tradition of Prince Madoc’s voyage, the
patriotism of his countrymen leading to the desire that they should participate
with the northmen in the glory of discovering this continent. Whatever may
have been his fate, it is certain that neither his followers nor the Scandinavians
ever left their impress on an American language. As the knowledge of the various
Indian tongues has advanced with the progress of settlement and more enlight-
ened inquiry, the identical tribe, speaking Welsh, has receded like the mirage,
until it is now sought in almost that last place upon the continent to which a
foreign colony could have reached. The Zuni Indians, a “pueblo” or settled
tribe, living in the neighborhood of the Navajos, have enjoyed this reputation
of late on the strength of the number of albinos found among them.
EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE, V7.

The Hon. John R. Bartlett, now secretary of the State of Rhode Island, many
years ago prepared a very elaborate paper, giving all the “authorities” on this
subject, and, if I am not mistaken, published it at the request of the Welsh
citizens of New York. He certainly can elucidate the history of the legend if
Mr. McMasters desires to pursue the inquiry in that direction.

I do not, however, think it necessary to dwell upon that point, or the im-
probability of a change of color and feature. The character of the language of
the Navajos is well known. Vocabularies, more or less extensive, have been
obtained from time to time by various officers of the army, government agents,
and by Mr. Bartlett himself. From these the late Professor Wm. W. Turner
demonstrated, long since, its affinity with the great Athapascan or Chepewyan
stock, a family occupying the northern part of the continent, next south of the
Esquimaux, and extending from the shores of Hudson’s bay to those of the
Pacific. To this family the Apaches, neighbors of the Navajos, also belong.
Mr. Hale, the philologist of the United States exploring expedition, had pre-
viously obtained vocabularies of the Tahculli or “ Carriers,” of Fraser river, of
certain bands near the mouth of the Columbia, and of the Umpquas, to which
he gave the collective name of “'Ti-ka-li-Um-kwa.” These Mr. Gallatin proved
to be Athabascan tribes. In 1851 I collected new vocabularies on Rogue river
and the Klamath, still further south, which Mr. Tnrner recognized as belonging
to the same family. All these form links in the chain connecting the Navajos
and Apaches with the parent stock, and show that the migration southward of
the Athabascans took place by routes west of the Rocky mountains.

In fine, the Navajos and Apaches are offshoots of an extreme northern race
who have wandered southward, just as the Camanches are a branch of the Sho-
shonees or Snakes of Oregon. I have by me vocabularies of almost every tribe
of this great family, and can assure you that the verbal similarity is conclusive
as to their common origin. But my opinion is not needed in corroboration of
that of Turner and of Buschmann.

As regards the blankets, they are the common pattern of the Mexican “sarape,”’
made, it is true, exceedingly well.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

remittance of contributions to the Smithsonian Institution, and through his
Majesty’s gracious intervention I obtained orders which gave me satisfaction, and
will, I have no doubt, be agreeable to you also.

I have since crossed the ocean again, and am just arrived from Europe; this
absence has delayed my addressing you this letter.

The work of Descourtilz is ready to be offered to the institution—that is to
say, the first volume, for the continuation has not yet been published ; and they
are preparing at the museum a collection of birds for the same destination,
This collection is not complete; but I have taken upon myself to delcare
that that was not an objection, as a complete collection can only be made
by degrees.

I have also obtained an order from the Historical and Geographical Institute
of Brazil that a set of their three-monthly publication (the Revista) be sent to
you. You will find that some of the volumes are missing, because the boxes in
which they were kept have been destroyed; but if they are republished they
will be sent to you,

happily, I cannot do it in this opportunity, because the Brazilian museum is
exhausted with the returns made to other museums.

I send a few ornithological and entomological specimens and some bones of
fossil animals. :

I send also a copy of the “Ornithologie Brésilienne,”’ a work which shall
continue and form four or five volumes.

Therefore it seems to me more conducive to the object of having Dr. H. Berendt
well recommended to the authorities of the different departments he intends to
visit, to write by the steamer of the 16th instant to the minister of foreign
affairs of Guatemala, telling him Dr. Berendt’s object, and the minister will
no doubt write to the corregidors recommending them to tender the doctor any
assistance or information in their power, to further such useful undertaking.

In case Dr. Berendt wishes it, I send for him a passport, recommending him
officially and especially to whatever authorities he may meet in Guatemala.

The secretary to this legation is the member for Peten in the chamber of
representatives of Guatemala, and although not personally acquainted with the
corregidor, is known to the latter by name and may, if desirable, give a letter

naturalized citizen of the United States, an accomplished gentleman and man
of science of great merit, who, under the auspices of the Institution and as its
agent, purposes a visit to Central America with a view to exploring the less
known portions of Guatemala and the coasts of that republic, in order to aug-
ment the knowledge which we at present possess of their geography and natural
history.

The enterprise is purely scientific, interesting to the learned world, and cannot
fail especially to redound to the advantage of the people and government of
Honduras as far as concerned in its execution; under which impression I can
entertain no doubt that you will extend to Dr. Berendt and his assistants the
protection, aid, and facilities which may be in your power towards the further-
ance of their objects, agreeably to the request of the representative of the re-
public in the United States.

WaAsHINGTON, November 7, 1865.

Dr. Berendt, accompanied, perhaps, by an assistant, is about to proceed to
Central America, as an agent and under the auspices of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in this capital, for the purpose of increasing the knowledge which we
already possess respecting the geography and natural history of certain unex-
plored parts of Guatemala and the coasts of Honduras.

This purpose recommends itself by its intrinsic interest to the scientific world,
and more especially to the government and people of that republic; and Dr.
Berendt has been strongly represented to me by Professor Henry, the distin-
guished secretary of the above institution, as being a gentleman of great attain-
ments in science, and of much personal merit.

Upon these considerations, I pray you to accord to the Doctor the regard
which ‘he merits, and to his enterprise the protection, aid, and facilities which
may be in your own power, or to procure them for him from the functionaries
with which you may be in correspondence.

Dr. Berendt is a native of Germany, and a naturalized citizen of the United.
States.

Jt remains only to subscribe myself, with the highest respect, your obedient
servant,

LUIS MOLINA.

The ADMINISTRATOR of Trujillo, Honduras.

WASHINGTON, November 7, 1865.

I have been informed by the highly esteemed secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, Professor Henry, that Dr. H. Berendt, a citizen, by naturalization, of
the United States, has formed the design of prosecuting, under the auspices of
the Institution, either alone or accompanied by an assistant, an expedition
into certain unexplored regions of Central America, with a view to increasing:
the amount of our present knowledge of their geography and natural history.
This visit, purely scientific, will embrace the departments of Peten, Vera Paz,,
and Golfo Dulce, in Guatemala, and will terminate on the coast of Honduras.

As far as regards the exploration of their own coasts, the people and govern-
ment of Honduras will find themselves especially interested in this enterprise,
so strongly commended, as Professor Henry well observes, to the favor of
the whole scientific world ; and I have therefore consigned to the worthy professor
the papers which he has been pleased to request of me in the name of the In-
stitution for the authorities of the northwest coast, recommending to them to
extend to Dr. Berendt all the protection, aid, and facilities in their power and
which may be necessary to secure success to his meritorious undertaking. I have
sent to him, moreover, this letter, directed to your excellency, in order that the
supreme government may have knowledge of the projected enterprise, and that,
if the opinion of its merits be as favorable as I think it will be, orders may be:
graciously issued to the authorities of the northwest coast in conformity with
the objects indicated in my recommendations above referred to.

I should add that Protessor Henry speaks of Dr. Berendt as ‘a gentleman:
of great merit and of high accomplishments in point of science.”

Allow me the honor of subscribing myself, in conclusion, your excellency’s

any communication on the part of your Institution, and endeavor to give in
exchange whatever may be of interest for you and in their reach. They propose
publishing regular annual reports and periodicals, and dare to offer regular
exchanges, although conscious that their doings, owing to the smallness of their
means, will by no means compare with those of your proud Institution. The
more happy you could make this little fraternity ardently devoted to science.

illustrative description of that most venerable and accomplished monument of
the history of the republic, the court-house, at the same time the seat of the
government and senate.

EXTRACTS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE. Beare

You are already aware, from previous correspondence with this department,
that the legislature of the province, at the instance of the chief superintendent
of education, authorized the establishment of a meteorological station in every
county in Upper Canada in connexion with the department of public instruction,
the observers being the head masters of grammar schools. 'The following in-
struments were obtained from England for each station: Barometer by Negretti
and Zambra; dry and wet bulb thermometers by the same; and maximum and
minimum thermometers by Cassella. These were compared with standards at
the new observatory by Mr. Glaisher, and again at the Toronto observatory.
They are excellent instruments, and may be relied on. Each station is also
supplied with a wind vane and rain gauge. Full instructions and tables, together
with forms for periodical reports, are provided for the observers.

As some of the counties have hesitated to pay for the instruments, and in
others the observations were not duly taken, it was deemed necessary in 1865
to obtain further legislation and regulations on the subject. Although some
observers faithfully performed their duty under the former system, it was found
that more satisfactory results would be obtained by restricting the number of
stations and making a pecuniary allowance to observers for their labors. Our
stations are now ten (10) in number, situated at the most favorable points between
longitude 83° and 74° west, and latitude 42° and 46° north. The observers are
educated men, and graduates of universities. Arrangements have also been made
for the careful examination and comparison of the records of the observations at
this office. The results will appear monthly in our official journal.

I send herewith copies of some recent regulations which we have issued to
our stations.

As our meteorological establishments are now being placed on a more satis-
factory footing, we may hope to contribute information of permanent value ; and
your institution would confer a favor on this department by sending us as com-
plete a series of its meteorological reports, with any papers bearing on the sub-
ject, as it may be able to afford.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

From A. Panizzi, Principal Librarian.

British Museum, Ju/y 20, 1865.

Sir: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th May last,
informing me that on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution you have forwarded
to the British Museum, as a present to the trustees, upon certain conditions, a
type series of fossils from the upper Missouri, collected by Lieutenant War-
ren, and Dr. Hayden.

In reply, I have to express the thanks of the trustees of the British Museum
for the very obliging offer which the managers of the Smithsonian Institution
have made to them, and I am to assure you of the readiness of the trustees to
reciprocate the kind feeling of interest which the managers have shown in the
improvement of the collections of the British Museum. Although the trustees
cannot accept a present under restrictive conditions, they are prepared, in this
instance, to meet the wishes of the managers of the Smithsonian Institution so
far as may be in their power, and I am accordingly directed to send you here-
with the copy of a letter on this subject from Professor Owen, the superintend-
ent of the departments of natural history in this museum, on whose views the
trustees are disposed to act.

I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,

Dear Sir: I enclose the letter and form which you brought me on the 17th
instant from the principal librarian. In reference to the fourth condition, after
due inquiry and inspection, I should be prepared, when required, to submit to
the trustees a series of duplicates, in my opinion suitable in the sense of equiva-
lency, as a return for the type series of fossils proposed to be presented con-
ditionally by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, United States.

Assistant Secretary British Museum.

From Professor William Hincks.

Toronto University, March 26, 1866.

Dear Sir: The additional proof just received of the liberality with which
the Smithsonian Institution uses its duplicates in promoting science claims some-
thing more than the mere formal expression of our gratitude, and is, I assure
you, very highly appreciated by myself and my colleagues in the management
of our museum, and by all the authorities of our University.

Permit me to explain that the objects of the museum are first to afford the
best attainable materials for instruction in the several branches of natural science
to the professor of that department in University College; secondly, to afford
opportunities for private and special study to any persons seeking them; and
thirdly, to offer a pleasing and instructive exhibition to the publie at large,
which is opened at all proper hours without any payment, and is extensively
visited both by our own citizens and the numerous travellers from the United
States, the most intelligent of whom have expressed themselves in the most
flattering terms respecting its interest and beauty. We perhaps excel most in
birds, and so far as the representation of the few families that remain unrepre-
sented in the collection, and the completion of our North American series,
nothing is more desirable to us. In mammalia we aim chiefly at obtaining the
moderate-sized native animals, and a few of the more deviative forms, not having
either space or funds for attempting more. We have a good instructive series
of shells and some special collections, and this branch is a favorite one. We
have many fine insects, and greatly desire to extend and improve that collection.
We have some excellent specimens of fishes, both British and Canadian, and a
few Chinese and West India. We have some crustacea and echinodermata and
a few good polypifera, but are comparatively deficient in these interesting
branches. Our botanical collection includes about 7,000 species, chiefly European
and North American, with many fine forms from all parts of the globe. We
are somewhat crippled in funds, which checks very rapid increase, and we have
no means of accumulating duplicates to any extent, but we should feel the
sincerest pleasure in rendering any service within the reach of our efforts to the
Smithsonian Institution as a proof of our estimate of the value of its contri-
butions to science and the liberality with which it seems to be conducted.
Our specimens are throughout systematically arranged and handsomely ex-
hibited. I should have said above that we have some good reptilia and am-
phibia, yet very few comparatively.

[ Translation. }

Fort Rag, Hupson’s Bay Territory, June 20, 1864.

My Dear Sir: I take advantage of Mr. Smith’s departure to offer you the
assurance of my respect and perfect consideration. I thank you for myself
and my converts for the permission you have kindly given me to take up my
quarters within the bounds of Fort Rae.

As Mr. Smith will perhaps tell you, I have had an opportunity of visiting
the tribes which inhabit the interior of the country comprised between Great
Bear lake, Copper Mine river and Fort Rae. It is through the kindness of that
gentleman that I have been able to comply with the desire of the Indians, and
J am infinitely indebted to him for it. As many incidents of this journey were

of a kind to interest a “ voyageur,” I shall allow myself to amuse you with a-

few.

In the first place I will spare you the fatigues of a journey on snow-shoes,
which, notwithstanding your reputation as a pedestrian, you will doubtless not
regret performing without stirring from your easy-chair. I will transport you,
therefore, at once to Lake Kleritic, eight days’ travel by that method to the north-
northeast of Fort Rae, and ten or twelve days by canoe. There, upon a pretty
high hill, is situated the camp.

A magnificent view is enjoyed from this point of the above-named lake and
of Lake Kamitié, which empties into it. Their immovable and frozen surfacs
winds between feldspathic mountains, sometimes naked or eaten into by lichene
and mosses, sometimes covered with forests of thorns. But these trees are only
pigmies of five or six feet in height; wretched shrubs whose roots are buried
in a thick bed of yellowish lichens, and whose dwarfed and vertical branches
allow the rays of the sun to pass through. On the left extend arid steppes,
dotted with pools of stagnant water, serving as a pasturage for herds of rein
deer which run unceasingly over the surface of the lake. This country is a
true Arabia Petrea, where the eye takes in only blocks of granite, masses of
coarse porphyry, diorite, and especially of feldspathic orthose. Here there is
no stratification, no talus of debris or metamorphism; the mountains have under-
gone no degradation, and the waves which beat against their foundations dash
themselves in vain. Upon the slope opposite to these rocks stretches the
Ot’-el-néré or flat country of the Esquimaux, which, despite its name, is com-
posed only of mounds and rounded hills. I did not go there only because I
had more work than I could perform among my Indians. It is time that I
spoke of them.

They belong to the great Montagnais or Téné nation and to the Slave tribe,
but their idiom is very different from the language of the Ténés. Many of
these Indians have already made the voyage from Portage la Roche, and this
present year two of them are preparing to repeat it. ‘The young people and
grown men alone visit Fort Rae, or that at the Forks, or have intercourse with
the whites. The rest of the tribe, the old men, women and children, not only
have never seen the missionaries, but even a white man of any sort. I except,
however, King Beaulieu, who visited their midst in May, 1863, but did not
ascend as far as I, by nearly three days’ journey.

It is a singular spectacle, that of a horde of these savages on their march over
a frozen lake, and it was the first time that I have been permitted to witness it.
As far as the eye could reach, a long file of sledges and dogs, women loaded
with burdens and young children, the cries of infants, the barking of dogs, and
the shouts which their conductors uttered—the whole forming a picture as cu-
rious as wild.

I have told you that these poor Indians have never yet seen a missionary,
which is saying that they had not a trace of Christianity. Thus disease (I speak
of moral disease) has made frightful ravages among these unfortunate tribes. It
cannot be denied, and it is my conviction, that we shall assist at the obsequies
of the Dog Rib nation, (Plats cotés de Chiens.) ‘The incredible venereal ex-
cesses to which these wretched people were formerly addicted has destroyed the
constitution, although so robust, of the Indians, and abridged half their existence.
Among them young persons are only seen emaciated and frail, with bony and
hectie faces. Pulmonary consumption slowly undermines the tribe. During
the forty-four days which I passed among them, I ministered to two of them on
the death-bed. On my return to Fort Rae I found five graves yet fresh, and
upon the journey of the Toaut Onédés river two others; a tenth savage is dying
at the moment of my writing you these lines. If you add to this figure, already
unhappily too great, the thirty-four Indians who died during the last winter, you
have forty-four deceased in the space of six months, an enormous total consider-
ing the number of this tribe, (about 1,200, according to my enumeration.) 'To
pthysis, which appears to be, with the venereal disease, the scourge of this peo-
ple, is added influeneza, which extends its ravages especially among the children.

Poor people, they are very different in their morals from what they were for-
merly. The beneficent light of the gospel, in entering their hearts, has opened
their eyes to their past excesses; but as Adam, converted, they carry the chastise-
ment of their guilt with them.

It is to these causes, venereal excess and incestuous unions, that I attribute the
general stuttering of these Indians. Among ten there was not a single one who
was not a stammerer.

I have dwelt long upon these Indians, my dear sir. What I have told you
is not for the purpose of exposing the scourges of humanity. My duty is to hide
them. But they speak eloquently in showing that the theory of the primitive
man, the happiness of man free and cut off from religion, is but an Utopia, worthy
of the philosophers who invented it.

Ouce more I thank you for having afforded me the means of doing a share of
good to these poor Indians. They will repay you some day. I refrain. It is
time to close this long farrago, which has become tedious.

Will you, while excusing my loquacity, receive anew the assurances of the
distinguished consideration with which I am, sir, your very humble servant.

BREVET MAJOR GENERAL,
LATE CHIEF ENGINEER U. 8S. ARMY, AND REGENT OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

By J. G. Barnard, Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers, and Brevet Brigadier General U. S. A.;
Brigadier and Brevet Major General U.S. V., A. M., LL. D., N. A. S.

[Reprinted from the Annual of the National Academy of Sciences for 1866. ]

{Instead of preparing a eulogy myself, as requested by the Board of Regents, of their lamented associate
General Totten, I have thought the service would be better rendered by presenting the facts I had gathered
on the subject to General Barnard, and by adopting his tribute to the memory of one so long and so effi-
ciently connected with the Institution. J. H.}

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Academy:

In conformity with a clause of the constitution of this Academy, and in obe-
dience to your instructions, 1 am here to render the tribute of a formal biograph-
ical notice in commemoration of one who was numbered among our most vener-
able and most honored associates. If, in the language of one of our body, on a
previous and similar occasion, “itis no unreasonable assumption that public
benefit and individual incentives may be derived from the history of any man
whose scientific services have rendered him worthy of admittance to your num-
ber,’’ that assumption must have a peculiar force when it applies to one who
has “ finished his course,’ and has filled a life, protracted beyond the usual
term, with scientific labors of no ordinary variety and magnitude.

It is but little more than two years since we first met for the great and import-
ant work of organizing this National Academy, and with us—of our number, if
not personally present—were “both the gray-headed and very aged men.”
But, alas! these, like autumnal leaves, are rapidly falling away, and already
the places ofa ‘l'otten, a Hitchcock, and a Silliman know them no more, save in
the records of their lives and deeds, and in the grateful memories of their associ-
ates. What a trio of names, glorious in the annals of science, is this! Well
may they be incentives to us who yet remain to strive that we may worthily
replace them, and establish for this Academy a reputation for usefulness and
science which their honored bearers have acquired for themselves.

Although there may be many among us more capable than myself of doing
justice to the memory of our departed colleague, I feel grateful that the lot has
fallen to me. Placed under General Totten on my first entrance into the mili-
tary service—almost in my boyhood—my relations to him, both personal and
professional, have ever since been continuous and intimate. Under obligations
to him of no ordinary nature, I could not do otherwise than regard him with
reverence and affection. If I fail, therefore, it shall not be because my heart is
unmoved, nor because I am insensible to the magnitude of my task.

Josepu GILBert Torren was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on the 23d
of August, 1788. His grandfather, Joseoh Totten, came from England before
138 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

the war of the Revolution, and engaged in mercantile pursuits in New York.
Attached to the cause of the mother country, he left that city, after the acknowl-
edgment of our independence, for Annapolis, Nova Scotia. It would appear
that his two sons remained in this country, since one of them, Peter G. Totten,
married in 1787 Grace Mansfield, of New Haven, a very beautiful woman, whe
died a few years after her marriage, leaving two children, the subject of this
memoir and a daughter, Susan Maria, who married Colonel Beatty, an English
officer, and who is still living, a widow, in London. After the death of Mrs.
Totten, which occurred when her infant son was but three years old, the father,
having been appointed United States consul at Santa Cruz, West Indies, took
up his future abode on that island, leaving his son under the care of his mater-
nal uncle, Jared Mansfield, a graduate of Yale College, 1777, and a learned

mathematician. ‘The boy continued to be a member of Mr. Mansfield’s family
until the latter removed to West Point, having been appointed captain of engi-
neers and a teacher in the United States Military Academy, then just organ-
ized by act of Congress of 1802. Young Totten’s first teacher was Mr. Levi
Hubbard, brother to the rector (at that time) of Trinity church, New Haven ;
afterwards his education was carried on under the personal superintendence of
hisunele. Of the period of his schoolboy life we have some glimpses, through the
recollections of an old friend and schoolmate, Mr. Ralph Ingersoll of New Ha-
ven, who speaks of him as a bright, noble youth, of fine mind, fond of study,
and always at the head of his class, gentlemanly in his deportment, and
greatly beloved.

Young Totten went to West Point with the family of his uncle in 1802. He
was soon after appointed a cadet. He remained at West Point one term, that
of 1803, and perhaps part of that of 1804. He was promoted to a second lieu-
tenancy in the corps of engineers, July 1, 1805.

The venerable General J. G. Swift, recently deceased, his brother engineer
officer and life-long friend, describes him at West Point as ‘a flaxen-headed
boy of fourteen years of age, a good scholar, and to me a most interesting com-
panion.”’

Captain Mansfield, having been appointed surveyor general of Ohio and the
western Territories, November 4, 1803, induced his nephew to accompany him
to the west as an assistant on that first systematic survey of any of the new
States of the Union. Here that faculty which so distinguished him through
life, of keen observation of whatever was most interesting connected with or in-
cidentally brought under his notice by his professional pursuits, displayed itself
at this early age in a noteworthy manner. ‘The vestiges of an earlier race than
the red man, which have since been made the subject of the researches of a Squier
and a Davis, of a Lapham and of a Haven, and to which, during recent times,
fresh attention has been directed by the developments of the high antiquity
of the human race in Europe as shown by similar relics over the surface of that
country and by the lacustrine remains in Switzerland, attracted his notice and
were made the subjects of survey. Although these investigations were not
published, they are, I believe, the first we have record of; those of Caleb
Atwater, who is called by Squier and Davis “ the pioneer in this department, ”
not having been published until 1819. Full descriptions and measurements of
several of these mounds, particularly that of Circleville, were made and sent to
his friend, J. G. Swift. ‘lo most youths of his age those remains of structures,
built

“while yet the Greek

would have been passed over with vague curiosity or listless indifference.
Not so with young Totten. Although notable, perhaps, to perceive all the eth-
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 139

nological importance which has since been attached to them, he could yet appre-
ciate them as objects of high interest, as vestiges of the races which had inhab-
ited the country, and give his time to their examination and measurement.

During the two years which he passed in the office of his uncle at Ludlow’s
station near Cincinnati, he was a companion of several young men who subse-
quently became conspicuous, among whom were Nicholas Longworth, Samuel
Perry, Daniel Duke, Thomas Pierce, and Peyton Symmes, all of whom are now
dead. His tastes, however, led him back to the army, (from which he had re-
signed shortly after his promotion,) and, February 23, 1808, he was reappointed
a second lieutenant of engineers, his commission bearing the same date as that
of his subsequent friend, brother engineer officer, and professional associate,
Sylvanus Thayer, of national fame as for so many years superintendent of the
Military Academy, and as the officer to whom is mainly due its present high
grade among the military and scientific institutions of the world. Lieutenant
Totten commenced his career as a military engineer under Colonel Jonathan
Williams, the first chief of the corps, and was engaged on the construction of
Castles Williams and Clinton, New York harbor.

At the commencement of the war with England Lieutenant Totten was as-
signed to duty as chief engineer of the army under Brigadier General Van
Rensselaer, in the campaign of 1812, on the Niagara frontier, and in that capa-
city took a conspicuous part iu the battle of Queenstown. He was subsequently
chief engineer of the army under the command of Major General Dearborn, in
the campaign of 1813, and of the army under Major General Izard and Briga-
dier General Macomb, in the campaign of 1814, on Lake Champlain. Having
been promoted to a captaincy in 1812, he was in June, 1813, brevetted major,
for ‘‘meritorious services,’ and September 11, 1814, lieutenant colonel, for
“eallant conduct at the battle of Plattsburg ;”’ his efficient services as an engi-
neer in the defensive arrangements of that field having contributed powerfully
to the successful issue. rte

The termination of the war may be considered as the close of one period in
the life and services of General 'T'otten, and the commencement of another; or
rather it may be said, that the events of which we have traced a faint outline
were but the preparation and training of his mind for the real work of his life,
Reared under the eyes and guardianship of a relative distinguished for his
mathematical attainments, receiving as extensive a military and scientific educa-
tion as West Point at that early day could give, called by his position in Sur-
veyor General Mansfield’s office, not only to exercise the science which the du-
ties involved, but to take extended views of our country as to the interconnec-
tion of its parts, and their relations to commerce or war, then practically taught
the duties of a military engineer in what concerns the defence of harbors, and
finally carried through the ordeal of actual war in the campaigns of armies in
the field, he was now prepared for the great work of his life—the fortification
of our seaboard frontier. When I call this the great work of his life, | am not
unaware that it is but a part of that work—still the most important part, and
one to which his other labors may be considered incidental.

A brief reference to the condition and progress of sea-coast defence at that
period is here appropriate. Previous to the Revolution, our seaport towns had
not grown into large cities, nor were there great naval establishments or military
depots to invite the enterprises of an enemy. During that contest, the harbors of
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, &c., had been, toa certain extent,
“fortified” against naval attack by slight earthen batteries, or in some few
cases by small and (as we would now call them) insignificant earthen forts. A work
of palmetto logs and sand on Sullivan’s island, Charleston harbor, mounting
but 30 guns, decisively repulsed, early in the revolutionary war, the attack of
the British fleet under Sir Peter Parker, consisting of two frigates and six
sloops-of-war, carrying about 270 guns, destroying four of the smaller vessels, and
140 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN:

inflicting a loss of 205 in killed and wounded (eleven times as many per gun
employed against them as the English lost at Trafalgar;) thus decisively dem-
onstrating the value of fortifications, and the superiority of land batteries to
ships. But with an immense sea-coast line and sparse population, it was im-
possible to hold our seaports against the great naval power of the mother coun-
try, and the war of the Revolution was mainly a contest of land forces. After
the attainment of our independence, the importance of fortifying our harbors
impressed itself on the mind of General Washington, and the political agitations
which grew out of the French Revolution, and which threatened to involve the
new-born Power of the West, prompted early action in this direction. In that
day war, though a science, had not grown into one which makes tributary to it
all other sciences, as it has since done. Fortification, indeed, had reached a
high degree of perfection, but the elaborate treatises on that subject scarcely
touched the subject of harbor defence, so little art was apparently supposed to
be involved in throwing up batteries to defend the entrances of ports. The art
of a Vauban and Cormontaigne was little concerned in the war from which we
had just emerged, and the circumstances were too dissimilar, the theatre too
large and too thinly populated, the armies engaged too small, to afford to the pre-
cepts of a Lloyd or a Templehoff much apparent applicability. While the war
developed generals of unquestionable ability in the spheres in which they acted,
it seemed to be conceded, that for military science, and especially for the art
of fortification, we must look to Europe. Hence we find so many of the early
harbor defences of our principal seaport towns to have been built under the di-
rection of foreign officers who had found employment among us, and who did
not always possess the knowledge of the art to which they laid claim.

The importance of a Military Academy for the training of officers for the mil-
itary service, and especially for the engineers and artillery, had been acknowl-
edged even from the very outset of the struggle for independence. We find
even the Continental Congress appointing a committee ‘to prepare and bring in
a plan of a Military Academy,” and the first Secretary of War, General Knox,
in an official report to the President, discusses the subject at much length. The
establishment of such an institution is known to have been a favorite object of
General Washington, and in his annual message in 1793 he suggests the inqui-
ry, “whether a material feature in the improvement” of the system of military
defence “ ought not to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of
the art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone;” and in 1796 he
states that ‘‘ the desirableness of this institution had constantly increased with
every new view he had taken of the subject.”

An act of Congress of 1794 had provided for a corps of artillerists and engi-
neers, to consist of four battalions, to each of which eight cadets were to be
attached, and made it the duty of the Secretary of War to procure books, instru-
ments and apparatus for the benefit of said corps; and in 1798 Congress author-
ized the raising of an additional regiment, increased the number of cadets to
fifty-six, and empowered the President to appoint four teachers of the arts and
sciences necessary to the efliciency of this “corps.” Of the four teachers,
none were appointed prior to January, 1801, at which time Mr. George Barron
was appointed teacher of mathematics, and the institution, “ which was nothing
more than a mathematical school for the few cadets then in the service,” was
nominally established.

It was soon discovered that the regiment of artillerists and engineers could
not combine with effect the two duties assigned to its members, and a law was
therefore framed separating them into two corps, and declaring that the corps of
engineers should be stationed at West Point, New York, and should constitute
a Military Academy. ‘This act of March 16, 1802, which is the organic law of
the corps of engineers and of the Military Academy, provided for the appoint-
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 141

ment of a certain number of officers and cadets,* (not to exceed twenty in all,)
and declared that “the principal engineer, or, in his absence, the next in rank,
shall have the superintendence of the Military Academy, under the direction of
the President of the United States.”

It is notmy purpose here to follow further the history of that institution; I
have alluded to its initiation as a step taken to provide for an acknowledged
want of the period—an institution for teaching the military sciences to young
men entering the army, and for creating a competent corps of engineers. It
was soon found, however, that the duties of engineer oflicers were inconsistent
with their remaining at West Point, and themselves constituting “‘a Military
Academy.” Most of them were soon called to dutiesalong the seaboard, in con-
structing our fortifications, while, as the wants of the service and of the Acad-
emy have been more clearly seen, the number of cadets has been increased, to
supply not only the engineers and artillery, but officers of all arms of the ser-
vice, and the various professorships and departments of instruction now existing
have been established.

As the duties of the corps became more and more extensive, its chief, though
charged with the administration of its affairs, could not be constantly present at
the Academy, and it ultimately became apparent that the immediate superin-
tendency of such an institution was incompatible with his proper functions. In
1817, an officer selected from the corps (Brevet Major Sylvanus Thayer, to
whom allusion has already been made) was appointed permanent syperintend-
ent of the Academy, and made subject only to the orders of the President of
the United States.

Major (afterwards Colonel) Jonathan Williams, a near relative of Dy. Frank-
lin, whom he accompanied, as secretary, to France, where he studied the mili-
tary sciences, and made himself acquainted with the standard works on fortifi-
cation, was thie first chief engineer of the United States under the law of 1802.
He was an officer of decided merit, much beloved by his subordinates, and is
justly styled the father of the corps of engineers and of the Military Acad-
emy.

While exercising his superintendence of the Academy, he devoted himself
personally to the fortification of New York harbor, and most of the forts which
constitute the inner line of defence of that harbor—Fort Columbus, Castles
Williams and Clinton, (Castle Garden,) and a work similar to the last named,
located two or three miles higher up the river (Fort Gansevoort)—were planned
by him, and built under his immediate supervision,

Castle Williams was the first ““casemated”’ battery erected in this country,
(built in 1807-10,) and was planned after the system of Montalembert, with
which, as we have seen, Colonel Williams had made himself acquainted in
France. This and other works of Colonel Williams, though they have been
superficially and ignorantly criticised, were really meritorious, and do not suffer
> comparison with European structures of the same or even much more recent

ates.
- The indications of an approaching war with England, and the obvious inade-
quacy of existing fortifications, had led to renewed exertions, and prompted the
works just mentioned and others at all our seaports, so that when the war broke
out there was not a town of any magnitude upon the coast not provided with
one or more batteries. But most of the works so thrown up before the subject
had been studied and systematized as a whole were defective in design, smatl,
weak, and, being built, for present economy, of cheap materials and workman-
ship, very perishable. In the main, however, they answered their purpose—
more, perhaps, through an undue respect for them on the part of our foe than

* Besides ten cadets of engineers, forty cadets ‘‘of artillery” were authorized by this
law; making fifty cadets in all.
142 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

through their intrinsic strength. It was not till after the close of the war with
England that a permanent system of coast defence was entered upon by our
government. Indeed, without the experience of that war it is doubtful whether
a measure, always so unpopular and generally so little understood as a national
system of fortifications, could have gained the support of Congress and of the
people. A “board of engineers’ was constituted in 1816, with instructions to
make examinations of the | sea-coast, and to prepare plans for defensive works,
subject to the revision of the chief engineer and the sanction of the Secretary
of War.

Up to this period the Military Academy had maintained a sort of embryo
existence, without definite form or a prescribe d system. The annual term of
study lasted from April to November, all the intermediate months being vaca-
tion. No fixed number of terms was necessary to graduation, nor was it pre-
scribed what should be studied. Some cadets remained but a single term be-
fore being commissioned; others, several years. Although this period pro-
duced oflicers who afterwards became highly distinguished in engineering, (as
well as in other branches of military art,) it is not surprising that the govern-
ment yet entertained the common notion that only in Europe, and especially in
France, could high military science be found ; nor that, in undertaking so vast
and costly a work as the fortification of our sea-coast, distrust should have-been
felt in the unaided abilities of our own engineer officers. A distinguished
French engineer, General Simon Bernard, was invited to this country, ‘and, as
‘assistant’? in the corps of engineers, (an oflice created for the purpose by
Congress,) made a member of the board which, as first constituted, November
16, 1816, consisted of himself as president, Colonel William McRee, and Lieu-
tenant Colonel J.G. Totten. In 1817 Colonel Totten was relieved, and ap-
pears to have been stationed at Rouse’s Point, Lake Champlain, in charge of
fortifications at that place, and the board to have been composed of Brigadier
General J. G. Swift, Chief Engineer, Brigadier General Bernard, and Colonel
McfRee; but Colonel Totten was again made a member in 1819, and (both
General Swift and Colonel McRve having resigned) the permanent board came
to consist of Bernard and Totten alone, and the labor of wor king out the funda-
mental principles of the system, and of elaborating the projects of defence for
the great seapoftts, thus devolved mainly upon these two officers, though naval
officers of rank and experience were e associated with them whenever their exam-
inations included positions for dock-yards, naval depots, or other objects which
concerned the naval service.

Though the advent of a foreign officer, and his assignment to ‘this duty, under
the anomalous designation of “assistant” in the corps of engineers, naturally
caused some feeling, yet it can scarcely be doubted that the influence of the
proceeding was beneficial. If in Swift, McItee, Totten, Thayer, and many
others, were found high engineering abilities and acquirements, it is no less true
that professional association with such a man as Bernard was calculated to stim-
ulate to higher attainments and more zealous exertion. ‘The spirit of emulation
alone would induce our own officers to prove to the country that they were not
inferior to others. To high military and scientific acquirements and great ex-
perience in his professional duties, General Bernard united to the qualities of an
amiable and accomplished gentleman the tact to adapt himself to his peculiar
position without wounding the pride of those with whom he was thus associ-
ated. he prestige of his name aided powerfully in sustaining, with the admin-
istration and with Congress, the measures which the board found nECEESEY to
recommend, and in estab! ishing firmly, as a part of our national policy, the sys-
tem of sea-coast defence by fortifications. In recounting the origin and growth
of the system, it is but just to give that name an honorable mention.

By the board of engineers of which I‘have been speaking a series of reports
was drawnup, which, mostly from the pen of our departed associate, form his

best memorial, and exhibit in a masterly manner the principles of sea-coast and
harbor defence, and their application to our own country. Ina paper of this
kind it will not be out of place to give some idea, at least, of the arguments and
views contained in these documents. An elaborate report of 1826, from which
I quote, gives ageneral réswmé of the principles which have guided the labors
of the board, and of the results arrived at:

“The means of defence for the seaboard of the United States, constituting a
system, may be classed as follows: First, a navy ; second, fortifications ; third,
interior communications by land and water; and fourth, a regular army and
well-organized militia.

« The navy wust be provided with suitable establishments for construction
and repair, stations, harbors of rendezvous, and ports of refuge, all secured by
fortifications defended by regular troops and militia, and supplied with men and
materials by the lines of intereommunication. Being the only species of offen-
sive force compatible with our domestic institutions, it will then be prepared to
act the great part which its early achievements have promised, and to which its
high destiny will lead.

“ Fortifications must close all important harbors against an enemy, and se-
eure them to our military and commercial marine; second, must deprive an
enemy of all strong positions where, protected by naval superiority, he might fix
permanent quarters in our territory, maintain himself during the war, and keep
the whole frontier in perpetual alarm; third, must cover the great cities from
attack; fourth, must prevent as far as practicable the great avenues of interior
navigation from being blockaded at their entrances into the ocean; fifth, must
cover the coastwise and interior navigation by closing the harbors and the sev-
eral inlets from the sea which intersect the lines of communication, and thereby
further aid the navy in protecting the navigation of the country; and sixth,
must protect the great naval establishments.

“ Interior communications will conduct with certainty the necessary supplies
of all sorts to the stations, harbors of refuge, and rendezvous, and the establish-
ments for construction and repair, for the use both of the fortifications and the
navy; will greatly facilitate and expedite the concentration of military force
and the transfer of troops from one point to another; insure to these also unfail-
ing supplies of every description, and will preserve unimpaired the interchange
of domestic commerce even during periods of the most active external warfare.

“ The army and militia, together with the marine, constitute the vital princi-
pleof the system.

“From this sketch it is apparent that our system of defence is composed of
elements whose numerous reciprocal relations with each other and with the
whole constitute its excellence; one element is scarcely more dependent than
the whole system is on any one. Withdraw the navy, and the defence becomes
merely passive; withdraw interior communications from the system, and the
navy must cease in a measure to be active for want of supplies, and the fortifi-
cations can offer but a feeble resistance for want of timely re-enforcements ; with-
draw fortifications, and there only remains a scattered and naked navy.”’

The relation of the navy to fortifications is one of those subjects not always
well appreciated, and hence the cause of mischievous notions and much misrep-
resentation. No pains is spared in these reports to make this subject clearly
understood. After the quotation just given, Colonel Totten remarks:

“It is necessary to observe, in the first place, that the relation of fortifica-
tions to the navy in a defensive system is that of a sheltering, succoring power,
while the relation of the latter to the former is that of an active and powerful
auxiliary ; and that the latter ceases to be efficient as a member of the system
the moment it becomes passive, and should in no case (we allude to the navy

proper) be relied on as a substitute for fortifications. This position may be
easily established.
144 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JCSEPH G. TOTTEN.

“Tf our navy he inferior to that of the enemy, it can afford, of course, unaided
by fortifications, but a feeble resistance, single ships being assailed by whole
fleets; if it be equal, or superior, having numerous points along an extended
frontier to protect, and being unable to concentrate, because ignorant of the
selected point of attack, every point must be simultaneously guarded :. our sep-
arate squadrons may therefore be captured in detail by the concentrated fleet of.
the attacking power. If we attempt to concentrate under an idea that a favorite
object of the enemy is foreseen, he willnot fail topush his forces upon the places
thus left without protection. ‘This mode of defence is liable to the further
objections of being exposed to fatal disasters, although not engaged with an
enemy, and of leaving the issue of conflict often to be determined by accident,
in spite of all the efforts of courage and skill. Ifit were attempted to improve
upon this mode by adding temporary batteries and field works, it would be found
that, besides being weak and inadequate from their nature, the most suitable
positions for these works must often be neglected, under a necessary condition of
the plan, that the ships themselves be defended; otherwise, they must either
take no part in the contest, or be destroyed by the superior adversary.”

It is hardly to be expected that a system affording so much room for discus-
sion, and by its importance inviting it, should, especially in this country, escape
adverse judgment. Military and naval men, congressmen, and even cabinet
officers, have assailed it, called in question the principles on which it is based, or
denied the judiciousness of their application. ‘The forms and sources of assault
have been varied, but there has been really no great difference in the substance,
of which, perhaps, as good an expression as any may be found in these dogmas,
forming the pith of a criticism from no less a source than the Secretary of War,
Mr. Cass, approved by the President, General Jackson:

“1st. That for the defence of the coast, the chief reliance should be on the
navy ;

«2d. That in preference to fortifications, floating batteries should be intro-
duced wherever they can be used ;

«3d. That we are not in danger of large expeditions ; and, consequently,

“4th. That the system of the board of engineers comprises works which are
unnecessarily large for the purposes which they have to fulfil.”

Owing to these strictures, the House of Representatives, by resolutions of
April 9, 1840, called upon the War Department for a report of a full and con-
nected system of national defence. ‘The duty was committed by the Secretary
of War to a board of officers of the army and navy, among whom was Colonel
Totten, and by whom the report. was drawn up. It was entirely approved by
the Secretary of War, Mr. Poinsett, and is universally admitted to be one of the
most able and comprehensive expositions of the whole subject of sea-coast de-
fence extant, and a complete refutation of the objections made to our existing
system. ‘The discussion of the first and principal proposition—that of defence
by the navy—is so interesting and instructive that, though long, I venture to
quote it :

“The opinion that the navy is the true defence of the country is so aceept-
able and popular, and is sustained by such high authority, that it demands a
careful examination.

« Before going into this examination, we will premise that by the term ‘navy’
is here meant, we suppose, line-of-battle ships, frigates, smaller sailing vessels,
and armed steamships, omitting vessels constructed for local uses merely, such
as floating batteries.

“For the purpose of first considering this proposition in its simplest terms,
we will begin by supposing the nation to possess but a single seaport, and that
this is to be defended by a fleet alone.

“ By remaining constantly within this port, our fleet would be certain of meet- —
ing the enemy, should he assail it. But if inferior to the enemy, there would
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 145

be no reason to look for a successful defence; and as there would be no escape
for the defeated vessels, the presence of the fleet, instead of averting the issue,
would only render it the more calamitous.

«Should our fleet be equal to the enemy’s, the defence might be complete,
and it probably would be so. Still, hazard, some of the many mishaps liable to
attend contests of this nature, might decide against us; and in that event, the
consequences would be even more disastrous than on the preceding supposition.
Tn this case the chances of victory to the two parties would be equal, but the con-
sequences very unequal. It might be the enemy’s fate to lose his whole fleet.
but he could lose nothing more; while we in a similar attempt would lose not
only the whole fleet, but also the object that the fleet was designed to protect.

“Tf superior to the enemy, the defence of the port would in all respects be
complete. But instead of making an attack, the enemy would, in such case,
employ himself in cutting up our commerce on the ocean; and nothing could be
done to protect this commerce without leaving the port in a condition to be suc-
cessfully assailed.

“ In either of the above cases the fleet might await the enemy in front of the
harbor, instead of lying within. But no advantage is apparent from such
arrangement, and there would be superadded the risk of being injured by tem-
pests, and thereby being disqualified for the duty of defence, or of being driven
off the coast by gales of wind, thus for a time removing all opposition.

“Tn the same cases also, especially when equal or superior to the enemy, our
fleet, depending on having correct and timely notice as to the position and state
of preparation of the enemy’s forces, might think proper to meet him at the out-
let of his own port, or intercept him on his way, instead of awaiting him within
or off our own harbor. Here it must-be noticed that*the enemy, like ourselves,
is supposed to possess a single harbor only; but, having protected it by other
means, that his navy is disposable for offensive operations. If it were attempted
thus to shut him within his own port, he, in any ease but that of decided infe-
riority, would not hesitate to come out and risk a battle; because, if defeated, he
could retire under shelter of his defences to refit; and if sucegssful, he could
proceed with a small portion of his foree—even a single vessel would sutiice—
to the capture of our port now defenceless, while, with the remainder, he would
follow up his advantage over our defeated vessels, not failing to pursue into
their harbor should they return thither.

« Actual superiority on our part would keep the enemy from volunteering a
battle; but it would be indispensable that the superiority be steadily main-
tained, and that the superior fleet be constantly present. If driven off by tem-
pests, or absent from any other cause, the blockaded fleet would escape, when it
would be necessary for our fleet to fly back to the defence of its own port.
Experience abundantly proves, moreover, that it is in vain to attempt to shut a
hostile squadron in port for any length of time. It seems, then, that whether
we defend by remaining at home, or by shutting the enemy’s fleet within his
own harbor, actual superiority in vessels is indispensable to the security of our
own port.

“With this superiority the defence will be complete, provided our fleet re-
mains within its harbor. But then all the commerce: of the country upon the:
ocean must be left to its fate; and no attempt can be made to react offensively
against the foe, unless we can control the chances of finding the enemy’s fleet:
within his port, and the still more uncertain chance of keeping him there; the
escape of a single vessel being sufficient to cause the loss of our harbor. Let
us next see what will be the state of the question on the supposition of numer:
ous important ports on either side, instead of a single one, relying on our part
still exclusively on a navy.

“Tn order to examine this question, we will suppose our adversary to be for-
tified in all his harbors, and possessed of available naval means, equal to our

Ors
146 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

own. This is certainly a fair supposition ; because what is assumed as regards
his harbors is true of all maritime nations, except the United States ; and as re-
gards naval means, it is elevating our own strength considerably above its pres-
ent measure, and above that it is likely to attain for years.

“ Being thus relatively situated, the first difference that strikes us is, that the
enemy, believing all his ports to be safe without the presence of his vessels, sets
himself at once about making our seas and shores the theatre of operations,
while we are left without choice in the matter; for if he thinks proper to come,
and we are not present, he attains his object without resistance.

“The next, difference is, that while the enemy (saving only the opposition of
Providence) is certain to fall upon the single point, or the many points he may
have seleeted, there will exist no previous indications of his particular choice,
and, consequently, no reason for preparing our defence on one point rather than
another; so that the chances of not being present and ready on his arrival are
directly in proportion to the number of our ports—that isto say, the greater the
number of ports, the greater the number of chances that he will meet no opposi-
tion whatever.

“ Another difference is, that the enemy can choose the mode of warfare as
well as the plan of operations, leaving as little option to us in the one case as in
the other. It will be necessary for us to act, in the first instance, on the suppo-
sition that an assault will be made with his entire fleet; because, should we act
otherwise, his coming in that array would involve both fleet and coast in inev-
itable defeat aud ruin. Being in this state of concentration, then, should the
enemy have any apprehensions about the result of a general engagement, should
he be unwilling to put anything at hazard, or should he, for any other reason,
prefer acting by detachments, he can, on approaching the coast, disperse his
force into small squadrons and single ships, and make simultaneous attacks on
numerous points. ‘These enterprises would be speedily consummated, because,
as the single point occupied by our fleet would be avoided, all the detachments
would be unopposed; and after a few hours devoted to burning shipping, or
public establishments, and taking in spoil, the several expeditions would leave
the coast for some convenient 1endezvous, whence they might return, either in
fleet or in detachments, to visit other portions with the scourge.

“Ts it insisted that our fleet might, notwithstanding, be so arranged as to
mect these enterprises ?

« As it cannot be denied that the enemy may select his point of attack out of
the whole extent of coast, where is the prescience that can indicate the spot ?
And if it cannot be foretold, how is that ubiquity to be imparted that shall
always place our fleet-in the path of the advancing foe? Suppose we attempt
to cover the coast by cruising in front of it, shall we sweep its whole length ?
—a distance scarcely less than that which the enemy must traverse in passing
from his coast to ours. Must the Gulf of Mexico be swept as well as the
Atlantic ; or shall we give up the Guli to the enemy’ Shall we cover the
southern cities, or give them up also? We must unquestionably do one of
two things: either relinquish a great extent of coast, confining our cruisers to a
small portion only, or include so much that the chances of intercepting an enemy
would seem to be out of the question.”

The report then goes on to discuss the uses for defensive purposes of gun-
boats, floating batteries and steam batteries, as distinguished from the navy
proper. Admitting their usefulness, and, even in some cases, their necessity, it
argues with great foree that they are not a substitute for and cannot supersede
fortifications, and it sums up its argument concerning naval defence with the
following broad propositions, to which it challenges opposition :

“Ist. If the sea-coast is to be defended by naval means exclusively, the de-
fensive force at each point deemed worthy of protection must be at least equal
wn power to the attacking force.
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 147

«9d. As from the nature of the case there can be no reason for expecting an
attack on one of these points rather than on another, and no time for transter-
ring our state of preparation from one to another after an attack has been de-
clared, each of them must have assigned to it the requisite means ; and,

“3d. Consequently this system demands a power in the defence as many
times greater than that in the attack as there are points to be covered.

«There has been but one practice among nations as to the defence of ports
and harbors, and that has been a resort to fortifications. All the experience
that history exhibits is on one side only; it is the opposition of forts or other
works, comprehended by the term fortification, to attack by vessels, and al-
though history affords some instances wherein this defence has not availed, we
see that the resort is still the same. No nation omits covering the exposed
points upon her seaboard with fortifications, nor hesitates in confiding in them. ”

The most prominent cases of such successful attacks, viz. Copenhagen, Al-
giers, San Juan de Ulloa, &c., are then described and discussed, to show that
the deductions drawn from them are erroneous, or that they are not cases in
point, or that the disastrous result has been owing to the neglected condition,
imperfect armament, or unskilful and inadequate defence of the forts.

The report, of which I have given some of the main points, may be said to
have silenced opposition to our system of fortifications for the next ten years ;
but, in a form modified by the alleged changes in the condition of the country,
increase of population, construction of railroads, &c., it again found expression
in a resolution of Congress in 1851; and the Secretary of War, to enable him-
self to respond, called upon numerous distinguished army and navy officers for
an expression of their opinions. ‘The following questions were addressed to sev-
eral of the principal engineer officers, among whom the chief of corps, General
Totten:

“1st. How far the invention and extension of railroads have superseded or
diminished the necessity of fortifications on the seaboard ? :

“2d. In what manner and to what extent the navigation of the ocean by
steam, and particularly the application of steam to vessels of war, and recent
improvements in artillery, and other military inventions and discoveries, affect
this question ?

“3d. How far vessels of war, steam batteries, ordinary merchant ships and
steamers, and other temporary expedients, can be relied upon as a substitute
for permanent fortifications for the defence of our seaports ?

“Ath. How far the increase of population on the northern frontier and of the
mercantile marine on the northern lakes obviates or diminishes the necessity of
continuing the system of fortifications on these Jakes ?”

General Totten’s response to these critical interrogations is, as usual with
him when this great subject has to be dealt with, full and exhaustive. The
following pithy paragraphs exhibit his views on the influence of railroads :

‘Suppose a hostile fleet to lie in front of the city of New York—which
nothing would prevent, if the channels of approach were not fortified—in what
way could the 100,000 or 200,000 new men poured into the city and environs
by railroads, although armed with muskets and field-pieces, aid the half-million
of people already there? It seems to me very clear that these additional forees
would, like the population of the city, be utterly powerless in the way of resist-
ance, with any means at their command, and, if resistance were attempted by
the city, would but serve to swell the list of casualties, unless they should at
once retreat beyond the range of fire. If the enemy’s expedition were intended,
according to the second supposed mode of attack, for invasion, or occupation for
some time, of a portion of the country, then in many places this resource of
railroads would be of value, because then the duty of defence would fall upon
the army and militia of the country, and these communications would sweil
their numbers.
148 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN,

“But of all circumstances of danger to the coast, this chance of an attempt
by an enemy to land and march any distance into a populous district is least to
be regarded, whether there be or be not such speedy mode of receiving re-en-
forcements, and our system of fortifications has little to do with any such dan-
ger. In preparing against maritime assaults, the security of the points to be
covered is considered to be greatly augmented whenever the defence can be so
arranged as to oblige an enemy to land at some distance; for the reason that
opportunity is thereby allowed, in the only possible way, for the spirit and
enterprise of the people to come into play. .

‘Instead of being designed to prevent a landing upon any part of the coast,
as Many seem to suppose, and some allege in proof of extravagant views on the
part of the system of defence, the system often leaves this landing as an open
alternative to the enemy, and aims so to cover the really important and dan-
gerous points as to necessitate a distant landing and a march towards the object
through the people. It is because the expedition would easily accomplish its
object without landing, and without allSwing the population to partake in the
defence, that the fortifications are resorted to. For instance, without Fort Del-
aware, or some other fort low down on Delaware bay, an enemy could place
his fleet of steamers in front of Philadelphia by the time his appearance on the
coast had been well announced throughout the city. And in spite of all New
Jersey, Delaware, and lower Pennsylvania, he could levy his contributions, and
burn the navy yard and shipping, and be away, ina few hours. But being
obliged, by the fort above mentioned, to land full forty miles below the city,
the resistance to his march may be safely left to the courage and patriotism that
will find ample time to array themselves in opposition. ”

Concerning the application of steam to vessels of war he says:

“The application of steam to vessels of war acts upon the question of sea-
coast defence both beneficially and injuriously. It acts injuriously in several
ways; but chiefly, first, by the suddenness and surprise with which vessels may
fall upon their object, and pass from one object to another, in spite of distance,
climate, and season; and, secondly, by their ability to navigate shallow waters.

“The first property, by which squadrons may run into our harbors, out-
stripping all warnings of their approach, affords no chance for impromptu prepa-
rations; accordingly, whatever our preparations are to be, they should precede
the war. If seems past all belief that a nation having in commission—as
France and England always have—a large number of war-steamers, ready for
distant servicein twenty-four hours, receiving their orders by telegraph, capable
of uniting in squadrons, andin two or three days at most speeding on their sev-
eral paths to fall upon undefended ports—it is not to be expected, I say, that
they should delay such enterprises until temporary resorts could be got ready
to receive them. And yet there are those who insist that we should leave
defensive measures to a state of war—that we should let the day supply the
need!

‘«Tnadequate as all such measures must prove, there would not be time to
arrange even these. By the second property, due to their light draught of water,
these vessels will oblige the defence to be extended in some form to passages
or channels or shoals that were before adequately guarded by their shallowness.
The bars at the mouth of the Mississippi formerly excluded all but small ves-
sels-of-war, and the strong current of the river made the ascent of sailing ves-
sels exceedingly uncertain and tedious. Now these bars and currents are imped-
iments no longer; and all the armed steamers of Great Britain and France
might be formed in array in face of the city of New Orleans before a rumor ot
their approach had been heard.

«Had the English expedition of 1814, attended by a squadron of armed
steamers, arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi, a few transports might have
been taken in tow, and in a few hours the whole army would have been before
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 149

the city. Or twelve or fifteen such steamers could have carried the whole army
up in half a day, without the delay of transports. Will it be contended that
the attack in that form would have been repulsed with the means then in Gen-
eral Jackson’s hands? Would the landing, or even the presence on board these
steamships, of the British troops have been necessary to burn the city or put it
under contribution? Is there anything now, but the existence of forts on the
river, to prevent the success of such an attack by fifteen or twenty steamers of
war, allured there by the vastly increased magnitude of the spoil? ”’*

While the enemy’s means of attack are thus enhanced by the use of war
steamers, General ‘lotten contends that they cannot be relied upon, as a substi-
tute for fortifications, for defence.

“T do not assert,”’ he says, ‘ that armed vessels would not be useful in coast
_defenee. Such an idea would be absurd. I shall even have occasion to show
a necessity for this kind of force, in certain exceptional cases. It is the general
proposition, viz., that armed vessels, and not fortifications, are the proper defences
for our vulnerable points—a proposition the more dangerous, because seem-
ingly in such accordance with the well-tried prowess and heroic achievements
of the navy, that we have now to controvert.

“Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans
are, we will suppose, to be guarded, not by forts, but by these vessels, on the
occurrence of a war with a nation possessing large naval means. We know
that it is no effort for such nations to despatch a fleet of twenty line-of-battle
ships and frigates, or an equal number of war steamers, or even the combined
mass—both fleets in one.

* * % * * * x. *

“What, then, shall we do at the above-named ports severally? Each is
_ justly felt to be an object worthy of an enemy’s efforts, and each would be cul-
pable in sending elsewhere any part of the force required for its own defence.
Each, therefore, maintains a naval force equal, at least, to that the enemy is
judged to be able to send promptly against it. Omitting any provision for
other places scarcely less important, what is the result? It is, that we main-
tain within the harbors of, or at the entrance to, these places, chained down to
this passive defence, a force at least six times as large as that of the enemy.

“ He does not hesitate to leave his port, because it will be protected in his
absence by its fortifications, which also afford him a sure refuge on his return.
He sails about the ocean, depredating upon our commerce with his privateers
and small cruisers, putting our small places to ransom, and in other ways fol-
lowing up appropriate duties; all which is accomplished without risk, be-
cause our fleet, although of enormous magnitude, must cling to ports which
have no other defence than ‘that afforded by their presence. ‘Vhey cannot com-
bine against him singly, for they cannot know where he is; and must not,
moreover, abandon the object which they were expressly provided to guard.

“Tt would really seem that there could not be a more impolitic, inethcient,
and dangerous system, as there could not certainly be a more expensive one.”

I have thus extensively quoted from the reports of General Totten, because
they are themselves the best expressions of the life labors and services of the
subject of our memoir, and because I think they treat of matters which should
be, in an eminent degree, interesting to the members of this National Academy,
and which, moreover, should demand its attention. :

To preserve the continuity of my subject, I have followed these reports down
toa late date. It is necessary now to revert to an earlier period. It has

* The experience of the rebellion has proved the truth of General Totten’s words. The
moment the forts were passed, the city of New Orleans was, notwithstanding the land forees
under Lovell, at Commodore Farragut’s mercy. I have alluded elsewhere to the failure of
the forts.
150 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

already been observed that, as soon as the original board of engineers had
sufficiently matured the general system of defence, and completed plans for the
works first required, its members applied themselves to the duty of construe-
tion. In 1828 General (then Colonel) Totten took charge of the construction
of Fort Adams, Newport harbor, and continued on this duty, making his resi-
dence in the town of Newport, until December, 1838, the date of his appoint-
ment as chief of the corps of engineers. ‘This work, the second in magnitude
of the fortifications of the United States, is one of the best monuments of his
genius as a military engineer. From its peculiar relations to the land defence,
it called for the application of most of those rules of the art and many of those
special arrangements which form the themes of treatises upon “ fortification,”
and which, generally, have but a very limited application to works of harbor
defence. In these respects it has no parallel with us; and in the treatment of
the case and happy adaptation of means to the end, Colonel Totten exhibited a
mastery of all the details of the art, which proves his technical skill and minute
knowledge to be fully equal to the power of broad generalization I have already
endeavored to illustrate. But Colonel Totten found here yet another field for
professional usefulness—another track to explore. The art of the civil engi-
neer (I use the phrase in its application to mere construction, whether it be of a
military or civil work) was yet in its infancy in this country. Our resources
in building materials were almost unknown, their qualities and adaptabilities to
different purposes of construction undeveloped. ‘Thus far the matter had ex-
cited little attention; the building material, whether brick or stone, lime or tim-
ber, nearest at hand was indiscriminately used, and its aggregation left much to
the skill of the mechanie. In commencing constructions on so great a scale, it
was of the first importance that the work should be both durable and econom-
ical—a result only to be attained by the most careful selection of materials, and
the most skilful manipulation. Besides, our forts called for arrangements
unknown in other branches of building—arrangements for which the execution
and the most suitable materials had to be studied out ab initio, since on many of
these points there were neither experience nor extant rules to guide.

In the years 1830 and 1831 a series of experiments was instituted by Colo-
nel Totten at Fort Adams, on the expansion and contraction of building stone
by natural changes of temperature, and the effects of these variations on the
cements employed to secure the joints of stone copings. An account of them
was prepared under his direction by Lieutenant (now Professor) W. H. C. Bart-
lett, a member of this Academy, and published in the American Journal of
Science for July, 1832. The methods employed were at once simple and inge-
nious, and the result was such as to leave no doubt that in this climate the
joints of copings formed of stone of four or five feet in length will always be
insecure, no matter what description of cement may be employed to close them.

This result is one of great practical importance. Previously to the experimen-
tal examination of the subject by Colonel 'Votten, the walls of our most expen-
sive works of masonry were protected by copings cemented at their joints; and
while the failure of the cement was constantly noticed, the cause of the failure
was not understood. The experiments showed that the changes of longitudinal
dimensions of granite coping-stones, five feet only in length, under the extreme
temperatures to which they were exposed at Newport, would be sufficient to pul-
verize the hardest cement between them, or to leave cracks in it thicker than com-
mon pasteboard. With marble as a material, these destructive effects are con-
siderably increased, and with sandstone, nearly doubled.

About the same time Colonel Totten caused some experiments to be made to
ascertain the relative stiffness and strength of the following kinds of timber,
viz: White pine, (Pinus strobus,) Spruce, (Abies nigra,) ‘and southern pine,
(Pinus australus ), also called long-leaved pine’
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 151

These experiments, made by his assistant, Lieutenant T. 8. Brown, of the
corps of engineers, were published in the American Journal of Science and
Art, and afterwards, having been revised by the author, in the Journal of the
Franklin Institute, a note being added, the calculations extended, and practical
inferences drawn therefrom. ‘This memoir and additions are found iu vol. vii,
new series, Journal of the Franklin Institute, 1831. Lieutenant Brown’s account
concludes with the following remarks :

“Jn Tredgold’s Carpentry, and other similar works, may be found the con-
stant numbers (a) and (c) for nearly all the kinds of wood useful in the arts ;
but besides that the numbers are in many instances calculated from insufficient
experiments, most of the specimens used in the trials were of Kuropean growth,
and of course the results obtained are inapplicable to American timber, though
bearing the same name. It is much to be desired that numerous and accurate
experiments be made in this country by those having the requisite zeal and
opportunities ; our architects will then know with certainty the qualities of the
different kinds of woods they are using, and instead of working at hazard and
in the dark, as they now too often do, they will be guided by the sure light of
practical science to certain and definite results. If these experiments contrib-
ute ever so little to the attainment of so important a result, the object of their
publication will be fully accomplished. ”

A subject of such vital importance in the art of construction as the composi-
tion of mortars could not fail to invite, or rather compel, the researches of Colo-
nel Totien. No species of masonry is subject to such severe deteriorating influ-
ences as the walls and arches of fortifications, especially in our climate; so
severe, indeed, that they almost drive the engineer to despair. Next only to
the importance of having the building stones or bricks of a suitable character, is
that of uniting them by a strong and durable mortar. Few persons whose
attention has not been called to the subject conceive its magnitude, the
variety of materials it embraces, and the laborious investigations to which it
has given rise. Colonel Totten commenced his researches at an early date,
and continued them actively during the whole period of his connexion with Fort
Adams.

His work on “ Hydraulic and Common Mortars”? was publisned in 1838 by
the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. It contains, besides original experi-
ments and observations on mortars, hydraulic cements and concretes, trausla-
tions of essays by ‘T'reussart, Pitot, and Courtois, the best French writers on
the same subject, and constitutes to this day an authority relied on by Amer-
ican engineers. Colonel Totten’s experiments extend over the period from 1825
to 1838; they are especially valuable for the variety of limes and cements, and
the tests of different modes of slacking the lime, mixing the mortars, and pre-
paring the cements and coneretes. ‘Ihe mortars were tested, after periods ran-
ging trom five months to four years and five months, for tenacity, by the force
required to separate two bricks joined together by means of them, and for hard-
ness by the weight which they would support, applied over a small circular
area. ‘The experiments on concretes or factitious stones are equally compre-
hensive, being directed to the composition and consistency of the cement, whether
best used as a stiff mortar or a semi-fluid grout; to the effect of additions of
common lime and sand or rounded pebbles and gravel, and to ascertaining the
proportion of each that would be used to the best advantage. ‘The results de-
veloped by these investigations are of the greatest value, and having been ap-
plied in the construction of the fort, have now had the test of many year’s ex-
perience.

It would be almost impossible to enumerate the various objects of Colonel
Totten’s researches while at Newport. ‘here is scarce a subject connected
with the art or science of the engineer, civil or military, which did not engage
152 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

his attention, and of which he has not left some record. The thickness of sus-
taining walls, the thrust of arches, among the more important, and the composi-
tion of stuccoes, of paints, lackers, washes for stone or brick work, among the
less so, may here be mentioned.

Perhaps no period of his life is so interesting and so affectionately remem-
bered by his professional associates. Indeed, a large proportion of the young
officers of the corps of those days passed a portion of their time under his com-
mand, and acquired their first professional experience in the performance of
duties under his eye and direction. ‘The disposition to cultivate science, phys-
ical and natural, led him to original researches, while his influence stimulated
and led to improvement the educated young men who from time to time came
into his military family. Fond of exercise, bodily and mental, he sought in
natural history, as in geology, mineralogy, and conchology, objects for the
long walks and drives conducive to health, while the arrangement of the speci-
mens, their care and classification, and the study of the babits of the animals
which occupied the shells, gave scope to his wonderful powers of observation.
Instead of finding his young officers a trouble, he was fond of their companion-
ship, suggesting modes and objects of experiment, and encouraging them to do
so likewise, thus cultivating originality of thought. His laboratory was at
their service, and his companionship and example at their disposal. After a
day’s labor he retired to this laboratory, glad to have with him such of the young
companions of the day as desired to join him. ‘The honored president of this
Academy can recollect, year after year, the computations, under Colonel Totten’s
direction, of the thickness of revetments, the analysis of minerals collected in
the field, classifications of shells gathered in days’ walks on the seashore, dis-
cussions of the curious structure of geological specimens in the neighborhood of
Newport, and of the curious mineralogical specimens of the upper portion of
Rhode Island, which he encouraged them to find. So upon the fort itself, the
various researches which I have described were marked out for successive ex-
perimenting, with a generosity to his assistants which almost persuaded them
that they were original with them. 'The determination of the measures used in
laying out the fort, and the.practical apparatus employed in the measurements,
received his careful study. ‘The practical character of these works impressed
themselves upon the minds of the young officers, and furnished the fitting com-
plement to the theoretical training received at West Point.

Not least pleasant among the memories of this period of Colonel Totten’s life,
to those who had the good fortune to be associated with him, is the recollection
of the social enjoyments of his house. Married in 1816 to Catlyna Pearson, of
Albany, he was surrounded by a young family, among whom his happiest
moments were spent, and to whom he was everything that such a relation can
imply. None could be happier in his social intercourse. Genial and eminently
hospitable, he cultivated as a duty those smaller amenities of society by which
the cares of life are lightened and its joys augmented. His house was the
home of his friends, and was seldom without some one of them. ‘Though dig-
nified and courteously reserved in his intercourse with the external world, few
more highly enjoyed real humor, or could with more true bonhommie give them-
selves up to the gayety of the moment. In his relations to his young officers he
was kind and affable, encouraging freedom of expression, and inviting inquiry
in everything that related to professional matters, while there was always that
in his manner which inspired the most profound respect and forbade undue lev-
ity of conduct in his presence.

Before quitting the scene of so important a portion of Colonel Totten’s official
labors, it is proper to remark that, in addition to the duties of his particular
charge, he, as a member and for the last six years president of the board of
engineers, was engaged in the planning of the new works for which Congress
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 153

from time to time made the necessary appropriations.* ‘To this duty he usually
devoted the winter months, during which all construction on Fort Adams was
suspended. In the execution of his designs he was usually assisted by young
officers of the corps, who found therein a practical application of the theoretical
knowledge acquired at West Point instructive and useful.

The works of harbor improvement on the seaboard and on the lakes were
likewise under ‘the control and direction of the Engineer Bureau ; and Colonel
Tutten, though not directly engaged therein, was not infrequently called on to
inspect and advise concerning them. Most of these, and especially those of the
lake shores, afforded curious and interesting problems in this branch of civil
engineering, and his reports and notes on these subjects, yet extant, are addi-
tional proofs of the wide range of his professional knowledge and of his powers
of accurate observation and of skilful deduction from the phenomena of na-
ture.

Colonel Totten was appointed colonel of the corps of engineers and Chief
Engineer December 7, 1838. At this time the construction of Fort Adams
was so far advanced towards completion as to nee@ no longer his personal super-
vision, and the city of Washington became thenceforth his home and the seat of
his official duties. Identified, as we have seen, with the origin and growth of
the great system of sea-coast defence of the United States, it was eminently
proper that he should become the head of that bureau of the War Department
to which its execution was committed, and no one could be more eminently fitted
for that important station.

At the date of his appointment the system of coast defence had been for about
twenty years in progress of construction, and during that period most of those
ports and harbors of the United States deemed most important to ourselves or
most assailable by a naval foe had been, at least, partially fortified. At many
such points, indeed, no new work had been as yet constructed, owing to the
existence of forts ot batteries more or less adequate built before or during the
war of 1812. ‘These works, where possible, were absorbed into the new sys-
tem with some repairs and alterations. Among such points may be mentioned
the harbors of Portland, Portsmouth,- New London, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
and Charleston. New and powerful works had, however, been built or far
advanced to completion, for the defence of Boston, Newport, New York, Hamp-
ton Roads, the Savannah river, Pensacola, Mobile, and New Orleans. But
the strictures on the system, to which we have before made reference, proceed-
ing from such an authority as the Secretary of War and sanctioned by the
President, had not failed to shake the confidence of Congress and of the people.
For several years the annual appropriations had been wholly denied or made
so inadequately that the work had languished and at some points had been
wholly suspended. But however much opposition may grow up in time of pro-
found peace, no sooner is there a probability of seeing a foe at our doors than
- all eyes are turned to these protecting works, and the most urgent demands are
made that our seaport towns shall be speedily put “in a state of defence.”’
Such an impulse was given by the Maine boundary and McLeod questions,
soon after the advent of Colonel Totten to the Chief Engineership. In fulfill-
ing the urgent duty which thus devolved upon him, he did not content himself
with the mere issuing of orders from his office at, Washington. He made it his
business to inspect personally the works, and in less than two years, besides

* By the Regulations, the local engineer officer, upon whom the construction of the pro-
posed work was to devolve, was ex officio a member of the board. This brought together
during the winter months engineer officers from various parts of the country—from the
shores of the Gulf,'from the seaboard of North and South Carolina and Georgia, as well as
from nearer points, and added not a little to the charm of the professional and social life of
the young engineer officers at Newport.
154 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

the enormous office labor he found necessary to attend to on the first assump-
tion of charge of the bureau, he had visited every fort and battery on the sea-
coast of the United States. His inspections were not superficial and hasty ;
they were most thorough and searching. His investigations embraced, at the
same time, the general scope and purpose of the work, its adaptability to its
great objects, and the minntest detail in its construction. It was now that
the country derived the full benefit of his indefatigable researches while at
Newport

I have already alluded to the lack of knowledge and experience in this coun-
try of the art of construction, especially in its applications to the peculiarities of
fortification. ‘To supply this lack was a great end of Colonel Totten’s labors
at Fort Adams. At few other points did the locality or circumstances of the
construction render practicable such researches. This remark will apply par-
ticularly to the works on the Gulf of Mexico. 'The regions’ bordering the Gulf
were, at the close of the war of 1812, but recent acquisitions to the territory of
the United States. Sparsely populated and isulated from the rest of the Union
as (before the application of gteam to the navigation of the Mississippi) they
were, they would be defended, if defended at. all, only by the aid of fortifica-
tions. ‘Vhe fact that New Orleans had been almost wrenched from our grasp,
and the impression then everywhere felt that if it had been captured it would
not have been relinquished, stimulated the government to secure the possession
of this important place and of other strategic points on the Gulf by immediate
fortification. Accordingly, designs for works—mostly prepared by General
Bernard—-were among the first labors of the board of engineers, and the forts
on the river and lake approaches to New Orleans, at the entrances to Mobile
bay and Pensacola harbor, were almost simultaneously commenced. Around
New Orleans especially the engineers had to contend with formidable difficul-
ties. ‘The deadly climate, the treacherous soil, on which no art could build a
structure so massive as a fortification that should not sink one or more feet,
warping and dislocating the walls and arches, the difficulties of procuring the
services of mechanics and laborers, the want of building materials, &e., all com-
bined to make construction exceedingly difficult, to forbid any of its niceties, and -
to hinder all research or experiment. Some of these works had been entirely
finished at the period we have arrived at, others nearly so, and left to “ settle”
before the weight of the earthen parapets was added.

Considering all these unfavorable circumstances, these works had been built
in a manner creditable to the energy and skill of the engineers; but a few
years’ neglect, aided by a damp and tropical climate, had given many of them
an appearance which, to the superficial observer, promised anything but effi-
ciency. Indeed, it was a popular belief in New Orleans at this time that Fort
Jackson, on the Mississippi, had sunk so much that its guns could not be brought
to bear on the river—a belief doubtless due to the unnecessarily highness of the
levees by which it had been surrounded to protect its site from inundation, and
to the rapid growth of vegetation on and about the fort. Such was the condi-
tion of this work when Colonel Totten first visited it in 1841, and the author
of this paper, who had but recently taken charge of it, has yet a vivid recollec-
tion of the thorough inspections of this and other works, the tedious voyages in
open boats through the intricate “bayou” navigation about New Orleans, in
company with his chief, as well as the copious and most minute instruations
which he received. Destitute of American experience on such points, the
designer had followed European precedents, or the constructing engineer had
been left to his own devices as to much that relates to the interior arrangements.
The wood-work of magazines, inadequately ventilated, had rotted and fallen in
ruins; the covering of the bomb-proof casemates, imperfectly understood, had
failed to exclude water, which percolated through the piers and arches, or
gathered in muddy pools on the floors. ‘The work to be done to bring the forts

*
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 155

to speedy efficiency was vast; embrasures and floors of casemates were to be
raised to compensate the settlement the work had undergone; earth to be
removed from the arches,in order to repair or renew the roofing; magazines
and quarters to be refitted, and all this before a gun could be mounted in a
proper manner. On all these points Colonel Totten was rich in the experience
of his long researches, and ready at once to give the proper directions. Follow-
ing his detailed instructions, the works speedily reached such a condition of
efficiency as to permit the mounting and service of their guns.*

What the writer here relates from his own experience at New Orleans serves
but to illustrate the indefatigable labors and personal agency of Colonel Totten
at this period, along the whole seaboard of the United States, in bringing all
its ports and harbors into a defensible condition. Nor should I confine these
attributes to any particular period. During the whole time of his chief engi-
neership he continued the same laborious supervision. Generally once in about
every two years he inspected every fort of the United States, and scareely
was the local engineer officer more thoroughly familiar with each detail of his
own particular works than was the Chief Engineer with those of all under charge
of the Engineer bureau. Besides attending to the routine duties of his office at
Washington, he found time to design plans for new works, as well as for altera-
tions or enlargement of old ones. An admirable draughtsman, executing his
work with a delicacy and finish that defied competition on the part of his sub-
ordinates, he would be usually found, if visited at his office, engaged at
his drawing-table. - Indeed, if he had a fault as Chief Engineer, it was the
habit of doing everything himself. It was contemplated by the Regulations
lations that all plans of fortifications should be made by a board of engineers,
and General Totten, in one of his reports, alludes to the fact that this has
not always been the case, in these words: “In rare cases it has happened that
plans have been made under the particular direction of the Chief Engineer, owing
to the difficulty, at moments, of drawing the widely dispersed members of the
board from their individual trusts.” It may be said, too, in justice to him, that
when he assumed controi of the bureau, it was almost indispensable to take
much upon himself, in the direction of the repairs and prosecution of many of
the works, owing to the great pressure thrown upon the corps by the circum-
stances of the period, aud the want of a sufficient number of experienced
officers.

The excitement produced by the anticipation of war with England was fol-
lowed by an actual war with a weak neighbor, a war inaugurated by the same
influences which, in a more potent form, produced the rebellion, or rather of
which the rebellion was but the legitimate and natural sequel. Called on by
General Scott, who reposed in his professional skill the most unbounded confi-
dence, Colonel Totten assumed, in 1847, the immediate control of the engineer-
ing operations of the army destined to invade the Mexican capital, directing in
this capacity the siege of Vera Cruz. For his successful services he was
breveted a brigadier general, March 29, 1847, “for gallant and meritorious
conduct at the siege of Vera Cruz.” Having thus successfully accomplished
the special task for which he had been selected, he left the army and resumed
his station at Washington.

In addition to the onerous duties of his office, involving, besides the labors
described, the inspectorship and supervision of the Military Academy, his
position and high reputation subjected him to calls for incidental labors by the
goverument, by the States, or by municipal bodies. A few months prior to his

156 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

appointment as Chief Engineer, 1838, he was, at the invitation of the Secretary
of the Navy, ordered to visit the navy yard at Pensacola, and to prepare plans
for dry-docks, wharves, sea-walls, and other improvements. Save a wretched
failure in the shape of a wharf, the place—a navy yard ia name—had been, up
to this period, destitute of everything that characterizes such an establishment,
except an imposing row of officers’ quarters, and some few storehouses. A
board of naval officers had been convened two years previously to consider the
wants of the yard, and had recommended an extensive system of improvements,
involving, among other things, no less than four dry-docks. Such constructions,
reaching thirty or more fect below the level of low water in the loose sand of
the bay shores, were difficult, demanding all the resources of the engineer, and
it was on account of General Totten’s eminent abilities and high authority in
such matters that the Navy Department had recourse to his services. He made
areport on the manner of construction, with plans which, if I mistake not, have
been a guide in the subsequent operations. Unfortunately, to this day no per-
manent dry-dock exists, a floating wooden one having, through some influence,
been substituted, at enormous expense, for the intended masonry structure.*

The legislature of the State of New York having, March 30, 1855, passed
“An act for the appointment of a commission for the preservation of the harbor
of New York from encroachments, and to prevent obstructions to the necessary
navigation thereof,” the commission so appointed invited and obtained the co-
operation, as an “advisory council,” of General ‘Totten, Professor Bache, and
Commander Davis, United States navy. The nature of the services thus ren-
dered is best understood by reference to the reports of the commissioners them-
selves:

“The distinguished reputation of General Totten, Professor Bache, and
Commander Davis for scientific attainments, their diversified experience in the
construction of hydraulic works, and long observation of the influence of tidal
currents in the formation and removal of shoals, indicated them as the best
qualified to assist the commissioners in the discharge of their duties, while their
high personal character precluded the possibility of their advice being affected
by other than the single purpose of arriving at a just decision on the questions
submitted to them.” And again, after a particular allusion to the services of
Professor Bache: ‘It is the gratifying duty of the commissioners to present to
the notice of the legislature the important services which have been gratuitously
rendered to the State by General Joseph G. Totten, chief engineer of the
United States army, and Commander Charles H. Davis, of the United States
navy, who, with Professor Bache, formed the advisory council of the commis-
sioners. Animated by the single desire of preserving the port of New York
in all its usefulness, they brought to the consideration of the subjects referred
to them the diversified experience of many years spent in the examination and
improvement of harbors. ‘The several reports they have made on the exterior
lines, on the improvement of Hell Gate, and on the preservation of Gowanus
bay, are profound dissertations on the forees and actions of currents, and, while
they evince, in some degree, the extent of the labors of those gentlemen, they
demonstrate how just is the public estimate of their scientific attainments.”

Following the example of New York, Massachusetts soon organized a similar
commission for the port and harbor of Boston, on which the same gentlemen
were invited to serve, receiving similar testimonials of the high ‘value of their
services.

* The ‘‘ questionable shape’ and suspicious object of this novel craft, set afloat and towed
out into the bay by the rebels in 1861, caused anxious surmises on the part of Colonel Brown
and the gallant garrison of Fort Pickens, reminding us of the famous ‘‘ Battle of the Kegs”
of the Revolution. The probable object was to sink it in the channel to prevent the entrance
of our gunboats. But Colonel Brown’s interference prevented the accomplishment of the
design. It was abandoned by the rebels, and set fire to by Colonel Brown’s orders.
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 157

Of the many scientific men of the country who were associated with him in
such duties, (of whom most usually was our eminent president, ) none exhibited
greater zeal and assiduity, few took a more prominent and useful part. The
resolutions of the Light-house Board, on the occasion of his decease, which are
appended to this memoir, would be, with slight modifications, applicable ia
reference to all his connexions of a similar nature. Inflexible in his integrity,
uncompromising in his notions of duty, and watchful to the highest degree for
all the interests of the government in all that concerned his charge, it is not
strange that the shameless Floyd soon found him an obstacle to his peculiar
operations. He was virtually banished from his office, or at least relieved from
its duties, which he did not resume until Floyd left the War Department. He
took this opportunity—perhaps the very first and only release during his life-
time from the unceasing demand of duty—to visit Hurope in company with
Mrs. Totten, travelling through France, Italy, Germany, and England. n-
dued with those keen perceptions and that harmonious adjustment of faculties
which render the mind susceptible to the beautiful, whether in nature or art, he
was, in the true sense of the term, an artist. For music, for painting, for
sculpture, he had a high relish and a most accurate and discriminating judgment.

By such a one the treasures of art and antiquity of Europe can only be
adequately appreciated and enjoyed, as we know they were appreciated and
enjoyed by General Totten. He did not fail, however, to take the opportunity
to examine, as far as he was able, the fortifications of Europe, of the character
and peculiarities of which, however, he had little to learn. On his return he
was sent by Floyd to the Pacific coast, with directions to inspect the fortifica-
tions in construction, avd to report on the defensive requirements of that
region. This duty and the report thereon he executed in his usual thorough
and exhaustive manner. It furnished him with the opportunity to acquire the
same personal knowledge of all that concerned the seaboard defence of our
newly acquired territories on the Pacifie which he already possessed, beyond
any other man, in reference to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

In the year 1851 General Totten inaugurated, and continued through the years
1852, 1853, 1854, and 1855, a series of experiments at West Point ‘on the
effects of firing with heavy ordnance from casemate embrasures,” and also ‘on
the effects of firing against the same embrasures with various kinds of missiles.”
It will be interesting and conducive to a better understanding of the objects and
results of these experiments to say a few words as to the origin and meaning of
the term “casemate,” and to give an account of General Totten’s previous
labors in connexion with the ‘‘casemate embrasure.’”’ he word is from the
Spanish casa-mata, (a compound, most likely, of casa, house, and matar, to
kill; though it is said also to mean a low or hidden house; but the etymology
is not settled,) and seems to have been used to signify a countermine as well as
a concealed place, arranged in connexion with a fortification, for containing and
using a piece of artillery. According to Bardin* it appears to have been applied
to the double or triple tier of uncovered gun platforms used by the early Italian
and German engineers for flanking the ditch, as well as to vaulted galleries along
the searp wall. ‘lhe term finally came to mean, in fortification, any vaulted
room under the earthwork of the rampart or glacis, whether intended for service
of guns, orfor quarters of troops, or for containing stores. A gun casemate is
such a vault abutting against the scarp or countersearp wall through which an
“embrasure” is pierced to permit the discharge of the gun; and in the naval
service the term has been adopted to signify the part of an iron-clad vessel con-
taining the guns, and which is, for that reason, especially protected by the iron
plating. Hence the essential notion of the word seems to involve one or more of
the attributes of concealment, shelter, and destructive purpose.

* Dictionnaire de l’Armée de Terre, &c.
158 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

The use of the casemate, in some of its forms, for flanking purposes goes back
to Albert Durer and San Micheli, in the early part of the sixteenth century, and
it was resorted to by Vauban in his second and third systems, of which the
tower-bastions are casemated throughout. But it was reserved for the Marquis
de Montalembert, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, to give it an
extraordinary development, and to make the casemate the essential element of
a system of fortification. ‘This “most intrepid of authors upon fortification ”
(as he is styled by Chasseloup) boldly attempted to apply to his art the same
principles by which Napoleon won his victories—the concentration of superior
forces upon the decisive poiats, In his projects we find, upon all parts where
there must be a decisive contest of artillery, an extraordinary concentration of
guns, amounting in some cases to ten times those of the attacking batteries, the
construction of which it is intended to prevent, or which shall be promptly over-
powered, if constructed. This concentration he effected, and could only effect,
by the use of casemates, upon which, numerous and well constructed, he bases
all the strength of his fortifications.

No author on this art has displayed greater genius or a greater affluence of
resources, and no author has given occasion for so much acrimonious discussion.
Rejected by the French, the principles of Montalembert have been made the
basis of the modern German, or “ Polygonal,” system.

For sea-coast fortification the casemates of Montalembert had a singular
applicability, aud he has the merit. at least, of being the first writer who has
seen in this branch of the art a subject of particular treatment, and who had given
special designs for forts and batteries ‘for the defence of ports.”

In no warlike structure was there so great a concentration of artillery as in a
ship-of-war, such as it was fifty oreventwenty years ago. And as there is no
limit to the number of ships which may be brought to bear upon a shore battery
save that of the range of artillery and the area of navigable water, it is easy to
see to what overwhelming hostile fire such a work may be subjected. On the
other hand, it frequently happens that the site otherwise most advantageous for
a battery is low and contracted, rendering any accumulation of guns impractica-
ble, if mounted on an ordinary rampart, and exposing the unprotected gunners
to the fire of the sharpshooters with which the enemy’s topmasts are filled.*

{t is no small merit of Montalembert to have devised a method of mounting
guns which should meet this case. Notwithstanding that the French corps of »
engineers rejected the system in its intended application, and disclaimed, as an
engineer, its author, it nevertheless constructed, in 1786, for the defence of the
roadstead and harbor of Cherbourg, forts which are in reality almost copied from
his designs.t Ifollowing the exampie of the French, other European nations
have adopted, for the defence of their seaports, works of the same character, of
which the forts of Cronstadt and Sebastopol, once made familiar to us, in their
outward appearance, by the pictorials, are recent specimens; and, as we have
already seen, Colonel Williams introduced them into our country in 1807, by
the construction of Castles Williams and Clinton, and Fort Gansevoort, New
York harbor.

An objection urged against casemates, and a grave one, since it is aimed at
one of their most important attributes, is that the embrasures of masonry are
dangerous to the gunners, from their outward flaring surfaces reflecting into the
interior the enemy’s missiles. Montalembert was well aware of this objection,
calling the embrasure, in its ordinary form, a “murderous funnel,” (entonnoir

* The topmasts of many of the vessels of Commodore Farragut’s fleet in the attack on Forts
Jackson and St. Philip contained boat-howitzers, destined to fire canister at the gunners of
the low batteries of those works.

t The celebrated Cainot, then an officer of French engineers, but who adopted the views
of Montalembert, writes to him: ‘‘ You have wrung from your adversaries the admission
that well-constructed casemates are a good thing,” &c. (Zastrow, Histoire dela Fortification: )
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 159

meurtriére,) and his sagacity aid not fail to prescribe the best remedy by rules
intended to reduce to a minimum the external opening. He directed that the
throat should be no larger than necessary to receive the muzzle of the gun and
to endure the shock of its discharge; that it should not be more than two feet
from the exterior surface of the wall; that the cheeks should be parallel to the
sides of the sector of fire; and to render practicable these arrangements he
invented the ‘affut @ arguille,” (carriage with tongue,) which has served as the
type of nearly all subsequent casemate gun-carriages. It is strange that, even
while adopting the plans of Montalembert, European engineers should have
almost wholly overlooked these maxims, and that it was reserved for our own
illustrious engineer to make their application, and, in perfecting the casemate
and the embrasure, to become a co-worker with Montalembert, by bringing the
easemated water-battery to its highest degree of perfection.

I now revert to General Votten’s labors in this connexion, and in reference
thereto I quote from his report to the Secretary of War:

«The first casemated battery was completed in 1808. It has two tiers of guns
in casemates and one in barbette. he exterior openings of the lower embrasures
are 4’ 8” by 6 feet, giving an area of 28 square feet; and of the second tier 3/
8” by 5 feet. area 184 square feet; the horizontal traverse of the guns being
limited to 44 degrees.

«Within three or four years of the time just mentioned two other casemated
batteries were built, each having a single tier of guns in casemates, with exterior
openings of 4! 5” by 5 feet, area 22 square feet; one with horizontal scope of
about 42 degrees, and the other of about 45 degrees.

“Tn 1815 the author of this report was called on to prepare a project for the
defence of. an important channel; and, having been convinced, while employed
as an assistant in the construction of two of the batteries just mentioned, that
the principles and the details by which the embrasures and the dependent case-
mates had thus far been regulated were erroneous and defective, set about a
eareful study of the conditions to be fulfilled in providing for the heavy guns of
that period mounted on a casemate carriage that had already been approved and
adopted. ‘The result was an embrasure having an exterior opening of 4 feet
wide by 2/ 6” high at the outside line of the cheeks, and 3 feet high at the key
of the covering arch, the throat being 1/ 10” wide. ‘This provided for all the
depression and elevation of the gun that the carriage permitted, and also for a
horizontal scope of full 60 degrees. Covered with a lintel instead of an arch,
the height of the exterior opening might be a little less than 3 feet.

“The plan of this embrasure shows that the interior opening is 5’ 6” wide,
and that the plane of the throat is within 2 feet of the outside of the wall, which,
just at the embrasure, is & feet thick.

« A slight modification fitted this embrasure, when applied to flanking or in-
terior defence, to receive at first a carronade of large calibre, and of later years
a howitzer instead. When these latter were liable to be assailed by musketry,
the outer cheeks were made ex cremailliere, (notched,) a long-known device.

“Tt was with timidity and hesitation that the cheeks of this embrasure were
placed so near the track of the ball, when fired from the casemate, with the
maximum obliquity, and the results of an early trial with experimental embra-
sures at Fortress Monroe gave some sanction to the doubt. ‘lhe first two under
trial were built of lime-mortar, and were soon shaken to pieces by the blast of
the gun. Another one, however, constructed of bricks laid in cement-mortar,
sustained without injury several hundred discharges. These last results have
been confirmed wherever there has been practice from our embrasures, which,
with immaterial differences, have, since 1815, been constructed in all our case-
mated batteries according to the preceding description.”

It will be seen from the foregoing quotations how thoroughly General Totten,
in adopting the casemated battery, was imbued with the spirit of its illustrious
160 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

originator. If, as is likely, he was aware of the latter’s rules on this subject,
he was the first to appreciate their essential importance, and to prove the prac-
ticability of their application. It is probable, however, that the close study of
the subject, critical observation, and keen sagacity which so distinguished him on
all occasions, and which taught him to accept nothing as the best which was
susceptible of improvement, led him to recognize as “ murderous funnels” the
embrasures of routine—to create anew the rules of Montalembert, and to make,
for the first time, a successful application of them. He reduced the throat to
nearly an absolute minimum ; he placed it at two feet from the outer face of the
wall, diminishing the external openings from eighteen, twenty-two, and twenty-
eight, down to about ten square feet, while he increased the sector of fire of the
gun from forty-five to sixty degrees; thus adding one-third to its field of fire,
and consequently to its value.

The embrasures, thus modelled in 1815, remained unchanged until the year
1858, but the casemate continued a subject of study and experiment during most
of his life. ‘The perfecting of ventilation, the determination of the dimensions
and height of the piers, of the span and rise of the arches, their thickness and
manner of covering, so as to obtain perfect drainage and to avoid the injurious
effects of frost, &c., were problems of prolonged research and skilful solution,
establishing for General Totten the right to be considered the author of the
American casemate. :

In connexion with these researches may be mentioned those also which were
directed to the determination of the manner of mounting guns “ en barbette.” *
As the dimensions of sea-coast ordnance increased, more and more elaborate
structures became necessary for their mounting and management. ‘The plan-
ning and construction of the carriages belonged to the Ordnance Bureau, but it.
was General ‘Totten’s task to adapt the platforms and parapets thereto. None
but the engineer or artillerist can thoroughly understand the difficulty and com-
plexity of the problems therein involved. ‘lo provide a platform which shall
support, without the slightest deflexion, the weight, and resist the shock of dis-
charge, while it provides for the training or pointing of the gun—which is so
adapted to the parapet as to allow the maximum horizontal seetor of fire, and to
afford the most perfect cover to the gunners consistent with allowing all the de-
pression demanded by the circumstances of the case-—such are the conditions to
be fulfilled, separately, for each calibre of gun. After years of experience, and
after our sea-coast ordnance had attained its highest development prior to the
introduction of the rifled gun and fifteen-inch columbiad, General Totten em-
bodied his results in a lithographic sheet exhibiting to the eye of the engineer
for every kind of gun and for every probable case the particular solution. This
single sheet exhibits strikingly the characteristics of the author’s mind—the
profound study which he brought to bear on every subject, the scrupulous aecu-
racy of his determinations, which neglected no appreciable magnitude, and the
thoroughness and generality of his solutions. —

When the embrasure of 1815 was designed, ships’ armaments contained no
gun heavier than a twenty-four or thirty-two pounder. As the calibres increased
it became a matter of doubt whether the five feet thickness of wall immediately
about the embrasure was sufficient. At the same time the progress made in the
art of forging large masses of iron had suggested that by its use the funnel form
of the mouth might be entirely done away with, and the exterior opening re-
duced to an absolute minimum. Nothing but experiment could lead to sound
conclusions, and the experiments referred to on a former page were instituted,
the principal objects of which were (in General 'Totten’s own language)—

I. “« To ascertain the effects of firing with solid balls, with shells, and with
grape and canister, from heavy ordnance at short distances, upon various mate-
rials used in the construction of casemate embrasures.

* A barbette gun is one which is fired over a parapet.
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 161

II. “'To determine whether these embrasures might have a form that would
shut out most of these missiles, and resist for a time the heaviest, without lessen-
ing the sector of fire, horizontal and vertical, of the casemate gun.

III. “To determine the degree to which, without injury from the blast of the
gun, or lessening its scope of fire, the throat of the embrasure, and also the ex-
terior opening, might be lessened.

IV. «To determine whether all smaller missiles might not be prevented from
passing through the throat into the battery ; and whether the smoke of the blast
might not also be excluded by simple and easily managed shutters.”

Targets were constructed representing the wall of a fortification pierced with
its embrasures. All varieties of materials were employed in the walls, and every
suggested method of consti ucting the embrasure was tried. General Totten’s
report shows that the minutest detail of construction was directed by himself,
and that he personally superintended the experiments. They were éarried on
at intervals during four successive years, the results of each year suggesting the
object of experiment for the next.

It would be out of place here to follow the report through its detailed ac-
counts of the firings, or even to attempt to sum up the conclusions arrived at,
referring as they do to such a variety of subjects ; but those concerning the
thickness of the scarp-wall and the use of wrought iron may be properly quoted
as among the most important :

« The general conclusion from these trials is, that, whether of cement concrete, of
bricks, or of hard stones, the portion of the wall at and around each embrasure
having the thickness of five feet only should be no larger than is indispensable
for the adaptation of the gun and carriage to the embrasure; if restricted to a
small area, this thickness will suffice—not otherwise.

“The thickness of five feet will resist a number of these balls, impinging in
succession on that space, provided the bond expand promptly above, below, and
on each side, into a thickness greater by some two and a half feet or three feet
or more. Were the wall no thicker generally than five feet, being reinforced
only by piers some fifteen feet apart, it would soon be seriously damaged by
battering at short distances.”

And in reference to iron it is stated: “ First, it may be fairly assumed that
a plate eight inches thick of wrought iron of good quality, kept in place by a
backing of three feet of strong masonry, will stop a solid ball from an eight-
inch columbiad fired with ten and a quarter pounds of powder from the distance
of two hundred yards. The plate of iron will be deeply indented at the point
of impact, the ball carving for itself a smoot bed of the shape and size of one
hemisphere, in which it will be found broken into many pieces easily separable,
and it will, besides, be somewhat bent generally. The masonry behind will
be much jarred, and, unless strongly bonded, be considerably displaced ;. more-
over, unless the thickness of three feet is well tied into thicker masses imme-
diately adjacent on the sides and above and below, the general damage will be
severe.

“Second, this plate will be much the stronger for being in a single mass, and
not made up of several thinner plates. ‘The continuity effected by bolts and
rivets of the made-up plates is broken even by weak assaults, so that. after-
wards the stronger, instead of a joint opposition, finds only a succession of
feeble resistances.

“'Third, a thickness of two inches is ample for shutters designated to stop
the largest grape-shot. With this thickness they will be neither perforated nor
deformed by anything less than cannon balls or shells. These shutters also,
for the reason just given, should be made of a single thickness. The firings
show the necessity of concealing entirely, even from the smallest iron missile,
their hinges and fastenings.

ll s
162 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

«Fourth, a wrought iron plate of half an inch in thickness is adequate to pro-
tect the outer margins and the offsets of embrasures from injury by grape or
canister shot.”

These facts established, the effect of the form and dimensions of the embra-
sures in carrying in the smaller missiles was investigated ; the recorded results
will enable us to appreciate the force of Montalembert’s expression, “ murderous
funnels,” as even its author could not do.

«Suppose a hundred-gun ship to be placed within good canister range of a
easemated battery of about the ship’s length and height, to the fifty guns of the
ship’s broadside there would be opposed about twenty-four guns in two tiers
in the battery. The ship would fire each gun once in three minutes, or ten
times in half an hour; the fifty guns would therefore make five hundred dis-
charges within that time.

« With* one hundred and fifty-six balls in each thirty-two-pound canister,
(weighing in all thirty-one and a half pounds,) there would be thrown seventy-
eight thousand balls in thirty minutes. Supposing one-half to miss the fort,
which, considering the size of the object and the short distance, is a large al-
lowance, there would still remain the number of thirty-nine thousand balls to
strike a surface of (say) six thousand square feet—that is,

ie eaGhacuiare O0ts- 2.25 - ake ae a - aen ee en eee 64 balls.
“Or within the exterior opening of one of the embrasures of our

“Within the European embrasure above mentioned, having fifty-

four square feet of opening,* there would be received in half an

ONES BAe eer cS. Rees el eee Sate Ae 351 balls.”

And if the ship carried modern eight-inch guns, and fired canister of musket
balls, these figures would be, in the three cases, fifty-one, four hundred and fifty-
three, and two thousand seven hundred and fifty-four. These theoretical con-
clusions were verified by the experimental firing with grape and canister, and
it is thus seen how greatly superior General Totten’s embrasure of 1815, which
is but little larger than that of the second target, is to the European one, and
how thoroughly he had, at that early day, mastered the subject. He had, in-
deed, perfected the embrasure so far as it could be done with masonry alone.

But the quantity of small missiles which even that embrasure would receive
is dangerously great, and would be much diminished if the funnel-form of the
mouth could be done away wiih, and the throat reduced to an absolute minimum.
This could be accomplished only by the use of iron, and the conclusions I have
just quoted furnish the data necessary to its successful application.

The throat (still placed two feet back from the outer face of the wall) being
formed of iron plates, it became practicable to cut away the flaring surfaces of
masonry, 80 as to present others parallel or perpendicular to the face of the wall,
and by this change of form to exclude all missiles not directed within the limits
of the throat itself Still more completely to accomplish the object, wrought-
iron shutters of two inches thickness (as determined by the experiments) were
applied, by which, except at the moments of aiming and firing, the embrasure
was entirely closed.

Such is the history of the casemated battery and casemated embrasure in the
United States. We have seen that the perfection to which they have been
brought is due to General Totten, and to General Totten alone. Nor is it to the
experiments which I have been describing, laborious, skiliul, and thorough as
they were, that we may solely attribute such results. We must look back to

; * Reference is made to the embrasure ef a European work built within the last twenty-
ve years.
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 163

the time when, a first lieutenant of engineers, he saw and aided in the con-
struction of our first casemated fort, and when he, fully appreciating its merits
and recognizing the defects which a disregard and want of appreciation of the
illustrious projector’s own principles had entailed upon it, set himself to the task
of enhancing the one and correcting the other.

The ten years which have eiapsed since 1855 have witnessed changes in the
character of sea-coast and nayal artillery, and an increase in the ealibres and
weight of their projectiles, which no one at that date would have anticipated ;
hence some doubt may be entertained whether our casemated masonry works
are adequate to contend with iron-clad vessels armed with the modern artillery.
This is a question which it remains for experiment or experience to decide. It
has, as yet, not been demonstrated that a masonry fort, constructed as our more
recent works are, will not, armed with the powerful guns now being introduced,
endure the contest quite as long as its iron-clad antagonist can protract it.

In this connexion it is due to General Totten to say that he has himself been
ever the most strenuous advocate of “big guns,” the most urgent instigator of
their production. The writer well remembers when, seated with him on the
piazza of the officers’ quarters at Fort Jackson, our eyes resting on the mighty
stream flowing past us, upon the defence of which our thoughts and conversa-
tion had been turning, he exclaimed, “ We must have a 20-inch gun.” The
idea was novel to me at that time, and I exhibited some surprise. He went on
to say that, thoroughly to prevent the passage or attempted passage of an armed
steamship, there must be not only danger but almost a certainty of destruction.
“Let us have guns such that (to use his own phrase) ‘every shot shall be a
bird.’”” The invention of armored ships, not then foreseen, has increased the
necessity of having such guns as he, on other grounds, so strongly advocated.
He expressed the greatest confidence that a gun of the dimensions he named
would yet be made and introduced into our batteries, and added the interesting
statement that in his earlier days he had found much difficulty in impressing
upon the members of boards on which he had served the necessity of having
guns in our harbor defences larger than 24-pounders. To the labors and
genius of a Rodman we owe the actual invention of the art. of constructing
fifteen and twenty-inch guns; but without the unceasing stimulus of General
Totten’s known and urged views, it is doubtful whether Rodman’s labors would
have been called for or sustained.

The preceding pages have been mainly devoted to the illustration of our de-

. parted associate’s career as an officer and as the Chief Engineer of the United
States. Before turning our attention to other spheres of his usefulness, it seems
fitting to quote from one of his eulogists the following summary of his official
characteristics :

“In wielding the influence of his office as Chief Engineer, the prominent traits
exhibited by General ‘Totten were strict justice and scrupulous integrity. No
sophistry, no blandishments, no arbitrary exercise of superior authority could turn
him in the least from his steadfast adherence to his own sense of duty. Avoiding
all useless collisions with his official superiors, showing due respect to their
station, he never failed to call their attention to any errors committed by them
with respect to the department under his charge; nor did he ever leave them
any excuse for wilful wrong-doing by remaining silent, even when he knew
that his suggestions would not only be ill-received and of no use, but might be
visited by the exercise of those petty vexations which official superiors can em-
ploy against those under them who thwart their misdoings.

* * * * * * % * *

«The individual traits of General Totten were strongly marked. Powerfully
built, of a constitution of the most vigorous stamp, cool, potent, and persevering,
of sound judgment and variety of intellectual capacity, nature seemed to have
164 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

endowed him for the profession that he had chosen. His attention to the per-
formance of his professional duties amounted to a devotion.
* * * * * * * ® *

“Whilst steadily adhering to what had been well settled by experience, and
withstanding the ill-directed efforts of that class of men of whom some are to
be found in all bodies, who seize upon every novelty and press it into the service
of their own crude notions, he was far from rejecting well-reasoned projects of
improvement, and encouraged, as his own immediate works show, every step
towards real progress. Although not belonging to the class of mere inventors,
he had that invaluable faculty to one holding a position of so great public re-
sponsibility, of detecting the fallacies with which this class too frequently de-
ceive themselves as well as others.”

In 1863, under the law uniting into one the two corps of engineers and topo-
graphical engineers, General ‘Totten was advanced to the full grade of brigadier
general. A few days before his death the Senate unanimously confirmed his
nomination by the President to be ‘major general by brevet, for long, faithful,
and eminent services.”” Never were such distinction and such commendation
more fitly bestowed.

Giving the precedence in order to duties most intimately connected with his
profession, I now turn to General Totten’s important labors in establishing and
maintaining our present light-house system.

The attention of Congress having been called to the pressing necessity for
introducing certain reforms, administrative and executive, into the light-house
system of the United States, that body, after full discussion of the subject,
passed an act (approved March 3, 185J) stipulating that from and after that
date, in all new light-houses and all light-houses requiring illuminating appa-
ratus, the lens or 'resnel system should be adopted.

Another chapter of the same act provided for the appointment of a commis-
sion, to be composed of two officers of engineers of the army, and such civil
officers of high scientific attainments as might be under the orders or at the dis-
position of the Treasury Department, and a junior officer of the navy as secre-
tary, whose duty it should be to inquire into the condition of the light-house
establishment of the United States, and to make a general detailed report and
programme to guide legislation in extending and improving our present system
of construction, illumination, inspection, and superintendence.

The board, as constituted by the President, consisted ef Commander W. B.
Shubrick, General J. G. Totten, Colonel James Kearney, Captain 8S. F. Du- |
pont, United States navy, Professor A. Dallas Bache, superintendent United
States coast survey, and Thornton A. Jenkins, United States navy, as secretary.

Its labors were directed first to demonstrating the evils, irregularities, and
abuses which had crept into the light-house service under the management of
the Fifth Auditor of the treasury, (the late venerable and highly respected
Stephen Pleasonton,) among which were found to be those arising from de-
fective principles of construction, renovation, and repair of light-houses, inade-
quate protection to sites and badly planned and poorly constructed sea-walls.
Jt may readily be understood how the peculiarly practical mind of General Tot-
ten, brought to bear upon these and kindred subjects of inquiry, developed and
demonstrated the necessity of at once employing proper scientific systems and
plans of construction. His assistance in collecting data was found invaluable,
and his lucid, clear mind was equally to be trusted in detecting faults and in de-
vising the remedy.

Without entering into a detailed account of the labors of this board of inquiry,
it is sufficient to state that the mass of evidence. collected by it was so irresisti-
ble in proof of existing errors, that Congress, under date of August 31, 1852,
passed an act which created a permanent light-house board, to which was con-
fided all the duties of the establishment. General Totten was appointed to this
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 165

board, and served as a valued and honored member, with but a short interruption,
until his decease. Its early labors were arduous and onerous. A new system
was to be founded where before had been none; order should come from chaos,
error was to vanish before science, economy to succeed to wastefulness, darkness
to give place to light. ‘The task, great as it was, fell upon no shrinking hearts
or feeble brains. “The work was accomplished; and long before his lamented
death General Totten had the satisfaction of witnessing the labors of himself
and his associates crowned with full success. The board in its deliberations de-
rived great benefit from his preseuce and participation, and relied with entire as-
surance upon the correctness of his judgment upon all subjects concerning which
he would express an opinion. He served almost continuously as chairman of
the committee of finance, and the decisions of that committee owe not a little of
their sound wisdom to the searching scrutiny joined to the generous and liberal
views of its chairman. He was also a member of the committee on engineering,
in which department his peculiar merit was most conspicuous. 'The principal
works with which his name is associated, and which claim our attention, are the
light-houses on Seven-Foot Knoll, near Baltimore, Maryland, and on Minot’s
Ledge, off Cohasset, Massachusetts.

The former is an iron pile structure standing in some ten feet of water. It
was erected at a time when the science of iron pile construction was in its in-
fancy, and was one of the first works of the kind undertaken by the board.
Hence it was a matter of deep interest and solicitude. It was successfully com-
pleted, and the light-house stands to-day a signal reward for the thought and
labor bestowed upon its conception and construction.

The light-house at Minot’s Ledge was a work of far greater difficulty, and to
its proper location and plan General Totten lent the resources of his great expe-
rience and exhaustless knowledge. As his intimate acquaintance with the
whole coast of the United States, acquired while acting as a member of the
board of engineers, and during his annual inspections as Chief Engineer, ena-
bled him, with the aid of the Coast Survey, to indicate with almost unerring
certainty the proper location and character of all new light-houses, so his prae-
tical knowledge of construction, in laying the foundation of our-sea-coast fortifi-
cations and the sea-walls by which the sites of many of them had to be protect-
ed, prepared him to grapple with the difficulties of constructing a masoury
tower in this exposed situation, and to bring to their solution all the known and
tried resources of engineering. ;

Minot’s Ledge is situated about twenty miles southeast of Boston. It is the
outer rock of a very dangerous group called the “Cohasset Rocks,” lying at
the very wayside of navigation to the harbor of Boston. A light-house of iron
had been erected here a few years previous to the organization of the Light-
house Board, but it was carried away in a fearful storm which swept along the
coast of New England on the 16th of April, 1851.

Not only the commercial interests of the country, but humanity demanded
that it should be replaced, and Congress promptly made an appropriation for
this purpose, stipulating that the tower should be erected on the outer Minot,
and confiding its construction to the Topographical Bureau. This bureau, hay-
ing publicly advertised, received sixteen distinct proposals to erect the proposed
structure, but @nally recommended, in view of the difficulties to be overcome,
and the fearful fate of its predecessor, that it should be located on one of the
inner rocks. In accordance with this recommendation, an act of Congress was
passed authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to “ select, instead of the outer
Minot’s Ledge, any more suitable site.”” Before further action had been taken,
the whole subject fell into the hands of the newly created Light-house Board.
A joint resolution of Congress was then passed (1854) giving to this board the
decision as to the location and the mode of construction.
166 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

The question of location being thus widely reopened, a committee of the
board was sent to make a personal examination of the locality. General Tot-
ten was, of course, a member of this committee, and was not long in making up
his mind that the outer and not the inner Minot was the proper site. His argu-
ments on this subject proved conclusive with the board. He urged that if the
light were placed on any of the inner rocks the desired object would be but
partially accomplished, since in a dense fog or thick snow-storm vessels might
approach within a few hundred feet without being able to see it, and thus be
lost upon the outer ledge.

When the question of practicability was broached, his professional pride
seemed to be roused. He argued that, after what had been done on the coast of
England in the erection of the Eddystone light-house a century ago, and more
recently of the Bell Rock and Skerryvore lights, it would be a humiliating
admission that the requisite science and skill were not to be found in this
country to erect a similar structure where, as all admitted, one was so much
needed.

He earefully studied the accounts of the construction of the Eddystone, Bell
Rock, and Skerryvore light-houses, by Smeaton, Robert Stephenson, and Allan
Stephenson, but the fact that the Eddystone was begun at high-water mark,
that the ledge of the Bell Rock was extensive, and elevated several feet above
low-water, and that the Skerryvore presented still less difficulties, while the sur-
veys show that the outer Minot’s ledge was very contracted, and that the pro-
posed structure must commence even below low water, did not deter him from
advocating and designing a work for this formidable position more difficult to
accomplish than anything which had ever preceded it.

The plans which he prepared were drawn with his usual minuteness of detail.
The problem was one peculiarly fascinating to engineers—the uniting into a
single mass the several component stones of the structure so that no one can be
detached from the rest, that each shall be a bond of connexion to those adjacent,
that the whole shall be an integral, having a strength ample to defy the most
powerful foe to human structure, the fury of the ocean’s winds and waves. —
Though not himself the constructor of the work, yet to have insisted against
authoritative adverse opinion on its practicability, to have planned the building
and selected the engineer who should rear it, and to have overlooked the work
from its commencement to its completion, entitles him, even were this his only
work, to recognition among the Smeatons and Stephensons and Brunels, as one
of the great engineers of the age.

For the execution, he selected Captain (now Brevet Brigadier General) Bar-
ton 5. Alexander, of the Corps of Engineers, an officer whose experience, ener-
gy. boldness, and self-reliance eminently fitted him for the task. It is for him
to recount the history of the work, to give to the world the interesting narrative
of dithculties met and overcome, of patience requited and energy triumphant.
General Totten watched its progress with unflagging interest, making frequent
visits to the superintending engineer, aiding him with his counsels and encour-
aging him in his difficulties. He lived to enjoy the proud satisfaction of inspect-
ing the finished structure; and when at last from its towering summit flashed
o’er the troubled waters the beacon-light of safety to the tempest-tossed mari-
ner, he might well exclaim, with the Latin poet, though in a n@bler sense and
in a less boastful spirit, “ Exegi monumentum cere perenius.”

General (then Colonel) Totten was named in the act of Congress organizing
the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 as one of the Regents to whom the busi-
ness transactions of that celebrated establishment are intrusted. “At an early
meeting of the Board of: Regents he was appointed one of the Executive Com-
mittee, and was continued in these offices by repeated election to the time of
his death, a period of nearly eighteen years. He evinced a lively interest in
the organization of the Institution, and after a careful study of the will and char-
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 167

acter of Smithson, gave his preference to the programme prepared by Professor
Henry, which was finally adopted. His advocacy of the plan was the more
important since he was well acquainted with the scientific character of James
Smithson, and had himself, as we shall see in a subsequent statement, been
engaged in a line of research similar to one of those pursued by the founder of
this Institution.

In the reconstruction of the interior of the main part of the Smithsonian build-
ing which had partly been completed in wood, but which had given way, he
strongly urged the employment of fire-proof material, to the adoption of which
the preservation of the valuable collections of the Institution is indebted. In
the discharge of his duty as one of the Executive Committee, he acted with the
same conscientious regard to the sacredness of the trust which characterized all
his official labors, and critically examined all the accounts, assured himself as
to the proper expenditure of the funds, and advised as to the general policy to
be pursued. In him the Secretary ever found a firm supporter, a sympathetic
friend, and a judicious adviser. Unostentatious, unselfish, and only desiring to
advance whatever cause he might be connected with, he gave the most valuable
suggestions as if they were of little moment, and in such a way that they might
appear to be deductions from what others had said or done, being more anxious
that his suggestions should be properly carried out than that they should be
accredited to himself.

As a recreation from the more arduous studies of his profession, he devoted
in the early part of his life his spare hours to natural history, paying much
attention to the mollusca of the northern coast of the United States; and he
was perhaps the first, or at least one of the first, to introduce into this country
the use of the dredge for the search of these animals, thus not only obtaining
many species which would otherwise have escaped attention and getting fresh
and unmutilated specimens of species previously known only from dead imper-
fect shells, but enabling us to learn something of the habits and associations of
the animals—information of much greater scientific value than the discovery of
a few new species. His observations and studies in conchology were embodied
in an article entitled “Descriptions of some Shells belonging to the Coast of
New England,” published in the American Journal of Science and Arts for
1834 and 1835, and Dr. A. A. Gould was largely indebted to him for material
employed in his “Invertebrata of Massachusetts,” many of the species of shells
contained in which were first found to inhabit our coast by General Totten ;
others were new species discovered by him, though described by Dr. Gould,
while some nine or ten specimens were not only discovered but described by
him. The descriptions of species and remarks evince his powers of observation
and critical acumen, and almost all of the forms described have stood the test
of subsequent examination, and the validity of their specific distinction been
confirmed, although several of them are among the most common shells of the
coast; on account of their small size, they had been previously overlooked or
neglected, but their insignificance in size did not diminish their interest in the
eyes of one who viewed nature in all her manifestations as worthy of contem-
plation. One of the most beautiful and almost the smallest of the bivalves of
our coast, called by him Venus gemma, has since been dedicated to him under
the name of Gemma Tottenii by Dr. William Stimpson.

General Totten collected principally on the shores of New England, and his
explorations with the dredge were almost entirely made in the vicinity of New-
port, R. I., and of Provincetown, Mass. A list of the shells of Massachusetts
was contributed by him to one of the preliminary reports on the natural history
of that State. The principal species described by him are as follows: Modiola
glandula, (now known as Mytilus decussatus,) Venus gemma, (Gemma Tottenii,)
Solemya borealis, Bulla oryza, Natica immaculata, Turbo minutus, (Rissoa
minuta,) Turritella interrupta, (Chemnitzia interrupta,) Acteon trifidus, (Chem-
168 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

nitzia trifida,) and Pasithea nigra. This last-named species he described from
young shells, and afterwards finding the adult shell, which is very different,
called it Cerithium reticulatum. It has for many years been called Cerythium
Say, but a late author has again credited it to him, under the name of Bittium
nigrum.

A species of Succinea (S. Totteniana) was dedicated to General Totten by
Mr. Isaac Lea, of Philadelphia.

Conchologists are also indebted to General Totten for the discovery of means
for the preservation of the epidermis or periostraca of shells, which is in many
species so liable to crack, and this recipe has been received with much appro-
bation by many collectors who have found it to supply a want much felt. The
valuable collection of rare shells which he made at this period of his life he
presented to the Smithsonian Institution, without the usual condition that it
should be preserved separately, but to be used most advantageously ‘for the
advancement of science, to complete the general collection of the museum, or for
distribution as duplicates to other establishments.

In the ‘Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History of New York” for 1824
(vol. i, pp. 109-114) he published “ Notes on some new Supports for Minerals,
subject to the Action of the Common Blow-pipe.” These researches on the use
and power of the blow-pipe appear to have been incited by an article of James
Smithson, the subsequent founder of the Smithsonian Institution, and the
memoir of ‘Totten commences with a reference to and rehearsal of the experi-
ments of that gentleman, as detailed in a letter to the editor of the Annals of
Philosophy. Smithson, it was remarked, had communicated several ingenious
modifications of Saussure’s process with supports of splinters of sapphire, which
process, he observes, “has been scarcely at all employed; owing partly to the
excessive difficulty, in general, of making the particles adhere, and in conse-
quence of the almost unpossessed degree of patience required, and of the time
consumed by nearly interminable failures.’ Detailing the processes of Mr.
Smithson, three in number, and the snecess of that gentleman, he adopted a
- modification of Smithson’s third process, having recourse, as a support, to a
portion of the mineral itself, which he designed to expose to the action of the
flame. ‘Instead, however, of taking upon the point of platinum wire a very
minute portion of the paste made of the powdered mineral,’ according to Mr.
Smithson’s method, he “formed a paste by mixing the powder with very thick
gum-water, and, rubbing a little of it under the finger, formed a very acute cone,
sometimes nearly an inch in length, and generally about a twentieth of an
inch in diameter at the base.’ ‘lo the apex of such cones the most minute
particles would adhere under the strongest blast of the blow-pipe, and being
insulated by the destruction of continuity of the particles of the cone, the flame
could be directed upon it with undiminished fervor. Experiments were made
on a number of minerals, confirming those of Mr. Smithson, and greatly extend-
ing the power of the blow-pipe, and he was thus led to add to the three classes
divided in relation to this instrument a fourth, namely, “such as are fusible, per
se, in microscopical particles.”

The attention of the inhabitants near the shores of the great lakes of the
north had often been arrested by the sudden disappearance in the spring of the
ice on the surface. The lakes would be covered with a continuous sheet of
solid ice in the evening, and in the next morning all would have vanished.
Wild speculations had been entertained as to the explanation of this phenomenon
previous to the investigation of the subject by General Totten, who presented
an article on the subject to the American Association for the Advancement of
Science at the Springfield meeting in 1859.

From this it appears that his attention had been directed to it forty years be-
fore, at Plattsburg, New York. Ice is composed of a congeries of prismatic erys-
tals, whose axes are at right angles to the surface of the mass. “ Examina-
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 169

tions then and afterwards made of floating fresh-water ice have shown that the
natural effect of the advancing year is gradually to transform ice, solid and
apparently homogeneous, into an aggregation of these irregular prismatic crys-
tals, standing in vertical juxtaposition, having few surfaces of contact, but
touching rather at points and on edges, and kept in place at last merely by
want of room to fall asunder. Until this change has somewhat advanced, the
cohesive strength of ice of considerable thickness is still adequate to sustain the
weight and shock of the travel it had borne during the winter; but becoming
less and less coherent by the growing isolation of the prisms, or more and more
‘rotten,’ as the phrase is, though retaining all its thickness, the ice will at last
scarcely support a small weight, though bearing upon a large surface, the foot
of man easily breaking through, and very slight resistance being made to the
point ofa cone.” ‘The points of contact of the particles being destroyed, each
will drop into the position in the water below required by the place of its own
centre of gravity—that is to say, it will be upon its side, exposing large sur-
faces to the action of the warm water. With the ice in such condition, a heavy
wind will cause the disruption of the particles, and the speedy disappearance
would be the consequence. This remark of General Totten as to the crystalli-
zation of ice has since been extended to nearly all substances which, in becom-
ing solid, assume the crystallized form. The axes of the crystals tend to assume
a position at right angles to the surface of cooling.

As illustrative of the mind of General Totten, it may be stated that he seldom
failed to give valuable hints for the improvement of processes or inventions
which were brought before him in the course of the discharge of his numerous
official duties. Among these was an instrument for ascertaining the daily
amount of evaporation from a given surface by means of the descent of water
contained in an inverted graduated tube, the open end of which, was immersed
in the basin from which the evaporation took place. With a slight correction
for variation in barometrical pressure, this instrument gives, with more precision
than any other with which we are acquainted, the amount of evaporation.

I have, gentlemen, thus faintly and inadequately sketched the life and ser-
vices of our departed friend and associate; but, faint and inadequate as my
sketch may be, I feel confident that every one will recognize in it the lineaments
of a great and true man. Labors so protracted, results so important and varied,
it is the destiny of but few to achieve, and for him who achieves them may
justly be claimed a high niche in the temple of fame, and the grateful homage
of the patriot and of the seeker after truth. One of the oldest of the corpora-
tors of this academy, it was permitted him only to contribute his past labors
and his shining example. But these are indeed a rich legacy. Proud, indeed,
may this youthful institution be that it can enrol among its members the name
of Joseph Gilbert Totten; proud, too, may each one whom I now address—
each one of its members—be, if he shall achieve but a far less claim to recog-
nition among men of science. ‘To the aged among us—to those who were young
with him, and like him have crowned a life of toil by honorable achievements—
I need not speak. They require no example, and they may feel in contemplat-
ing his history an additional assurance that their own works, too, “ shall praise
them.” To the more youthful or to the middle-aged, who have just commenced,
or but partially accomplished, the steep ascent which leads to honorable fame,
his life is precious in its teachings.

He was a patriot in the broadest and best sense of the term. To his country
he had given himself, and every faculty of his being was devoted to her honor and
welfare—realizing almost literally the thought of Rousseau, “the child on en-
tering life ought to see his country, and to the hour of his death see but her.”

Like all who have left lasting results for the benefit of their country or of
mankind, he was a hard worker. But ill-regulated labor, however arduous,
170 EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL: JOSEPH G. TOTTEN.

could never have accomplished what he accomplished. Beyond all men I ever
knew, he was systematic ; and few indeed are the examples of a life, in al
things, so perfectly regulated. ‘The beautiful order which pervaded all that he
did is searcely less worthy of study and admiration than the achievements to
which it so materially contributed.

He was no trifler with the realities of life, who dallied with them for his pleas-
ure or who wielded them as instruments of ambition or self-interest. To him,
as to all true men, the meaning of life was concentrated in one single word,
Duty. This “chief end of man,” which is to glorify God by obedience to his
laws in the-use of the faculties he has bestowed, was his ruling principle—the
celestial cynosure to which his eyes were ever directed, and from which no al-
urement of lower motives could divert it. Nor was his sense of duty of that
frigid, repulsive nature which reduces the conduct of life to a formula, and, sub-
stituting rules for emotions, seems but a refined selfishness. He was warm and
sympathetic, finding his chief happiness in the pleasures of domestic and social
intercourse, but singularly susceptible to everything that ministers to innocent
enjoyment. ;

Perhaps no more striking illustration than his history affords could be found
of the truth that the path of duty is the path of happiness. His life was em-
inently a happy one, and his, indeed, was that “ peace of mind which passeth
understanding.” ‘Though devoted from his youth to the military service of his
country, and doomed to the vicissitudes of a soldier’s lot, he was permitted, to
a greater degree than most men, to enjoy the blessings of the domestic circle.
There, indeed, he sat enthroned, the idol of a family of whose supreme affection
and immeasurable devotion he was the object. Nor dare we call those blows by
which a Heavenly Father reminds us that this world is not our “ abiding place,”
and teaches us to look beyond to “an house not made with hands, eternal-in the
heavens,”’ sources of unhappiness to him who receives them as from the hand of
One ‘“ who chasteneth whom he loveth.” One by one, he lived to see all his
three sous, two of his four daughters, and finally the companion of the joys an
sorrows of so many years, precede him to the grave.

Beautiful beyond all else that earth presents is that conjugal companionship,
so touchingly depicted by Burns, which, beginning in youth, is permitted to con-
tinue unbroken till the Psalmist’s period of life is overpassed. During the later
years of their lives, Mrs. Totten, no longer bound to the domestic hearth by
the cares of a growing family, became truly an inseparable companion. Never,
when it was at all practicable to have her with him, did he ride or walk, or
make a journey, or perform one of his periodical tours of inspection, without
her companionship; nor could one see them together without feeling that they
presented a model of whatever is amiable and lovely in the conjugal state. If
he was to her the embodiment of all that is most worthy of respect and love in
man, not less marked was his deference to her. In her own sphere—as woman,
wife, mother—she was supreme, and her judgment his law. When, but two
years before his own death, she was somewhat suddenly called away, it seemed
as if he regarded it as a message from on high, “set thy house in order, for
thou shalt die and not live.’”, No murmur escaped his lips, and no long-contin-
ued sadness clouded his brow, but there was an unwonted gentleness and quiet-
ude in his demeanor, a softening, as it were, of his nature, which revealed how
deeply “ the iron had entered his soul.” His health and bodily strength seemed
to continue little impaired, and his devotion to the duties of his office undiminished.
But once, during a life protracted beyond the usual span, had that powerful frame
submitted to the sway of sickness, and he seemed to have unusual promise of
a still further protracted life. But such promises proved deceitful. Early in
March, 1864, he was attacked with pneumonia. His illness was not at first
deemed alarming, and, indeed, at one time he was supposed to be convalescent,
but a relapse ensued, and on the 22d of April he expired, having borne the suf-
EULOGY ON THE LATE GENERAL JOSEPH G. TOTTEN. 171

ferings of his sickness with cheerfulness and resignation, and retained to the
last the perfect use of all his mental faculties. He had long been a member
and communicant of the Episcopal church, and died in the Christian’s hope of
a joyful resurrection.

Gentle, kind, and good, mild, modest, and tolerant, wise, sagacious, shrewd,
and learned, yet simple and unpretending as a child, he died as he had lived,
surrounded by hearts gushing with affection, and the object of the respect and
love of all with whom he had ever been associated.

The greatest of sculptors, the greatest of painters, a man unsurpassed in
boldness and originality of thought, and whose name is among those of the few
whose genius overpasses the limits of country and claims homage from all man-
kind—Michael Angelo—in a work stamped with the maturity of his powers,
carved a figure known to the world as “ I] Pensiero,” or Thought. There ex-
ists in art no other personification of meditation, no other type of self-collected-
ness and profound thought.

The sculptor arrayed it not as a philosopher, as a monk, as a poet, as an
artist, as a theologian, as a scholar, nor even as a pope. And yet these differ-
ent types of thinkers were not wanting in the past or present of the age and
country of a Raphael, of a Correggio, of a Leonardo da Vinci, of a Dante, of a
Savonarola, of a Marco Polo, of a Columbus, of a Machiavelli, of a Galileo, of a
St. Francis de Assis, of a St. Thomas Aquinas, of a Julius II, of a Leo X,
and of a Clement VII.

How, then, has Michael Angelo arrayed his personified ‘‘ Thought ?’’ In the
garb of a Soldier, upon the breast the cuirass, upon the brow, wrapt in medita-
tion, the iron easque of the man of war. ‘The great sculptor has divined the
mysterious cause why, among all people, among all classes, and in all epochs,
the soldier is honored. Instinct teaches the people, and genius taught Michael
Angelo, that among so many glorious pases fe among so many immortal vic-
tims, so many illustrious martyrs or devotees of thought, illustrating an age or
a country, the soldier stands forth pre-eminently, in all ages and in all countries,
the victim always ready, the defender always armed, the servant, the apostle,
and the martyr.

It is the Christian version of the ancient allegory which made Minerva issue
from the brain of Jupiter: Minerva, or wisdom armed, the helmet upon her
brow, the sword in her hand.

Will the foregoing paragraphs, which I have translated somewhat freely from
the “ Soldat” of Joachim Ambert, a work devoted to the illustration of the sol-
dier’s career, be deemed an immodest or extravagant glorification of the profes-
sion of arms? Far be it from me to exalt unduly that profession, but I would
at least make a claim for it, the more necessary since popular apprehension tends
to lose sight of the thinker in the man of force and of blood, that, more than any
other, it embraces all sciences and all branches of human knowledge, and leads
its followers into vast and diverse fields of thought. Let the illustrious dead be
our witnesses ; that idea which a genius of a Michael Angelo inspired and em-
bodied in marble; that idea which the lives of a Cesar, a Frederick, a Washing-
ton, a Napoleon, and a Wellington have justified; the union of Force and
Thought finds yet another and a varied illustration in the accomplished soldier
and profound thinker whose life and works we now commemorate.

RESOLUTIONS OF THE LIGHT-HOUSE BOARD.

Resolved, That the members of the Light-house Board feel most deeply the
loss sustained by the branch of the public service under their charge in the
death of Brevet Major General Joseph Gilbert Totten, who has been one of the
most useful and active members of the board from its first appointment in pur-

suance of law in 1851, under the Secretary of the Treasury, as a temporary
board of inquiry into the light-house establishment ofthe United States, through
all the years of organization of the establishment and of its executive duties.

Resolved, That the high scientific attainments, the admirable administrative
qualities, the perfect knowledge of general principles, and attention to every
minute detail of the system, impressed the mental and moral qualities of Gen-
eral Totten upon his associates in a way to make his mind eminently a leading
one of the board, while his suavity, patience, perfect amiability, and retiring
modesty rendered him one of the most charming of associates in executing work
to which he was so much more than sufficient.

Resolved, That in the discharge of the duties of inquiry of the first board,
the resulting organization, the adoption of the present system of lighting by
lenses, the subject of construction, theoretical and practical, and the use of
materials, the experience and experimental knowledge of General Totten were
of the highest value to the board, and his careful application of the sciences
were of the greatest importance to the light-house system; and that in the large
qualities of common sense in all the transactions of the board, general as well
as technical, and in his high sense of justice directing great mental power, the
board constantly felt the support of General Totten as one to be relied upon for
guidance in all difficult questions of administration.

Resolved, That the affectionate qualities of General Totten’s heart so endeared
him to his colleagues, that in now expressing themselves in regard to his death,
they are fully prepared to share to the utmost the deep grief of his family, to
whom they offer their sincere condolence for the loss of one not to be replaced,
but to be ever mourned as the true, devoted, and sincere friend.

Kesolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to the family of
General Totten, and to the honorable Secretary of War, and to the honorable
Secretary of the Treasury.

Resolved, That these proceedings be published in the Washington newspapers.

MEMOIR

OF

DUCRKROTAY DE BLAINVILLE,
BY M. FLOURENS,

PERPETUAL SECRETARY OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.
[TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION BY C. A. ALEXANDER. |

«There is no pursuit in the world so toilsome,” says La Bruyere, “as that of
making for one’s self a name.”’ Undeterred by this reflection, and stimulated
by the charm of satire, La Bruyere braved the annoyances of which he spoke,
and made for himself a very considerable one. The member of the academy
whose memory I am about to recall had teo much energy to be daunted by such
a saying as the above, and seems in no small degree to have been stimulated in
his arduous labors by the spirit of contradiction. Having by persevering efforts
thrown light on some of the highest points of the science of organized beings,
he also enjoyed the success which seldom fails to attend criticism and attracted
the fervid interest which opposition constantly excites, even when its attacks
are directed against genius.

Born at Arques, February 17, 1777, son of Pierre Ducrotay and Catharine
Pauger, Marie-Henri de Blainville was fond of recounting that, although his
family was not numbered among the most illustrious of the province, it ascended,
nevertheless, to the fourteenth century ; that it was the issue of a Scotch gentle-
man who, holding nothing except by the tenure of cloak and sword, had received
from the place of his landing the name of Ducrotay. Having thus sheltered the
nobility of his family under the egis of Scottish loyalty, he would add that, un-
der Francis I, the government of the castle of Arques, which its position then
rendered an important post, was confided to one Robert Ducrotay; that the
fortunes of the family had been still further enhanced through a descendant of
the latter, who had the address to secure the favor of five successive monarchs,
had received particular marks of esteem from Henry III, and the confirmation
of his titles and franchises from Henry IV, to whom he had rendered valuable
service at the battle of Arques. It was in the bosom, therefore, of a family
proud of its historical recollections and jealous of its privileges that the first
moral impressions of the young Ducrotay de Blainville were formed.

He was the youngest son, and had the misfortune’to lose his father at an
early age. For the rudiments of education he was indebted to a neighboring
curate, and was transferred at a later period to the military school of Beaumont
en Ange, which was under the direction of the Benedictine monks of Saint
Maur, and of which it is eulogy enough to say that it had the honor of counting
Laplace among its pupils.

The revolutionary tempest, in dispersing the religious congregations, closed too
. soon for the young De Blainville this excellent source of instruction. He was
scarcely fifteen when he returned to a mother, weak and broken in spirits, whose
blind affection could maintain no adequate restraint over a youth of wayward

disposition. All that depends on the life of a father—all that avails the experi-
176 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE.

ence of the head of a family who conceals from the son who should support the
honor of his name none of the rude obligations of existence, is often only appre-
ciated after along series of deceptions. At tke age of nineteen, wishing to enter
into public service as an engineer, Henri de Blainville passed some months at
Rouen in a school of design. ‘The director of this establishment wrote to the
mother of his pupil: “ The character of the young man is intractable; his heart,
though vindictive, is not unrelenting; his greatest passion is a love of learning;
all the rest is a chaos of ill-combined ideas.”

To finish his studies he came to Paris, and scarcely was he there when even
the shadow of authority disappeared; he lost his mother. Delivered thence-
forth to his own guidance, too much independence became to him a dangerous
snare ; he abandoned himself to all the passions of his age, and surrounded by
trifling companions, sueceded very quickly and very gaily in dissipating his
whole patrimony.

Having attained this natural result of the life he was leading, he began to
reflect, and comprehended the necessity of supplying the resources of which he
had robbed his future existence. In his first efforts he did no more than put
forth a restless activity. By turns he appeared as a poet and essayist among
his friends, a zealous musician at the conservatory, and, in a celebrated studio,
a painter and designer of no little skill. ‘I'wo lofty principles, in the mean time,
survived in the soul of this young man—an exalted respect for his birth and a
love of knowledge.

The first of these two sentiments had, in truth, its perils; it gave rise to sin-
gular pretensions. M. de Blainville had preserved all the illusions of the
noblesse of the preceding age to such an extent that he could never, even when
his views had become sobered, entirely divest himself of the idea that by royal
prescript he was endowed with peculiar privileges. Among these, as that of
censure and authoritative assertion appeared to him the most precious, he made
use of it always and everywhere, and this rendered intercourse with him some-
what impracticable to such as did not choose to admit these obsolete claims of
feudalism.

The ardor for instruction, combined with the pious respect for family, saved
this restless nature by directing its extraordinary energy towards a noble aim.
When, shaking off the last delusions of an idle youth, our fiery gentleman found,
on attaining his twenty-eighth year, that he was ruined, without career and
without family, if a bitter regret sprung up within his heart he repressed it, and
appealing to a vigorous and unsubdued spirit, he put forth, in order to retrieve
himself, a courage worthy of his ancestors.

The crafty Phrygian slave, in ancient comedy, might exclaim: Buy your
master. M. de Blainville, though not indisposed to the same course, judged it
more prudent to comply with the tendencies of his age. Chance had conducted
him to the course of physics which Lefevre Gineau was then holding at the
College of France; and here was revealed to him a new charm, that of serious
application. He had presented himself to the professor as a modest neophyte,
but soon made himself sufficiently appreciated to be admitted into a house where
the associates of M. Gineau, all connected with the highest class of instruction,
were accustomed to assemble. It was in this circle cf eminent men that, for
the first time, he recognized his vocation. Nothing harmonized better with his
tastes and turn of mind than the authority of the chair and the dogmatic tone
of the mastér. ‘The commanding influence which superiority of knowledge ex-
ercises over men appeared to him the most enviable of attainments. He believed
that he had discovered the path which would one day conduct him to distine-
tion. From this moment persevering and ardent labor absorbed all his powers.
Submitting to judicious counsels, he entered, by a scrutinizing analysis of the
human organization, upon a career of original research, and made such extra-
ordinary efforts and rapid progress that afier two years passed in the amphi-
~e

MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE. Ti

theatres and hospitals, he proved himself a not unworthy competitor even of
Bichat, by a remarkable disquisition on experimental and comparative physi-
ology.*

The report of this transformation of character, which must have been a mat-
ter of no little surprise, and perhaps chagrin, to the noble and gay companions
of his early youth, penetrated at length into the paternal manor-house, where
the eldest of the family of De Blainville still resided. ‘Do you know what has
become of your younger brother?” said one day a communicative traveller.
“Nothing good, I suppose.” “ Let me tell you, then, that he isina path which
will lead to great renown.” ‘“Impossible!’’ exclaimed the feudal Norman; “he
never had the least inclination for employment of any sort.”

The range of his earliest labors, his address, his birth, the singularity of his
outset, caused this new adept of science to be remarked from the first. In pur-
suing all the branches of instruction at the museum he met everywhere with
generous sympathy ; and it was in this great and first school of modern natural
history that were developed, during years of profound study, the pre-emi-
nent faculties of an intelligence destined to mark its passage by force of medita-
tion, boldness of views, and tenacity in controversy.

He first attached himself to zoology, and to this he gave a distinctive charac-
ter. Especially is this character observable in what he has left us respecting
the mollusks and the zoophytes.t| When he began to occupy himself with these
two groups of beings, all the principal divisions had already been established,
the type had been definitely determined, the classes formed, these classes
divided into orders ; but there remained the genera, a labor which required
peculiar sagacity, and in this De Blainville excelled.{ His conceptions of
the genera were such as Linnzus had entertained ; nor is this the sole parallel
which I discover between himself and that naturalist of so rare a cast. These

* This disquisition, which was his thesis, bore the following title: Propositions °
extracted from an Essay on Respiration, followed by some experiments on the influence of the
eighth pair Of nerves on respiration, presented and maintained at the School of Medicine of
Paris, August 30, 1808.

t His researches on the mollusks are his best labors in practical zoology. His Manual
of Malacology forms an eminent work in anatomy, physiology, and especially analytical
classification. This work, undertaken in 1814 for the Supplement of the British Encyclopedia,
was not published till 1825. Several fragments of it had appeared in the Dictionaire des
Sciences Naturelles, and the article Conchology of that compilation is reproduced in the
Supplement, with numerous additions. The article Mollusks is also given, with extensive
developments and new monographs. ‘‘I have drawn much,”’ says M. de Blainville, ‘‘ upon
the work of Lamarck for the number and distribution of living shells, and upon that of
Defrance for fossil shells. I think,’ he adds, very judiciously, ‘‘that the species have been
generally too much multiplied. We may sometimes derive benefit from these approxima-
tions of identical or analogous fossil species, although, as I intentionally repeat, we ought
not to place an unlimited confidence in them. In all parts of the natural sciences, what is
laid down to-day is almost always susceptible of being modified to-morrow.’ (He had
adopted as a general device of his writings, Dies diem docet—day teaches day.) He thus
recapitulates the spirit of his book: ‘‘It has been my object to show that the classification of
molluscous animals may very well accord with that of shells, and that consequently their
simultaneous study must have an influence on that of each of them.”

The Manual of Actinology or Zoophytology is also an important work, but must be ranked
after the former. It is the reproduction of the article Zoophytes of the Dictionary of Natural
Sciences, but much improved. ‘‘The plan I have followed,”’ he says, ‘‘is the same with
that which I had adopted for my Manual of Malacology; I have stated, in distinct chapters,
the generalities pertaining to the organization, physiology, and natural history of all the
animals heretofore confounded under the name of zoophytes. * * * * * Thave had
in view to cite all the genera which have been proposed, in order to supply the lacune
which might exist in the Dictionary of Natural Sciences, which is not a proof, however, that
we adopt them all. * * * *.”? The last phrase is, by its turn, characteristic of the man-
ner of M. de Blainville.

t Here de Blainville had two peculiar merits—merits which also distinguished
Linnzeus—that of marking the true character of each genus, and that of ranging the genera,
one in relation to the others, agreeably to an analytical view. See in another note what I

two are perhaps the only methodical writers whose fire is not extinguished in
the treatment of details. Linnzeus gives life to those details by inventiveness of
expression ; De Blainville animates them in another manner, by making them
the vehicle of his preconceived and impassioned ideas.*

From zoology De Blainville passed without delay to comparative anatomy.
In these galleries, then so new, everything recalled to him the profound admi-
ration which he had felt when, confounded in the crowd, he had for the first time
heard the eloquent voice of the inspired restorer of the ancient science of Aris-
totle.t But this admiration itself awaked all his critical instincts, and already the
daring resolution was formed within him of some day venturing upon opposi-
tion. While he was thus musing upon the grounds of dissent and independence,
the penetrating regards of the man of genius had more than once rested upon
him. Cuvier coveted for science such proselytes; he sought them out, welcomed
them, opened to them his house and library, gave them a share in his affections,
and all in the utmost good faith, so long as they remained satellites of his re-
nown; but when, once become strong, they ventured to contest the part of the
lion, the alliance was broken.

One day, De Blainville, absorbed in meditation, saw Cuvier approach him—
the great Cuvier, then at the apogee of his brilliant career.‘ I have a proposal
to make to you,” said the man of science to him whom labor alone had as yet
designated to him, and whom he addressed for the first time. ‘ Are you dis-
posed to unite your efforts with mine in the eompletion of a great work on com-
parative anatomy with which I have been occupied for along time? You shall
have a share in my success: we shall aid one another.’ Tempted by the gratifi-
cation which a man of merit feels at being appreciated, appreciated, too, by a
superior intelligence, De Blainville promptly accepted the offer of collaboration.
No sooner, however, was he thus established in the first rank among the disci-
ples, many of them already celebrated, who lent their efforts to the execution
of works whose projection belonged exclusively to the master, than M. de
Blainville, who could never bear even the shadow of subordination, gave place
in his bosom to the feelings of a jealous susceptibility. He took tinea com-
plained with acrimony, and was heard with indulgence, even with kindness; for
much should be pardoned to him who merits much. But from the time that the
right of censure was conceded, the intractable disciple established it on so wide
a base that M. Cuvier used to say pleasantly: “Ask M. de Blainville his
opinion on any subject whatever, or even simply say to him good day, and his
reply will be, ‘No.’ ”

Compelled to a state of permanent warfare, Cuvier at least knew how to profit
by it; it discovered to him all the exposed points of his doctrines; all were
promptly seized upon by a watchful antagonist, who, in these attacks, seemed
charged with the office of those priests of antiquity who daily repeated to kings,
in the midst of their grandeur, Forget not that you are men. In requital of
services so gratuitously rendered, the master, at once judicious and adroit, neg-
lected nothing to promote the interests of this singular collaborator. After having
for ten years fulfilled a course at the athenzeum, he asked the succession for De
Blainville; selected him to supply his appointments at the College of France
and the Museum; and when the faculty of sciences was to choose a professor of
anatomy and zoology, took care to environ him as a candidate with all the means
of success. M. de Blainville was nominated, and, with independence thus
secured, acquired an absolute liberty of opposition which he used by no means
sparingly.

* Since he proceeds from ideas to facts, each new detail fot.nd is necessarily, as regards:
the preconceived idea which guides him, a peril or a proof; there is no room for indifference.

t M. de Blainville himself cheerfully acknuwleged that the brilliant success of Cuvier
as a professor had greatly contributed to the impulse which directed all his own energies
towards natural history.
‘MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE. 179

He had made no mistake in the choice of a vocation; it was in the chair of
the professor especially that De Blainville succeeded in giving lustre to his
scientific career. He possessed in the highest degree that ready affluence of
ideas, that animated turn of expression, that authoritative tone, which at once
overmaster and allure the hearer. He preferred to a calm and judicious caution
in sowing the seeds of knowledge, the forms of a bold and imposing logic. To
some young and inflammable heads he thus succeeded in communicating an ardent
sympathy for the disciple who reared himself in contradiction to a great master ;
and yet that master was Cuvier, in whose fame the youth of France so justly
exulted, but in whom they now sought, with a certain malice, to assail the su-
periority of the savant, forgetful of the claims of a noble and independent sim-
plicity.

Such successes on the part of De Blainville were not calculated to render
relations between the two more complacent. At the close of a sojourn in England,,
De Blainville returned enriched with scientific materials, and Cuvier, supposing
liis just supremacy to be still respected, asked to have them communicated to,
him. The traveller contented himself with saying: “ In order that they may
be more readily at your disposal, I am going to publish them.’ Thus all things.
portended a rupture, a pretext for which, with so unconformable a nature as.
that of De Blainville, could not long be wanting. Cuvier might regret the op~
position of an original and powerful intellect, but he knew at least how to derive:
from it the advantages of contradiction. As for De Blainville, he deprived
himself of the benefit of intimate contact with an exalted mind, endowed with,
every quality requisite for counselling and directing: right reason, luminous.
tranquillity of thought, and that good sense which is the real sovereign and final:
judge of everything in this world.

In the rudest shocks of life, the energetic man whose character I am con-
sidering seemed to find in labor renewed strength. His cotemporaries could not
but wonder at the vigor infused into his studies: profound researches, bold: dis-
cussions, exhaustive historical retrospects,* nothing, in fine, seemed to weary
the indefatigable elasticity of this ardent and active mind. In 1822 he published
the first volume of a general treatise on comparative anatomy,? and with this
work a new doctrine made its appearance. Cuvier had just reared the science
on the experimental method, which proceeds from facts to ideas. In the efforts
of De Blainville this order was reversed, and all his labors were based upon the
opposite method.

His first care was to form an abstract type of the living being. Buffon had
said: “ We can distinguish in the animal economy two parts, of which the first
acts perpetually, without any interruption, and the second acts only at inter-
vals. ‘The action of the heart and lungs appears to be that first part; the
action of the senses and the movement of the body and members seem to be the
second.’ This view became the principle of Bichat’s celebrated distinetion of
two lives—organic life and animal life. Buffon proceeds to say: “If we clothe
the interior part with a suitable envelope—that is to say, if we give to it senses
and members—the animal life will presently manifest itself, and the more senses,
members, and other exterior parts the envelope contains, the more complete will

* The Dictionary of Natural Sciences contains a great number of very considerable
articles by M. de Blainville, who was at the same time one of the most active collaborators
of the Bulletin de la Societé Philumathique. It may be added, and with literal truth, that
during the whole militant life of our savant there appeared nothing on natural histoyy which
did not undergo on his part a sort of adverse discussion. Placed by the legacy of his friend
M. de Lamétherie at the head of the Journal of Physics, he furnished, from 1818 to 1822,
a series of historical reswmés, in reading which one cannot fail to be struck with the extent
and variety of the knowledge displayed.

t This volume, the only one he published, is entitled ‘‘ De ’ Organization des Animauz,
ou Principes d’ Anatomie Comparée,”’ and is occupied with the study of the skin and apparatus
of the senses in all the classes.
e
180 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE.

the animal life appear, and the more perfect will be the animal.” M. de Blain
ville combines the two ideas of Buffon. In effect, there are, in life itself, two
lives, the life of nutrition and that of sensation. Of the general envelope, Buffon
saw but the exterior part, the seat of the sensations; M. de Blainville sees this
envelope continued, turned inward, penetrating into the interior, and becoming
there the seat of the respiratory and digestive functions. And, as there are two
lives, so are there two grand systems of apparatus, the vascular and the nervous
apparatus; and on these two depend all the organs: on the first the organs of
sense and of motion; on the second the organs of secretion and nutrition. |

The abstract type of the living being once established, a new frame-work is
furnished to M. de Blainville wherein all the details of comparative anatomy—
details almost infinite in number—become classified and concentrated. The
different structures appear only as realized instances of one first conception.
The dogmatic process is substituted for the experimental, and M. de Blainville,
having impressed the science with the form of his own genius and originality,
might also consider himself a master, and a great master.*

So many and such strenuous labors had long since marked out for M. de
Blainville a place in the Academy; he was called to it in 1825.t In 1830, a
royal ordinance having divided into two that part of the instruction of the Mu-
seum devoted to the demonstration of invertebrate animals, he was naturally
designated, from his admirable labors on the mollusks and zoophytes, for the
occupancy of one of the chairs. ‘Thus, though late in his application to the
sciences, he had acquired the best position which they can confer, and saw the
destiny accomplished which he had traced for himself when, in a moment of
spleen, he had said to Cuvier: “I shall take my seat one day at the Institute
and the Museum, beside you, in face of you, and in spite of you.” The last
phrase was an injustice, for it assumed an animosity which did not exist; but
it would have been to diminish the enjoyment to have ceased to believe in it :
experience had simply proved to Cuvier the difficulty of their relations, and had
made him distrustful of them.

M. de Blainville had now arrived at that age when a man of superior intellect
feels the necessity of connecting his collective ideas by some philosophic bond.
His long studies on zoology had led him to see in the animal kingdom only a
continuous series of beings, which, becoming at each stage more animated, more
sensitive, more intelligent,t ascend from the most inferior animals up to man;
an elevated view, which was that of Aristotle in antiquity, as it was that of
Leibnitz in modern times. “The continuity of gradations,” says Aristotle,
“conceals the limits which separate beings, and withdraws from the eye the
point which divides them.” “I love maxims which are self-supporting,” said
Leibnitz; and we know that, to have such maxims, he had conceived the idea
of reducing them all to one. His philosophy has but one principle, that of con-
tinuity. Hach being, in the globe that we inhabit, is connected with all others,
and that globe itself with all globes. “ With M. Leibnitz,” said Fontenelle, “one
would have seen either the end of things, or that they have no end.”

Never has a scientific idea experienced more vicissitudes than that of the scale
of beings. All the naturalists of the eighteenth century admit it. ‘‘ The progres-
sion of nature is effected by insensible shadings,” says Buffon. ‘ Nature makes

* It is to be regretted that this production, conceived with so much vigor, should have
remained incomplete. It would be difficult to find a mind suited for the continuation of the
work, and capable of reducing the whole of comparative anatomy to the dogmatic form.

+ He had been presented as early as 1814, and even at that early period with just title,
to replace M. Olivier.

t This idea of series was with him always predominant. See especially his remark-
able Prodrome d’une Nouvelle Distribution Systématique du Régne Animal, 1816; his article
on the word Animal, in the Supplément du Dictionaire des Sciences Naturelles, published in
1840, and his great work Osteographie Comparée.
2

no leaps,” exclaims Linneus. Bonnet exhausts himself in well-meant etforts to
find everywhere equivocal species with which to supply vacancies. At length
Cuvier appears, and all idea of continuity, of sequence, is excluded. The animal
kingdom is distributed into groups; definite, circumscribed, profoundly separated,
without connexion, without transition. Cuvier is followed by M. de Blainville ;
and with him the serves of beings reappears, and now at least with more develop-
ment and completeness,* more nearly demonstrated throughout, and, what is
here the last step, essentially connected with the doctrine, every day better un-
derstood and more respected, of final causes.t

The chain of beings thus linked together and adapted one to another evidently
implies a fixed design, a consistent.plan, an end foreseen. Final causes are the
highest philosophic expression of our sciences, and at the same time the most
cheering ; it is a pleasure of a high order to discover and contemplate that won-
derful assemblage of so many different forms and forces combined in proportions
so just. ‘The spectacle of an infinite wisdom diffuses calm over the human spirit.
“Tt is no small thing,” said Leibnitz, ‘to be content with God and with the uni-
verse.” :

In 1832 a severe blow was sustained by science; Cuvier was too soon lost
tous. The administration of the Museum decided to transfer M. de Blainville
to the chair in which the modern Aristotle had achieved immortality. From
that time, it was in the close neighborhood of the collections, due to a half cen-
tury of inappreciable labors, that M. de Blainville, a vigilant and almost jealous
guardian, pitched his tent; it was a true tent, an abode worthy of our savants
of the middle age, where he reproduced both their long meditations and their
exhaustless enthusiasm.

* In order properly to understand M. de Blainville in his different labors, regard must
everywhere be had to the profound influence exercised upon him by M. Cuvier. The proof
of this influence will be found even in this question of the animal series, which is one of
those on which he has most constantly opposed him.

M. Cuvier, taking the nervous system as a guide, had established four principal divisions
of the animal kingdom—the vertebrata, the motlusca, the articulata, and the radiata or
zoophytes. It is on the nervous system also that M. de Blainville constructs his theory, only
he separates the last division of M. Cuvier, that of the radiata, into two, which gives him
five divisions instead of four—the osteozoa, which answer to the vertebrata; the entomozoa,
which correspond to the articulata; the malacozoa to the mollusks ; the actinozoa and the
‘amorphozoa, which represent the radiata. Such are the five grand types of the animal
kingdom, and it is easy to perceive how upon these is established the ascending series or
scale. Mounting by successive steps from the amorphozoa to the osteozoa, he passes to the
consideration of this latter great type, and instead of the four classes—mammals, birds,
reptiles, and fishes—he subdivides it into seven—mammals, birds, pterodactyls, (a lost class
of reptiles, ) reptiles, icthyosauri, (another lost class of reptiles, ) amphibia, (the batrachians
of Cuvier,) and fishes. Here alsoit may easily be seen how the ascending scale is developed;
it remounts from fishes to amphibia, from amphibia to icthyosauri, from these to reptiles, trom
reptiles to pterodactyls, from the latter to birds, and from birds to mammals. The class of
mammals is divided into three sub-classes—monodelphs, didelphs, and ornithodelphs ; and
here again the same ascending gradation is seen, from ornithodelphs to didelphs, and from
these to monodclphs. Without entering into further details, it will be seen from what has
been stated how M. de Blainville modifies, and almost always multiplies, by subdividing,
the groups of M. Cuvier; how he connects, while inteecalating in his scale, the lost with the
living species ; how he applies to the groups themselves, to types, to classes, to orders, &c.,
the ideas of series, gradation, ascent, which had till then been more particularly applied to
species. His scale is, in the first place, the scale of groups; but he does not stop there.
Just as in the entire kingdom there is the series of principal groups or types, there is in
each type the series of classes, in each class the series of orders, in each order the series of
genera, in each genus the series of species. It is a succession of series superposed in line,
always ascending and always direct.

t ‘The conception of jinal causes,” says M. de Blainville, ‘‘leads rigorously and
necessarily to the demonstration of a Being whose intelligence is infinite, and enables us to
discern, not only for each created being in itself, but for each group of beings, and in the
whole assemblage of beings, a plan, a necessary harmony, and within the preconceived
limits.’ * * * * * (Article: Animal of the Suppl. du Dict. des Sciences Naturelles.)

182 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE

Passing his life in a sombre apartment, buried in the depths of a vast arm-
chair, encompassed with a triple rampart of heaps of books, original drawings,
anatomical preparations and disordered instruments, if sometimes a studious dis-
ciple obtained admittance to him, it was necessary to surmount more than one
obstacle, and not less difficult to find a chair than a place for it when found. If at
length, after this difficult installation, reference to some volume became necessary
in the heat of research, it must be drawn generally from the base of a mountain
of books, whose displacement was not the less chaotic and tumultuous for being
often repeated. Did an adventurous visitor, after much solicitation, obtain ac-
cess to the inviolable asylum, when as yet he was scarcely more than on the
threshold, and without a sense of Iris presence being manifested by any move-
ment, a grave and sonorous voice would address to him the invariable question :
What is needed for your service, Monsieur? The stranger, sometimes, discon-
certed by the apparently inextricable confusion of thelabyrinth before him, or aware
too late of the inconvenience imposed on a profound thinker by the derangement
of his ideas, would seek safety in a hasty retreat. But if the first expressions
of the visitor disclosed a personage worthy of a learned conference, M. de Blain-
ville, at once raising his head and divesting himself of the thoughts in which he
was absorbed, would employ all the advantages which his facile elocution placed
at the service of a vast fund of knowledge, and the auditor, charmed by so
much courtesy, might expose himself, by prolonging his visit, to the danger
that after his departure the laborious savant should once more repeat the phrase :
Another hour lost. Was it a former pupil, on the other hand, who came to clear
up some questionable point, he might with confidence surmount every barrier
and count on the most cordial reception; for, if M. de Blainville exacted from
his disciples a species of feudal fidelity and homage, he at least requited it by
an affection which was little less than paternal.

It was from this sanctuary of study that, after having been long held in re-
serve, there issued one day, in full panoply, like Minerva from the brain of
Jupiter, the emphatic contradiction of all the arguments on which Cuvier had
founded the new science of paleontology.

The first germ of this surprising science of Jost existences rested on the old
belief of a general and ancient deluge. In vain did the scholastic philosophy
pretend that fossil shells were only sports of nature ; in vain did the philosopher
Voltaire, who, for very unphilosophic reasons, would not admit, on any terms,
that there had been a deluge, send forth his pilgrims to seek for an explanation
of the dispersion of marine shells: neither sporss of nature nor pilgrims availed
anything. Sustained by the evidence of the fact and by ineffaceable tradition,
the common sense of mankind asserted its right of dissent.

In the seventeenth century, attention, which had been excited by the fossil
shells, was transferred to the gigantic bones preserved in the bowels of the earth,
and whose origin was not involved in less obscurity. In 1696 some bones of the
elephant were discovered in the principality of Gotha. The Grand Duke called
together his council of savants, and the council pronounced, with unanimity,
that these were sports of nature. About the same time were found in the prov-
ince of Dauphiny some bones of the animal which we now call the mastodon.
A surgeon of the country buys these bones and has them brought to Paris,
where he exhibits them for money, affirming in his advertisement that they
were taken from a sepulchre thirty feet long, and that they are the remains of a
giant, a king of one of the tribes of barbarians who were defeated near the
Rhone by Marius. All Paris was eager to see this trophy of the glory of
Marius; and, agreeably to its almost constant usage, Paris, after having at first
believed all that was told it, presently made a mock of all that it had at first
believed.

With the eighteenth century comes at last a serious study of the subject.
Gmelin and Pallas bring to our knowledge the fossil bones of Siberia; they inform

I
MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE. 183

us that these bones are found there in prodigious quantity, comprising those of
the rhinoceros, the elephant, and gigantic ruminants. Who shall be the fortu-
nate interpreter of these strange facts? Gmelin and Pallas conclude that a vast
irruption of the sea, from the southeast, could alone have transported into the
regions of the north these extraordinary relics, which all pertain to animals of
the south. Buffon, now almost an octogenarian, conceives, with more pene-
trating insight, the idea of Jost species. “The bones preserved in the bosom of
the earth are witnesses,” he says, “as authentic as unexceptionable, of the past
existence of different colossal species of all the races now in existence.” And
with eloquent emotion, he adds: “It is with regret that I quit these precious
monuments of ancient nature, which my advanced age does not leave me time
to examine. This study of beings which have disappeared would alone require
more time than remains for me to live, and I can only recommend it to posterity.
Others,” he continues, “will come after me * * *;” and the prophecy has
been fulfilled. To the honor of our age, Cuvier creates for himself a new art;
he touches these scattered remains, and recalls before our astonished eyes ghe
extinct races of the earth.

He interrogates each stratum of the earth, and each yields him a peculiar
population. He finds first the crustacea, the mollusks, the fishes ; then reptiles,
then mammals, but mammals of which the race no longer exists: the races
which exist to-day he finds only on the present surface of the earth. It follows
that life is developed only gradually, progressively; and the admirable theory
of the succession of beings arises and offers itself as the surest deduction from
the best-established observations. There have been, according to Cuvier, re-
peated but partial and successive creations: these multiple populations have
gone on improving at the same time that they were diversified ; and for the sud-
den disappearance of so many species at once, nothing less could have been
necessary than violent and abrupt causes.

M. de Blainville takes up each of these propositions, one after the other, and
contests them all.* He adopts a single and simultaneous creation; a first and

* The following four propositions, whose elements are drawn from his great work on
Osteography, form a. comprehensive summary of the ideas of M. de Blainville on paleon-
tology: First, a creation, single and consequently complete; secondly, that creation, com-
plete at the moment when it proceeded from the hand of God, becomes afterwards incom-
plete in proportion as species perish, for each race becoming extinct leaves a gap; thirdly,
causes the most natural, the most simple, the action of may, &c., have sufficed to destroy
the extinct races, as they still suffice to destroy before our eyes the living races; fourthly,
there is therefore no need, in order to explain these continuous destructions, of having
recourse to general and extraordinary revolutions, to cataclysms.

Proposition 1. There has been but one creation. ‘‘We may find here,” says M. de Blain-
ville, with reference to the manatee, ‘‘a new proof that the fossil species, whose analogues
we no longer recognize, are but extinct terms of the animal series produced by the thought
of the creative power, and by no means, as has been too often said, and is still repeated
every day, the remains of an ancient creation, which has given place to a new and more
perfect one—an assertion easy to make, but incapable of being sustained by any legitimate
ee in favor of so rash an opinion.” (Manatus, p. 128.) In speaking of pal@ocherium,
1e says: ‘‘ Although none of these species have been found alive, we are yet forced to con-
clude that it is impossible to admit with certain naturalists that they can be considered as a
primitive form of some existing species which are but a transformation of them, and still less
that these have replaced them in consequence of a new creation, as many say, without good
reasons it is true, since we have shown that they fill an actual chasm in the intelligible
series created by divine power for an intelligent purpose.” (Pal@othertums, p. 153.) With
reference to two or three fossil species of the rhinoceros, he says: ‘‘ There are two or three
links of the animal series which have been destroyed before other congeners, existing still
in less inhabited parts of the ancient continent, and which can in no manner be considered as
transformations of the former, and still less as the product of a new creation, as it is at
present somewhat the fashion to suppose for each stratum of the sedimentary formations.”
Rhinoceros, p. 222.)

Proposition 2. This single creation, at first complete, presents at present vacancies which
extinct species supply. ‘‘These mammals,” says M. de Blainville, alluding to certain

‘
184 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE.

complete population, subject to incessant extinctions; and for this continuous
destruction he requires nothing but slow and ordinary causes. You pretend,
he exclaims, that at each of your supposed revolutions the great Author of
created beings has recommenced his work! But observe first the general
resemblance which allies the living with the lost species; notwithstanding
all your sagacity, you have not succeeded in distinguishing, by any certain
criterion, the fossil elephant from the present elephant of the Indies.* You are
forced to acknowledge that, among animal fossils, there are many found which
differ in nothing from living animals.t The facts on which you found your
theory are therefore insufficient and incomplete; and incomplete facts cannot be
prescribed as a limit to our conjectures.

In default of complete facts of which he, no more than Cuvier, is possessed,
M. de Blainville seeks a higher reason which may supply its place and deliver
his impatient spirit from the pain of hesitation. This higher reason seems to
him to consist in the wnity of the kingdom of nature; and here science is indebted
to him for an important step in advance. So long as he had confined himself
to"the study of present species, the animal series had everywhere presented to
him gaps and vacuities; everywhere beings were found wanting. At this

species of smaller bears pertaining to the same orders, the same families, and to the same
Linnzean genera with those which still live on the earth, ‘tare not, however, always of like
species; but they fill in an admirable manner the gaps which the living animal series at
present offers.” (Sub-ursus.) ‘‘ As a definite conclusion,’ says M. de Blainville, ‘‘ we find
in the dinotherias, which seem to have disappeared at a very early period from the surface
of the earth, a step, a term in that animal series which religious philosophy, the only true and
good one, unavoidably accepts, but which science demonstrates the more easily in propor-
tion as the question is judiciously considered, and a greater number of elements can be
employed.” (Dinotherium, p. 61.)

Proposition 3. The extinct races have perished through natural causes, which are still
acting every day. ‘The largest species are those which have first disappeared; and we may
even now observe that the same thing is taking place under our eyes in regard to the species
still existing on the surface of the earth.”’ (Sub-wrsus, p. 116.) ‘The rhinoceros is in the
condition of the elephants, which, because of their great size and their biennial uni-parturi-
tion, perish earlier—that is, first among terrestrial animals—as a consequence especially of
the multiplication of the human species upon the earth.’’ (Rhinoceros, p. 221.) He says of
some species of fossil viverra: ‘‘'These species have disappeared, as we see disappear at
present, by little and little, the genet, the civet, and the ichneumon, though half domes-
ticated.”’ (Viverra, p. 94.)

Proposition 4. There has not since the creation of living beings been any general and
extraordinary revolution of the globe. M. de Blainville says, in speaking of bears: ‘“‘A
single species of this genus has ceased to exist, a species which in Europe completed the
genus, as it is complete in Asia and America; a feebler species, and inhabiting the part of
Europe most anciently civilized, and at the same time, perhaps, the most pepulous, which
must have hastened its disappearance from the number of beings at present in existence; so
that the state of things in relation to this genus would demand no cataclysm, no change in
the present conditions of existence of the earth, but only incessant progress in the develop-
ment of the human species in Europe.” (Bears, p. 88.) ‘‘The bones of fossil small bears
might have been carried, whether united or separated, and often already broken, with mate-
riais of different nature borne by the atmospheric waters into the places of deposit, where we
now find some of them by hazard, without there having been required catastrophe or change
in the ambient mediums to determine their destruction.”” (Sub-ursus, p. 115.)

*~ The fossil elephant of M. Cuvier—the mammoth of Russia—is, according to M. de
Blainville, only the present elephant of Asia. ‘‘ The definite result, to which we are con-
ducted by a rigorous logic, is that in the actual state of our collections, at least,at the
Museum of Paris, it is still nearly impossible to prove that the fossil elephant, of which so
many remains are found in the earth, differs specifically from the still existing elephant of

ndia,”’

t ‘*There are some doubtful species, which will affect more or less the certainty of
results so long as precise distinctions shall not have been reached respecting them. Tlius,
the horses, the buffaloes, which are found with the elephants, have net as yet peculiar
specific characters; and the geologists who do not choose to adopt my different epochs for
the fossil bones will still be able to derive from them an argument so much the more con-
venient as it is from my book they will take it.” (Cuvier. Discourse on the Revolutions of
the Surface of the Globe.)

MEMO’R OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE. 185

point, by a happy inspiration of genius, he discerns in nature which has per-
ished the beings which are wanting in nature as it exists,* and, with surprising
skill, he interealates among living species the fossil species ; thus asserting, and,
first among naturalists, discovering to us the wnity ef the animal kingdom.
That kingdom is therefore one, and the unity of that kingdom seems the first
demonstrated point in the unity of creation.

Having thus stated the opposite opinions of the two authors, let us turn to
their methods, which will be found not less opposed. Cuvier follows facts,
alike resolved to wait for them however slowly they may arrive, and to accept
the result which they yield him, whatever it may be: whether the theory of
successive creations, if species continue to be found everywhere separated and
superposed, or the theory of a single and simultaneous creation, should it be
found eventually that they occur anywhere intermingled and confounded.
M. de Blainville assumes a great fact, which he transforms into a principle: the
fact of the unity of the animal kingdom, and from that unity he boldly deduces
the unity of creation. Thus there is, on one side, always the experimental
method, with its process sure and its results uncertain; on the other, always
the dogmatic method, with its result presented as certain, but obtained by a
process which is not sure.

The human mind in making use of methods and judging them has this quality
of excellence, that it finds no repose except in the full and entire knowledge of
things. It is this restless seeking for truth, a movement impressed upon tke
mind by a divine impulse, which constitutes its force in labor and its joy in
discovery. In the new study which we have been considering, a multitude of
facts, i mean necessary facts, are still wanting to us. We have explored but a
part of the surface of the globe. There are places where, in reference to so
grave a discussion, nature may well be surprised at not having been interro-
gated. There will arise intrepid explorers who will lay open unknown regions.
There will arise new thinkers. 'The noble science of Cuvier and De Blainville—
for, from the very opposition of ideas, the two names will remain united—has
reached that elevated point at which it is able to propound with precision the
problem upon which it is divided; and this problem of the successive or simut-
taneous order of created beings is surely, in the domain of natural history, one
of the grandest which the genius of men has ever conceived.

Absorbed in contemplations of so high a nature, M. de Blainville became less
and less disposed to comply with those relations of amenity which render life
easy. To excuse himself to his own conscience, he attributed to rigidity of
principle what was at best but error of judgment. He was now in possession
of the substantial privileges of suecess; but this did not diminish his pretensions.
He brought them all into this Academy, in spite of the admonition given us by
Fontenelle: “Here it was intended that everything should be simple; that no
one should think himself under an obligation to be im the right; that no system
should govern, and that the door should always remain open for truth.” To
one who had but too well learned in the professor’s chair the full value of the
law of the strongest, this privilege of being in the right appeared intolerable
when it no longer applied to himself alone. In replies marked by a tone of
peremptory authority, M. de Blainville was apt to forget that he had descended
from the chair, and that here all the seats are equal. ‘ Doubtless,” as was said
by the sagacious historian just cited in speaking of one of his colleagues, “ the
‘search for truth demands in the Academy liberty of contradiction; but all society

* Nothing in the book of M. de Blainville is at the same time more ingenious and
true than this remark, namely, that the more lacune a group of mammifers presents, the
more vacancies between its living species, so much the greater is the number of fossil species
which it counts. The actual pachyderms afford only scattering species, and there are many
fossil pachyderms. The monkeys, on the other hand, present numerous aud closely crowded
species, and there are few fossil monkeys, &c.
186 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE.

exacts in contradiction a certain deference, and he did not recollect that the
Academy isa society. We did not cease to discern his merit through his man-
ner, but for this some little effort of equity was required, and that effort it is
always better to spare mankind the trouble of making.”

Not that these ‘efforts of equity’? were wanting in the case of M. de Blain-
ville, any more than the terror with which, by his fierce attacks and stubborn
disputativeness, he had succeeded in inspiring the most hardy academicians.
He seemed at the last to have adopted an extreme resolution ; and,

As if he had designed
To break all terms of commerce with mankind,

he withdrew from our reunions, and, in the spirit of Moliere’s Alcestis, who
yearned to find— °

Some nook of earth, if earth such nook can give,
Where honest candor might have leave to live,

he fairly barricaded himself, as has been shown, in the depths of his cabinet.

He had undertaken to give, in a great work on comparative osteography,™ ~
the description and demonstration of the collections confided to him, and super-
intended, with characteristic severity of attention, the drawings which none
could better judge of than himself. ‘This enterprise involved enormous expense,
and had every claim to the encouragement which authority everywhere extends
to vast and important publications. It was but simple justice that the work
should be placed under the patronage of the government. But to obtain this,
it would have been necessary to make suit, or, at least, submit his claims, and
never was misanthrope more singularly bent on preserving all the prerogatives
of an intractable humor. Taking high ground, and with reason, in regard to
the value of the author and the work, he assumed that his wishes should haye
been anticipated and his acceptance solicited ; for, over and above the hatred
which he had vowed to the human race, he endowed with a superior and priv-
ileged degree of irritation all that bore the guise of authority, and that by
which we were then governed chafing him in his prepossessions as a gentleman,
he could not be brought to condescend so far as to honor it with a request.
He suffered of course, complained bitterly, and had the satisfaction of accusing
all the world: colleges, Academy, ministry, government, all were culpable, all
except himself, who would abate no jot of his punctiliousness, and thereby only
succeeded in dispelling all possibility of finishing his learned and gigantic
catalogue. '

This man, whose captious spirit took fire at the very appearance of a favor
conferred by power, and whose antecedents by no means announced a concilia-
tor, employed himself, about this time, in a work of the most delicate concilia-
tion. Under the title of a History of the Sciences of Organization, adopted as a
Basis of Philosophy,t he published, in 1845, a work whose object, he said, was
the alliance of philosophy and religion.

Always led away by preconceived views, he carries into history the same
method as into philosophy. He constitutes types: Aristotle is the type of the
natural sciences in antiquity, Albert the Great in the middle ages, and, in our

of the Skeleton and Dental System of the Five Classes of Vertebrate Animals, Recent and
Fossil, to Serve as a Basis for Zoology and Geology. 1839-'50. It is from the ideas scat-
tered in different parts otf this great work, incomplete as it unfortunately is, that I have
derived the paleontological doctrine of M. de Blainville; for he had not the same good fortune
with M. Cuvier, of collecting in a single discours the sum of his researches and views.
Death surprised him’ before he had finished his task; and to reproduce now the doctrine
which he labored with so much fearlessness and ardor, we have but scattered elements, often
left incompletein unfinished pages.

t In this work M. Abbé Manfried co-operated with him, and it is scarcely necessary
to say that my remarks only apply to that part of the book pertaining to M. de Blainville.
MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE. 187

own days, M. de Lamarck. He nearly suppresses all the rest of naturalists, and,
in his impassioned delineations, fails to remember that history is a judge, and
that’ the first duty of a judge is impartiality. Nor is he less rash as a diplo-
matist than historian: seeking the first principles of his philosophy in Lamarck,
Gall, and Broussais, whom he calls the three great philosophers of our age, and
thus encumbered with no light baggage of materialism, he ventures into uncer-
tain paths, and misses the only sure one, which Bossuet had followed in his
immortal treatise of the Knowledge of God and of ourselves. But it was labor
and time lost. The science of organization cannot be the basis of philosophy.
The domains are separated. What we now call philosophy, what Descartes
called, by a more precise term, metaphysics, has but one object, profoundly cir-
cumscribed—the study of the soul.

As an analytical appreciation of the progress of the human mind in the
natural sciences, the book of M. de Blainville had been preceded by one of M.
Cuvier on the same subject,* a production slowly matured and of a calmer spirit.
In comparing the latter work with the other, one is involuntarily reminded of
the well-known line :

My phlegm’s as philosophic as your spleen.

A wide interval separates the penetrating sagacity which detects the weak side
in the ideas of others from the deliberate reflection which sits in judgment on its
own. 'l'oo impatient to subject his theories to a severe analysis, but too pru-
dent to leave them exposed to attacks which might incur danger, M. de Blain-
ville made use of stratagem: he carried the war among his adversaries, and,
allowing them neither peace nor truce, compelled them to hold themselves always
on the defensive.

The necessity of success, an implacable tyrant, in him inspired by turns the
stubborn disputant and the fascinating professor; and it was because in the
latter character success was certain that in entering upon the functions of the
master, not only did he put forth all his intellectual superiority, but he ds-
played likewise his better moral qualities: the confidence of being useful, the
hope of being loved, the charm of appreciation, removed then all the asperities
of the surfaca The sentiment of recognized pre-eminence sufficed to dispel all
roughness and pretension ; and confident of his strength, nor yet affecting any
concealment of his efforts, he gained much by being seen in this light. One
day, at the exit from a lecture, a former scholar drew near in order to congratu-
late him on the happy manner in which he had just treated an important ques-
tion. “I am glad that you are satisfied,” rejoined M. de Blainville; “the
subject was difficult, and for eight days I have meditated upon this lecture from
nine o’clock in the morning until midnight.”” This avowal discovers a strict
conscientiousness, for no one ever possessed more than he the gift of brilliant
improvisation. He has been known, after an hour and a half occupied in rich
and animated lecturing, on being excited by some objection, to begin anew to
discourse and argue, with closed doors, regaining at once all his strength and re-
sources, conceding nothing, and remaining always the last champion in the field.

An ardor like this for disputation subjected to singular vicissitudes friendships
which certainly ran no risk of growing languid through dull acquiescence. The
faithful associate,t the sage Pylades of this impetuous Orestes, once said to me:
“ For nearly half a century that our intimacy has lasted, it has been rather
cherished and cemented by discussion than by perfect agreement.” In effect,
if M. de Blainville obtained, sooner than suited him, a triumph for the thesis

188 MEMOIR OF DUCROTAY DE BLAINVILLE.

which he was supporting, he would presently take in hand the opposite thesis.
But what, it would be impatiently asked, what then is decidedly your opinion ?
Is it yes? No, it is not yes. Isit xo? I have just proved to you that it can
not be zo. It must needs, however, be one or the other; decide. Ok ho! he
would exclaim, you forget, then, that 1am a Norman. And in him everything,
physical as well as moral, recalled that origin. He was of medium stature, but
of a remarkable vigor. His eye, lively, penetrative, observant, revealed a supe-
rior nature. ‘The simplicity of his exterior denoted his confidence in a personal
value which chose to borrow nothing from honorary distinctions, distinctions for
which he manifested a plenary indifference. No ostentation, no petty vanity
sunk this man to a lower level. He seemed to have settled in his own mind
that by study alone can life be invested with dignity or value.*

Under all its envelopes, and | however seemingly impenetrable, the heart, when
once touched, was but the more unreserved in its effusions. Become possessor
of the small manorial domain of his ancestors, M. de Blainville returned yearly
to visit its shores and hills, to breathe the invigorating air of the sea, and to re-
call the tender images which had soothed his earlier years. During the time
that he thus occupied his little manor, the man of science disappeared, and the
gentleman showed himself no cynic. An unaffected amiability accompanied
him into society, and in that of ladies especially he displayed a playfulness and
good taste which banished into the distant and lowering horizon of science every
misanthropic impulse. His delight in the revival of associations found other
aliment in the reunion of the representatives of all the epochs of his lite. Fre-
quently assembled around him on such occasions, this circle of friends was open
to all philosophies, to the most opposite opinions, to all social positions, to every
age. For the youngest among them the severe critic and profound thinker ever
entertained a warm and watchful regard, which, it is but just to say, was re-
quited, not only by unlimited devotion, but, since his death, by a pious care for
the memory of the distinguished savant.t

At the beginning of the year 1850, M. de Blainville thought it his duty, not-
withstanding the alteration of his health, to open his course at the Faculty of
sciences. In his first lectures, he reappeared with a talent which had lost
nothing of its force or brilliancy. Impelled, however, by sad presentiments, he
quitted, on the Ist of May, his modest habitation at the Museum, promising a
speedy return. He was but going, he said, to breathe his native air, and see
the sun of spring once more shine on the fair coasts of Normandy.{

His purpose was not fulfilled. Searcely had he taken his place in the vehicle
which was to convey him, when, by a sudden stroke, this noble existence was
terminated, On the public authority it devolved to extend that protection to
his last moments which it owes to the humblest citizen, and to restore to his
friends and colleagues the mortal remains of one so worthy of respect, one by
whom the nothingness of life had never been forgotten.

* T scarcely need say that M. de Blainville belonged to most of the learned societies of
the world, and of course to the Royal Society of London. He was a member of the Legion
ef Honor, and if he remained a simple chevalier it was only because he preferred it.

t All the manuscripts of the great naturalist were scrupulously collected by his young
friend M. Nicard, who prepared, also, a notice breathing a spirit of enthusiastic veneration.

¢ This love of his native place was one of the prominent features of his character, as
was also the love of his family. The son and daughter of his elder brother were long ‘the
only ties of kindredship which remained to him.
REPORT ON THE TRANSACTIONS

OF THE

SOCIETY OF PHYSICS AND NATURAL STORY OF GENEVA,

FROM JULY, 1863, TO JUNE, 1864.

BY DR. CHOSSAT, PRESIDENT.

TRANSLATED FOR THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

SSS ee

In conformity with article 7 of our laws, I am about to present to the society
an account of its transactions and its progress during the year in which I have
had the honor of being called to preside over it. The society, I regret to say,
publishes no special bulletin of its sittings; the annual report of the president,
at the close of his official term, is intended to supply its place. This, however,
it can only do imperfectly, because, from the necessarily tardy date of its pub-
lication, some of the results communicated must have partially lost the character
of finality. However this may be, the greater portion of the labors of the year
have been successively inserted either in the present volume of memoirs, or in
the archives of the physical and natural sciences of the Bubliothéque Universelle ;
so that my task to-day will be limited to a concise recapitulation of those labors.

Since the end of September last, the society has been deprived of the special
collaboration of our excellent colleague, Professor Claparéde, whose infirm health
has obliged him to withdraw from the functions of secretary of our sittings—
functions which for many years he discharged in so distinguished a manner.
His place has been filled, provisionally at first, by MM. Alexander Prevost and
de Loriol; and definitively since, by M. Alexander Prevost alone, whom you
designated for this office 21st January last. Such has been the obligingness of
these gentlemen, and so clear and detailed their report of the current proceed-
ings of the society, that the execution, always more or less difficult, of my
present duty has been facilitated to the utmost possible degree; and I shall be
permitted, I am sure, to present to them, as well in the name of the society as
my own, the most sincere acknowledgments.

Agreeably to the usage adopted in former reports, the present account will be
divided into two principal parts: that of the physical and that of the natural
sciences ; parts which will be then subdivided into as many special sections as
the nature of the communications made to the society may prescribe. In each
of these sections we shall speak, first, of the original memoirs which have been
read; and next, say something of the verbal reports which have been made to
the society during the year. We commence with astronomy.

PHYSICAL SCIENCES.

AstTronomMY—Memoirs.—M. Emile Gautier read two memoirs on the consti-
tution of the sun. With M. Kirchhoff, he regards this body as a globe in fusion,
190 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY OF

- incandescent, and surrounded with a vast atmosphere; he conceives that this
atmosphere, constituted chiefly of thick and metallic vapors, must be incom-
parably more dense than the terrestrial atmosphere, and he attributes to it the
protuberances and roseate border observed in total eclipses, as well as the dap-
pled appearance of the surface of the sun. But he denies to it the action
attributed by M. Kirchhoff in the production of the solar spots.

As regards these spots, M. Gautier considers them to be connected with oxy-
dations, with masses of salts and scorix, with solidifications, in a word, which
are temporarily formed on the surface of the sun; and this, under the influence
of exterior refrigeration or interior chemical action, in much the same manner as
is observed in great masses of metals in fusion, in our industrial operations. The
author admits the results of M. Speerer and those of M. Carrington regarding
the apparent differences in the duration of the rotation of the sun, according to
the heliographic latitude of such of the spots as are adopted for the calculation
of this rotation. And in reference to the acceleration in longitude of the points
of the equatorial zone, he considers it, with our colleague M. Cellerier, as re-
sulting from the’action exerted upon the solidified masses floating on the surface
of the sun, whether by the friction of the heavy and metallic atmosphere of that
orb, or by the interior rotary movement of the strata of its mass infusion. These
two components being both a function of the velocity and of the cosine of the
latitude, (though this cosine has a different power for each of the two compo-
nents,) they vary with each parallel, and their resultant may supply the reason
of the acceleration in question. For the rest, although the ‘author does not con-
‘sider the mean density of the sun to be inferior to that of water, yet he admits
that its low degree of density might form a serious objection to his theory of the
spots, an objection which will be met on his part by a deliberate and thorough
examination.

Professor Pluntamour read us an extract from a very interesting memoir on
the horary and telegraphic operations, by means of which the longitude of the
observatory of Neuchatel has been connected with that of the observatory of
Geneva. These operations have led to some new results on the employment of
the telegraph in determinations of this nature. But, as the paper of M. Planta-
mour appears in the present volume of the collection of our memoirs, we confine
ourselves to a simple mention of it. The same physicist presented a note on the
rectifications to be applied to the general system of levelling for Switzerland,
and on the choice to be made, as a point of departure above the sea, between the
mean level of the Mediterranean at Marseilles and the mean level of the ocean,
as the latter results from very exact measurements executed in nineteen of the
principal ports of France between Bayonne and Dunkirk. M. Plantamour would
prefer the level of the ocean, the mean of which is 0.80 higher than the mean
level of the Mediterranean at Marseilles.

Verbal reports.—Professor Alfred Gautier presented statements, full of in-
terest, on several astronomical labors executed in different observatories of
Europe and America. These statements bore more particularly, firstly, on the
spots of the sun, their reciprocal occultation observed at Altona, and their pre-
sumed connexion with the aurora borealis and magnetic variations ; likewise, on
the two periods, one of eleven and the other of fifty-six years, recognized by M.
Wolf in the number of these spots; secondly, on the photometric researches of
M. Alvan Clarke, relative to the intensity of the light of the sun compared with
that of the fixed stars ; whence it would result that our sun cannot be one of the
brilliant stars of the heavens; thirdly, on a slight augmentation to be applied to
the value of the parallax of Mars as hitherto recognized, an augmentation which
would imply that our distance from the sun is a little less than that at present
admitted ; fourthly, on the observation of shooting-stars by P. Seechi, from
which it results that these meteors are situated at a height of 100 to 150 kilome-
tres, and hence that they are within the limits of our atmosphere; fifthly, on
PHYSICS AND NATURAL HISTORY OF GENEVA. LOT

the lines of the solar spectrum, which, at an elevation of four miles above the
ground, remain identical with those on the surface of the earth, only the spectrum
diminishes in extent in proportion to the elevation attained; sixthly, on the dis-
covery of a satellite of Procyon; on the light of 7 of the Ship, which, in the
space of twenty years, has passed from the first to the sixth magnitude; and
finally, on a deviation of 10’ of the plumb-line in the environs of Moscow, at a
distance from any description of mountain.

MerTEeoroLoGy.—Memoirs.—The great and valuable labors of our future
president, Professor Plantamour, on the climate of Geneva, pertain by peculiar
right to our society, and would have occupied a distinguished place in the col-
lection of our memoirs, if their extent had not compelled the author to have them
printed and published separately. This work, one of true scientific importance,
inasmuch as it is based on observations executed with improved instruments,
and repeated every day and several hours of each day for thirty-five consecutive
years, and finally discussed with all the resources of modern science, could not
be analyzed in a report necessarily so much circumscribed as the present;
besides that, it would now be the more useless to attempt such analysis, since
Professor Aug. de la Rive has recently given, in the archives of the physics and
natural sciences of the Bibliothéque Universelle, a detailed and highly interesting
account of the enterprise.

Verbal reports—Professor Plantamour communicated some of the results
obtained during the month of January last, at the meteorological stations of the
valley of the higher Rhone. _ Some singular anomalies of temperature have there
been realized. Thus, among others, it was found that it was colder at the vil-
lage of Rechingen (valley of Conches) than at the hospice of Saint Bernard,
though the latter is situated 1,140 metres higher than the village. « These anom-
alies may be explained sometimes by the presence or absence of the sun, and
sometimes also by the cold air flowing from the mountains anv. accumulating
gradually in the bosom of the narrow valleys. Professor Marcet informed us of
the results of M. Glaisher on the diminution of the temperature of the air in pro-
portion to the elevation attained—results gathered in England and by means of
balloon ascensions. The diminution is not regular, most probably from cireumstan-
ces purely accidental, such as momentary currents of cold air, or enormous strata of
vapor, which arrest the solar heat and reflect it toward the higher spaces. After
traversing cold mists of some thousands of feet in thickness, M. Glaisher found at
11 or 12,000 feet of elevation the same temperature as at the surface of the earth.
Professor Wartmann reports, in relation to atmospheric electricity on high
mountains, that it had been observed this year in an ascension of the Jungfrau,
as had been done the year before on the Diablerets, that at the approach of a
storm the ironed staves of the tourists commenced ixtonating, and that singular
sounds were heard in the air. Professor Gautier spoke of torrents of rain hav-
ing fallen in Italy, in February last, accompanied, at Rome, by a furious hurri-
cane, which transported thither sand entirely similar to that ‘of the desert of
Sahara. Professor Marceet remarked upon the relatively very mild temperature
of the winter of 1863-64, in Canada, a fact which navigators believe they ac-
count for by a change observeds as they suppose, in the direction of the Gulf
Stream. M. Chaix read to us a report on the results of late travels in Arabia,
and particularly those of Palgrave, who succeeded in traversing the country by
passing for a Syrian.

MATHEMATICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL Puysics.—Memoirs.—M. Ch. Galopin

‘read an extract of a memoir on the mathematical theory of double refraction.
After reciting the principles on which rests the theory of Fresnel, and having
indicated the process followed by that eminent physicist for applying analysis
to transcendental researches, our colleague adopts as his own the views of Cau-
chy, who regards the movement of light as a particular case of the movement of
a system of molecules, very slightly diverted trom their position or equilibrium,
192 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY OF

and solicited by mutnal forces of attraction and repulsion; and he gives the dif-
ferential equations, whose integration would furnish the value of the molecular
displacements. By a method peculiar to himself, M. Galopin, with the help of
certain artifices of analysis, arrives at the equation of the velocities of luminous
waves already given by Fresnel, an equation which may be regarded as repre-
senting a surface called that of elasticity, and from which he deduces the equation
of the surface itself of these waves. Besides the two surfaces in question, there
still exist six others, the study of which enables him to arrive rapidly at the
properties of the surface of the waves, at those which concern the peculiar points
and planes of that surface, the conic and cylindrical refractions, and finally the
ordinary and extraordinary rays of crystals of two axes.

M. Lucien de la Rive has made researches on the differences of density of a
gaseous mass revolving around an axis in a cylindrical vessel, and has arrived
at a formula which enables him to calculate these different densities. The dif-
ferences in question are little appreciable for volumes of gas and dimensions of
vessels of inconsiderable quantity ; but they increase in proportion as the diame-
ter of the vessels is larger. The last named physicist read a memoir on the
conducetibility of ice for heat. After having given the detail of his experiments,
he recapitulates them mathematically, and proceeds to deduce to the value of
the co-eflicient %, of the conductibility of ice, a co-efficient which he finds =0.25,
that of glass being 0.13, and that of porcelain 0.24. Then applying his results
to the formation of ice on a surface of water below 0°, he seeks for the law
according to which this formation takes place, and he arrives at three equations
corresponding to three different epochs of the formation in question. Now, as
the last of these equations is that of a parabola, he thence deduces that after the
lapse of quite a few days of frost, the ice can only increase very slowly. The
author finally establishes the agreement of his theory with known facts, with
the observations of Flauguergues particularly, and concludes by indicating
briefly the application which may be made of it to the formation of the polar
ices.

Verbal reports.—Professors Wartmann and Marcet, in several successive verbal
communications, brought to the notice of the society the interesting discussion
in progress between MM. Magnus and Tyndall, on the absorption of heat by
gases. M. Tyndall, in repeating his experiments without employing the dia-
phragm of rock-salt, has removed one of the most serious objections of M. Mag-
nus. From his results he derives consequences of importance for the theory of
Wells on dew, and for other atmospheric phenomena. Professor Marcet made
the additional remark that Dulong, in his investigation regarding the specific
heat of gases, had set out with the hypothesis that gases do not radiate; now,
since M. Tyndall has established that they do radiate, the results of Dulong
would seem to call for revision, account being taken of the radiation. Professor
Plantamour occupied our attention with the views of M. Hipp respecting the
establishment of electric clocks in cities. Their employment at Geneva has
greatly conduced to a determination of the conditions by which their disposal
should be governed. Their position in gas-lanterns exposes them to great vari-
ations of temperature from summer to winter, to the unfavorable influences of dust
and humidity, and to the disturbing effects of the discharges of atmospheric
electricity and of concussions produced, whether by gusts of wind or the fre-
quent washing of the lanterns—concussions which have sometimes caused tem-
porary loss of the current. By reason of these difficulties, M. Hipp would prefer
that such clocks should be placed in the wall of the fronts of houses rather than
in the gas-lanterns. M. Philip Plantamour presented an analysis of the re-
searches of M. Edliing on the formation of ice in the northern seas. According
to the latter, the sea begins to freeze from the bottom; the water being there
cooled below the point of congelation, the least shock, the passage of a fish for
instance, suffices to determine solidification and to produce the sudden formation
PHYSICS AND NATURAL HISTORY OF GENEVA. 193

of masses of ice more or less considerable, which rise and float on the surface of
the water. The analysis of M. Plantamour has been inserted in the Archives
of the Bibliothéque Universelle.

Cuemistry.—Memoirs.—Professor Marignac communicated to the society the
continuation of his researches on the silico-tungstates. He has recognized three
distinct acids formed by the combination of tungstic acid and silicic acid, namely :
1st. Silico-tungstie acid, containing 12 equivalents of tungstic acid for 1 of silicic
acid; 2d. Silico-decitungstic acid, 10 equivalents of tungstie acid for 1 of silicic
acid; 3d. Tungsto-silicie acid, which has the same composition as the first, but
which differs by its crystalline form. He remarks that a great number of salts
of these acids present crystalline forms almost identical, although not by any
means so in their composition. This fact seems to him to indicate the necessity
of admitting the following extension of Mitscherlich’s principle of isomorphism,
viz: that two compounds including an element or a group of common elements,
which constitutes by much the greater part of their weight, may be tsomorphous,
even when the elements in which they differ do not constitute by themselves an
isomorphous group. M. Delafontaine read a memoir on the atomic weight of
thorine or thorium. He has repeated the analysis of the sulphate of thorium
after the method of Berzelius. ‘The mean of several accordant results yielded
him for the equivalent of thorine the figure 823.3, and admitting that the form-
ula of this is 7/0”, the weight of its atom referred to oxygen would be 1,646.6,
and that of thorium 1,446.6. ‘lo the same author we owe a note on the place
which thallium should occupy among the elements. Several chemists place it
among the alkaline metals, while others consider it as being related to lead. Of
these two views our colleague adopts the former.

Verbal reports —M. Clusius has modified his theory on the atomic composi-
tion of ozone. It is not this body, it would seem, but oxygen which is formed
of atoms grouped two and two—atoms which are dissociated when oxygen passes
into the state of ozone. But it is objected to this new theory that ozone having
more density than oxygen, it is the former, not oxygen, which must be com-
posed of grouped atoms.

NATURAL SCIENCES,

GroLoey.— Memoirs.—M. Favre has continued his communications on the
geological constitution of the Chablais. The soil of this province is composed
of new formations superposed in the following order: the glacial, fucoid schists,
kimmeridgian l.mestone, collovian limestone, liasian, lower lias, triassic, coal, and
serpentine. One of the characters of the region is the absence of cretaceous
and nummulitic formations ; an absence which results probably from the soil in
question having been already elevated above the surface of the water at the
epoch of the cretaceous and nummulitic seas. The author afterwards presents
a geological description of that part of Savoy traversed by the valleys of Meé-
geve and of Haut-Luce. Among other formations he there recognizes the black
slates of the jurassic period, forming the crest of Mont Joli; a fine deposit of
vegetable fossils of the carboniferous era, near Bonhomme; and near Beaufort
deposits of anthracite. He also shows that the granitic group of Mont Blanc is
separated from that of Beaufort by sedimentary rocks, a continuation of those
of the valley of Chamounix, and thus the granite of Beaufort would seem to be
a prolongation of that of Valorsina.

M. Favre also gave an account of an investigation in which he is engaged of
the deposits of translation between Jura and the Alps. These deposits present
four principal stages: 1st, the present alluvium; 2d, the alluvium of the ter-
races, deposited by great currents of water above the glacial formation, and ata
maximum elevation of 30 to 33 metres above the lake; 3d, the glacial deposit,
composed of loam, of rolled pebbles, and of some erratic blocks; 4th, the old

alluvium, composed of facilites (pudding-stone) and of rolled pebbles. Among
these, the euphotide, found below Geneva, comes from the mountains of the
Valais, a considerable distance doubtless, and the translation of which, by
reason of the interposition of the lake, it is not easy to explain.

M. Loriol read to us a memoir on the nummulitic formation of Egypt. To
eight species of echinoderms already known in the nummulitic of that country
he adds four others entirely new. He also communicated a series of researches
on the classic mountain of Saléve. . The fauna of the coralline stratum which
forms the base of that mountain has furnished some new fossils, among others
a large species of Diceras. The deposits between the corralline and the middle
neocomian belong to the valengian stratum, as their fossils (Natica leviathan)
testify. ‘The Urgonian stratum offers three species of invertebrata in common
with the deposits of Orgon, without speaking of several new species, and in par-
ticular of a fine terebratula (7. Edrodunensis,) which has not yet been pub-
Jished, and which has been compounded with the T. semistriata. Finally, in
this Valengian stratum, M. Loriol has distinguished four new species of
brachiopods.

Verbal reports.—Professor A. de la Rive called the attention of the society
to the researches of M. Frankland on the physical cause of the glacial epoch.
This cause he finds in the generally admitted fact, that the ocean must, at the
precipitated epoch, have had a temperature much superior to that which it now
has; that hence the evaporation of the seas would have been considerably aug-
mented, and with it the aqueous precipitations of the atmosphere. Now, these
enormous precipitations, falling in the form of snow, and during millenary pe-
riods, on the elevated table-lands of the high latitudes of the globe, would
eventually oceasion the vast accumulations of ice which characterized the epoch
in question. In support of this theory, M. de la Rive added, that since 1815
he had observed the great extension which the glaciers of Switzerland had ac-
quired after the two rainy years of 1816 and 1817. Further, that other savants
had already announced ideas upon the glacial epoch in close analogy with those
of M. Frankland. This communication of Professor de la Rive has been
inserted in the Bibliotheque Universelle.

Professor Desor communicated some of the results of his late researches on
the lacustrian deposits of lake Neuchatel. He has studied two stations at Au-
vergnier; one of the age of stone, situated near the shore, at a depression of
about five feet below the mean level of the water; the other of the age of
bronze, which is found somewhat in front of the other and at a greater depth.
He supposes that the stations of the age of stone are the remains of artificial
islands formed of pebbles heaped around stakes planted in the bottom of the
lake.

M. de Heer announces the discovery of the wing of an insect of the genus
blatina in the anthracites of the Valais, near St. Maurice. ‘his inseet, found
under fossil plants of the epoch of coal, is a near neighbor of those of the coal
series. Professor Pictet has continued to give us information both of the facts
relative to the discovery of the jawbone of Moulin-Quignon and of the different
scientific inquiries which bear upon that discovery. ‘These inquiries have been
successively published in the scientific and literary journals of the epoch; and
as they are too numerous for us to give here even a simple enumeration of them,
we must be content with a reference to the journals themselves. ‘The last-named
naturalist spoke also of the discovery of a tooth of a gigantic crocodilian in
the oolite of Poitiers; according to the savants who have examined it, this
animal appears to have been about one hundred feet in length. Finally, M.
Alexandre Prevost, our secretary, showed us a fragment of a human skull,
found in the valley of Chamounix, immediately above the Aiguilles by which
the glacier of Bossons terminates in that valley. This fragment is doubtless
a relic of one of the three guides who perished on the great plateau during the

expedition of Dr. Hummel in 1820. Other bones, of the same origin, have
been found last spring and still more recently in the same localities.

Borany.—Memoirs—Dr. Muller read a memorandum of the monstrosities
which he had met with in the flower and fruit of the jatropha pobliana, and
deduced therefrom some conclusions on the theory of the anther. He thinks
that this is formed neither by the combination of two ordinary leaves, nor by a
leaf whose edges are incurvated towards the median rib so as to form the two
chambers of the pollen. He believes that the anther represents only a simple
leaf, and that the pollen is developed in the incrassated tissue of the paren-
chyma of this leaf. The anthers heretofore recognized are of 1, 2, 4, and 8
chambers, and according to the commonly received theory, the existence of
trilocular anthers would be an impossibility. Now, in confirmation of his own
theory of the antherian leaf, M. Muller read a note on the existence of trilo-
cular anthers in the species pachystema of the family of the euphorbiaee,
(Java). ‘he same colleague aftcrwards presented a notice of two modes of
inflection of the stamens in the euphorbiaceze. The only one of these two:
modes which is noteworthy is that in which the anther is inflected in the bud,
its summit below and its base above. This form of inflection is important,
inasmuch as it serves to characterize the great tribe of the crotonez.

Verbal reports.—Professor de Candolle, in his Botanic Geography, has re-
marked that the beech and chestnut have not been discovered in Algeria. Now,
Professor Martius has recently found chestnut trees in the forest of l’Edding, in
the neighborhood of a Roman aqueduct. M.de Candolle conceives that in such
a locality the chestnut may well have been introduced by the Romans, and he
persists in thinking that the tree in question does not exist in the Atlas. He
also noticed a memoir of Dr. Hooker on the arctic flora, a memoir in which that
savant secks to explain why certain regions of the north possess a very rich.
flora, (Lapland,) while others have an extremely poor one, (Greenland.) M.
Hooker thinks that after the glacial epoch the vegetable species, in proportion.
as the ice withdrew, would ascend into the arctic regions, when those regions
were continental, while in the regions which became insular the sea would op-.
pose the reascension of vegetables. The same naturalist presented the society
with grains of the indigenous coffee of Peru; these grains are more voluminous.
than those of the coftce of Asia, but it is not yet possible to determine their
species. He exhibited also the male flower of a begoniacean of Africa, very
different from the usual type of its family, for which he had been indebted to.
the kindness of Dr. Hooker. Lastly, M. Reuter presented to the society the
leaf, fruit, and part of the flower of the tormelia fragrans, which is the first:
time that the fruit of this aroid of Mexico has been seen at Geneva.

ZooLoGy— Memoirs —M. Henri de Saussure read a paper on the incessant:
dispersion of the hymenoptera on the surface of the globe, a dispersion which.
would have for its apparent consequence a successive modification of individuals, .
and consequently the development of series of graduated species, marking the
stages traversed by the migrations of each type. This hypothesis would ex--
plain the parallel series which may be observed on the same continent or on
different continents. Among these successive modifications, one of the most
interesting is that which pertains only to one of the two sexes, the feminine.
In the genus Elis, for instance, we can distinguish as many as twenty varie-
ties, spread over all the continents, varieties extremely distinct from one another
in regard to the female, but of which the males seem identical or nearly. so,
which would constitute a series of types successively polygamous. he author
concludes by indicating certain species which may have passed from Europe te
America, and from America into Africa or Europe. M. Alois Humbert read a
memoir, in which he showed, by means of mollusks which he had brought from
Ceylon, that in the pulmonate gastropods there exists no essential difference
between those with an external and those with an internal shell, and that it is
196 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY OF

possible to establish all the requisite transitions between the two extremes of
this family, extremes which may be represented by the slug, (internal shell,)
and the snail, (external shell.) M. Victor Fatio communicated a memoir on the
vertical distribution of species in certain families of birds. Leaving the basin
of Lake Leman with twenty-four different species of sylviade, he loses some
one of these species in proportion as he ascends the mountains; and when
arrived at the Haute-Engadine finds himself accompanied only by redstarts, one
of which alone, the ruticilla tithys, ascends still higher. In this comparative
study, the author first establishes an approximation between the north pole and
our higher Alps, which leads him to signalize the relations which exist, for birds,
between their horizontal passages and vertical migrations. Next, passing to
this transport of species to heights more and more considerable, he recognizes
the influence which climate and the nature of the soil exercise on the produc-
tion of nourishment.

Verbal reports —M. V. Fatio took notice of the appearance at Geneva of a
bird, the syoraptes paradoxus, which inhabits Siberia, Tartary, and China, and
which entered Europe in 1863, directing its course from the northeast of Ger-
many to the southwest of France. An extraordinary drought in its native
country has probably been the cause of this unusual migration of the bird in
question.

ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOG one —Professor Thury communicated his
important memoir on the law of the production of sexes. In the case of plants,
the fundamental identity of the pistils and stamens is admitted by those
‘botanists who regard the organs in question as modified leaves. Now, accord-
ing to the experiments of Knight, heat favoring the production of male flowers
in dicecious plants, M. Thury. has thence concluded that the caloric acted on
plants by occasioning a more complete elaboration and maturation of the juices
and organs, so that the production of the male element would correspond with
a more perfect development of the germ. Applying these ideas to the animal
kingdom, our colleague has deduced from them the consequence, that the pro-
duction of one or the other sex depends only on the degree of maturation of
the egg, a maturation which would continue to advance during the time which
elapses between the moment of the detachment of the ovum and that of its
impregnation, in such manner that the ova promptly fecundated would yield
females, and those more slowly fecundated males. Such is the filiation of ideas
by which M. Thury has arrived at the theory to which his name will remain
attached ; a theory which was confirmed by experiment in each of the twenty-
nine cases in which, at the instance of its author, trial was made by M. Cornay.
Yhese ideas of our colleague have excited very general interest; they were
immediately submitted to investigation in France, in England, and in Germany,
and this on so large a scale that we may hope to arrive promptly at results
altogether decisive. Certain objections, however, have been raised against this
theory, of which we shall here notice only such as have been advanced at our
own sittings. Thus, for instance, in regard to hemp, which grows in very
different climates, it has been said that nothing has heretofore indicated that
more male individuals are produced in the hemp of warm countries than in that
of cold ones. Again, M. Pagenstecher has sought to demonstrate that the
theory of M. 'Thury was in opposition with observations on the parthenogenesis,
and he substitutes for it another theory, in which account is equally taken of
the age of the egg at the moment of its fecundation. In effect, at the session
of the Helvetic society of natural sciences in 1863, he expressed the idea that,
by maturation, the pellicle of the ovule became hardened, which might prevent
a more or less considerable number of zoospermes from penetrating into the in-
terior of the egg, and thus influencing its sexuality. Some of these objections,
it must be confessed, rest only upon hypotheses and need demonstration in
order to obtain assent.
PHYSICS AND NATURAL HISTORY OF GENEVA. 19%

Professor Claparéde read a memoir on the circulation of the blood in
arachnidx of the genus lycosa. ‘The examination of this circulation conducts
the author to a very unexpected result: that in these animals the blood, in
almost the whole of the heart, moves from front to rear, contrary to what takes
place in all the arthropods hitherto studied. The memoir of M. Claparéde hav-
ing been published in the previous volume of our collection dispenses with the
necessity of entering into the further details of this interesting investigation,
which, besides, it would be difficult to understand without plates. The same
naturalist presented another memoir in which he sets forth the result of his in-
teresting researches made at Port Vendres, during the summer of 1863, on the
anatomy and classification of marine annelide. He first occupies himself with
a type which has not been studied heretofore except in a manner probably very
imperfect, that of the polyophthalme, which forms among the chetopods an in-
termediate link between the oligochetz and the polychetaw. He next examines
the annelidz, degraded from the family of the terebellacx, in which the disap-
pearance of the vascular system is accompanied by the formation in the general
cavtiy of the animal, of a liquid holding in suspension red globules, very similar
to the corpuscles of the blood of mammifers, and thrown into continual move-
ment to and fro by the contractions of the walls of the body. Lastly, he passes
to the examination of the family of syllid, of which the species present some
the normal and others the alternating generation. Among more than twenty
species pertaining to this family, and found by him at Port Vendres, one species
only was already known. ‘This memoir, accompanied with plates, is inserted
in the present volume of memoirs of the society.

M. Victor Fatio read a memoir on the reproductive male apparatus of the ac-
centor alpinus, one of the pretty sparrows of our Alps. In the spring, at the
approach cf rutting time, its testicles acquire an enormous development, attain-
ing a volume of about one-third of that of the entire trunk. Their different
vessels, instead of opening directly into the cloaca, are wound upon themselves,
and form on the sides of the anus two large balls which hang beneath the tail
in pouches covered by the skin. On issuing from these balls, the vessels in
question are directed towards the common vestibule, and terminate at the ex-
tremity of a small sexual papilla. In autumn all this temporary development
disappears. Doctor Dor read a memoir on the physiological effects of the bean
of Calabar, (physostigma venenosa.) Studied specially in its effects on the
eye, this substance produces contraction of the pupil, and occasions a sort of
cramp of the accommodator muscle. In this double relation it acts as an anta-
gonist of the atropima. Professor Valentin presented a note on the stretching
of the motor nerves. This stretching, by producing elongation of the fibrillous
sheath of Schwan, must narrow the diameter, and thus occasion, probably, a
certain degree of compression of the nervous pulp which it envelopes* M.
Valentin has sought to measure the effects of the stretching in question, and
that by help of a measuring apparatus at once rotary and graphic, and of a
slight current of induction, as a means of excitation of the nerves examined.
The same physiologist made a communication on the effects of the separation
of the motor nerves from the vervous centres. He has ascertained: Ist, that
a discontinuity of one demi-millimetre suffices to produce all the effects resulting
from the separation in question, which excludes the idea that the nervous force
ean act at a distance, as in induction; 2d, that when the two separated ends
of the nerve are examined with the microscope, it is found that the peripheric
portion presents only degenerated fibres, while the end attached to the nervous
centres is composed only of fibres perfectly normal. For the great sympathetic
the effects are different, on account of the anastomoses of the peripherie end.

*We say probably, because if the elongation of the nervous substance is proportional to
that of the sheath which envelops it, there will not be compression, but a stretching only of
the nervous pulp enveloped.
198 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY OF

Verbal reports—There have been some interesting communications to the
society, on physiological researches conducted by foreign savants, namely: By
Professor de la Rive, on the experiments of M. Scouttetten relative to the elas-
ticity of the blood, and to the current which, through the galvanometer, passes
from the arterial to the venous blood; and this as well in the living animal as
in the blood freshly drawn from the vessels. By Professor Claparéde, on the
process of M. Wandt for measuring the rapidity with which thought may be
transferred from an impression of the serse of hearing to an impression of the
sense of sight, (about ¢ of a second.) The personal equation of the observer
ought, evidently, to be here taken into consideration. On the animal grafts of
Dr. Best; besides the subcutaneous grafts of different members effected with
success, this physiologist, in the case of two animals of the same species, bué
of different sex, has succeeded in engrafting the genital organs of one into the
abdominal cavity of the other. He has also united two rats by the skin of the
lateral part of the body, and has thus succeeded in establishing between them
a complete vascular communication. Although these graftings have succeeded
between animals of the same species, they have failed between those of dif-
erent species. Again—and with this I shall end—Professor Claparéde de-
tailed to us the last results at which, each for himself, MM. Knoch, in Russia,
Leuckart, in Germany, aud the late Bertholus, in France, have arrived in their
valuable researches on the evolution of the bothryocephalus. In this worm, com-
mon enough in Russia, Poland, the south of France and Geneva, the eggs are
developed in water, and at the end of seven months give birth to embryos fur-
nished with remarkably long cilia. These embryos continue to live freely in the
water, and there produce a larvee armed with hooks very similar to that of the
teenias. Now, what still remains to be discovered is, whether it is sufficient to
