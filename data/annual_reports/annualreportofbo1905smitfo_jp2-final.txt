PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS FOR THE YEAR
ENDING JUNE 30, 1905.

Ata meeting held March 12, 19038, the Board of Regents adopted
the following resolution:

Resolved, That, in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the fourth Wednes-
day in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the Tuesday after
the first Monday in December and on the 6th day of March, unless that day falls on
Sunday, when the following Monday shall be substituted.

In accordance with this resolution, the Board met at 10 o’clock a. m.
on December 6, 1904, January 25, 1905, and March 6, 1905.

REGULAR MEETING OF DECEMBER 6, 1904.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; the
Hon. W. P. Frye, President pro tempore of the Senate, acting as
Regent; the Hon. S. M. Cullom, the Hon. O. H. Platt, the Hon. F. M.
Cockrell, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh. A. Dinsmore,
Dr. Andrew D. White, the Hon. John B. Henderson, Dr. A. Graham
Bell, and the Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held March 7, 1904, were read in
abstract and approved. ; ;

DISPOSITION OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The Secretary stated that at the meeting of January 27, 1904, a com-
mittee consisting of the Chancellor, the members of the executive com-
mittee, and the Secretary had been appointed to act on the question
of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson and of the
monument to be erected to him. The committee reported to the Board
on March 7, 1904, recommending that a suitable tomb be erected and
that Congress be asked to make an adequate appropriation for it.

- Since that meeting the committee had decided to suggest in lieu of
their former recommendation that the original tomb be brought to this
country and used as a final resting place for the remains. Accordingly
the Secretary had entered into correspondence with the ofticials at
Genoa, and the tomb had been shipped and was expected by the end

of the present month.
XI
XII PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

After discussion, Senator Cullom offered the following resolution,
which was adopted:

Resolved, That the special committee having in charge the matter of the final dis-
position of the remains of James Smithson be authorized to receive the original
tomb, and to place it, suitably inscribed, with the remains, in some proper position
that they may select in the grounds of ihe Institution; the expenses involved in the
matter to be met from the funds of the Institution.

NEW BUILDING FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Secretary stated that the preliminary floor plans and elevations
were approved on January 27, 1904, and that the detailed plans for the
construction of the foundation had been worked out during the spring.
The excavation for the building was begun on June 15, 1904, the Secre-
tary turning the first spade of earth, and the site of the building was
inclosed with a high board fence. The excavation was completed dur-
ing the last of the summer, and the work of laying the foundation was”
immediately begun, the material used being concrete. This part of the
work was finished November 9, 1904.

Proposals for furnishing the granite for all parts of the building
where this stone was to be used, were opened October 1. There were
nine bidders, and after due consideration the following selections were
made: For the basement story, pink granite from Milford, Mass.; for
the main and second stories, the white Bethel granite of Vermont;
for the upper story, white granite from Mount Airy, N. C.; for the
trimmings of the court walls, the so-called Woodstock granite of Mary-
land. It was explained that the stones from these quarries would
harmonize, and that the selection had the favorable recommendation
of the superintendent of construction and of the architects.

Contracts were at once entered into for supplying the above mate-
rial, cut and ready for laying, and it was gratifying to state that the
total cost of the granite would fall below the original estimates.

It was expected that work on the lower story could be started by
next February, and in case the season were an open one, the basement
walls could be completed before the summer of 1905. At the present
time the superintendent of construction was erecting, in wood, a nar-
row section of the south front of the building, of actual dimensions,
in order to determine if the lines and proportions as shown on the
plans were entirely satisfactory or subject to improvement.

PRESERVATION OF ANTIQUITIES.

The Secretary recalled to the Board that bills for the preservation
of antiquities on the national domain, had been introduced in the Sen-
ate by Senator Cullom, and in the House by Representative Hitt, at
the last session of Congress, but that no action had been taken. It
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

had been learned that the Secretary of the Interior had in contempla-
tion a bill which, while meeting the needs of the Department, would
also be satisfactory to the Institution. The Institution had undertaken
to prepare for the Secretary of the Interior the requisite maps giving
the location of antiquities on the public lands. It was of interest to
state that the Secretary of the Interier had already taken preliminary
steps in the matter, so far as his authority extended, and had appointed
guardians for important ruins.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Secretary said that since the last meeting of the Board two
expeditions had ben sent out by the Institution; one under the direc-
tion of Mr. A. G. Maddren for the purpose of studying the remains
of the Alaskan mammoth and other large mammals reported as abun-
dant in the ‘‘ Bone-Yard” and at Elephant Point; and a second under
the direction of Dr. W. H. Sherzer to study the glaciers of British
Columbia. Arrangements had also been made to send Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes to Vera Cruz, Mexico, for the purpose of studying the prac-
tically unexplored region in the eastern shore of that country, where
it is hoped to discover the relationship of the mound-building tribes
of our Mississippi Valley and the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande
and Rio Colorado with the so-called civilized tribes of Mexico. . The
district was also interesting because of the presence there of a branch
of the Maya race of Yucatan.

The sending of these expeditions was a recurrence tc the old policy
of the Institution which paid for them from its own fund. In this
last case it was a joint work of the Bureau of American Ethnology
and the Institution.

EXTENSION OF ETHNOLOGICAL WORK IN HAWAII AND SAMOA.

The Secretary explained that he had for several years, in connection
with the estimates, urged the extension of the researches of the Bureau
of American Ethnology to Hawaiiand Samoa. Congress had apparently
been unwilling up to the present time to authorize this. These
researches were practically urgent, and the request had been renewed
this year, and he hoped that its importance could be impressed upon
the members of the appropriations committees. No additional
appropriation was needed to accomplish this, it being only necessary
to insert the proper phraseology in the appropriation bill.

The Board then adjourned.

bequest at some future time.

On motion the report was accepted and ordered filed.

REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE FINAL DISPOSITION OF
THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The Chancellor, as chairman of the committee, reported as follows:

At a meeting on December 6, 1904, the Board of Regents adopted the following
resolution:

** Resolved, That the special committee, having in charge the matter of the final
disposition of the remains of James Smithson, be authorize: to receive the original
tomb and to place it, suitably inseribed, with the remains, in some proper position
that they may select in the grounds of the Institution; the expenses involved in the
matter to be met from the funds of the Institution.”

Your committee haying directed the shipping of the tomb to this country, it
arrived in the port of New York and has just been brought on here. It is tempora-
rily set up near the Institution. It is a most modest structure, but sufficient in its
place in a cemetery surrounded by other tombs. Your committee would like to
have the Regents see it before they place it permanently in any conspicuous exter-
nal position. Should the Regents please to authorize the committee to place it
within the Institution, at least temporarily, they will find a place for it.

After realizing the insufficiency of the tomb for an external site, your committee
have some hesitation in choosing a place for it in the open grounds of the Institution
under the terms of the resolution, but would probably place it immediately north
of the present building. Your committee feel that in that case, some accessory
would be necessary.

The adoption of this report will be considered by the committee as authorizing
them to place the tomb and remains within the Institution, at least temporarily.

Repectfully submitted.

MELVILLE W.- FULLER, Chairman.

On motion the report was adopted.

FREER COLLECTION.

The Secretary said that during the early part of the year 1904 he
bad had an interview at the Institution with Mr. Charles L. Freer, of
Detroit, who was desirous of giving his valuable collection of objects
of American and oriental art to the Smithsonian Institution or to the
United States Government on certain conditions. Mr. Freer had
outlined orally the extent of the collection, its cost, and the conditions
under which he proposed to make the offer.

The Secretary had brought the matter before the executive com-
mittee, and he read a letter which he had sent to Mr. Freer reciting
his understanding of the collection and conditions of gift, and which,
further, contained the following action of the committee:

The executive committee, haying heard with interest and apprecia‘icn the state-
ment by Secretary Langley of the proposition and views of Mr. Charles L. Freer,

sm 1905——2
XVI PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

of Detroit, to intrust to the Smithsonian Institution a collection of works of art,
now in his possession, which has already cost $600,000 and to which he proposes
to add almost as much more and to construct for housing it a hall costing $500,000,
upon condition that all the expense and responsibility for its care and mainte-
nance shall be provided, are of the opinion that it would be well for the Board of
Regents to consider such a proposition in sympathy with the broad and cultivated
spirit in which it is made; but as it is presented only as a statement of a conversa-
tion with Mr. Freer, it is requested by the committee that Secretary Langley com-
muniecate with Mr. Freer and suggest to him that he put in more precise form his
views and his wishes, so that the action which the committee may recommend to
the Board shall be such as will exactly set forth Mr. Freer’s purposes and be given
the careful consideration appropriate to such an enduring benefaction.

To this letter the following reply was received:

Derrorr, Micu., December 27, 1904.
S. P. Laneiey, Esq.,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C.:
Dear Str: In replying to your kind letter of the 16th instant, and in further
reference to the conversation had with you on March 24 last, I beg to say that my
permanent collections consist of the following art objects, namely:

By James McNerLit WHISTLER:
100 framed paintings in oil, water-color, and pastel.
60 unframed drawings in pencil and water color.
150 lithographs.
575 etchings.
The entire decorations of the Peacock Room.

By D. W. Tryon, T. W. Dewrne, and A. H. THAyeEr:
50 framed paintings in oil, water-color, and pastel.

By various masters of Chinese and Japanese schools of painting, beginning with the
tenth century and ending with the nineteenth century, including specimens by
Ririomin, Sesshiu, Sesson, Motonobu, Tanyu, Koyetsu, Sotatsu, Korin, Kenzan,
Hoitsu, Okio, Hokusai, and various other masters:

400 kakemono, many of which are in pairs.
80 screens, many of which are in pairs.
30 panels.

By various potters of the Far East and Central Asia, including Chinese, Japanese,

Coreans, Persians, Arabians, and others as yet unidentified:
950 pieces of pottery.

Also a small group of ancient Chinese and Japanese bronzes, a few early Japanese

and Corean wood-carvings, and some lacquer by Koyetsu, Korin, and Ritsuwo.

These several collections include specimens of very widely separated periods of
artistic development, beginning before the birth of Christ and ending to-day.

No attempt has been made to secure specimens from unsympathetic sources, my
collecting haying been confined to American and Asiatic schools. My great desire
has been to unite modern work with masterpieces of certain periods of high civiliza-
tion, harmonious in spiritual and physical suggestion, having the power to broaden
esthetic culture and the grace to elevate the human mind.

These collections I desire to retain during my life for the enjoyment of students,
my friends, and myself, and for the further purpose of making additions and improve-
ments from time to time. Believing that good models only should be used in
artistic construction, I wish to continue my censorship, aided by the best expert

advice, and remove every undesirable article, and add in the future whatever I can
obtain of like harmonious standard quality.

I now repeat my offer to bequeath these collections to the Smithsonian Institution,
or to the United States Government, and also the sum of $500,000 in money jor the
purpose of constructing a suitable building in which to house them, upon the follow-
ing terms and conditions:

First. The sum of $500,000 shall be paid by my executors to the Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government promptly after my decease,
and shall be used forthwith for the construction of a fireproof building connected
with the National Museum, the construction of which has recently been authorized,
or reasonably near thereto.

Second. The interior of this building shall be arranged with special regard for the
convenience of students and others desirous of an opportunity for uninterrupted
study. A suitable space shall be provided in which the Peacock Room shall be
reerected complete. The whole interior arrangement of the building shall be agreed
upon between the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and myself within a
reasonable time after the acceptance of this offer.

Third. The collections, with such changes and additions thereto as shall be made
during my lifetime, shall be delivered by my executors to the Regents immediately
after the building is constructed and ready to receive them.

Fourth. The collections and the buildings shall be cared for and maintained per-
petually by the Smithsonian Institution or the United States Government at its own
expense.

Fifth. No addition or deduction shall be made to the collections after my death,
and nothing else shall ever be exhibited with them, or in the same building, nor
shall the said collections, or any part thereof, be removed at any timesfrom the said
building except when necessary for the purpose of making repairs or renovations in
the building.

Sixth. No charge shall ever be made for admission to the building or for the privi-
lege of examining or studying the collections.

Seventh. The collections and building shall always bear my name in some modest
and appropriate form.

In lieu of the foregoing offer I am willing, upon the conditions above expressed,
to make a present conveyance of the title to said collections to the Institution or the
Government, and a bequest of the sum of $500,000 for the building, provided:

1. The collections shall remain in my possession during my life, and in the possession
of my executors after my death until the completion of the building.

2. I shall have the right to make such changes in the collections, by disposing of
any part thereof, or by adding thereto, as may seem to me advisable or necessary
for the improvement of the collections, or any of them.

3. Both I and my executors shall be free from any liability on account of any loss
in or damage that may accrue to the collections while in my or their charge, even
though such loss or injury shall occur by reason of my or their negligence, or the
negligence of my or their servants, agents, or employees. -

The exact form of the bequest or gift and the details for carrying it into execution
are legal questions that can be agreed upon by counsel representing the Institution
or the Government and myself.

I suggest that the Institution or the Government, before coming to a decision
regarding the above offer, send a committee of experts to Detroit to make an exami-
nation of the collections. It will be a source of satisfaction to me to exhibit the col-
lections to such a committee, and the report it may make will be of great value to
the Institution or Government in reaching a conclusion. I remain, with great
respect,

Very truly, yours, CHARLES L. FREER.
SOWIE PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

After conference with the chairman of the executive committee the
Secretary addressed Mr. Freer, asking if he could see his way to
modify the requirements of the fifth clause of his conditions, to
which a reply was received that after serious consideration no modifi-
eation could be made in the terms of the clause referred to.

A very general discussion arose as to the matters involved under
the terms of the proposed donation, the prevailing opinion being that
more information was necessary before the Board could come to a
conclusion. It was pointed out that Mr. Freer had asked that a com-
mittee visit him for the purpose of seeing the collectian, and the
Board decided to accept the suggestion. The following resolution
was accordingly adopted:

Resolved, That the Chancellor appoint a committee of three Regents, whose duty
it shall be to make personal examination of the collection of art objects which Mr.
Charles L. Freer has proposed to give or bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution,
and make report to the Board of its value and merits, and said committee is further
instructed to ascertain from Mr. Freer what alterations, if any, can be made in the
conditions of his very generous proposal; and the Secretary of this Institution is
hereby added as an additional member of this committee.

The Chancellor appointed Doctor Angell, Senator Henderson, Doe-
tor Bell, and the Secretary as the committee.

The Board then adjourned.

REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 6, 1905.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Fuller (Chancellor) in the chair; the Hon.
Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice-President of the United States; the Hon.
O. H. Platt, the Hon. Robert Adams, jr., the Hon. Hugh A. Dinsmore,
the Hon. Andrew D. White, the Hon. John B. Henderson, Dr. A.
Graham Bell, and the Secretary, Mr. 8. P. Langley.

MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING.

The minutes of the meeting held January 25, 1905, were read-in
abstract and approved.

APPOINTMENT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

The Secretary, after stating the necessity for the appointment of an
additional assistant secretary of the Institution, asked the Board’s
approval of his selection of Dr. Cyrus Adler, the present Librarian of
the Institution, for the position, adding an explanatory statement as
to Doctor Adler’s fitness for the duties.

Senator Henderson followed with further commendatory remarks,
and presented the subjoined resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Dr. Cyrus Adler as Assistant

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the Library and the Exchanges,
with such additional duties as the Secretary may assign him, be approved.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIX
FREER COLLECTION.

Senator Henderson, in the absence of Doctor Angell, Chairman,
and on behalf of the committee appointed to visit Detroit and inspect
the art collection of Mr. Charles L. Freer, presented a report, which
was very fully discussed; and as it was deemed best that the matter
should be considered at a subsequent meeting of the Board, at which
a fuller attendance might be expected, Senator Platt offered the fol-
lowing resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents take this occasion to express their sincere
thanks to Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, for the courtesy shown to the committee
of the Regents which recently visited Detroit to examine his art collection; and that

further consideration of his generous offer to donate the same to this Institution or
the United States be continued until the next meeting of the Board of Regents.

GIFT OF BOTANICAL COLLECTION.

The Secretary stated that Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore,
had donated to the Institution his entire botanical collection, compris-
ing 100,000 plants and nearly 1,600 books on botany. There were no
conditions, except that the donor reserved the right to continue to
work upon the collection.

Doctor White offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents be tendered to Capt. John

Donnell Smith for his generosity in presenting to the Institution his large and yal-
uable collection of plants and books on botany, which is gratefully accepted.

FINAL DISPOSITION OF SMITHSON’S REMAINS.

The Secretary reviewed the report presented to the Board at the
meeting of January 25 by the committee charged with the final dis-
position of Smithson’s remains, and said that he hoped that at some
future time Congress would make an adequate appropriation for giving
these remains a fitting interment; but that so far as he had been able
he had given present effect to the mandate of the Board by depositing
them temporarily within the building in a small room which he had
had fitted up on the immediate left of the north entrance to the
building.

The remains had been examined by medical experts and found to be
in aremarkable state of preservation. They had now been put in a
suitable casket and were ready to be transferred to the tomb, and he
would ask the Regents, when the meeting had adjourned, to proceed
to the room and witness the deposit of the casket.

After remarks on the condition of the work of the Institution, the
Board adjourned, and the Regents repaired to the room referred to,
where, in their presence, the casket was placed within the tomb, which:
was then sealed.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. XXIII

Early in June, 1905, the Accountant of the Institution, W. W. Karr,
whose duties also Seer ‘ed the handling of its revenues, was found to
be a defaulter. Instead of there being a credit balance of $46,648.33
on June 30, 1904, as shown by the books of the accountant, there was
in fact a deficiency of $362.80.

The subject of this deficiency is dealt with in detail in a special
report communicated by the Secretary to the executive committee, and
which the executive committee now submits to the Board of Regents
with its approval. It seems proper in this place to make a general
résumé showing the items of the deficiency and in what manner it was
perpetrated.

On July 13, 1891, a check was drawn for a semimonthly pay roll
amounting to $494.57. After the voucher for the pay roll had been
approved for this amount and the check corresponding to the voucher
had been signed, Karr raised this check from $494.57 to $5,494.57,
appropriating the difference, $5,000, to himself. This was the first
transgression which was ascertained.

Between July, 1891, and May 31, 1905, there was received as income
by the Institution $1,146,051.32, and actually deposited in the Treasury
$1,087,184.19, leaving a difference of $58,867.13, which should have
been to the credit of the Institution, but which represents the embez-
zlement by Karr from the receipts of the Institution proper.

In addition to this, Karr embezzled from the Congressional appro-
priation for the U. S. National Museum for the fiscal year 1904—5 the
sum of $7,400, which amount has been repaid to the Government by
the bonding company which had given bond to the Government for
his fidelity. In further addition thereto, Karr abstracted from funds
received by the Institution for the International Catalogue of Scien-
tific Literature, at London, $4,691.48.“

To recapitulate, the actual losses through Karr’s embezzlements
were as follows:

Moneys received for the Smithsonian Institution aud converted to his

The executive committee in 1891, when these defalcations began,
consisted of James C. Welling, Henry Coppée, and Gen. M. C. Meigs.

duration, Bey ing heed immediately transformed into a Unkle by eae

deposit of the semiannual interest funds, the fact that there had been
peculations from the Institution was not discovered until June, 1905,
when the Institution was informed that its account wasoverdrawn. As
the end of the fiscal year was drawing near, it was found necessary to
borrow the sum of $10,000 to meet current obligations. The loan
was paid on July 5, 1905, or as soon as collections would permit.
Owing to the condition in which the books and accounts were left by -
the late accountant, it is impossible to state in their respective classes
the amounts of the miscellaneous receipts. The total of such receipts
deposited in the Treasury during the year was in the aggregate
$6,861.72, as given in the foregoing statement.

Your committee also presents the following statements in regard to
appropriations and expenditures for objects intrusted by Congress to
the care of the Smithsonian Institution:

gress for that fiscal year, or involve the Government in any contract
LIV ACTS AND RESOLUTION OF CONGRESS.

or obligation for the future payment of money in excess of such
appropriations unless such contract or obligation is authorized by law.
Nor shall any Department or officer of the Government accept volun-
tary service for the Government or employ personal service in excess
of that authorized by law, except in cases of sudden emergency involy-
ing the loss of human life or the destruction of property. All appro-
priations made for contingent expenses or other general purposes,
except appropriations made for the fulfilment of contract obligations
expressly authorized by law, or for objects required or authorized by
law without reference to the amounts annually appropriated therefor,
shall, on or before the beginning of each fiscal year, be so apportioned
by monthly or other allotments as to prevent undue expenditures in
one portion of the year that may require deficiency or additional
appropriations to complete the service of the fiscal year; and all such
apportionments shall be adhered to except when waived or modified
in specific cases by the written order of the head of the Executive
Department or other Government establishment having control of the
expenditure, but this provision shall not apply to the contingent
appropriations of the Senate or House of Representatives; and all
such waivers or modifications, together with the reasons therefor,
shall be communicated to Congress in connection with estimates for
any additional appropriations required on account thereof. Any
person violating any provision of this section shall be summarily
removed from office and may also be punished by a fine of not less
than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not less than one
month.” (Approved March 3, 1905; Statutes, X X XIII, 1257.)

RESTRICTIONS ON PRINTING, BINDING, AND ILLUSTRATIONS.

And no more than an allotment of one-half of the sum hereby appro-
priated shall be expended in the first two quarters of the fiscal year,
and no more than one-fourth thereof may be expended in either of the
last two quarters of the fiscal year, except that, in addition thereto, in
either of said last quarters, the unexpended balances of allotments for
preceding quarters may be expended: * * * Provided further,
That hereafter no part of the appropriations made for printing and
binding shall be used for any illustration, engraving, or photograph
in any document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the
order to print expressly authorizes the same, nor in any document or
report of any Executive Department or other Government establish-
ment until the head of the Executive Department or Government

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE

YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1905.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith my report,
showing the operations of the Institution during the year ending
June 30, 1905, including the work placed under its direction by Con-
gress in the United States National Museum, the Bureau of American
Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoological
Park, and the Astrophysical Observatory.

Following the precedent of several years, there is given, in the
body of this report, a general account of the affairs of the Institution
and its bureaus, while the Appendix presents more detailed state-
ments by the persons in direct charge of the different branches ot
the work. Independently of this, the operations of the National
Museum are fully treated in a separate volume of the Smithsonian
Report, and the Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology con-
stitutes a volume prepared under the supervision of the Chief of
that Bureau. The scientific work of the Astrophysical Observatory
is recorded in occasional publications.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

By act of Congress approved August 10, 1846, the Smithsonian
Tnstitution was created an Establishment. Its statutory members are
the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice of the United
States, and the heads of the Executive Departments. The preroga-
{ive of the Establishment is “the supervision of the affairs of the

1

B. Angell, of Michigan; Dr. Andrew D. White, of New York; the
Hon. J. B. Henderson, of Washington City; Prof. A. Graham Bell,
of Washington City; the Hon. Richard Olney, of Massachusetts, and
the Hon. George Gray, of Delaware.

There are two vacancies on the Board, caused by the death of Sena-
tor O. H. Platt and the retirement of Senator Francis M. Cockrell.

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held March 12, 1903, the fol-
lowing resolution was adopted:

“ Resolved, That in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the
fourth Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall
be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on
the 6th day of March, unless that date falls on Sunday, when the
following Monday shall be substituted.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

Tn accordance with the above resolution the Board met on Decem-
ber 6, 1904, January 25, 1905, and March 6, 1905.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which latter will
be found in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

REGULAR MEETING OF DECEMBER 6, 1904.

A statement concerning the disposition of the remains of James
Smithson, and the report of the special committee having in charge
the final disposition of the remains, was presented to the Board,
which adopted the following resolution:

“ Resolved, That the special committee having in charge the matter
of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson be author-
ized to receive the original tomb, and to place it, suitably inscribed,
with the remains, in some proper position that they may select in the
grounds of the Institution ; the expenses involved in the matter to
be met from the funds of the Institution.”

The Secretary made a statement to the Board concerning the prog-
ress on the new building for the National Museum. The excavation
for the building was begun on June 15, 1904, and the laying of the
foundations in concrete was finished November 9, 1904. The con-
tracts for the granite had been entered into.

The Secretary recalled to the Board the various bills introduced
for the preservation of antiquities on the national domain. He had
learned in the meantime that the Secretary of the Interior had in
contemplation a bill which would meet the needs of the Department
and be satisfactory to the Institution, which had prepared for the
Secretary of the Interior the requisite maps giving the location of
antiquities on the public lands. The Secretary of the Interior had
also taken preliminary steps for the appointment of guardians for
important ruins.

ANNUAL MEETING, JANUARY 25, 1905.

The Secretary announced the reappointment of Dr. J. B. Angell
as a Regent for six years, by joint. resolution approved by the
President January 19, 1905.

The usual resolution relative to income and expenditure was
adopted, and the annual reports of the Secretary, the executive com-
mittee, and the permanent committee were submitted.

The special committee on the disposition of the remains of James
Smithson reported the arrival of the original tomb, and their decision,
under the authority given at the previous meeting, to place it and the
remains within the Smithsonian building. A statement of the rein-
terment of the remains will be found on a subsequent page.

The Secretary informed the Board of the proposal of Mr. Charles
L. Freer, of Detroit, to bequeath or to make a deed of gift, to take
effect upon his death, of a collection of paintings and etchings, largely
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

those of Whistler and his school, and of American and oriental pot-
tery and other objects of art; and of erecting a building to be used
solely for the purpose of exhibiting these objects, on condition that
the Regents should provide for the maintenance of the building and
collections. The Secretary had laid this matter before the executive
committee under date of December 16, which adopted the following
report:

“The executive committee, having heard with interest and appre-
ciation the statement by Secretary “Langley of the proposition and
views of Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, to intrust to the Smith-
sonian Institution a collection of works of art, now in his possession,
which has already cost $600,000, and to which he proposes to add
almost as much more, and to construct for housing it a hall costing
$500,000, upon condition that all the expense and responsibility for
its care and maintenance shall be provided, are of opinion that it
would be well for the Board of Regents to consider such a proposition
in sympathy with the broad and cultivated spirit in which it is made;
but as it is presented only as a statement of a conversation with Mr.
Freer, it is requested by the committee that Secretary Langley com-
municate with Mr. Freer, and suggest to him that he put in more
precise form his views and his wishes, so that the action which the
committee may recommend to the Board shall be such as will exactly
set forth Mr. Freer’s purposes and be given the careful consideration
appropriate to such an enduring benefaction.

“It is further requested by the committee that Mr. Freer be com-
municated with in such time that his reply may be received and be
considered by the committee before the meeting of the Board, which
occurs on January 25, 1905.”

After reading several communications from Mr. Freer on the
subject, and the correspondence between him and the Secretary, the
following resolution was adopted :

“Resolved, That the Chancellor appoint a committee of three
Regents, whose duty it shall be to make personal examination of the
collection of art objects which Mr. Charles L. Freer has proposed to
give or bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution, and make report to
the Board of its value and merits; and said committee is further
instructed to ascertain from Mr. Freer what alterations, if any, can
be made in the conditions of his very generous proposal; and the Sec-
retary of this Institution is hereby added as an additional member of
this committee.”

The following committee was then appointed: Doctor Angell,
Senator Henderson, Doctor Bell, and the Secretary

REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 6, 1905.

The Secretary asked the Board’s approval of his appointment of
Dr. Cyrus Adler as Assistant Secretary of the Institution, and the
following resolution was adopted:

“Resolved, That the appointment by the Secretary of Dr. Cyrus
Adler as Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

charge of the Library and the Exchanges, with such additional duties
as the Secretary may assign him, be approved.”

In the absence of Doctor Angell, chairman of the special commit-
tee, Senator Henderson presented a report giving an account of the
visit of the committee to Detroit and their conference with Mr.
Freer. The report was fully discussed, and the following resolution
was adopted :

“Resolved, That the Board of Regents take this occasion to express
their sincere thanks to Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, for the cour-
tesy shown to the committse of the Regents which recently visited
Detroit to examine his art collection; and that further consideration
of his generous offer to donate the same to this Institution or the
United States be continued until the next meeting of the Board of
Regents.”

The Secretary stated that Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore,
had donated to the Institution his entire botanical collection, and the
Board adopted the following resolution:

“Resolved, That the thanks of the Board of Regents be tendered
to Capt. John Donnell Smith for his generosity in presenting to the
Institution his large and valuable collection of plants and books on
botany, which is gratefully accepted.”

The Secretary stated that a room in the Smithsonian building had
been fitted up as a temporary resting place for the remains of Smith-
son, and asked the Regents to be present at their transfer.

After adjournment, the Regents repaired to the room referred to,
where, in their presence, the remains were placed within the tomb,
which was then sealed.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Sixty years ago, when Joseph Henry became the first Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution, the scope of the work he assumed was
practically unlimited; Smithson’s direction being that his bequest
was to be used for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.” After considering many suggestions as to how this might best
be done, Professor Henry decided that the proper function of the
Smithsonian Institution was “to assist men of science in making
original researches, to publish them in a series of volumes, and to give
a copy of them to every first-class brary on the face of the earth.”
This has remained the policy of the Institution; and although its
operations have, of necessity, been modified from time to time, its
original breadth of scope has never been narrowed.

The methods of assisting in original research have been various.
Numerous grants have been made to qualified investigators, and
xpeditions have been sent out in many directions. Several enter-
prises undertaken by the Institution on a small scale outgrew the
original intention and, in accordance with the policy of the Institution
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

not to carry on work that could be done elsewhere, have been allowed
to establish themselves independently, chief among which are the
United States Weather Bureau, the Geological Survey, and the Fish
Commission. Other establishments, as the National Museum,, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, and
the National Zoological Park, have continued under the direction of
the Institution. It led the way in the organization of brary work in
the United States; it took the initial steps and continues to support
schemes for international cataloguing, and it maintains a benevolent
relation with the American Historical Association and the National
Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The results of all important investigations and the operations
of the Institution and its dependencies are reported upon constantly.
Its publications, which include more than 250 volumes, are to be
found in all the important libraries of the world, and some of them
on the work table of every scientific student. Through the agency of
the International Exchange System, these works, together with other
public documents and learned treatises, are distributed throughout the
civilized world, and the foreign works received in exchange are
invaluable in American scientific lbraries.

Thus the Smithsonian Institution is in constant association with
the Government and all the public institutions of the United States.
To them the Institution holds out a friendly cooperation, its aim
being, while continuing its own work upon its accepted lines and
adapting them to new needs as occasion arises, to continue along the
established policy of preventing rivalries, promoting wise cooper-
ation, diminishing waste, and furthering the search for knowledge,
the recording of discovered truth, and its dissemination among the
people.

In this great work the individual is not lost sight of; the publi-
cations of the Institution are widely distributed, its library constitutes
an important part of the Library of Congress, and its museum is the
rarest in existence in many branches of the natural history and eth-
nology of the New World. Less imposing than these methods of
serving the public, but no less important, is the satisfaction of a con-
stant stream of inquirers, whose letters from every corner of the
country bring questions bearing on every branch of knowledge.

BUILDINGS.

The only important building operation carried on during the past
year, of course excepting the work on the new Museum building, was
the construction of a mortuary chapel to contain the tomb of James
Smithson, brought from Italy.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fe

When the San Benigno Cemetery at Genoa was expropriated for
municipal purposes by the Italian Government in 1903, the Regents
determined to bring the remains of James Smithson to Washington.
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the committee appointed for this pur-
pose, was successful in his mission, and on January 25, 1904, formally
gave the remains into the hands of the Regents. Doctor Bell’s report
and an account of the ceremonies incident to the removal and recep-
tion of the remains were published in the Annual Report for 1904.

The body, upon its arrival in Washington, was placed temporarily in
a room in the Smithsonian building containing the relics of Smithson.
While resting there, the remains were examined by medical experts
and found to be in a remarkable state of preservation. Meanwhile,
a small mortuary chapel was prepared for them on the immediate
left of the north entrance of the Smithsonian building, and on March
6, 1905, the remains were carried to this chapel and, in the presence of
the Regents, replaced in the original tomb, recently brought from
Genoa (plates 1, m1), where they will rest until Congress makes
adequate provision for their interment.

Work on the reconstruction on the large archeological hall in the
main Smithsonian building has continued throughout the year, as
has the process of repairing various portions of the roof of the Mu-
seum, including the re-covering of the central rotunda. Some time
has also been spent in going through the subcellar of the Museum
building removing dead wires, whitewashing, and otherwise improy-
ing its condition.

FINANCES.

tain approved railroad bonds which form part of the fund established
by Mr. Hodgkins.

At the beginning of the fiscal year July 1, 1904, there was a
deficit of $362.80 instead of a credit balance of $46,648.33, as stated
in my report for the year ended June 30, 1904. On June 2, 1905, it
was discovered that the accountant of the Institution was a defaulter,
and that by the aid of false entries and erasures he had been able to
conceal his misdeeds from detection. He was immediately placed in
the custody of the law and an examination of the books and accounts
was commenced, but the total amount of the defaleation had not been
determined at the close of the fiscal year, and a more complete
statement will be submitted in a special report.

During the year the total receipts deposited in the Treasury of the
United States in behalf of the Institution were $74,761.72. Of this
sum $57,060 were derived from interest, $10,000 from a temporary
loan, and the balance of $7,701.72 from miscellaneous sources. The
disbursements during the year amounted to $69,245, the details of
which are given in the report of the executive committee. The
balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1905,
for the expenses of the Institution, was $5,153.92.

During the fiscal year 1905 the Institution was charged by Con-
gress with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

RESEARCHES.

In accordance with the original plan of the Institution that its
Secretary should devote his time to scientific matters as well as
administrative,* research work in various fields has been continued
under my direction by the Institution and its dependencies.

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest,
which are referred to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology
the Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological,
geological, and ethnological researches, which will be found fully
described elsewhere in this report.

HODGKINS FUND.

Frequent applications for grants from the Hodgkins fund are
received; and while, as noted in previous reports, the conditions
establishing the foundation are such as to measurably restrict the
scope of its activities, all requests for aid are carefully considered
and acted on. In addition to the researches here mentioned, reports
on several interesting investigations, already noted as in progress,
are still awaited and will be published later.

A grant has been approved on behalf of Mr. A. L. Rotch, of Blue
Hill Meteorological Observatory, whose investigations of the upper

and present such facts and principles as may be developed for publication in
the Smithsonian contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents,

10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

air currents by means of kites have been aided by the Hodgkins
fund. Mr. Rotch conducted a series of experiments at the St. Louis
Exposition with ballons-sondes, which carry instruments only, these
recording automatically the temperature and pressure of the air,
the duration of flight and the place of landing, indicating also the
velocity and direction of the air currents traversed. The success of
these first experiments in America with recording balloons was such
as to warrant their continuance under the same direction, and on
their termination the results will be embodied in a report by Mr.
Rotch for publication by the Institution.

A paper on the Construction of a Vowel Organ, by Dr. E. W.
Scripture, has been recently published by the Institution. This arti-
cle gives the details of work under a Hodgkins grant approved for
the purpose and mentioned in my last report.

Tn extending his researches in connection with speech or phonetics
Doctor Scripture has been fortunate in securing individual gramo-
phone voice records of much historical interest. A voice record of
the Emperor of Germany was transmitted by Doctor Scripture in
January, 1905, for preservation in the United States National Mu-
seum. This record gives, in about two hundred words, the Emperor’s
conception of the aims and beauty of true manhood and of man’s
duty to his fellow, and recognizes the wisdom of the Almighty and
Omniscient Creator. At present only one other record of His Maj-
esty’s voice exists, namely, one made at the same time for preserva-
tion in the hbrary of Harvard University.

The experiments conducted by Mr. Alexander Larsen, of Chicago,
in connection with the photography of lghtning flashes, with a
special effort to measure their duration, mentioned in my last report
as having been aided by a limited grant from the Hodgkins fund,
have been continued during the year and the results carefully re-
ported. An interesting research on the fluorescence of minerals has
also been carried on by Mr. Larsen, more than 100 specimens, sent for
the purpose by the Institution, having been examined and reported
on. During these experiments many interesting facts have been
noted, which may prove the basis of further investigation.

A moderate additional grant has been approved during the year
on behalf of Doctor von Lendenfeld, of the K. K. Zoologisches Insti-
tute, Prague, to assist in defraying the cost of the construction of an
improved apparatus for taking the serial instantaneous photographs
required for studies of the flight organs of animals. Doctor von
Lendenfeld has given serious and protracted attention to this subject,
in connection with which numerous articles prepared by him, or
under his direction, have been published. A paper by Doctor Mascha,
supervised by Doctor von Lendenfeld, on “ The Structure of Wing-
Feathers,” has recently been printed in the Smithsonian Miscella-

appeared in the Smithsonian Report for 1904. |

In May, 1905, a grant was approved on behalf of Prof. W. P. Brad-
ley, of Wesleyan University, for an experimental investigation of the
expansion of air through a nozzle. As all practical forms of appa-
ratus for the production of liquid air depend, so far, upon this type of
expansion, the research is deemed an important one, the more so from
the fact that the theory of the nozzle expansion of gases is in dispute
and must apparently remain so until more complete data are secured.

The results of previous experiments in the liquefaction of air, car-
ried on by Professor Bradley at Wesleyan University, show conclu-
sively that he is in an exceptionally favorable position for the direc-
tion of an extended inquiry into the factors which make for efficiency
in such a research, and as it is expected that further investigation
will materially aid a decision as to certain questions concerning which
experimentalists are not fully agreed, the report to be submitted by
Professor Bradley is awaited with interest.

Early in the year 1904 a third grant was approved on behalf of
Dr. Carl Barus to aid in preparing the completed report of his
recent research for publication. This memoir, “A Continuous Record
of Atmospheric Nucleation,” is in press, as one of the Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge, and will be the third and last volume of
the series giving a detailed account of the investigation of Doctor
Barus. <A request that a summary of the work should be prepared by
the author for presentation before the first international congress on
ionization and radioactivity at Liége in September, 1905, was ap-
proved, thus enabling an investigation on a subject of much immedi-
ate interest, prosecuted under the auspices of the Institution, to be
brought to the attention of this notable gathering.

The subscription to the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism and
Atmospheric Electricity has been renewed for the present year, with
the understanding that the publication will be maintained in the
future without such aid, a stipulated number of copies being for-
warded this year, as heretofore, to addresses designated by the Insti-
tution.

Among the miscellaneous investigations aided by the Institution
during the year I may mention that Dr. Edward L. Greene, asso-
ciate in botany, United States National Museum, has undertaken to
prepare for publication by the Smithsonian Institution a monograph
to be entitled “ Landmarks of Botanical History.” Doctor Greene
expects to complete this work in two years. Dr. Albert M. Reese,
of Syracuse University, received a small grant to assist him in his
1b REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

work of collecting in Florida the materials for the study of the em-
bryology of the alligator, and in subsequent investigations. Mr.
W. A. Bentley, of Jericho, Vt., has from time to time made numer-
ous photographs of snow crystals and has recently turned over to the
Institution 500 glass positives of his best and most interesting photo-
graphs, together with a descriptive paper relating to them.

NAPLES TABLE.

The Smithsonian seat in the Naples Zoological Station has been
continuously occupied for the greater part of the present year and,
as heretofore, the reports submitted at the close of appointments
mention the exceptional opportunities for special research afforded
at Naples.

To avoid the confusion and inconvenience likely to result from the
duplication of appointments, Doctor Dohrn has recently made a
request that two students should not be assigned to Naples at the same
period without previous consultation with the management of the
station. In order, therefore, to meet the wishes of the always
courteous and accommodating director, it is desirable that those wish-
ing to occupy the Smithsonian seat should enter their applications
as long a time as possible in advance of the period decided on. This
will permit the necessary correspondence in regard to each appoint-
ment, when, as is not infrequently the case, there are more applicants
than can be readily provided for, and will perhaps also at times
afford the opportunity for the extra occupation of an unassigned seat.

It may be added that appointments covering twelve months of the
year 30, 1905, to June 30, 1906—have already been approved,
but as two students are to be received during the same period for one
limited appointment, it may be possible to approve additional brief
sessions during the year. As before announced, applications for the
ensuing year may be taken up for consideration at any time within
six months of the period desired.

The appointment of Prof. J. B. Johnston, of the Uae of
West Virginia, terminated March 1, 1905. While at Naples Doctor
Johnston obtained and prepared a large amount of .material for
future experiment and study. Being an experienced teacher, he
hopes to embody the results so far secured in a more complete and
exact account of the brain, which will be incorporated in a text-book
on The Nervous System of Vertebrates, now in course of preparation.

In April Doctor Johnston was succeeded at the station by Dr.
Stewart Paton, a former member of the teaching staff of Johns Hop-
kins University, on whose behalf a second appointment of six months
from November 1, 1905, has since been approved. A previous inves-
tigation to determine the time when the first spontaneous movements
and definite reactions to external stimulation occur in the embryo

will be continued by Doctor Paton, who will investigate also the
correlative structural changes in the central nervous system that ac-
company these functional developments, and will endeavor to deter-
mine the elements which conduct the nervous impulses.

I am glad to state that the advisory committee continues the same,
and to record my appreciation of the helpful action of the members
in recommendations as to appointments to the Smithsonian seat.

EXPLORATIONS.
ARCHEOLOGY OF GULF STATES OF MEXICO.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, a member of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, has carried on an extended archeological reconnoissance for
the Smithsonian Institution in the Gulf States of Mexico. His trip
was successful, adding information to what 1s known of the prehis-
toric inhabitants of this rich but only partially explored region.
While the main object of this visit was the increase of our knowledge
of Mexican archeology, attention was incidentally given to the strik-
ing likeness of many prehistoric objects observed to those from the
United States and its bearing on the question of culture migrations.
An area was shown in each of the States of Vera Cruz and Tamauli-
pas, as typical of the prehistoric culture of this region, one of these
extending from Xalapa, capital of Vera Cruz, to the Gulf coast, the
other being near the city of Tampico, on the banks of the Panuco and
Tamese rivers.

The numerous ruins or mounds that occur in these areas, rarely
visited by archeologists, are supposed to be typical of the former
culture of two great allied peoples, the Totonacs and Huaxtecs, who
in prehistoric times inhabited the greater part of Vera Cruz and what
is now southern Tamaulipas.

On account of its historical as well as archeological importance,
& visit was made to the little-known ruin of Cempoalan, a Totonac
metropolis visited by Cortés, the conqueror of Mexico. Archeo-
logical literature pertaining to this city is very scanty; there is not
a single description in English of the still well-preserved temples of
this remarkable capital. On his visit to the site of Cempoalan
Doctor Fewkes obtained many fine photographs of the four stately
pyramids and gathered much data regarding their construction. He
also studied and took photographs of the many small objects found
in the neighborhood of the mounds that will later be published. An
attempt to determine the site of another flourishing Totonac city
revealed, near the ancient Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, an important
cluster of earth mounds of considerable size. These were also photo-
graphed and their relics studied.
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Doctor Fewkes visited several large ruins in the neighborhood of
Xalapa, one of which, near Xicochimalco, he has identified as the
remains of the pueblo of Sochimatl, mentioned by Bernal Diaz del
Castillo, historian of the conquest. By this identification new light
is shed on the hitherto obscurely known route of the conquerors from
Cempoalan over the mountains to the plateau of Mexico.

The extensive group of large earth mounds, some of which are
remains of pyramidal temples, situated at Texolo, near Xico, were
also visited, and important material was gathered from them bear-
ing on their prehistoric inhabitants. The numerous ruins in the
vicinity of Tampico were found to be extensive, and objects from
them revealed evidences of a high development of culture. Of the
large Huaxtee pueblo called Chila, subdued by Cortés, nothing now
remains but a group of mounds in an almost impenetrable forest a
few miles from Tamos. Many sites of prehistoric pueblos were
found on the banks of the Panuco; some of these were once temples,
others mortuary hillocks containing pottery offerings and bones of
the dead. Numerous shell heaps occur in this region, some of which
were visited and examined. About a mile from Tampico, Doctor
Fewkes reports, he found a cluster of large earth mounds of con-
siderable extent, up to within a few years concealed by a dense jungle.
The most notable ruins in this region he on the banks of the Cham-
payan lagoon, at the Rancho de San Francisco and Cebadella. In the
Sierra de Palma there is a pyramid having a cut-stone facing and
stairways similar to those in the Totonac region.

THE SMITHSONIAN ALASKAN EXPEDITION.

An expedition to Alaska and adjacent territory was made during
the summer of 1904 by Mr. A. G. Maddren, under the direction of
the Smithsonian Institution, for an examination of the Pleistocene
deposits of northern Alaska, in which most of the mammoth and
other vertebrate remains occur. His report treats of these forma-
tions and the criteria by which they are to be distinguished from
the more recent ice and alluvial deposits which have been variously
noticed and discussed by travelers and writers. He says:

The problems of geographic distribution of the animal and vegetable life
of North America in Pleistocene time with the disturbance of faunas and
floras caused by the widespread glaciation during that period and their s=b-
sequent readjustment over the glaciated area all combine to form a complex
arrangement, to solve which will require large collections of specimens from
the Pleistocene deposits of the unglaciated area of Alaska and the adjacent
Canadian territory. At present our knowledge of this fauna and flora is
very limited. As far as we know, only one species of elephant (Hlephas primi-
genius), the mammoth, inhabited Alaska and Siberia during Pleistocene time.

The longest mammoth tusk so far reported from Alaska is one 12 feet 10
inches long, measured on the outside of the curve. Remains of the rhinoceros
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

have not been reported with those of the mammoth in Alaska, as in Siberia, and
it also appears that the remains of the mammoth in Alaska are not in as fresh a
state of preservation as those found in Siberia, which points to the surmise that
the mammoth became extinct in Alaska before the last of the species succumbed
in Siberia. Associated with the mammoth were herds of large bison and horses.
This species of horse may have been the last native to North America, the rear
guard of the last migration of these animals across the region of Bering Straits
to Asia before the land connection disappeared. There was a species of musk-ox,
together with sheep and bear. Descendants of these last three forms have by -
adaptive changes survived in these northern regions down to the present time.

The relation that the fauna and flora north of the area occupied by glaciers
bore to that region, in the United States before, during, and after separation by
the snow and ice fields; also the relation of forms in Alaska to those of Siberia,
with the time and duration of the land connection across Bering Straits and
- their subsequent separation, form a complex problem, the solution of which will
require the accumulation of much material.

Mr. Maddren summarizes his conclusions as follows:

I. That while remnants of the large Pleistocene mammal herds may have
survived down to the Recent period and in some cases their direct descendants,
as the musk-ox, to the present, most of them became extinct in Alaska with the
close of Pleistocene.

II. The most rational way of explaining this extinction of animal life is by a
gradual changing of the climate from more temperate conditions, permitting of
a forest vegetation much farther north than now, to the more severe climate of
to-day, which, subduing the vegetation and thus reducing the food supply, besides
directly discomforting the animals themselves, has left only those forms capable
of adapting themselves to the Recent conditions surviving in these regions to
the present.

Ill. There are no facts to support the contention that the climate of the Arctic
and sub-Arctic regions ever has been colder than it is at present.- There are no
phenomena presented in those regions that require a more severe climate than
that now existing to account for them. There are no ice deposits in Alaska,
except those of large glaciers, that may be considered of Pleistocene age. There
are no ice beds interstratified with the Pleistocene deposits of Alaska.

IV. That the various forms of land ice, together with the deposits of peat,
now existing through the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of Alaska belong to the
Recent period, and these deposits may be most conveniently and logically classi-
fied by their position with reference to the Pleistocene and Recent formations
and the ice deposits, can not be differentiated satisfactorily into deposits of
snow or of water origin by their physical structure and character alone.

THE SMITHSONIAN GLACIER EXPEDITION.

The expedition dispatched by the Smithsonian Institution to the
Canadian Rockies and Selkirks, under the immediate direction of
Prof. William H. Sherzer, of the Michigan State Normal School,
had a successful season’s work on the glaciers along the line of the
Canadian Pacific Railway. .A selection was made of those five gla-
clers which are at the present time most readily accessible to the tour-
ist or the student of glacial geology, and these were found to exhibit,
more or less strikingly, the characteristics of glaciers throughout
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the world. It may be a matter of surprise to many to learn that
four or five days of comfortable railway travel places one in the
midst of snow fields rivaling in size and grandeur those of Switz-
erland, that the ice bodies descending from these fields may be studied
from modern hotels as a base, and that of those to be reported upon
one may safely ride a horse to the very nose of each. For trips on the
ice to the passes and neighboring peaks experienced Swiss guides are
available during the summer months. So far as is known, there is
here the most magnificent development of glaciers of the Alpine type
on the American continent, and the purpose of the survey was to
gather as much information concerning them as the time and facilities
rendered possible. Many photographs with which to illustrate the
details of glacial structure were obtained, a number of which ac-
company a preliminary report of the expedition printed in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. Professor Sherzer reviews
his work as follows:

Field work began July 1, 1904, with two assistants, and continued until the
middle of September, camps being made at Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and in
Yoho, Asulkan, and Ilecillewaet valleys, in each case as close as practicable
to the glaciers under study. Quite in contrast with the two preceding summers,
that of 1904 proved exceptionally propitious for field studies. The unusual
number of bright days and the reduced precipitation, however, reacted unfavor-
ably in that they permitted forest fires to spread in several of the valleys, and
during. much of the summer the atmosphere was more or less charged with
smoke, rendering distant photography unsatisfactory or quite impossible.

Covered with a veneering of rock débris over its lower third, the Victoria
glacier, at Lake Louise, is not the most interesting of the series te the casual
observer, who is liable to carry home the idea that it is simply a stone heap,
and a rather uninteresting pile at that. Geologically, however, this glacier is
the most active and varied of any of those that can be conveniently reached in
the entire region, and nearly six weeks were devoted to the study of it and its
tributary, the Lefroy. In spite of the many visits which a camp alongside the
glacier for this length of time permitted, as well as numerous visits during two
previous seasons, not one failed to reveal some new feature or to shed important
light on one previously observed. This longer stay at the Victoria permitted
Ineasurements of the forward flow of ice under variable conditions of tempera-
ture, the construction of an accurate cross section, the determination of the
amount of surface melting, and the varying amounts of drainage and sediment
discharged—work which was not feasible on the other glaciers, to each of which
but seven or ten days could be devoted. <A detailed survey was made of each of
the five glaciers, from the nose around each way to the nevé field, by means
of plane table or compass and steel tape, and full data for a map of the ice and
moraines and for a general description were procured. Especial attention was
given to the structure of the ice itself, with the hope of shedding more light on
some of the points still under discussion.”

Only the most general statements concerning those results of the field studies
in which the scientific public may be interested will now be noted. The glaciers
generally were found to be still in retreat, the Wapta, at the head of Yoho
Valley, having exceeded its average of the last three years by a few feet, while
the Lllecillewaet, at Glacier House, receded but one-third of the average which it

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. We

has maintaind during the last seventeen years. The Asulkan, in an adjoining
yalley, which had been advancing for about two years, has remained practi-
cally stationary during the last year. The Victeria presents an oblique front
of nearly half a mile, and its lower 800 feet, completely veneered with rock
as above stated, has pushed out into the forest at a comparatively recent
date. This part has remained quiet apparently for a number of years, but accu-
rate measurements to stones embedded in the face show that a very gradual
wastage occurred during the summer, with a small stream of clear, ice-cold
water as confirmatory evidence.

Farther up, for a distance of about 1,600 feet, there is a steep ice front which
is so nearly parallel with the main axis of the glacier that there is a question as
to whether it is not its side. Here the front of the ice is receding, the amount
for the last year being about the same as the average maintained for the last
five or six years, and this in spite of an actual forward flowing movement of the
ice of 2 to 3 inches daily in summer and perhaps half this amount in winter.
The Wenckchemna glacier, in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, proved of exceptional
interest because of its almost unique character, only one other of the type—the
Malaspina in Alaska—having been described. The Wenckchemna consists of a
sluggish ice mass, relatively short, but broad, formed by the lateral coalescence
of about a dozen short ice streams, each of which retains its identity more or
less perfectly entirely across the glacier, and maintains its own nose and
motion independently of its neighbors. Accurate measurements to stones embedded
in the frontal slope showed that some of these ice streams are stationary, some
receding, and others advancing, the most rapid advance being near the center,
where freshly cut trees were observed. To those who do not fully appreciate
all the factors of the problem it is frequently a matter of surprise that a
glacier in one valley may be in retreat while that in an adjacent valley may be
advancing, as has just been the case in the Asulkan and Illecillewaet valleys;
but in the case of the Wenckchemna there is still more varied behavior in
streams that are actually side by side almost throughout their length.

PUBLICATIONS.

It is largely through its publications that the Institution carries
out that vital principle of its foundation, “the diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” Each year adds something of importance to the
long series of published works comprised in the Smithsonian Contri-
butions to Knowledge, the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,
and its Annual Reports. All these are published by the parent Insti-
tution, but the series is augmented by the Proceedings and Bulletins
of the National Museum, the Reports and Bulletins of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, and the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory, which bring before the public specialized matter no less
important.

The details of the work of the past year are given in the Editor’s
report, the subjects treated in that time including practically every
branch of human knowledge.

To the series of Contributions there has been added a third memoir
by Dr. Carl Barus, entitled “A Continuous Record of Atmospheric
Nucleation,” in which the author further discusses his researches on
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the nucleus, as published in “ Experiments with Ionized Air” (Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, vol. xxrx, 1901) and in. “ Strue-
ture of the Nucleus,” issued as part of the same volume in 1903. The
investigation was carried on with the aid of a grant from the Hodg-
kins fund. Doctor Barus describes the nucleus as a dust particle
small enough to float in the air but larger than the order of molec-
ular size, and shows that such a particle precipitates condensation in
an atmosphere saturated with water in its immediate vicinity. He
uses the term “nucleation ” to denote the number of nuclei per cubic
centimeter regardless of their source—which may be from mechan-
ical, thermal, chemical, high potential, or radio-active processes—or
their special properties. By far the greater number are initially
ionized, or at least carry an electric charge, and where they occur in
thousands and millions of approximately uniform size they give
rise to condensational phenomena of transcendent beauty and im-
portance.

The articles printed in the Miscellaneous Collections are, as the
name of the series would indicate, miscellaneous in character. The
past year has added 38 numbers to this series of papers, including
several relating to the bibliography of chemistry; an exhaustive
catalogue of Diptera, or two-winged flies, showing the geographical
distribution of several species known to spread disease; accounts of
explorations in Alaska and among the Canadian glaciers; some in-
teresting popular papers by Doctor Gill on the sculpin, the tarpon,
the ladyfish, and the carp, and a lecture by Dr. Andrew D. White on
the diplomatic service of the United States, the first of the series of
lectures under the Hamilton bequest.

The Contributions and Miscellaneous Collections just spoken of are
published at the expense of the Institution fund in editions of 1,500
copies, and are intended solely for distribution to the large lbraries
and institutions of learning throughout the world.

The Annual Report, on the other hand, is published by a Govern-
ment appropriation in an edition of some 12,000, and is intended
for a more general distribution. Primarily, this volume is a report
to Congress on the operations of the Institution during the year, but
its popular interest lies largely in its General Appendix, contain-
ing a number of papers showing the recent progress of the world’s
scientific work. To the selection of appropriate papers for this Ap-
pendix I have given much personal attention for several years past.

The manuscript of the work of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode, on
some contributions of America to the progress of science, which dur-
ing the past year has been worked over by Mr. Kenneth M. Goode,
editorial assistant, is now almost in its final shape, and will, I hope,
appear as a Smithsonian publication during the coming year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The Institution proper distributed during the year a total ot
60,063 volumes or parts of volumes of the series of Smithsonian
Contributions, Miscellaneous Collections, Reports, and publications
not included in the regular series, making an increase of 13,455
over the number sent out during the previous year.

THE LIBRARY.

The library of the Smithsonian Institution is, first of all, a library
of science, and, secondly, a collection of catalogues and bibliographical
apparatus. ‘The general aim, as stated in the original plan, has been
“to procure a complete collection of the memoirs and transactions
of learned societies throughout the world, and an entire set of the
most important scientific and literary periodicals.” In 1866 the main
portion of the Smithsonian library was for administrative purposes
transferred to the custody of the Library of Congress, and became one
of the important elements of that great National Library. This
collection continues as the Smithsonian Deposit. It has annually
increased in size and importance, and at present aggregates nearly
half a million entries.

There is retained at the Institution such books as are of immediate
importance to investigators carrying on their researches in the
Smithsonian buildings This reference collection, together with the
special libraries of the National Museum, the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, the National Zoological Park, and the Bureau of American
Ethnology, numbers about. 55,000 volumes.

Besides the accessions of books from customary sources, during
the past year there has been received a valuable library relating to
civil engineering bequeathed to the Institution by the late Dr. J.
Elfreth Watkins; also a collection of about 1,600 books on the flora
-of tropical America, presented by Capt. John Donnell Smith, and a
large number of additions to the Watts de Peyster Collection Napo-
leon Bounaparte.

The International Catalogue of Scientific Literature established
three years ago, with administrative headquarters in London, now
contains over half a million reference cards, 50,000 of which are
references made for the United States by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The entire work of preparing cards for this country is done
in connection with the library of the Institution, the cost of the
work thus far having been borne out of an allotment made by the
Institution.

aContributions to Knowledge, 4,540; Miscellaneous Collections, 27,558; Re-
ports, 25,425; publications not in regular series, 1,905; publications not Smith-
sonian yet distributed by the Institution, 635.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

CORRESPONDENCE.

From its correspondence it appears that the Institution is generally
considered by the public as an establishment to which requests may
be addressed for information on all branches of knowledge, for the
solution of various scientific problems, for the examination and
indorsement both of scientific investigations and crude, unscientific
speculations, for supplying answers to questions in prize contests, and
the like. It seems well, therefore, to state that while responses are
cheerfully given, as far as practicable, to all legitimate requests for
scientific information, the Institution does not undertake to maintain
a general question bureau. The communications received cover every
conceivable subject, from new theories of the physical phenomena of
the universe to a request for information as to the value of some sup-
posedly rare book, and the preparation of the data desired entails
the expenditure of a considerable amount of time and labor by the
members of the Institution’s staff. Many of these correspondents
are men of considerable culture and of much general reading, but are
wanting in that special training which is necessary for successful
scientific investigation, and correspondence with this class is especially
dificult to manage, since the rejection of the propositions made is
generally attributed to prejudice and is resented by the writers, who
array themselves as martyrs to science. it

During the year many letters have been received from inventors
who desire either grants of money with which to develop their various
devices or an expression of the Institution’s opinion as to the merits °
of their inventions. As the Institution has no funds from which such
aid can be given, and as the Secretary is prohibited by a decision of
the Board of Regents from expressing an opinion of this character,
he is obliged to refuse all such requests. It would seem proper to
state also that the Institution does not supply information of a com-
mercial nature, such as is customarily furnished for a fee by engineers
or other professional advisers, or which is designed to benefit some
individual rather than the public.

In spite of these restrictions, however, the conduct of this corre-
spondence is an important agency for the diffusion of knowledge
among men.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

In the message of President Roosevelt communicated to the two
Houses of Congress at the beginning of the third session of the
Fifty-eighth Congress (dated December 6, 1904) he says:

The collection of art contemplated in section 5586 of the Revised Statutes
should be designated and established as a national gallery of art, and the

Smithsonian Institution should be authorized to accept any additions to said
collection that may be received by gift, bequest, or devise.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. rk

The section of the Revised Statutes cited by the President is the
act of foundation of the Smithsonian Institution, which declares
that “ whenever suitable arrangements can be made from time to
time for their reception, all objects of art and of foreign and curious
research, all objects of natural history, plants, and geological and
mineralogical specimens belonging to the United States * * *
shall be delivered to such persons as may be authorized by the Board
of Regents to receive them, and shall be so arranged and classified
in the building erected for the Institution as best to facilitate the
examination and study of them;” so that the first object of the
Institution, in the eyes of its founders, appears to have been to give
it the curatorship of the Art collections of the nation.

During its early years this object was promoted in various ways;
among others, by the acquisition of a very valuable collection of prints
and engravings belonging to the Hon. George P. Marsh. After the
fire in the Institution in 1865 these prints were deposited for tempo-
rary safe-keeping in the Library of Congress and (with other works
of art) in the Corcoran Gallery.

Subsequently an appropriation was granted by Congress for mak-
ing a fireproof room in which these could be kept, but it was not until
1896 that the Regents provided for their recall to the Institution. In
the journal of the proceedings of the Board for 1896 (Smithsonian
Report, 1896, pp. xii and xiv) will be found the action taken by the
Board providing for their restoration to their own immediate control.
The following resolution offered then by Senator Gray was adopted:

Resolved, That the question of the propriety of bringing the works of art
belonging to the Institution under the more immediate control of the Board of
Regents be referred to the executive committee and the Secretary, with power
to act.

In pursuance of this the Institution brought back to its own keep-
ing a number of prints of value, both from the Library of Congress
and the Corcoran Gallery, leaving, by an amicable understanding with
the latter establishment, as a loan, a few of the works of art, notably
a large picture by Healy.

The old name of the collections was the “ Gallery of Art,” a title
which seems almost too ambitious for the present collections of the
Institution, though it is to be hoped that this designation will be
justified by their future increase. These have been placed by me in a
room specially fitted up for that purpose (the Art Room), under the
temporary charge of the hbrarian.

There is now in the courts awaiting legal interpretation a will con-
taining a bequest of a valuable collection of art objects.

On January 3, 1905, Mr. Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, offered under
certain contingencies to bequeath to the Smithsonian Institution his
valuable art collection, proposing at the same time to provide after
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

his death for a building of appropriate design and proportion, pro-
vided the Institution would undertake its maintenance. The objects
include a remarkable collection of the works of the late J. A. McNeil
Whistler and a number of oriental art objects. The proposal of
Mr. Freer is still under consideration by the Board of Regents.

HAMILTON LECTURE.

A number of years ago Mr. James Hamilton left a small bequest to
the Smithsonian Institution, the income of which was to be appro-
priated biennially by the Secretary, either in money or a medal, for
such contribution, paper, or lecture on any scientific or useful sub-
ject as the Secretary might approve.

The Regents of the Institution decided to let this small sum accu-
mulate, and it is only recently that the Secretary has found himself
able to commence to employ the income as a lecture fund. The first
address under the auspices of this fund was delivered by Dr. Andrew
D. White, LL. D., D. C. L., in the lecture hall of the National
Museum on March 9, 1905, and was entitled “* The Diplomatic Serv-
ice of the United States with some Hints toward its Reform.”

This lecture was printed by the Smithsonian Institution as a pam-
phlet of some twenty pages and was distributed to members of Con-
gress, officers of the Department of State, various members of the
diplomatic corps, the libraries of the larger universities, presidents of
colleges, and others likely to be interested in the important question
discussed.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

A great museum, in the modern usage of the word, has been defined
as “an institution for the preservation of those objects which best
illustrate the phenomena of nature and the works of man, and the
utilization of these for the increase of knowledge and for the culture
and enlightenment of the people.” This thought is that of one very
especially conversant with the subject, and implies both a collection
for the student and an exhibition for the visitor. It is this second
part of the museum’s work, the exhibition collection, which was
probably in the minds of those who originally described the future
Smithsonian museum as containing “ objects of art and of foreign
and curious research,” although even at that early date they added
“and all objects of natural history, plants, and zoological and min-
eralogical specimens belonging to the United States.” Under the
impulse of Congressional legislation the Museum has obtained a
signal advantage over the national museums of other countries, since
by law all collections made by the surveys of the Government of the
United States must be deposited here, thus providing for the sys-
tematic preservation of collections of great extent and vast im-
portance.

From the foundation of the Institution to about 1857 its specimens
were collected solely to serve as materials for research, and the exhi-
bition collections belonging to the United States were maintained
at the Patent Office. At the date mentioned Congress made an
appropriation to the Smithsonian Institution for the building of
cases to receive these collections, which were known as the “ National
Cabinet of Curiosities,” and from that time on the Institution’s
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

museum besides aiding students served to instruct and entertain the
public. The great growth of the Museum dates from the close of
the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, since’ which time collections have
been actively gathered and exhibited because of their educational
value. Neither purpose has been lost sight of because of the other,
and the instruction of the public has been secured not only by digni-
fied exhibition of interesting objects, but by adding to them series of
instructive labels based upon the maxim that a good educational
museum consists in a series of carefully prepared labels with well
selected specimens attached. With these two great purposes in mind
the Museum has now succeeded in bringing together catalogued
objects amounting to over 6,000,000 in number, the exhibition series
being so installed that the individual objects or groups would not
stand as inert curiosities by themselves, but are arranged in such
manner as to show their relation either to the orderly development
of nature or to the varied manifestations of human thought and
activity.

Tt can not but be realized that the Museum’s main attainment from
this point of view consists not only of the collections or of the build-
ing which houses them, but to an ever increasing degree in the posses-
sion of the experts who have the custody of these collections and the
knowledge to classify them and to make them available for public
instruction. I regret to say that the enormous growth of the col-
lections in the Museum has not been accompanied by any proportion-
ate increase in its administrative and scientific staff. The greatest
efficiency can hardly make up for the numerical inability to cope with
the increasing work, and it becomes each year more painfully appar-
ent that the personnel of the establishment must be materially aug-
mented if the present standards are to be maintained.

Despite this paucity of workers and the congested halls, the past year
has been as successful as any in the history of the National’ Museum.
During this time more additions to its collections have been recorded
than in any previous year save the period immediately following
the Centennial Exhibition of 1876. From the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition alone over thirty carloads were received, including many
valuable ethnological and technological exhibits. Besides this there
were the usual accessions from the Government surveys and from do-
nations and exchanges. Altogether, nearly 250,000 specimens have
been entered during the year, while a mass of material is yet to be
sorted out, these recent additions bringing the total number of speci-
mens now preserved in the Museum collections well over 6,000,000.

That only a very small fraction of these specimens can ever be on
public exhibition is evident, yet those stored away are by no means
the least important. The scientific staff is constantly engaged in re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25)

search in connection with the work of classification, and students
from kindred institutions frequently visit Washington or have col-
lections sent to them for investigation.

Duplicate material is used, when not actually needed for study,
for the purpose of exchange with other museums, and to a limited
extent, by authority given by Congress to the Regents of the Institu-
tion, for distribution among American schools. Fourteen thousand
specimens were distributed during the past year to schools and
colleges throughout the land for the general purpose of promoting
education.

The present crowded condition of the biulding has rendered it
difficult to place any more collections there, and such as come in from
one source or another are in the main temporarily stored in rented
buildings. While it has been found impossible to increase the
amount of material on exhibition, the standard of the objects ex-
hibited is being constantly improved, and the methods of installation
represent the most modern practice in this regard.

In the division of ethnology a place has been made for a Malaysian
collection contributed by Dr. W. L. Abbott and an interesting Philip-
pine exhibit gathered by Dr. E. A. Mearns. Over the hall of
mammals has been hung the cast of a great sulphur-bottom whale,
about 80 feet in length. Another noteworthy addition during the
past year is the reconstructed skeleton of a gigantic Triceratops, meas-
uring almost 20 feet.

During the course of the year scme 235,000 persons, an average of
753 visitors a day, have viewed these collections. This number would
unquestionably be greatly increased should it become feasible to open
the building at night or on Sundays.

Work on the new building, for the continuation of which Congress
at its last session appropriated $1,500,000, is progressing satisfac-
torily. The excavation was completed and the heavy conerete founda-
tion laid last autumn. The erection of the outer walls of granite is
now well under way.

The completion of this structure will, it is hoped, mark the begin-
ning of a new era in the activities of the National Museum. No
longer cramped for space, it can suitably care for the splendid col-
lections intrusted to its care; by exhibiting these, and by labels, pub-
lications, and lectures, it will still further endeavor to impart definite
instruction along definite lines to all who care to learn. Then, as
now, the first great lesson it will try to enforce is that a museum is
in nowise a cabinet of curios to while away an idle moment, but an
active instrument for the diffusion of knowledge among men.

26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The energies of the Bureau during the past year have been devoted
chiefly to preparing for publication the proposed Handbook of
Indians, which will include not only descriptions of the tribes and
their settlements, but also popular articles covering the whole range
of ethnological and archeological research relating to them. No
work of its kind so comprehensive in scope has ever been attempted,
and the effort to combine popular treatment with scientific accuracy
has involved an extra amount of time and labor. Almost all the
prominent ethnologists of the country have written special articles
for the Handbook, and all the staff of the Bureau and ethnologists
resident in the city have aided in criticism and revision.

Though somewhat curtailed through the necessity of retaining
several ethnologists for work on the Handbook, the field work of the
Bureau has been continued in Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, Indian
Territory, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, and Mexico. Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, made an
extended archeological trip through Mexico; Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, of
the National Museum, made a visit to Arizona in behalf of the
Bureau; and Mr. E. L. Hewett was commissioned to visit New Mex-
ico for the purpose of making researches among the ancient ruins of -
the so-called Pajarito Park district.

The systematic study of visiting Indian delegations has been con-
tinued with success. During the year 22 delegations consented to
be photographed, and in some cases allowed themselves to be meas-
ured and even to have plaster casts of their faces taken.

The work of compiling an archeological map of the United
States, which had received some attention in previous years, was
carried forward with all possible dispatch during the past year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has for more than fifty years been the medium of exchange of
documents and scientific publications between the Government and
learned institutions of the United States and those of foreign coun-
tries. Through its operations the Library of Congress has secured
a large collection of public documents, and an unequaled collection of
scientific serials has been acquired by the Institution for its deposit
in the Library of Congress. Each year the service grows in size
and importance. The weight of packages handled by it in 1899
was 317,883 pounds; in 1905 it was 474,871 pounds, an increase of
40 per cent in six years.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

hel

The number of exchange correspondents now aggregates 51,880,
or nearly 4,000 more than the number ten years ago. These are scat-
tered throughout every corner of the civilized world, and new centers
of scientific activity are opening up every year. It is largely through
the system of International Exchanges that the Institution realizes
the catholicity of its founder’s bequest, which contemplated the
diffusion of knowledge among all men. Moreover, this constant
exchange of courtesies among the learned institutions of the world
has not only served to enrich the universities, libraries, museums, and
learned societies of our country and those with whom we exchange.
but has at the same time done much to promote friendly relations
among the nations themselves.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The annual appropriation made for the service of the National
Zoological Park was in the following terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewer-
age, and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the
grounds; erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures and providing seats
in the park; care, subsistence, purchase, and transportation of animals, including
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees; the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals; the printing and publishing of operations, not exceeding
one thousand five hundred copies, and general incidental expenses not otherwise
provided for, ninety-five thousand dollars.

The collection of animals exhibited has increased, and comprised at
the end of the year over 1,300 individuals of all species. A consid-
erable number of these were born at the park, and 128 birds were
received from the exhibit made at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

The new house for mammals, mentioned in last year’s report, 1s
now approaching completion and will constitute one of the most
attractive features of the park. As this structure is necessarily built
from the general appropriation for the park, its progress is limited
by the amount of funds available for use. As the care of the animals,
the maintenance of the collection, the improvement and care of the
grounds, including the roads and walks, the repair of all structures,
fences, and inclosures must also be defrayed from this appropriation,
it is obvious that considerable economy must be exercised in order to
have any funds for the erection of buildings.

The park exists, in the words of the act of Congress, * for the
advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the
people.” The first and primary object is never to be lost sight of, but
in pursuance of the second much is done to facilitate the visits of those
who seek the pleasant influences of rural scenery and open air. For
this reason it is thought that attempts should be made to enhance the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

park features by greater care of the indigenous trees and the planting
of copses where such are required, by the establishment of seats, and
by perfecting the roads and walks as far as practicable. The park is
now the nearest to the city of any large stretch of open, picturesque
country, and this would seem to be almost a duty owed to the public.

This again brings to mind a project often urged upon Congress, but
never realized by an actual appropriation for the work. I refer to
the plan for extending the park to the nearest boundary road on the
southeast and the west. This has often been referred to in previous
annual reports, and it would seem that the present time is particularly
favorable for the accomplishment of this object, simce roads have
recently been established by act of Congress quite near to the present
boundaries.

Among the more pressing needs of the park is a small building
with outlying yards, which can be used as a hospital and quarantine
for sick animals and, incidentally, as a pathological and anatomical
laboratory. In this connection, in view of the fact that the primary
object of the park is for “ the advancement of science,” it must be
considered how much our knowledge has been increased by such es-
tablishments as the Jardin des Plantes, of Paris, under Buffon, Cuvier,
or Milne-Edwards; the gardens of the Zoological Society in London,
by Huxley and others, and those at Berlin and elsewhere. I approve
the recommendation of the superintendent that a modest laboratory
tor pathological research be added to the park equipment.

During the last year the number of visitors to the park has further
increased, and it is not too much to say that no equal expenditure by
Congress has brought so much of instruction and rational enjoyment
to the people.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As for several years past, the operations of the Astrophysical
Observatory have been almost wholly directed toward measuring the
amount of the solar radiation, and its loss in transmission through
the sun’s envelope and through our own atmosphere.

I do not yet regard the evidence of solar variability as conclusive,
but still as rendering this conclusion more probable, and I am glad
to state that two lnes of investigation have this year become very
prominent in the work of the Observatory, which will almost. cer-
tainly lead to a conclusion regarding this important question.

The first of these is the almost daily bolometric examination of the
large solar image formed by the great horizontal telescope, for the
purpose of detecting changes in the transparency of the solar absorb-
ing envelope. This work depends so little on the transparency of our
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

own atmosphere that it can be done almost as well in Washington as at
a station more favored as regards atmospheric transparency and free-
dom from clouds. The past year has not given evidence of very
marked variations either in the transparency of the sun’s envelope
or in the supposedly dependent mean temperature of the earth, but
on the contrary the observations have continued most of the time near
the mean in both respects. Such changes as have been noted are not,
however, contradictory to the view that alterations of the transpar-
ency of the sun’s envelope do occur, and cause changes in the amount
of solar radiation received by the earth, which in turn cause depar-
tures of the earth’s temperature from its mean.

The second line of investigation to which IT have referred above is
the determination of the total solar radiation outside our atmosphere,
by observations with the bolometer and pyrheliometer at a station
located in a relatively clear and cloudless region and at a considerable
altitude above sea level. As long ago as February, 1902, at the re-
quest of the Hon. C. D. Walcott, and for the consideration of the
Carnegie Institution, I urged in a letter to him the great utility of an
observatory for solar research to be located at a high altitude and
charged with the determination of the question of the amount of solar
radiation and the limits of its variability. An observatory for solar
research has now, in fact, been established by the Carnegie Institution
on Mount Wilson, in southern California, after extensive tests of
different proposed sites. By invitation of the director, Prof. George
K. Hale, and in accord with the authorization of Congress for the
undertaking of observations at high altitudes by the Astrophysical
Observatory, I have sent to Mount Wilson an expedition in charge of
Mr. C. G. Abbot, for the purpose of determining the conditions for
studying the variability of the sun.

The expedition is equipped with spectro-bolometric and pyrhelio-
metric apparatus of the highest quality, and wholly adequate to
making the most accurate possible determinations of solar radiation
and its transmission through our atmosphere. As I have elsewhere
remarked, I am not convinced that it is possible to estimate exactly
the loss of radiation in our atmosphere by any observations whatever,
but it does seem that the estimates which can be made from the
observations of the Mount Wilson expedition will be so close an
approximation to the truth that if a notable variation of solar
radiation outside our atmosphere occurs the results will show it.
Furthermore, similar observations are being continued as usual in
Washington. Mr. Abbot reports that the sky above Mount Wilson
is of great clearness and uniformity, and that weeks and even months
pass there without a cloud appearing above the horizon, so that
observations may be made almost every day with good prospects
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of success. It is expected that the expedition will remain on Mount
Wilson until late in the autumn.

I take this opportunity to express my obligation to the Carnegie
Institution and to Professor Hale and his coworkers for the aid
and counsel they have so generously extended in furthering the
objects of the expedition.

Additional details of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory
will be found in the report of the aid acting in charge.

NECROLOGY.
ORVILLE HITCHCOCK PLATT.

Tt is with a keen personal regret that I have to record the death
on April 22, 1905, of Senator Orville H. Platt, of Connecticut, who
for six years had served on the Board of Regents, and who at all
times took much personal interest in the welfare of the Institution.

Senator Platt was born in Washington, Conn., July 19, 1827.
After an academic education he undertook the study of law at Litch-
field. He was admitted to the bar in 1849, and practiced at Meriden.
He became secretary of state of Connecticut in 1857. In 1861-62
he was a State senator; later he served as a member of the State
house of representatives and as speaker of that body. From 1879
until the time of his death he was United States Senator from his
native State, and his public life belongs to his country. I shall not
add here my poor testimony to that of the history which will record
his contribution to the national good. He was a man honored by
all and best loved by those who best knew him.

Respectfully submitted.

S. P. Laneey,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the condition and
operations of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1905.

At the beginning of the year the excavation for the new building on the north-
ern side of the Mall was actively under way and in the autumn the heavy
concrete foundations were completed. In October, 1904, the contracts were
executed for the granite required for the outer walls and for the trimmings of
the two courts. Contracts for other materials were also entered into at intervals
during the remainder of the year, all at prices which insure the putting up of
the structure within the limit of $3,500,000 fixed by Congress. It was hoped
that work upon the basement might begin by February or March, but unfortu-
uately the winter was severe, with much snow, which interfered with quarrying,
and up to the close of the fiscal year not enough stone had been received to
warrant the commencement of building operations. The date at which this
report is written, however, permits it to be said that the first basement stone
was laid on August 21, 1905, and no further delays are anticipated.

In respect to the increase of collections, the year’s record has neyer been
exceeded, except during the period immediately following the Centennial Exhi-
bition of 1876. There were the usual accessions from the Government surveys
and through donation and exchange, but the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
held at St. Louis, furnished an opportunity probably not soon again to be
presented for securing a very large amount of valuable material, especially in
ethnology, mineral technology, and other branches of the useful arts, which was
accepted to the extent of over thirty carloads. Only a small proportion of these
objects could, however, be directly added to the classified and exhibition collec-
tions, owing to lack of space, and the greater part have been placed in storage
to await the completion of the new building.

Among the additions from other sources was one of special moment consisting
of the large and important private herbarium and botanical library of Capt.
John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, which the owner has most generously pre-
sented. The former comprises over 100,000 mounted plants, and the latter
above 1,500 volumes.

The number of accessions, including only that small part of the material
from the exposition which it was possible to place on record, was 1,692, and of
specimens 245,384.

Except for the crowded state of the buildings, the Museum is now in as
good condition as at any time in its history. The standard of the exhibition
collections was materially improved, though their expansion practically ceased
some years ago. The reserve, or study, collections were extensively utilized

. 31
oo! REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in the promotion of knowledge, and duplicate specimens to the number of over
14,000 were distributed to educational establishments throughout the country.

Buildings and equipment.—The roofs of the Museum building have, as usual,
demanded most attention in the matter of repairs. ‘The temporary strengthen-
ing a few years ago of the supporting iron framework over the main halls
has continued to be effective, but most of the slate covering had so far deterio-
rated that in 1904 the roof above the east hall was coated experimentally with
asphalt, burlap, and slag. Having answered its purpose through one season,
the roofs of the‘other halls and of the rotunda and one pavilion were similarly
treated during last year. The metal work upon the roofs also required extensive
overhauling, and several skylights were added. The 20 large windows in
archeological hall, which have been approaching a condition bordering upon
collapse, were completely repaired and made practically as strong as ever.

In view of the crowded condition of all the public halls, the building of only
a few exhibition cases was called for. 'To provide, however, for the care and
arrangement of the very extensive accessions received during the year, mainly
from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the Government surveys, and a few
large private donations, a considerable amount of storage furniture was de-
manded. The number of permanent cases of this character constructed was
213, and of drawers 1,032, in addition to which much shelving was put up and
many boxes made for the storage of material in bulk and the distribution of
duplicates.

The heating plant, with the addition of a few radiators, has given good
service. Steam was maintained from October 8, 1904, to May 2, 1905, on an
average of sixteen hours a day, the expenditure of coal amounting to 8380 tons.
A new arrangement of telephones was effected at the beginning of the year
whereby the cost was materially reduced, and as a special fire precaution six
standard alarm boxes of the pattern used by the District of Columbia have
been installed in different parts of the Museum building.

Organization and staff—The organization of the Museum remains the same
as heretofore, except that a Department of Mineral Technology, with Dr.
Charles D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, as cu-
rator, was established in the autumn of 1904, to permit of proper direction in
the selection of objects relating to this subject at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition.

Dr. Cyrus Adler was made curator, and Dr. I. M. Casanowicz assistant cu-
rator of the Division of Historic Archeology. In the Division of Plants Dr.
J. N. Rose was advanced to associate curator and Mr. W. R. Maxon to assistant
curator, the position of aid being filled by the appointment of Mr. J. H. Painter.
Dr. James E. Benedict, assistant curator of the Division of Marine Inverte-
brates, has supervised the exhibits in biology and had charge of the collections
of comparative anatomy. Mr. Herbert S. Barber was appointed aid in the
Division of Insects, and Mr. B. H. Ransom, of the Bureau of Animal Industry,
assistant custodian of the Helminthological collections.

Mr. Charles Schuchert, for some years assistant curator of Stratigraphic
Paleontology, who resigned to accept the professorship of paleontology in Yale
University, has been succeeded by Dr. Ray S. Bassler. Vacancies in the Sec-
tion of Vertebrate Paleontology were filled by the selection of Mr. James W.
ridley and Mr. Charles W. Gilmore as preparators, and of Mr. Norman H.
Boss as assistant preparator.

The following gentlemen, to whom the Museum has become indebted for dis-
tinguished services or noteworthy contributions, were designated as honorary
associates: In historic archeology, Dr. Paul Haupt, of Johns Hopkins University :
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

in zoology, Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadephia; in botany, Capt. John Donnel}
Smith, of Baltimore; in mineralogy, Rey. L. T. Chamberlain, of New York City ;
in paleobotany, Prof. Lester F. Ward, of Washington.

Additions to the collections——The principal source of accessions during the
past year was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The exhibition made in that
connection by the Museum itself contained many important objects acquired
through the Government appropriation for the exposition, which, excepting such
as were seat to the Lewis and Clark Exposition, were subsequently incorporated
in the publie series here. Much more extensive and noteworthy, however, were
the gifts made to the national collections by several foreign governments, by
many States of the Union, and by a large number of individuals having
exhibits at St. Louis. So extensive, in fact, were these contributions that they
amounted in bulk to about 20 carloads of specimens, besides five of exhibition
eases. Of this number 25 cars were filled with collections illustrative of
mineral technology alone, comprising examples of the natural and finished
products and of the appliances of manufacture in many branches of mineral
industry. Unfortunately the arrangement and display of this instructive
material must be deferred until more space becomes available through the com-
pletion of the new building. The Department of Geology also received many
important additions, especially in the way of large masses and pieces appro-’
priate for exhibition.. The contributions in ethnology, next in extent to those
in mineral technology, were exceedingly varied and interesting, since they relate
to the customs and industries of several peoples, and will richly supplement the
existing collections.

Through the accessions already noted, the total number of specimens in the
Museum has been increased to about 6,141,990, classified as follows: Anthro-
pology, 986,964 ; biology, 4,499,185; geology, 745,891.

The most noteworthy additions in ethnology, besides those obtained at St.
Louis, were from the several islands between Sumatra and Borneo, the Mergui
Archipelago, and the island of Mindanao of the Philippine group; from pueblos,
_cliff houses, and caves in western Socorro County, New Mexico; and from the
Apache and Pima Indians of Arizona, and the pueblo of Zuni. To the collec-
tions in physical anthropology was added a large amount of material bearing
upon the natural history of several races of man, especially the American
Indians, Negroes, Slavs, and Filipinos.

The most important acquisitions in historic archeology consisted of Arabic
manuscripts and prints from the Moros of Mindanao, and of coins, pottery
lamps, and jars from the Orient. The Division of Prehistoric Archeology ob-
tained two valuable collections of implements from Japan; many interesting
specimens from Australia and Tasmania, Cape Colony, Thuringia (Germany),
and Belmonti, Italy; and a large number of stone implements and pottery
from the United States, Mexico, and South America.

The collection of timekeeping devices was increased by several gifts and
loans, and acknowledgments are due to the War Department for depositing
numerous pieces of ordnance, among them being many of considerable historic
interest.

The Division of Graphic Arts received many contributions from foreign
exhibitors at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and two pictures taken by
Daguerre. Among the accessions in ceramics were an extensive and very
beautiful collection of glassware from the Union Glass Works; examples of
Teco ware and Van Briggle pottery, and a collection of typical Japanese and
Chinese porcelains and pottery and of Japanese lacquer work.

To the collection of American history were added 768 objects, mostly loans.
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

including many personal military relics and examples of the wearing apparel
and other articles of the colonial period in Maryland and New York.

Mention may here be made of the large oil portrait of the Empress Dowager
of China, painted by Miss Katherine A. Carl and presented to the United
States by the Government .of China, with appropriate ceremonies at the White .
House. The picture, encased in its heavy and elaborately carved frame of
camphor wood, was transferred directly to the custody of the Museum and
temporarily installed in the lecture hall.

About 217,538 specimens were acquired by the Department of Biology, the
principal increases as regards number of specimens being in the divisions of
Plants, Insects, and Mollusks, though in other branches the additions were not
less important. The Division of Mammals received large collections contain-
ing many novelties from Malaysia and the Philippine Islands, besides many
interesting specimens from southern Europe, Brazil, and Japan, the Kamerun
district of West Africa, and Bewean Island in the Java Sea. The most impor-
tant additions to the Division of Birds were from the Philippine Islands,
Malaysia, and Costa Rica. Of reptiles, collections were obtained from Japan,
Formosa, the Philippine Islands, Malaysia, China, France, Switzerland,
Jamaica, Guatemala, and several parts of the United States. The Division of
Fishes received by transfer from the United States Bureau of Fisheries type
collections from Samoan waters and Hawaii, and a very large number of
specimens from the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America.

The Bureau of Fisheries was also the largest single contributor to the Divi-
sion of Mollusks, haying transferred some 5,000 specimens from recent dredg-
ings of the steamer Albatross on the coast of California. Other important
accessions comprised land and fresh-water shells from Texas, California, and
Montana; about 1,500 identified specimens of Philippine shells from the collec-
tion of the late Herr Mollendorff, and many marine mollusks from Alaska.
While no single large collection was received by the Division of Insects, yet
as a whole the additions were of average importance, aggregating over 34,000
specimens from many parts of the world.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates obtained from the Bureau of Fisheries
300 lots of foraminifera from the region about the Hawaiian Islands and a
large collection of crustaceans and samples of ocean bottom from the Albatross
cruise of the winter of 1904-5 in the eastern part of the Central Pacific.
The most important additions to the Helminthological Collection was a series
of parasites from Hgypt.

The past year has been especially noteworthy as regards the increase of the
collection in the Division of Plants, the additions having been very much greater
than in any previous year in the history of the Museum, embracing 750 acces-
sions and 143,690 specimens. This was chiefly owing to the generous gift by
Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, of his entire private herbarium,
which alone contained 100,889 specimens from different regions, but mainly
from tropical America. This large and valuable donation, the work of many
years in assembling, was accompanied by a choice botanical library of over
1,500 volumes. The next important contribution was by transfer from the
United States Department of Agriculture of 13,965 specimens from many parts
of the United States, and from Alaska, Greenland, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala,
Hurope, and India.

The Department of Geology acquired by gift at the Louisiana Purchase Expo-
sition important series of ores, minerals, and economic products from Brazil,
Siam, Ceylon, Greece, and several of the States, and through other sources,
many interesting minerals and cut gems.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

The collections in Stratigraphic Paleontology were mainly increased through
transfers from the Geological Survey, of which the principal ones consisted of
large numbers of Niagaran fossils from Tennessee, of Ordovician fossils from
the slates at Arvonia, Va., and of Devonian and Carboniferous fossils from
Colorado. A very valuable acquisition was the gift by Mr. E. O. Ulrich and
Dr. R. S. Bassler of the type and figured specimens of G5 species. The Section
of Vertebrate Paleontology received two large collections from the Geological
Survey, one made in the Wasatch Hocene of the Big Horn basin, Wyoming, the
other from the Oligocene of Oelrichs, S. Dak. In Paleobotany, the most
important additions were about 400 specimens from the coal fields of Sao
Paulo and Santa Catharina, Brazil, and about the same number from the
higher beds of the anthracite series in the vicinity of Pottsville, Pa.

Explorations ——As custodian of the national collections, the Museum depends
chiefly for its increment upon the Government explorations conducted by such
establishments as the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Fisheries, several of the
bureaus of the Department of Agriculture charged with biological research,
and the Bureau of American Ethnology, though in the history of the Museum
both the Army and Nayy have figured conspicuously. The very limited means
available for the purpose prevents any extended amount of field work by
members of the Museum staff.

From October, 1904, to March, 1905, the steamer Albatross, of the Bureau of
Visheries, made extensive explorations in the eastern part of the Central Pacific
Ocean, under the scientific direction of Dr. Alexander Agassiz. For the Bureau
of American Ethnology Dr. J. Walter Fewkes investigated the sites of ancient
Totonac semicivilization in southern Mexico, and Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson
continued her studies among the Zuni Indians of New Mexico, both of these
expeditions being productive of important collections. Mr. E. A. Schwarz,
who visited Cuba for the Department of Agriculture, brought back a large collec-
tion of insects which is especially rich in Coleoptera. Mr. A. G. Maddren,
under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, made a reconnoissance of a
part of the Yukon River basin of Alaska, during which he secured fragmentary
remains of several interesting Pleistocene mammals.

Reference should also be made to the movements of two of the most generous
benefactors of the Museum, Dr. W. L. Abbott and Maj. Edgar A. Mearns, sur-
geon, U. S. Army, from both of whom important contributions were received
during the year. The former, with headquarters at Singapore, has recently been
working in the Mergui Archipelago and on the islands of Banka, Billiton, and
Karimata, where his detailed and painstaking inquiries have furnished most
important results in both zoology and ethnology; the latter, who was with the
army of Maj. Gen. Leonard Weod on the island of Mindanao, has collected in
the same lines and with the same care.

Of field work conducted by assistants of the Museum, the following may be
mentioned: Dr. Alés Hrdlicka, during his investigations among the Apaches and
Pimas of Arizona in the spring of 1905, obtained an important series of ethno-
logical specimens, and Dr. Frederick W. True made several short trips to near-by
places in Maryland and Virginia for the purpose of securing remains of the
cetaceans which occurred in this region during the Cretaceous period. Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., collected animals and plants in
Switzerland, France, and Italy during the summer of 1904. Mr. Robert Ridg-
way, who was in Costa Rica from November, 1904, to June, 1905, obtained a
large series of the birds of that country, and was instrumental in securing
tt most important donation from the national museum at San José. Dr. W. L.
Ralph visited the Dismal Swamp, Virginia, and the Adirondack region of New
York, while Mr. Barton A. Bean collected in Carroll County, western Maryland.
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Dr. F. V. Coville, while engaged in field work for the Department of Agricul-
ture in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico, obtained many plants which have
since been transferred to the Museum, and Prof. O. F. Cook made botanical
collections in Guatemala. Mr. W. R. Maxon was in Jamaica during the first
part of the year, and later, accompanied by Mr. Robert Hay, in Guatemala under
detail to the Department of Agriculture. In June, 1905, Dr. J. N. Rose, with
Mr. Joseph H. Painter, left on a collecting trip to Mexico, which will be con-
tinued during the summer.

The Department of Geology was enriched from several localities through
cooperative work with the United States Geological Survey, participated in by Dr.
George P. Merrill, and Dr. R. 8. Bassler; and in June Mr. Charles W. Gilmore
accompanied one of the field parties of the Survey to New Mexico, where he ob-
tained a small but interesting series of fossil vertebrates. ;

Researches.—The classified arrangement of the collections prescribed by
law calls for a large amount of research work in the study and naming of speci-
mens, although a greater or less proportion of the material received has already
been identified. A full compliance with this requirement has at no time been
possible, since the attention of the scientific staff on its past and present basis
has been mainly absorbed in the mere care and preservation of the collections,
and the maintenance of the exhibition features. Much help is obtained, how-
ever, from the scientific men of other institutions, many of whom are interested
in one or other of the subjects represented in the Museum, and they may visit
Washington or have collections sent to them for the purposes of investigation.
The results of most of the inquiries conducted in the Museum laboratories are
only indicated in the manuscript records, which are virtually a descriptive
history of the national collections, constantly in progress, but the working up of
a collection from any particular locality or region, or of a group of objects,
large or small, may lead to a positive contribution to knowledge, meriting dis-
semination through the medium of publication. Some of the more important
investigations of the past year, both by assistants of the Museum and by others,
have been as follows:

In the Department of Anthropology, Dr. Walter Hough began a detailed
study of the very extensive Pueblo collections, continued his observations upon
the primitive uses of fire, and nearly completed a report on the Hopi Indians
of Arizona. The collections in archeology were utilized by Mr. W. H. Holmes
in preparing subjects and illustrations for the Handbook of North American
Indians and by Dr. J. W. Fewkes in working up the results of his recent
archeological explorations in the Antillian region. Several lines of research
in physical anthropology occupied the attention of Dr. Alés Hrdliéka, and a
paper descriptive of the Howland loan collection of Buddhist religious art
was written by Dr. I. M. Casanowicz.

In the Department of Biology, Dr. F. W. True prepared a diagnosis of the
fossil skull of a new genus and species of sea lion from Oregon and began a
report on the collection of ziphioid whales in the Museum. Mr. Gerrit. S.
Miller, jr., spent several months at the natural history museums of London,
Paris, Berlin, and Leiden in completing his studies and identifications of the
very extensive Hast Indian collection of mammals belonging to the National
Museum and of material from other regions. Dr. H. A. Mearns, while in Wash-
ington during the winter, studied and described the unique collection of
mammals and birds which he brought from the Philippines and completed
the first part of his report on the mammals obtained in connection with the
Mexican boundary survey.

Mr. Robert Ridgway continued the preparation of his monograph on the
birds of North and Middle America. The birds obtained by Dr. W. L. Abbott
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. St

on the islands off the west coast of Sumatra were the subject of study by Dr.
Charles H. Richmond, and those secured by the same explorer in Kilimanjaro
and the China Sea by Mr. H. C. Oberholser, of the Biological Survey. Mr.
J. H. Riley reported on a collection from the islands of Antigua and Barbuda.
Mr. Barton A. Bean, in conjunction with Dr. C. H. Eigenmann, of Indiana
University, worked up the specimens of fishes brought from the Amazon
River by Prof. J. B. Steere in 1901. The Characinidz have been referred to
Doctor EHigenmann, and the Pacific deep-sea fishes are being studied by Dr.
C. H. Gilbert, of Leland Stanford Junior University.

Dr. W. H. Dall completed a revision of the land and fresh-water mollusks
of North America north of latitude 49°, a review of the classification of the
American Cyclostomatidze, and papers on land and fresh-water shells from the
Bahamas and Central America. He also has in progress reports on the
Pyramidellidze, in joint authorship with Dr. Paul Bartsch; and on recent
eollections from the Bureau of Fisheries. Dr. William H. Ashmead has about
completed his work on the superfamily-Formicoidea or ants, and Mr. D. W.
Coquillett has been engaged upon a monograph of the North American mos-
quitoes. Miss M. J. Rathbun prepared for the Bureau of Fisheries two reports
on Brachyura and Macrura, collected at the Hawaiian Islands and in Alaska,
and continued her studies on the fresh-water crabs. Dr. Harriet Richardson
completed a comprehensive monograph of the North American Isopods, and
Dr. T. Wayland Vaughan gave much time to the madreporarian corals.

Dr. J. N. Rose reports satisfactory progress with his researches on the flora
of Mexico and on the Crassulacez and Cactaceze of North America. Mr. William
R. Maxon prepared several papers on ferns, and Mr. J. H. Painter studied the
Mexican species of Meibomia. Capt. John Donnell Smith, associate in botany,
continued his investigations and the printing of his extensive work, and Dr.
EK. L. Greene, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, began upon an
important paper to be entitled “ Landmarks of Botanical History.”

Dr. George P. Merrill completed a contribution to a history of American
geology and conducted observations on the origin of asbestiform serpentine
and the weathering of building stones. Research work in mineralogy was
mainly confined to the study of the structure of meteorites by Mr. Wirt Tassin.
Dr. R. S. Bassler submitted a paper on the Bryozoa of the Rochester Shales.
The report of Dr. Anton Handlirsch, of Vienna, on the Paleozoic insects repre-
sented in the Museum collection was received during the year and will soon
be published. An important work, sent to press before the close of the year,
was a catalogue of the type specimens of fossil invertebrates contained in the
collections of the Museum.

In Paleobotany, Prof. Lester F. Ward completed the second part of his mono-
graph on the status of the Mesozoic floras of the United States. Mr. David White
has made extensive use of the Lacoe collection in the preparation of a report
on the stratigraphic succession of the Pottsville floras in the basins of the
Appalachian trough, while Dr. F. H. Knowlton has been engaged upon the
fiora of the Laramie group and in the study of material from Alaska.

Distribution and exchange of duplicate specimens.—Duplicate invertebrate
fossils to the number of some 60,000 specimens, gradually segregated from the
reserve series during the progress of researches, were prepared for the use of
educational institutions, being made up into several hundred sets. There also
remained on hand for the same purpose a few sets of fishes, marine inverte-
brate animals, and geological specimens illustrating rock weathering and soil
formation. Of these several. collections, which are recognized as very helpful
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in connection with science teaching in the higher schools and colleges, 121,
aggregating over 14,000 specimens, were distributed during the year. In making
exchanges with scientific establishments and individuals about the same num-
ber of duplicate specimens were utilized, but as an equivalent is obtained in
these transactions they directly benefit the collections.

Exhibition halls—The crowded state of the exhibition halls prevents any
extensive additions to the public collections, but specimens are frequently
received which are deemed of sufficient importance to replace others that have
been for some time on display, and the installations in all branches are being
constantly improved. In ethnology the interesting Malaysian collection of Dr.
W. L. Abbott and Philippine collection of Dr. E. A. Mearns were substituted for
some of the older material from Polynesia; the basketry collection was rear-
ranged and several conspicuous examples of the handiwork of the Indians of
southern Alaska were installed. To the exhibition in historic archeology were
added a series of biblical gems, coins of the Bible, oriental manuscripts, ete.
The entire collection of prehistoric archeology, occupying the large upper hall of
the Smithsonian building, recently renovated, is being thoroughly revised and
will soon again be opened to the public. The exhibits in technology received
some interesting accessions, especially in the lines of electrical apparatus, fire-
arms, and railroad appliances. In the gallery of ceramics the collection of
purely artistic ware in porcelain, glass, lacquer, and metal work was arranged
by countries in a series of separate cases.

The most important additions in biology consisted of objects which had been
obtained and prepared for the Museum display at the Louisiana Purchase
Hxposition, including a number of large exotic mammals, the skeleton and
east of the exterior of a sulphur-bottom whale about SO feet long, accurately
eolored casts of several large snakes, and a fine set of models of deep-sea
fishes. The American faunal exhibit of insects was nearly completed, and the
synoptic series of marine invertebrates was enlarged. A number of large exam-
ples of important rocks and ores, besides several minerals and gems, were
added to the collections in geology, but the most noteworthy feature was a
skeleton of the great fossil Dinosaurian reptile, Triceratops prorsus, consisting
chiefly of the actual bones of this Cretaceous monster, the few missing parts
being reproduced in plaster. It stands 8 feet 2 inches high and measures
19 feet 8 inches long.

Visitors.—The Museum building was visited during the year by 235,921 per-
sons, and the Smithsonian building by 149,380 persons, making an average
daily attendance of 753 at the former and of 477 at the latter.

Mectings and lectures.—The lecture hall was used during the last half of the
year for several important functions. On March 9, 1905, the Hon. Andrew D.
White delivered, before a distinguished audience, the first lecture under the
Hamilton fund of the Smithsonian Institution, his subject being “‘The diplo-
matic seryice of the United States, with some hints toward its reform.” On
March 25 occurred the commencement exercises of the United States Naval
Medical School, the President of the United States being present and delivering
the diplomas to the graduates. Saturday afternoon lectures on zoological and
botanical subjects were ziven there from March 18 to April 22, under the
auspices of the Biological Society of Washington, the speakers being Dr. Albert
Mann, Dr. L. O. Howard, Dr. A. D. Hopkins, Dr. George T. Moore, Mr. William
L. Underwood, and Dr. I’. W. True.

The regular annual session of the National Academy of Sciences was held
from April 18 to 20, the lecture hall being used for the public meetings and the
office of the Assistant Secretary for business purposes, and on May 3 the hall
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

was occupied, for one of its daily sessions, by the American Institute of Mining
Engineers, then holding its annual meeting in Washington.

Publications.—The publications issued during the past year comprised the
Annual Report of the National Museum for 1903; volume 3 of Bulletin No. 50,
forming the third part of Mr. Robert Ridgway’s monograph of the ‘“ Birds of
- North and Middle America; part 4 of volume 8 of “ Contributions from the
National Herbarium,” entitled “Studies of Mexican and Central American
Plants, No. 4,” by Dr..J. N. Rose; volume 9 of the same series, composed of a
single paper on “ The Useful Plants of the Island of Guam,” by Mr. William E.
Safford; and the greater part of volume 28 of the Proceedings of the Museum.
The General Appendix to the Report for 1903 comprised two papers, one by the
Assistant Secretary, entitled “The United States National Museum: An
Account of the Buildings Occupied by the National Collections,’ the other by
Dr. A. B. Meyer, of Dresden, entitled “ Studies of the Museums and Kindred
Institutions of New York City, Albany, Buffalo, and Chicago, with Notes on some
Huropean Institutions.”

Library.—TVhe working library of the Museum now contains about 24,170
bound volumes and 38,645 unbound papers, the additions during the past year
having comprised 3,573 books, 3,048 pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes. It
is chiefly dependent on exchanges for its increases, but a large share of the
books required for the classification of the collections are not to be obtained in
this way, and the $2,000 annually appropriated by Congress is entirely inade-
quate to supply even the most important demands in this respect.

Hxpositions—The exhibit made by the Museum, in conjunction with the
other bureaus of the Institution, formed one of the especially noteworthy feat-
ures of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, at St. Louis, Mo., which closed on
December 2, 1904. Arrangements were then begun for the Lewis and Clark
Exposition, at Portland, Oreg., which opened on June 1, and is to continue until
October 15, 1905. Dr. Frederick W. True was designated as the representative
of the Institution and Museum, and Dr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., as chief special
agent. The exhibit for Portland, which had necessarily to be planned upon a
much smaller scale than the one at St. Louis, was made up almost entirely of
selections from the latter, though a few novelties were added.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905, in
accordance with the act of Congress making provision “for continuing ethno-
logical researches among the American Indians, under the direction of the
Smithsonian Institution,’ approved April 28, 1904.

The work of the Bureau has been conducted in accordance with the plan of
operations approved by the Secretary June 17, 1904. The systematic re-
searches have been carried forward by the seven members of the Bureau’s
scientific staff, assisted by a large number of associates and collaborators who
have been called on to prepare papers on special subjects or to conduct investi-
gations for which their qualifications especially fitted them. During the year

«seven members and associates of the Bureau have made researches in the field,
the regions visited including Maryland, Virginia, Oklahoma, Indian Territory,
Arizona, New. Mexico, Oregon, and Mexico.

The amount of field work has been somewhat curtailed by the necessity of
detaining a number of the ethnologists in the office to assist in the completion
of the Handbook of the Indians (hitherto referred to as the Cyclopedia or
Dictionary of the Indian Tribes), which was designed to be submitted to the
Secretary at the close of the year. The enlargement of the scope of the work
to include not only descriptions of the tribes and their settlements, but also
popular articles covering the whole range of ethnological and archeological
research relating to them, greatly increased the amount of investigation re-
quired, but the value of the Handbook as a work of reference has been more than
proportionately increased. With the view of revising and unifying the great
number of articles designed for introduction into the Handbook a committee of
revision was organized, consisting of members of the Bureau and all available
resident anthropologists, fourteen in all, who met three times each week to
discuss the papers presented. The meetings of this committee proved both
interesting and profitable, and suggested the advisability of holding similar
meetings hereafter for the discussion of current researches of the Bureau.

As a result of the preparation of the papers for the Handbook, covering, as
they do, the entire range of Indian ethnology and administration, the researches
conducted in the office during the year have been exceptionally comprehensive ;
every branch of anthropologic research, including somatology, psychology,
linguistics, sociology, religion, technology, and ssthetics, has received such con-
sideration as the comprehensive though necessarily brief articles for the Hand-
book required. Besides the articles treating of these primary departments of
research, many others have been prepared, on the various phases of the history,
archeology, biography, and education of the Indians and the administration of
their affairs. With the exception of the bibliography and index, which were
retained: for reference in proof reading, the manuscript for the Handbook, ac-
companied with about 800 illustrations, was submitted to the Secretary July 1.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. A]

Under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution the Chief visited Europe
for the purpose of attending the International Congress of Americanists, held
at Stuttgart, Germany, beginning August 18, 1904. In addition to representing
the Smithsonian Institution, he served as delegate of two other scientific organi-
zations, and was also designated by the Department of State as the official
representative at the congress of the United States Government. As a mem-
ber of the scientific staff of the National Museum he was intrusted with
the additional commission of visiting a number of the principal museums of
Hurope for the purpose of acquiring information to be utilized in the erection
and furnishing of the new National Museum building. On July 26 the Chief
sailed from New York in company with Mr. J. R. Marshall, of the firm of
Hornblower & Marshall, architects of the new building, and reached Plymouth,
England, August 1. Nine days were spent in visiting the museums of London,
Oxford, and Cambridge, and eight days in similar observations in Paris, and
on August 18 Stuttgart was reached. ‘The opening session of the Congress
of Americanists was held in the forenoon of that day and was attended by a
large number of members and other prominent persons, including His Majesty,
King William II, of Wurttemberg, who, in response to the address of the
president of the congress, Prof. Karl von den Steinen, expressed at length
his appreciation of the aims and work of the congress, and his pleasure at
having the session held in his capital city.

A report of the last meeting of the congress, held at New wade City in 1902,
was presented by Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of the Bureau, and
other routine business was transacted. Members of the congress were invited
to take luncheon with the King at his suburban palace, which was followed by a
reception in the palace gardens. The King’s interest was highly appreciated
and contributed much to the success of the congress. During the presence of
the Americanists receptions were also held by Count von Linden, vice-president
of the congress, and by Mr. Edward N. Ozmun, United States consul at
Stuttgart. Sessions were held on August 19, 20, 22, 25, and 24, and a large
number of papers, dealing in the main with questions of American history,
ethnology, and archeology, were read. On the 20th the Chief of the Bureau of
American Ethnology delivered an address on ‘ Contributions of American
Archeology to Human History,’ and at its close he presented to the congress
a set of 75 bound volumes, relating chiefly to American archeology and ethnology,
published by the Smithsonian Institution and two of its bureaus—the National
Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology—for which the president
extended the thanks of the congress. The Chief also presented a series of 66
photographs of American Indians, representing delegations which visited Wash-
ington during the winter of 1908-4, the series having been taken cojointly by
the Bureau of American Hthnology and the National Museum. Various excur-
sions were made to points of interest, the principal being to Schaffhausen,
Switzerland, to visit the sites of Dr. J. Nuesch’s recent explorations of the
tamous lake-dwelling stations at Schweizerbild and Ioenigsbau.

_-After the adjournment of the congress, the Chief proceeded to Dresden, where,
under the guidance of Dr. A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological and
Anthropological Museum of Saxony, the various museums of that city were
examined. After leaving Dresden, a number of cities in Germany, Holland, and
Belgium were visited with a view to museum study, and on August 12 he re-
turned to Paris, and on the 25th sailed from Cherbourg, en route for New York.
Between the date of his arrival in Plymouth, August 1, and his departure from
Paris, September 25, the Chief of the Bureau visited and made studies of up-
ward of 50 museums. ‘T'hese observations are embodied in a separate report
submitted to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,

sm 1905——7
42, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
RESEARCH WORK.

Shortly after his return from Hurope in September, the Chief found it neces-
sary to undertake the preparation of a number of articles relating to aboriginal
art and archeology for the Handbook of the Indians. Among the subjects
treated at some length are archeology, architecture, art, antiquity, Bureau of
American Ethnology, bonework, catlinite, cliff-dwellings, copper, engraving,
graphic art, mines and quarries, metal work, ornament, pottery, sculpture, shell-
heaps, shellwork, and stonework. The only field work undertaken by the Chief
during the year was a brief visit to Cavetown, Md., for the purpose of observ-
ing the exploration there being conducted by Dr. Charles Peabody and Mr.
W. K. Moorehead in the well-known cave near that village. Mr. J. D. McGuire
had begun the exploration of this cave for the Carnegie Institution in 1903
and had obtained valuable evidence of its former occupancy by Indians.
The present work, which consisted of extensive excavations within the outer
chamber of the cavern, yielded much additional material of the same general
character.

During the first few weeks of the year Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, was
at St. Louis supervising the final installation of the Kiowa heraldry exhibit
in the Smithsonian section of the Government building, Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. This exhibit comprised about 120 articles, filling 50 feet of wall
ease, together with one floor case, and consisted of 90 small shield models, 4
original shields, 5 tipi models, 6 paintings on buckskin, with several cere-
monial lances and smaller objects. On the completion of this work, after a
brief leave of absence, Mr. Mooney returned to Mount Scott, in the Kiowa
country, Oklahoma, where he continued his researches, including the prepara-
tion of models and the collection of ethnological material. A number of
Cheyenne tipi models were also made for the Field Columbian Museum, of
Chicago, with funds provided by that institution, as authorized by joint ar-
rangement with the Bureau. At the end of October Mr. Mooney returned to
Washington and was engaged in writing a preliminary paper on Kiowa heraldry
until about the end of the calendar year, when he was called on to cooperate
in the preparation of the Handbook of the Indians, for which work the following
articles were furnished: Arawakan colony, Calusa tribe, Cheyenne tribe,
Kiowa tribe, military societies, peyote, population, shields, skin-dressing, sig-
nals, sign language, Timucua tribe. Besides these about 100 minor articles were
prepared, treating of tribes, biographies of noted Indians, and other subjects.
In connection with this work the available information relating to the ancient
tribes of Florida and the Gulf States generally was found to be so deficient
and confused that Mr. Mooney undertook an investigation of the subject from
original sources. A part of the results has been embodied in the Handbook of
the Indians, and the foundation has been laid for an extended paper on the
ethnology of this region to form a complement to his previous studies of the
Siouan tribes of the east and the Cherokee. In the meantime he also super-
vised the photographing of the large series of shield models and other parts of
the heraldry collection made by him during previous years, and prepared cata-
logues and labels for such portions of this material as were required for the
Bureau exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Exposition.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, ethnologist, spent the first six months of the year in
the completion of the text of his monograph on the Aborigines of Porto Rico.
He left Washington on January 7, 1905, for an extended archeological trip to
the Republic of Mexico, under a grant from the Smithsonian Institution, and
returned on the 15th of May. About three weeks were spent by Doctor
Fewkes in the City of Mexico making arrangements with officials for letters
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

to those who could aid him in the prosecution of his studies. While not thus
engaged at the capital his time was profitably employed in studying the col-
lections in the Museo Nacional and one or two private collections, and in
making several excursions to places of archeological interest in the neighbor-
hood of the city, including several of the ruins near Lake Tezcoco, as well as
those at Iztapalapa and at San Juan Teotihuacan. While awaiting letters of
introduction from the President to the governors of Veracruz and Tamaulipas,
Doctor Fewkes visited Cuernavaca, where he made photographs of the so-called
“Victory stone,” or chimalli, the pictograph of the eagle, and the famous stone
lizard, and made a trip also to the ruins of Nochicalco and Tepotzlan. From
the ruin known as Casa del Tepozteco he obtained copies of inscriptions on
the raised seat in the inner room.

After receiving the necessary letters through the courtesy of President Diaz,
Doctor Fewkes proceeded to Xalapa, in the State of Vera Cruz, which he made
the base of operations during February, March, and a part of April. While in
that city considerable time was devoted to an examination of the magnificent
collection of Governor Dehesa, as well as the collection of Senora Estafania and
others. The vicinity of Xalapa was found to be particularly rich in ruins and
mounds, among which are those at Coatepec, Bandarilla, and Xalapa Viejo.
An excursion was made also to Texolo, where there are thirteen or more large
mounds, some of which are evidently the remains of temples of an old Totonac
city. Xico Viejo, an undescribed ruin of a Nahuatl garrison town mentioned
by Bernal Diaz and Gomara, was also visited in the mountains near the trail
taken by Cortés from the coast to the City of Mexico in 1519. Instructive
photographs of this ruin were taken, and notes made on the idols and pottery
found in the neighborhood.

Doctor Fewkes made two visits to the ruins of Cempoala, about 20 miles
from the city of Vera Cruz. On the first visit he was accompanied by an
official representative of Governor Dehesa, by the alcalde of San Carlos, a
neighboring town, and by the inspector and owner of the ruins. On the second
trip, when he spent a week at the ruins, Governor Dehesa kindly permitted him
to employ the services of the State photographer, Senor Ximines.

At the close of March Doctor Fewkes visited the old city of Villa Rica de la
Vera Cruz, now called Antigua, founded by Cortés. In the neighborhood of this
city but on the opposite side of the river he found many mounds indicating the
site of a large prehistoric city. Other ruins were observed at Santa Fe.

Doctor Fewkes examined some of the antiquities about Cordova and Orizaba ;
he also visited the pyramid of Cholula near Puebla, and about the middle of
April proceeded to the State of Tamaulipas, spending about three weeks at
Tampico in a study of the numerous ruins along the Panuco and Tamise
rivers and on the adjacent lagoons, and in visiting the extensive shell heaps
and temple mounds a mile east of Tampico and others not far from the
site of the old town, Tampico Viejo. Doctor Fewkes found numerous antiquities
at Altamira and mounds on the banks of the Champayan lagoon. Many other
evidences of former occupancy, as idols, pottery, stone weapons, and ornaments,
were seen in this region. The old city of Chila, destroyed by Cortés, situated
about 10 miles west of Tampico, was found to be hidden in a forest. Evidences
of temples and burial mounds also occur abundantly in this locality. About 50
Photographs of bowls, jars, and idols found in the neighborhood of Panuco,
Tampico, and the lagoons along the banks of the Tamise River, were made. Of
more than usual interest are those of large stone idols at Altamira and in the
courtyard of a house in Tampico.

On his return to Washington Doctor Fewkes continued the study from his
notes and photographs, and prepared a general account of his visit to Cempoala
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and Xicochimaleo, which was transmitted for publication by the Smithsonian
Institution. The illustrative material brought back includes about 200 large
photographic negatives, numerous smaller views, tracings of pictographs, and
many drawings, plans, and maps.

Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged during the year largely on the
Handbook of the Indians, assisting Mr. Hodge in the laborious task of prepar-
ing the manuscripts for publication. Among the articles written by Doctor
Thomas during the year for this work are agriculture, calendar, counting, Five
Civilized Tribes, fortifications, habitations, maize, migrations, mortuaTy cus-
toms, mounds and mound builders, population, reservations, treaties, besides a
number of biographical sketches and archeological articles of a more special
character. The work of reading the proofs of Bulletin 28, which required
especial acquaintance with archeology and glyphic systems of the ancient
Mexicans, was also intrusted to Doctor Thomas. This reading was completed
before the end of the year. Doctor Thomas was also frequently called on for
data required in official correspondence relating to his special branches of
research.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, at the beginning of the year began the prepara-
tion of various articles for the Handbook of the Indians, and continued the
correction and elaboration of the material pertaining to the Iroquoian stock
for the same work. Among the articles furnished are those on adoption,
clans and gentes, confederations, chiefs, government, mythology, religion, scalp-
ing, wampum, and women. The work of cataloguing the collection of linguistic
manuscripts, of which Mr. Hewitt is custodian, was completed as far as copy-
ing the old cards in duplicate, when the work was laid aside for that of
the Handbook. Mr. Hewitt also gaye material assistance in furnishing data
required in the correspondence of the Bureau relating to tribes and languages.

Mrs. M. CG. Stevenson, ethnologist, spent the month of July in New Mexico,
where she had been for some months making a study of the arts, industries,
religion, and social customs of the Zuni tribe. It was observed that the Zuni
pantheon is largely similar to that of the Hopi and the Rio Grande pueblos.
Although the Zuni worship numerous deities which take both human and bes-
tial form, they believe also in a supreme power without form, yet embracing
all form, the breath of life—life itself. These beliefs indicate that the Zuni
have reached a higher stage of culture than has previously been supposed,
although it can not yet be said to what extent this may be attributed to the
Spanish influence to which the tribe was more or less subjected for three
centuries. Various details relating to Zuni life were investigated, and valu-
able information regarding mortuary customs was obtained through the death
and burial of Naiuchi, a celebrated priest-chief, whose demise occurred during
Mrs. Stevenson’s stay in Zuni pueblo. Native plants entering into the medicine
and dietary of the Zuni were also studied; the arts of preparing and dyeing
wool, which have not. been practiced for many years, were observed, and speci-
mens of the native materials and devices employed in the process, as well as of
the dyed wool, were collected. Studies of symbolism as embodied in Zuni
textile and ceramic art, and investigations into the everyday life, and especially
the child-life, of the pueblo were likewise made.

Harly in August a day was spent by Mrs. Stevenson with the Santa Clara
Indians in making a series of photographs of their annual fiesta. The month
was occupied principally, however, in a study of the Sia Indians, a few days
being given to the neighboring Jemez pueblo. On the 27th Mrs. Stevenson
reached Cochiti, whence a visit was made to the great stone carving of
cougars on the mesa 10 miles distant. In Mrs, Stevenson’s comparative studies

these sculptures are of special interest, as they are referred to in some of the
most sacred myths of the Zuni. The first of September was employed in a
visit to the cavate and mesa ruins about 12 miles from Santa Clara and in
making observations among the Tewa people of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara,
and San Juan pueblos. The religious beliefs, rituals, and daily customs of
these people were found to be closely allied to those of Zuni, difference in lan-
guage alone indicating that distinct peoples are involved. In October Mrs.
Stevenson returned to Washington, where she has since been engaged in the
revision of proofs of her memoir on the Zuni Indians, in the Twenty-third
Annual Report, and, as opportunity afforded, in the elaboration of her several
studies on Zuni religious beliefs, on the edible and medicinal plants of Zufi,
on symbolism as embodied in the textile and ceramic arts, and on the dyeing
of textile fabrics. od

Dr. J. R. Swanton, ethnologist, was engaged during the year in copying and
preparing for the press material obtained by him among the Tlingit Indians
of Alaska during the winter of 1903-4. This work, as completed, consists of 137
pages treating of the general ethnology of the Tlingit peoples, 20 native texts
with interlinear and free translations, the words of about 100 songs, with
translations, together with English versions of 88 stories obtained at Sitka and
Wrangell—altogether forming 900 typewritten pages. Doctor Swanton has
also prepared grammatical accounts of the Dakota, Haida, and Tlingit lan-
guages for introduction into the Handbook of Indian Languages now in course
of preparation under the direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of
the Bureau; and he has also been called on to contribute several articles for
the Handbook of the Indians, including kinship, names and naming, priests
and priesthood, thunderbird, totem poles, secret societies, and social organiza-
tion.

Dr. A. S. Gatschet, ethnologist, continued his work on certain unfinished lin-
guistic studies which it was hoped could be completed for publication before
his failing health made further progress impossible, but in January he was
compelled to practically relinquish his efforts, and on March 13 was placed on
furlough.

Barly in the year arrangements were made with the United States National
Museum to have Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthropology in the
Museum, visit Arizona and New Mexico on behalf of the Bureau for the purpose
of making physical, physiological, and medical observations among the Apache
and Pima Indians. Leaving Washington on January 20, Doctor Hrdlicka began
his studies, five days later, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, where he re-
mained until February 8, when he visited a group of Apache residing near what
is known as the Sawmill, in the Black River Region. From this point he re-
turned to San Carlos, and on February 13 reached the Rice Station Apache
School and district, situated farther northeast on the reservation. On February
26, Doctor Hrdlicka endeavored to reach the White Mountain branch of the
Apache, but was prevented from doing so by exceptionally heavy rains. On
March 1 he was able to proceed to Sacaton, Ariz.,where studies of the Pima tribe
were made. From March 12 to 16 he was at Casa Blanca. On the latter date he
returned to Casa Grande, and thence proceeded to El Paso, Tex., reaching the
reservation of the Mescalero Apache in New Mexico on the 19th. After remain-
ing six days with the Mescaleros, Doctor Hrdlicka began his return journey,
reaching Washington March 31.

Doctor Hrdlicka’s researches were conducted with the object of supple-
menting his former investigations among the same tribes. As much attention as
possible was deyoted to the children, from birth onward, the number examined
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

being nearly 1,000. Other important subjects to which study was especially
devoted were fecundity, mortality, native foods, hygiene, disease, and curative
means and methods. These studies were greatly facilitated by the officials of
the Indian Office, and met with little objection on the part of the Indians.

In addition to his direct anthropologic investigations, Doctor Hrdlicka sue-
ceeded in gathering specimens of about 150 medicinal and food plants and a
number of ethnological objects. He procured one Apache skull and five complete
Apache skeletons, and in addition to making observations of value among the
ancient ruins of the general region, obtained many archeological specimens from
hitherto unexplored ruins in the San Carlos Valley.

In April, Mr. E. L. Hewett, who was engaged during the winter months in
preparing for the Bureau an archeological map of Colorado and New Mexico,
was commissioned to proceed to New Mexico for the purpose of making ex-
tended researches among the ancient ruins of the so-called Pajarito Plateau
district. His first work was the investigation of numerous deserted and ruined
pueblos of the Tewa tribes. This was followed by excavations of ancient
mounds in Otowi Canyon, which yielded results of exceptional interest. Up-
ward of 175 burials were uncovered, and the osseous remains of more than 100
individuals were collected and forwarded for study in the National Museum.
The art remains comprise numerous entire earthenware vessels and many frag-
ments, with a fair complement of implements of bone and stone. Mr. Hewett
was fortunate in reaching this arid spot in an exceptionally wet season, as he
found water within easy reach. At the close of the year he had completed his
studies within the boundaries of Pajarito Plateau and was preparing to explore
explore the plateaus and mountains to the west and the Jemez Valley beyond.

In June a report reaching the Bureau that important finds of prehistoric
remains of man and art had been-made on the site of the forthcoming James-
town Exposition, near Norfolk, Va., Mr. J. D. McGuire was commissioned to
visit the locality and report on the character of the discoveries made. Mr.
McGuire spent one day on the exposition grounds collecting such information as
was available, and later reported that although traces of human remains had
been exposed in the excavations of the exposition company, the reports had been
greatly exaggerated, the discoveries being meager and uniform in character
with the relies of countless other sites in the Chesapeake-Potomae region.

The work of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist, was confined to the prepa-
ration of the Handbook of American Languages which has been under way for
several years. The main part of the field work for the first part of the Hand-
book was closed during the present year and some field work designed to be
embodied in the second part was taken up. Doctor Boas also furnished the
article on languages for the Handbook of the Indians.

In the course of the fiscal year the following manuscripts for the Handbook
of American Languages have been submitted.

1. Dr. P. E. Goddard: Grammatical notes on the Hupa (Athapasean stock).

2. Dr. A. L. Kroeber: Grammatical notes on the Yuki (Yukian stock).

3. Dr. Roland B. Dixon: Grammatical notes on the Maidu (Pujunan stock).

4. Dr. William Jones: Grammatical notes on the Sauk and Fox (Algonquian
stock).

5. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Dakota (Siouan stock).

6. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Haida (Skittagetan
stock ).

7. Dr. John R. Swanton: Grammatical notes on the Tlingit (I<oluschan stock).

8 Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Kwakiutl (Wakashan stock).

9. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Chinook (Chinookan stock).
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

The following manuscripts are still outstanding :
1. J. N. B. Hewitt: Grammatical notes on the Iroquois (Iroquoian stock).

2. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Eskimo (Eskimauan stock).

3. Dr. Franz Boas: Grammatical notes on the Tsimshian (Chimmesyan stock).

During the year the grammatical notes on the Shoshoni by Mr. H. H. St.
Clair, 2d, have been revised.

The general plan of the Handbook of Languages has undergone no material
change, except in so far as it was deemed advisable to add briefer articles on the
grammar of the remaining languages of the northern part of the continent.
These are the Tlingit, the Salish, the Kutenai, and the Chemakum. It is
also deemed advisable to add a sketch of one of the coast languages of Oregon
which was collected during the year 1904-5 by Mr. St. Clair, who submitted his
material on the Coosa and Takilma of Oregon during the present year.

It also seemed desirable to add some data relating to the formation of the
noun in Chinook, which seemed of importance in order to clear up some ques-
tions relating to the fundamental traits of that family of languages. Since all
our information on this stock is derived from one informant, it seemed essen-
tial to obtain additional material from other sources and from another dialect.
lor this reason preparations were made to send Mr. E. Sapir to the upper
Columbia River to make a study of the Wasco. In the preparation of this
work the Kathlamet Dictionary, based on Bulletin 26, was arranged and copied.

The work on the southern group of languages will require long and ener-
getic field work. So far only one of the languages of the Gulf States, the
- Yuchi, has been taken up, this tribe being selected because it seems most likely
to furnish material that will be not only of linguistic value but will afford
knowledege of the early history and customs of the Southeast. This work has
been intrusted to Mr. Frank G. Speck, who spent the summer of 1904 among the
Yuchi tribe and who returned to this field at the close of the fiscal year.

HANDBOOK OF THE INDIANS.

Work on the Handbook of the Indians. North of Mexico, hitherto frequently
referred to as the “ Dictionary of Indian Tribes,” has been vigorously prose-
cuted during the year under the immediate supervision of Mr. F. W. Hodge,
of the Smithsonian Institution, who, with the approval of the Secretary,
has devoted most of his time thereto. Mr. Hodge has had the almost undi-
vided assistance of Dr. Cyrus Thomas; and, as occasion required, nearly the
entire scientific staff of the Bureau has aided both in the preparation of
the anthropologic and kindred articles and in the revision and elaboration
of the tribal descriptions found to be necessary by reason of recently
acquired knowledge. So far as the funds of the Bureau: afforded, the aid of
ethnologists not officially connected with the Bureau was also enlisted. The
services generously rendered by these, either gratuitously or for merely a
nominal consideration, are highly appreciated.

As outlined in former reports it was originally the plan of Major Powell
to classify the linguistic families, tribes, and settlements north of Mexico
and to identify the various names by which these had been known in the
vast literature of the subject, with a brief description of each such group.
This material, recorded on many thousands of cards, became known as the
“ Cyclopedia of Tribes, with Synonymy.”

In 1903 the Secretary altered the scope of the work by directing the incor-
poration of brief separate articles pertaining to the habits, customs, arts, and
industries of the Indians, and of their dealings with the Government, together
with biographies of noted individuals and a list of words of northern Indian
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

origin that have been incorporated into the English language. No work so com-
prehensive in its scope had hitherto been attempted, consequently in making
plans for the new departure it became necessary to begin at the foundation. The
popular style of treatment was ever kept in mind, and considerable time was
consumed in correspondence with experts best qualified for the preparation of
many of the special articles called for by the enlarged plan. For these reasons
it has not been possible to complete the work at an earlier date. Owing to the
fact that many of the specialists do not reside in Washington, it was difficult,
within a limited time, to arrange for entire consistency in treatment and to
prevent repetition through encroachment of one subject on another when written
by many hands. On this account, and for the purpose of obtaining the views
and criticisms of as many experts as possible, conferences were held, as already
mentioned, three times each week, which were faithfully attended by the eth-
nologie staffs of the Bureau and the National Museum, as well as by other
resident ethnologists; and ethnologists from elsewhere, while visiting Washing-
ton, often gave this committee of revision the benefit of their criticism.

As the articles prepared both by the regular attendants and by others were
read at the conferences, and thus were accorded opportunity for criticsim,
the value of the meetings in promoting the authoritativeness of the forthcoming
Tlandbook is inestimable. New subjects were constantly suggested, and in some
instances much new light was shed on others, after having been written, by
reason of the personal knowledge of one or another of the critics present.

In addition to the special articles elsewhere mentioned ‘n this report as
prepared by members of the Bureau, the following are among the more impor-
tant of those that have been furnished by specialists not officially connected
With ate

The Bureau was also fortunate enough to have the services of Dr. A. L.
Kroeber, of the University of California, who generously revised the accu-
mulated material pertaining to many of the linguistic families of California,
and in addition gave much valuable information respecting the Shoshonean
and Yuman families and the Mission Indians. The remaining Californian
stocks were reviewed by Dr. P. E. Goddard, also of the University of California,
and by Dr. Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard University.

With the exception of a few articles that had not been quite finished by those
to whom the subjects were assigned, the manuscript of the body of the Hand-
hook, recorded on more than 40,000 cards, together with about SOO illustrations,
was submitted to the Secretary for transmittal to the Public Printer on July 1,
1905, for publication in two octavo volumes as Bulletin 30 of the Bureau.
These cards do not include about 37,000 cross-references to the tribal syn-
onyms, nor the bibliography, which are retained for use in reading the proofs
of the text. After serving this purpose they will be ready to be put in type to
appear at the close of the work.

ARCHEOLOGICAL MAP.

The work of compiling an archeological map of the United States, which
had received some attention in previous years, was carried forward with all
possible dispatch during the last year. The departments of the Government
having control of the public lands have undertaken to protect from despolia-
tion by commercial relic hunters and unskilled and unauthorized explorers
the archeological remains of these lands, and excellent progress in this direc-
tion has been made, especially by the Department of the Interior. For years
the Bureau has been collecting data relating to these remains, and whenever
ealled on has furnished all available information for the use of the depart-
ments in carrying out this laudable enterprise. During the winter months Mr.
J. D. McGuire was engaged in collecting and collating data relating to the
antiquities of Arizona and Utah, and in platting these on topographical maps
furnished by the United States Geological Survey; and Mr. BE. L. Hewett has
carried forward to practical completion a corresponding work in Colorado and
New Mexico. The several maps have been completed so far as the data is
at hand. Accompanying the maps is a card catalogue of the various sites,
giving information regarding location, character of remains, and explorations
previously carried on. These maps and catalogues are at the disposal of
the departments when called for.

In New Mexico the following sheets embrace 512 sites of sufficient interest
to be catalogued: Santa Fe, Santa Clara, San Pedro, Pajarito Park, Bernal,
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Las Vegas, Chaco Canyon, Mount Taylor, Largo, Lamy, Wingate, Jemez, Taos,
Tierra Amarilla, Quemado, Acoma, Manzano, Pinos Wells, Tularosa, Chloride,
San Marcial, Fort Stanton, Big Hatchet, Chama, El Paso, Fort Bayard, Las
Cruces, San Juan, Albuquerque, and Tres Hermanos. In Colorado the Mesa
Verde sheet alone includes 54 sites. On the 21 Arizona sheets (Tusayan, Fort
Defiance, San Francisco Mountain, Echo Cliff, St. Johns, Prescott, Verde,
Florence, Holbrook, Canyon de Chelly, Solomonsville, Globe, Phoenix, Casa
Grande, Fort Apache, Diamond Creek, Chino, Marsh Pass, Tombstone, and
Tucson) 270 sites are recorded, and on the Utah sheets (Ashley, Beaver,
Escalante, Fish Lake, Henry Mountain, Kanab, Manti, Salt Lake, San Rafael,
St. George, Price River, Uinta, La Salle, Abajo, and Utah) are noted 122 sites.
The 1,008 archeological sites thus catalogued are scattered over an immense
territory and come under the jurisdiction of the Interior, Agricultural, and
War departments.

EXPOSITION WORK.

The exhibit of the Bureau installed in the Smithsonian section of the Gov-
ernment building of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis during
1904, and described in the report for that year, was dismantled at the close of
the exposition and a large part of it transferred to Portland, where it has
been installed as a part of the Institution’s exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Ex-
position. The remainder of the material has been-returned to Washington and
deposited in the National Museum.

STUDY OF INDIAN DELEGATIONS.

The systematic study of visiting Indian delegations has been continued with
success. During the year 23 delegations, representing 21 tribes, have been
conducted, through the agency of Mr. Andrew John, to the Bureau and National
Museum laboratories. Upward of 280 portrait negatives have been made, and
casts and measurements of a number of individuals have been obtained. Few
Indians of the higher type, however, are willing to submit to the experience of
having the face encased in plaster. The tribes represented are as follow:

COLLECTIONS.

The ethnological collections obtained during the year fall considerably short
of those of previous years, owing to the reduced amount of field work undertaken.
“his condition was due, as already explained, to the necessity of keeping most

of the scientific staff in Washington to aid in the completion of the Handbook
of Indians. Tne accessions are a valuable collection, made by Mrs. M. C.
Stevenson at Zuni, a series of archeological objects obtained by Doctor Hrdlicka
in Arizona and New Mexico, and several minor collections, all of which have
been deposited in the National Museum.

PUBLICATIONS.

The distribution of publications has continued as in former years. The
great increase in the number of libraries in the country and the multiplication
of demands from the public generally have resulted in an almost immediate
exhaustion of the quota of volumes allotted to the Bureau, few copies of any of
the reports remaining six months after the date of issue. Part II of the Twenty-
second Annual Report was issued in January. During the year 1,591 copies
of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Reports were sent to regular recipients,
and 2,000 volumes and pamphlets were transmitted in response to special
requests, presented largely by members of Congress. The proof reading of the
Twenty-third Annual and of Bulletin 28 was practically completed at the close
of the year, and it is expected that the press work of these publications will
shortly be begun. The Twenty-fourth Report was in the hands of the printer
before the close of the year, and Bulletins 29 and 30, the latter being the Hand-
book of the Indians, were ready to be submitted to the Secretary on June 30,
1905, while the Twenty-fifth Annual Report was completed, with the exception
of a small number of illustrations.

EDITORIAL WORK.

The editorial work of the year has presented features of exceptional diffi-
culty, on account of the large number of papers dealing with linguistics and
technical subjects. The Bureau has had the services of Mr. Frank Huntington
for the greater part of the year, and Mr. J. P. Sanborn, jr., received a proba-
tional appointment as editor in May. The reading of the proofs of Mrs.
Stevenson’s monograph on the Zuni Indians for the Twenty-third Annual
Report, a work of much technical difficulty, was intrusted mainly to Mr. I. G.
Farrell.

ILLUSTRATIONS.

The work of preparing illustrations has continued in charge of Mr. De-
Lancey Gill, who has been assisted, as heretofore, by Mr. Henry Walther.
The photographie work has included the making of portraits of members of 21
Indian delegations which visited the capital during the year. Three views of
each individual were taken, besides several group views, the negatives num-
bering 298. In preparing illustrations for the publications of the Bureau up-
ward of 200 negatives were made, and 156 films exposed in the field by members
of the Bureau were developed in the laboratory. During the year about 2,350
prints were made, mainly for immediate use in illustrating the Bureau publica-
tions. Illustrations prepared for the Twenty-fourth Annual Report number 45;
for the Twenty-fifth Annual Report, 128; for Bulletin 30, 800. Illustrations
transmitted with reports submitted to the Secretary for publication are: For
the Twenty-fourth Annual Report, 1,103; for Bulletin 30, 871. Illustrations
edited for the Twenty-third Annual Report number 25; for the Twenty-fourth
Annual Report, 1,102. The printed editions of 48 colored plates submitted by
the engravers for the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Annual Reports, num-
bering about 450,000 prints, were individually examined and approved or
rejected.
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

LIBRARY.

The library has been in immediate charge of Miss Ella Leary, who has had
the assistance of Mrs. Ella Slaughter. The accessioning and cataloguing of
the books, pamphlets, and periodicals received during the year have been kept
up to date, and the cataloguing of the publications of scientific societies has
been commenced. Owing to the crowded condition of the library and their
questionable place in an ethnological library, about 400 publications relating
to natural history, received through exchange, have been transferred to the
National Museum. During the year there have been received and recorded
898 volumes, 500 pamphlets, and the current issues of upward of 500 period-
icals: 120 volumes have been bound at the Government Printing Office. The
library now contains about 12,563 bound volumes, 7,000 pamphlets, and a large
number of periodicals bearing on ethnology and kindred topics. Purchase of
books for the library has been restricted to those that bear on the subject of
anthropology, with special reference to the American Indians, and only indis-
pensable works have been obtained by this means.

CLERICAL WORK,

The clerical force of the Bureau consists of four regular employees—Mr.
J. B. Clayton, head clerk; Miss Emilie R. Smedes and Miss May S. Clark, ste-
nographers; and Miss Ella Leary, clerk and acting librarian. During the year
the compilation of the Handbook of the Indians necessitated the employment of
additional clerks with special training in dealing with cyclopedic material and
in bibliographic work. In this the services of Mrs. F. S. Nichols, Mrs. Gertrude
L. Rogers, and Miss Laura W. Steever have proved invaluable.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau is comprised in seven classes, as follow: Office
furniture and appliances; field outfits; linguistic and ethnological manuscripts
and other documents ; photographs, drawings, paintings, and engravings; a work-
ing library; collections held temporarily by collaborators for use in research,
and undistributed residue of the editions of Bureau publications.

The additions to the property of the Bureau for the year include a typewriter
and a few necessary articles of furniture. The only improvement made in the
offices was the changing of the electric-light wiring, which was done under the
direction of the District authorities at a cost of $116.55

REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of
the International Hxchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1905:

The system for the interchange of publications between learned institutions
and individuals in the United States and those in other countries was inaugu-
rated by the Smithsonian Institution almost at the very beginning, and was
“maintained at the expense of the private fund of the Institution exclusively
from 1850 to 1881, when Congress made a small appropriation to assist in the
work. Since that time Congressional appropriations have been made annually,
but at no time have they been large enough to provide for the entire expense of
the service, the Institution having supplied all other necessary means from its
private fund, with the aid of United States departments and bureaus and
State institutions, which have been asked to reimburse the Institution, at the
uniform rate of 5 cents per pound, for a part of the expense of preparing, boxing,
and transporting contributions.

The number of packages dispatched during the year was greater than ever
before, and, as a record of every package is required, the work has been
considerably augmented, but there has been no increase in the clerical force.

The offices occupied by the Exchange Service, consisting of five rooms, are in
the southeast basement of the Smithsonian building, and are equipped with the
recessary folding and sorting tables, bins, file cases, desks, etc. In addition to
the customary supplies for general clerical employment, the service requires
large quantities of cards, labels, and printed forms. The supplies for packing
and shipping are considerable, and so far as practicable are obtained under
annual contract. 8

On May 1, 1905, the Institution was informed that the steamship Buteshire,
which sailed from New York on November 26, 1904, was subject to general
average adjustment on account of fire in the hold of the vessel during the
voyage. Twelve cases of international exchanges destined for Australian ports
formed a part of the cargo, and in the event that the contents of any of these
eases prove to be irreparably damaged they will be replaced by duplicate
volumes, if practicable.

The following tabular statement shows the weight and number of packages
transmitted each month during the year, and also the increase over the previous
twelve months in each class of correspondents. The second table is a statement
of exchange transmissions during each year since 1893.

EXCHANGE OF GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

All Government publications gratuitously presented to other governments
through the International Exchange Service during the year, and similar publi-
eations received by the departments and bureaus, are enumerated in the follow-

ing table.

25.66 per cent, over the fiscal year 1903-4,

The receipts from abroad show an increase of 4,166 packages, or

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

57

countries diminished to the extent of 9,648, or 12.89 per cent, during the same

period.

fo

The increase in receipts is particularly gratifying, and is due prin-
cipally to earnest demands, both by personal solicitation and by letter,

yr more

adequate reciprocal returns ; while the diminution in the contributions of United
States official publications is attributable largely to the elimination of many

correspondents who have

not sent an equivalent in their own publications.

With few exceptions the same arrangements exist for distributing exchanges
in other countries as those mentioned in the previous report, and, although
it is a source of regret that every country does not maintain an official exchange
bureau—among the most important being England, Germany, and Austria-
Hungary—the Institution has been successful in enlisting the services of some
institution of learning or prominent individual in nearly all countries not offi-
cially represented, with the result that means have been found for forwarding
exchanges to every part of the world. On account of the extent of the work,
and various disturbances which are liable to occur, interruptions and delays
are sometimes unavoidable.

China is still considering the proposal to establish an official exchange bureau,
and efforts were recently renewed through the diplomatic service with that end
in view, but, pending more satisfactory arrangements, facilities have been
added to the somewhat limited method of distribution. Packages for Shanghai
are now forwarded by post, under frank, through the United States postal agency
in that city, and through the courtesy of the Zi-ka-wei Observatory parcels for
the provinces are distributed with reasonable dispatch.

On account of the difficulty in transporting exchanges from the coast to the
city of Quito all transmissions to Ecuador were suspended for twenty-one
months, but through the efforts of the American minister consignments were re-
uewed on April 4, 1905, with the mutual understanding that exchanges for
Guayaquil and other coast towns should be packed in separate boxes and dis-
tributed to addressees from the port of entry. This arrangement is only tem-
porary, and, on the completion of a railroad now in course of construction from
Guayaquil to Quito, it is expected that all consignments will be forwarded
direct to the last-mentioned city and thence distributed.

Following is a list of correspondents abroad through which the distribution of
exchanges is accomplished. Most of those in the larger and many in the smaller
countries forward reciprocal contributions to the Smithsonian Institution for
distribution in the United States:

missions consisting of one box each were made to each depository on October 1
and December 27, 1904, and on February 28 and April 24, 1905. On the last
date mentioned three additional consignments, comprising complete sets, were
forwarded to Cape Colony, Manitoba, and France, respectively, thus increasing
the number of regular depositories to fifty-three. A list of these depositories

The fifty-three sets of United States official publications referred to were
delivered to the Smithsonian Institution from time to time as they came from
press, and when a sufficient number was received to completely fill the boxes
prepared for them a list was printed to accompany each set, which was then
shipped to its respective destination.

In addition to the above, partial sets were provided under the joint resolu-
tion of Congress approved March 2, 1901, for the purpose of increasing
exchanges with countries for which no provision was made under the limited
resolution of March 2, 1867. The new depositories that had been designated
to the close of the fiscal year 1904-5 were as follows:

As new countries are constantly being added, the partial sets for the depos-
itories designated under the last resolution are not forwarded simultaneously
with those originally provided, but are delivered to the Institution from the
Library of Congress and are dispatched with the next succeeding consign-
ments of miscellaneous exchanges to the respective countries in which the
depositories are situated.

The agencies in those countries which are supported at the expense of the
Smithsonian Institution are represented by Messrs. William Wesley & Son in
London, Mr. Joseph von K6résy in Budapest, and Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann
in Leipzig.

To those efficient representatives who aid the Institution in promoting the
interests of the Exchange Service, both at home and abroad, and to Mr.
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, grateful acknowl-
edgments are extended.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
JERI EE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report relating to the condition
and operation of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1905.

New house for mammals.—The principal work that has been prosecuted during
the year for the advancement of the park has been that upon the new house for
mammals. The structural ironwork was completed about December 1, 1904, and
the tile roof was finished about May 1, 1905. This roof was crnamented by
terra-cotta finials after models designed by Mrs. Kemeys. <A large conduit for
heating and ventilating purposes was constructed under the long axis of the
building. The amount expended from the appropriation for the year will reach
about $10,000. As the building is situated near the edge of a steep declivity, a
heavy fill of earth supported by a retaining wall will be required on the eastern
side in order to accommodate the necessary cages and walks. The plastering of
this building, the interior and exterior cages, and the woodwork still remain to
be done. It is hoped to occupy the building during the coming winter. Con-
siderable delays occur from the difficulty of getting suitable mechanics for the
work.

Temporary bird house-—To accommodate the birds kept during the summer
in the large flying cage, as well as those received from the St. Louis Exposition,
two additions were made to this building. A large indoor cage was fitted up
for quail, thrushes, cardinals, ete., and another for finches and other small
species, the latter communicating with an outdoor cage. Yards were con-
structed for the north African and Somali ostriches received from the Presi-
dent, and concrete floors were constructed for several of the larger indoor
cages. The total cost of the alterations and extensions was about $1,200.

Carnivora house.—A new boiler for the heating apparatus was put in with
satisfactory results. Considerable repairs were made to the metal roof, and the
ironwork of the outside cages was thoroughly cleaned and repainted, all at a
cost of about $800.

Temporary bear cages.—As funds were wanting for the construction of the
permanent dens designed for the collection of bears, the small cages in which
those animals are now confined were rearranged so as to give better facilities
for drainage. Drains were laid, gutters constructed, and screens planted.

Inclosures for burrowing rodents.—The inclosures heretofore used for this
purpose at the park have hitherto not been satisfactory, being badly located
and permitting the escape of the animals. Two new inclosures that have proved
very satisfactory have been made during the year. One of these, for prairie
dogs, was formed by excavating the earth to a depth of 44 feet, paving and
grouting the bottom, and then filling in with gravelly earth. Another, for
woodchucks, was not excavated so deeply and was closed at the bottom with
telford pavement. The cost of the two inclosures was about $500.

Repairs to inclosures.—Most of the inclosures in the park are made by wire
fencing, which has now been in use from five to eight years. In the course of

67
68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

this time the wire has become seriously weakened by rust in spite of all
efforts made for its preservation. A general reconstruction of the fences and
paddocks will soon be necessary. During the year considerable repairs have
been given to the fences inclosing the deer and the yak, and an additional in-
closure and shelter has been made for deer.

Public comfort rooms.—The park is still deficient in suitable public comfort
rooms for the accommodation of the public, especially for women and children,
and this is especially felt on holidays, when the park is crowded. On Easter
Monday thousands of children, with their parents and nurses, remain at the
park nearly all day, and the accommodations are wholly insufficient. During
the past year the rooms for women have been more than doubled, but they are
still too small. A building is badly needed in which a public comfort room
and restaurant could be combined.

Seats and benches.—During the past year a special clause for the purchase
of seats was inserted in the act making general appropriations for the park.
One hundred and sixty movable seats and 380 stationary benches were made
and distributed throughout the park at points where they may be convenient
for the public.

Coniferous trees.—The park received during the year an important gift of
coniferous trees from Mr. Lowell M. Palmer, of Stamford, Conn. These com-—
prise some thousands of specimens of different species. They will be planted
in appropriate situations, and it is believed that they will eventually greatly
add to the natural beauty of the park.

New survey and map.—TVhe map which was prepared early in the history of
the park has gradually become almost useless because of the numerous altera-
tions that have been made. More accurate and abundant detail was also
required in order that work might be always effectively planned. For this
reason a new survey was made and a map prepared of the most important part
of the park, covering about 40 acres. This map shows all trees, shrubbery,
water and sewer pipes, and every detail of configuration practicable to express
on its scale, which is 50 feet to the inch. Such a survey should be extended to
the entire park.

Important accessions.—The following animals were reeeived by gift:

From the President: One zebra, 1 lion, 2 gelada baboons, 1 north African
ostrich, 1 Somali ostrich (from the King of Abyssinia), 1 female jaguar (from
Ki. HW. Plumacher, American consul at Maracaibo, Venezuela), also several small
mammals, an eagle, etc.

From E. H. Plumacher, American consul, Maracaibo, Venezuela: Twenty-two
specimens, including a young jaguar, 2 ocelots, 2 monkeys, 2 rough foxes, several
parrots, ete.

From the Hon. H. G. Squiers, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipoten-
tiary to Cuba: Hight specimens, including 3 Cuban deer and a hawk-bili turtle.

From Admiral Robley D. Evans, U. S. Navy: One Philippine deer.

There were procured for the park by Dr. F. W. Goding, American consul at
Neweastle, New South Wales: Fifteen specimens, including 3 kangaroos, 1
female Tasmanian devil (to complete pair), 1 male Tasmanian wolf (to com-
plete pair), 2 brush turkeys, 2 Australian cranes, and some smaller birds.

From J. N. Ruffin, American consul at Asuncion, Paraguay: One young jaguar,
2 capybaras, 2 coypus, and a king vulture.

sy exchange there were received from New York Zoological Park: One llama,
1 mandrill baboon, 1 hornbill, 2 crowned cranes.

NORTH AFRICAN OSTRICH PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE KING OF ABYSSINIA.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

It has been found extremely difficult to make satisfactory arrangements for
transportation from distant South American ports. The steamship companies
refuse to receive animals without prepayment of transportation charges, which
in the case of the United States Government is impracticable. Certain ship-
ments of animals from Buenos Ayres are now waiting until some satisfactory
adjustment can be made.

Through exchange with the New Zealand government (arranged by the
President and mentioned in 1904 report) 8 roe deer were received. Ten
elk, a number of birds, and several small mammals were delivered to the rep-
resentatives of the New Zealand government in February and are understood
to have reached their destination safely. The elk were desired for propagating
purposes.

Births.—The births, 134 in number, included 1 American bison, 7 elk, 4 mule
deer, 2 Columbian black-tailed deer, 3 Virginia deer, 2 fallow deer, 2 Barbary
sheep, 1 Brazilian tapir, 23 blue foxes, 7 dingo, 9 gray wolves, several kanga-
roos, various rodents, ete.; also about 30 young of night heron and other birds
which nested in the flying cage. The wild turkeys which were hatched in the
spring of 1904 have run at large, and 6, together with the hen, still remain in
the park.

Deaths.—Gastro-intestinal troubles was the chief cause of death of animals
and included 2 young jaguars and several other cats, 2 Tasmanian zebra wolves,
a Rocky Mountain sheep, a cassowary, several flamingos, and various other
birds and small mammals. A number of blue foxes were lost from uncinaria
and two from ascaris canis.

Deaths from tuberculosis, though less in number, included more large ani-
mals, among those lost being 1 bison cow, 1 nilghai, 1 red deer, 7 roe deer, 2
elk, and 4 monkeys. The majority of these animals had recently come into
the collection and were undoubtedly affected with the disease when received.
Three monkeys were lost from osteomalacia, or “ cage paralysis,” and a tinamou
from: pulmonary aspergillosis.

Two elk and 1 prong-horn antelope were lost from accident, due in the latter
case to fright.

Autopsies were made as heretofore by the pathologists of the Bureau of
Animal Industry, either at the park, in the case of large animals, or at the
laboratory of the Bureau in the case of the smaller kinds.

Readjustment of boundaries.—An item was again submitted in the estimates
for $60,000 to purchase the land between the park and the new highways estab-
lished along the eastern and western sides of the park. (Public Act, April 28,
1904, ‘For the opening of connecting highways on the east and west sides of
the Zoological Park, District of Columbia.”) No action was taken by Con-
gress.

Exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition—This was successfully main-
tained throughout the season with comparatively little loss. Two keepers were
employed during the summer and autumn. The exhibit closed about the middle
of November on account of cold weather, the birds being removed and trans-
ferred to the National Zoological Park. The cage was purchased by the city
of St. Louis at its appraised value.

Personnel.—The fixed force of the park numbers about 82 persons, of whom
8 are assigned to the administration, 29 to the care of animals, 20 to the mechan-
ical department, 18 to the care of grounds, and 7 to the watch. Considerable
difficulty has been found in obtaining suitable men for positions of keepers of
animals. To be effective in this duty it is necessary to be quick, active, always
alert, neither timorous nor venturesome, and to have a natural aptitude for

cleanliness. These are qualities that are considerably beyond what is required
of a common laborer.
The keepers are divided into three classes receiving compensation as follows:

These men allege that their service is extra hazardous, that they are usually
required to work on Sundays and holidays, and that since the cost of living has
advanced considerably of recent years some advance should be made in their
wages.

Hospital and laboratory.—At present the park has no adequate provision for
the care of sick animals nor for the quarantining of those believed to be af-
fected with contagious or infectious diseases. When ill the animals remain in
the exhibition cages, their sufferings being displayed to the public, and enhanced
by the disturbance which necessarily goes on about them, or, if removed from
their cages, they are placed in unsuitable quarters where they are subject to
annoyance and far from comfortable. Several cases of contagious disease have
been rapidly propagated to several animals for want of means of promptly
isolating the first suspected case. There is need for a suitable building placed
in a secluded part of the grounds where animals can be properly isolated and
treated. ;

Connected with this there should be a laboratory in which proper examina-
tion can be made of the pathological and anatomical material that may come to
hand. But very little is known concerning the diseases that affect wild animals
and the parasites that associate themselves with them. An extension of our
knowledge in this direction would undoubtedly be of benefit to those who are
studying the diseases of man.

In other countries the most significant scientific function of collections of
living animals has been the advancement of knowledge with regard to the
structure, habits, and activities of animals. Nearly all such knowledge has
been derived from zoological collections of a character similar to that of the
National Zoological Park. For example, in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris,
investigations have been carried on since the middle of the eighteenth century
by men who achieved, in this way, a world-wide fame, such as Duverney,
Daubenton, Buffon, Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and Milne Edwards; in the
garden of the Zoological Society of London worked Owen, Flower, Huxley,
Sclater, Beddard, and many others; the garden at Berlin afforded Hartmann
material for his work on anthropoid apes, and it was at the Amsterdam garden
that Fiirbringer was able to prepare his monumental work on the structure of
birds. ‘The collections of the National Zoological Park should be utilized in
a similar way.

It is thought that a modest hospital and laboratory, similar to the one recently
established at the zoological garden in Philadelphia, can be built and equipped
at a cost of about $8,000. At the New York Zoological Park an institution of
this kind is about to be erected which will probably cost considerably more.

Roads and paths.—The park is much frequented by carriages. Lying, as
it does, along the valley of Rock Creek, it affords the most convenient and pleas-
ant access to the Rock Creek Park that lies north of it, and the main driveway
in that park communicates directly with the principal road in the National
Zoological Park. On this account it is of especial advantage to the public that
the roadways in the National Zoological Park should always be in good con-

dition. This is not easy, as the descent into the valley of the creek is so abrupt
that the surface of the roads and walks is washed away at every heavy rain.
Considerable damage of this kind is done every year, and this entails a constant
expense for the repair of the roads and walks. Some of the walks on the
steeper slopes should be laid in concrete, which, although more expensive, would
be cheaper in the end.

The portion of the park about the Quarry road entrance is in very bad con-
dition, owing to the fact that the roads and grades exterior to the park have
been recently changed and that ho permanent improvements can be made
within the park until the exterior changes are completed. It is hoped that
sufficient funds may be appropriated to permit the park to take up the work
effectively and place all the roads and walks in a suitable condition.

Shade trees and forestry.—Owing to the pressure of other matters, but little
attention has been paid to the natural forest in the park. This should, however,
be carefully gone over and properly thinned and preserved, as it is one of the
principal attractions sought by the public. The trees planted for the shade of
the walks and seats are not at present sufficient, and considerable additional
planting should be done. It is highly desirable that this should be accoupisie
as soon as possible, as the trees would increase in beauty and size year by year.

Schools, ete., visiting the park.—Since October 15, 1904, a record has been
kept of the various schools and other organizations visiting the park. Up to
June 380, 1905, there were 65 classes from normal and other schools, including
) from out of town, with 1,551 pupils; 7 classes from Sunday schools, including
2 from out of town, with 481 pupils; and 20 miscellaneous organizations,
including 4 from out of town, with 595 persons.

During the year three wooden shelters, covering, respectively, the ccelostat,
the long focus concave mirror, and the bolographie outfit for observing the solar
image, have been erected at a cost of $1,135. This item is chargeable to the
appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30,1904. The fence around the Ob-
servatory lot bas been renewed at a cost of $554. By permission of the park
authorities the Observatory inclosure was at the same time enlarged on the
east and south, and now contains 15,300 square feet.

Apparatus chiefly for use in a proposed expedition to a high altitude observ-
ing station has been procured at a cost of $3,862. Of this sum, $2,527 is
chargeable to the appropriation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904. Usual
periodicals have been continued, a few books of reference have been purchased,
and about 118 volumes have been collated and bound, at a total cost of $369.

No losses of property beyond usual wear and tear have occurred during the
year. :

Changes in personnel.—In the latter half of 1904 Dr. S. A. Mitchell was em-
ployed three months as temporary assistant on stellar radiation experiments.

Richard Norris resigned March 31, 1905.

By request of the Chief of the Weather Bureau Mr. H. H. Kimball was
assigned to the Observatory temporarily for a period beginning May 1, 1905,
in order that he might learn the methods of bolographic observation employed
here.

Mr. L. R. Ingersoll was engaged for three months, beginning May 10, 1905, as
temporary assistant for the Mount Wilson expedition.

Joseph Dwyer, messenger, was engaged April 1, 1905.

WORK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience I describe the work of the Observatory under the following
headings :

(1) Observations at Washington on the variability of the sun.

(2) Miscellaneous work.

(3) Expedition to Mount Wilson in California.

(1) OBSERVATIONS AT WASHINGTON ON THE VARIABILITY OF THE SUN.

As indicated in your paper, “On a possible variation of the solar radia-
tion,” @ and summarized in my last year’s report, our observations of several
years, but especially of the year 1903, have tended to produce the belief that
the total radiation of the sun may vary in comparatively brief periods, these
variations of solar radiation being irregular in period, but tolerably frequent

and large enough to produce considerable changes of the earth’s mean
temperature.

During the past year the work of the Observatory has been chiefiy directed
toward testing the supposed variability of the sun and increasing our knowl-
edge of it. As I have said in my last report, this investigation has three main
branches as follows:

First. The determination of the intensity and variation of the total solar
radiation reaching the outer limit of our atmosphere. Second, the examination
of the distribution of solar radiation over the sun’s disk for the purpose of
detecting changes of absorption in the solar envelope. Third, the reduction
of temperature measurements from numerous meteorological stations to note
departures of the temperature of the earth from its mean. : .

General view of the results thus far obtained since January, 1902.

Before reporting fully this year’s work I give in the accompanying chart,
Plate V, a general view of the results of the last two and a half years
touching this question. Three series of observations are represented in the
chart, namely :

A. Average departures from mean temperature for 89 stations distributed
over the North Temperate Zone, represented by the full line at the top of the
diagram.

B. The transmission of the solar envelope for radiations of wave length
0.50u¢ (green), as computed from spectrobolometric observations of the sun’s
disk at Washington, represented by the line at the middle of the diagram.

C. The solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere as computed from
spectrobolometric observations at Washington, represented by the lower line of
the diagram.

As the observations of type B and earlier ones of type C are frequently
separated by long intervals of time, the lines connecting the points should not
be interpreted as necessarily indicating the intervening values of the quantity
observed. .

Observations of the solar constant taken in Washington are seldom of a satis-
factory character, owing to the scarcity of days when uniform transparency of
the atmosphere persists for the several hours required for the determinations.
Accordingly only a few of the observations of type C are entitled to great
weight, and these are designated in the diagram by the letter G to denote it.
Observations of good character, but less satisfactory than these first, are desig-
nated by M, denoting medium weight. A still less perfect class, to which, un-
fortunately, most of the observations of 1904 and 1905 belong, is designated by
the letter L, signifying of little weight. Some observations still less satisfactory
than these I have omitted from the diagram as deserving no weight at all.

Considering now the diagram it will be seen that early in the year 1905 there
was a long-continued period of abnormally high terrestrial temperature, and
this was followed by a still longer period of abnormally low temperature. Cor-
responding well with this state of affairs are the observations of total solar
radiation, and these observations are fortunately almost all of great, or at least
medium, weight. In September, 1903, a single observation of the transmission
of the solar envelope was made, and this, compared with others of more recent
date, is low, indicating that diminished transparency of the solar enyelope was
the probable reason for the small amount of radiation and low temperature
observed at the same time.

In the year 1994 there was no long-continued period of abnormal temperature

4 Results of a similar trend are obtained for all wave lengths, and this wave
length is chosen merely in illustration,

departure comparable with those noted in 1905. So far as there were notable
variations from the mean in the temperature of the North Temperate Zone,
these occurred in January and February, and in October and November of 1904.
On the whole, these departures are confirmatory of the indications of the spec-
tro-bolometric determinations of total radiation for the same periods, but these
results, owing to scarcity of good weather, are lamentably inadequate. Still,
a medium-weight observation of June indicates average temperature and is
followed by it; a first-class observation of October 5 indicates high temperature
and is followed by it, and a medium-weight observation of October 22, indicating
low temperature, is followed by it. Prior to December there are only two
observations of solar transmission, of which the first, a high value, comes just
at the end of a period of high temperature, while the second, a low value, in
November, comes just preceding a short period of low temperature. In Decem-
ber higher values are found and higher temperatures follow.

The temperature departures of the first half of 1905 also present no such
fayorable opportunity for comparison with solar radiation phenomena as was
presented in 1903. The data on total solar radiation have not been fully re-
duced as yet, so that they appear still more meager than in former years, and
more so than they will after all returns are in. But the weather seidom per-
mitted satisfactory solar constant determinations at Washington in the first
half of 1905. Those observations here given fall in fairly well, as will be
seen, with the record of temperature departures. Observations of the solar
transmission have been made very frequently since December, 1904, and are as
« rule nearly average values and indicative of average temperatures, and thus
in accord with the facts tor the North Temperate Zone. Increasing values in
December and January and diminishing ones in February and in April and
May have their counterparts in the temperature curve for the North Temperate
Zone. The temporarily lower values in June find no counterpart in the tem-
peratures of the North Temperate Zone, but a fall of temperature may possibly
be shown early in July.

Taking all the facts together we find high values of solar radiation and solar
transmission preceding and accompanying high temperatures of the North
Temperate Zone; low values of solar radiation and solar transmission preced-
ing and accompanying low temperatures of the North Temperate Zone, and
intermediate values of these solar phenomena accompanying intermediate ter-
restrial temperatures. The evidence at hand is still too fragmentary to pro-
duce full conviction, but subject to later confirmation or rejection, as further
work shall prove, the results obtained thus far strongly indicate that the
transparency of the solar envelope varies at irregular intervals, with conse-
quent fluctuations of the solar radiation transmitted to the earth, and that
this in turn affects the mean temperature of the earth.

Observations of 1904-5.

(a) Solar constant awork.—Determinations of the radiation reaching the
earth’s surface, both in toto and for separate wave lengths, have been made
at all times when conditions permitted, and have been reduced as in former
years to give the transmission of our atmosphere, and the total radiation
reaching its outer limit. As above stated the number of days when the sky
has continued satisfactorily uniform for this purpose have been few, and besides
owing to the press of observing and computing work it has not been possible
to compute all the results as yet, so that on both accounts the tables which
follow are more than usually meager. Table 1 gives in continuation of similar
tables in preceding reports the transmission of the atmosphere at various wave
lengths for vertical rays.

The mean results will be found to lie extremely near the corresponding ones
for the year 1903—t, so that no further discussion of them seems necessary.

In Table 2 are given the values computed for the solar constant of radiation
outside cur atmosphere, in continuation of the series published in former years.
The method of computation and the assumptions on which it is based have been
given in preceding reports and are substantially thuse employed by you many
years ago at Allegheny.

78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The rating of the character of the observation is made chiefly by inspection
of the logarithmic plots used in determining the atmospheric transmission,
similar to those published facing page 80 of your report for the year ending
June 30, 1903. On an excellent day the observations thus plotted, like those
just referred to, lie close to representative straight lines, but such days are
unfortunately very rare in Washington, and especially within the last two
years, owing in part to building and other operations producing smoky and non-
uniform atmospheric conditions. The bearing of the results given in Table 2
on the question of the variability of the sun has already been given.

Before leaving the subject of solar constant observations it may well be
remarked that Mr. Fowle has published within the year a valuable paper giv-
ing a comparison between the solar constant values deduced by the method of
homogeneous rays and those deduced for the same days by the old method of
high and low sun observations of the total radiation of the sun by the
sctinometer alone.e This old method, the method of Pouillet, gives necessarily
too low results, as you long ago demonstrated.?

What is valuable in Mr. Fowle’s paper is that he shows that the defect is
almost constant at Washington, no matter what the time of the year, the trans-
parency of the air, or the humidity, provided the extrapolation is made with
moderate solar zenith distances. Thus if observations be made in Washington
with the actinometer alone and extrapolated by the aid of a logarithmic plot
to the limits of the atmosphere, and a correction of 14 per cent is then added,
the result will be practically the same as if the spectrobolometric method
had been used. If additional measurements should confirm this result (that
2 constant difference between the two methods holds here and at other locali-
ties), then the process of detecting variations in solar radiation outside our
atmosphere would be much easier, for it could be made to depend on actinometer
measures alone, and, indeed, old series of observations made years ago could
be utilized.

I give in illustration the following table, taken in part from Mr. Fowle’s
paper above cited, showing how closely solar constant values deduced from
pyrheliometer measures alone, by the application of the 14 per cent correction,
agree with values deduced when possible from spectrobolometric work of the
same days.

(b) Transmission of the solar envelope.-—As stated above the apparatus for
examining the solar image has been provided with appropriate shelters, and
1S how much improved over its condition last year. The great coelostat was
exhibited at St. Louis in 1904, and as a substitute a smaller coelostat was
arranged at the Observatory shop. The larger coelostat was not returned from
St. Louis until January, 1905, and, in the press of preparation for the Mount
Wilson expedition, time could not well be spared to set it up, so that the smaller
instrument has served throughout the year. Many measurements, both of the
distribution of radiation along the diameter of the solar disk and of its distri-
bution in sun spots, have been made after the manner explained last year.c A
revision has been made of all the data obtained relating to the distribution along
u diameter, on the assumptions (1) that we study a phenomenon of absorption
only; (2) occurring in a homogeneous medium situated outside the photosphere,
and (8) extending to 21 per cent of the solar radius.

With these assumptions it appears that the form of the distribution curves as
shown in Plate VIII of last year’s report agree within the experimental error
with that deduced from the ordinary simple exponential absorption formula.
As this formula in a logarithmic form is peculiarly adapted to graphical illus-
trations and comparison of results, all the measurements have been reduced on
the above basis and the results to be given below in Table 3 depend on it. It
goes without saying that the assumptions made are not harmonious with our
conceptions of the sun’s absorbing envelope, and they are only made for want
of better and for the sole purpose of more readily comparing the results of dif-

80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ferent days. This arbitrary method of reduction is necessary, for differences
of atmospheric transparency and differences of solar distance make a direct
comparison of one observational curve with another complicated and unsatis-
factory.
Plate VI shows two of the solar curves plotted with abscissz as air-masses
derived on the above assumptions, and ordinates as the logarithmic deflections.
The general absorption of the solar envelope appears to be like that of the
earth’s atmosphere, greatest at the violet end of the spectrum. This is shown,
end also some of the changes which have been noted in the apparent solar trans-
mission, in Table 3.
In this table the numbers purport to represent the percentage transmission of
the solar envelope for vertical rays, on different days, and for various rays
between wave lengths 0.4 in the violet, and 2.0 in the infra-red. The results
_are based on the assumptions stated above, and a considerable difference will be
noted from the corresponding table of last year, owing to a change in the
assumed thickness of the absorbing envelope.

ABSORPTION OF SOLAR ENVELOPE.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 8]

The bolometric examination of sun spots shows that they, too, exhibit much
greater absorption at the violent end of the spectrum than in the infra-red. Thus.
if our eye were like the bolometer, and could view sun spots by homogeneous
‘ays of different wave lengths of the infra-red as well as violet, we should see
the same spot four times as dark in violet light as when viewed by extreme
infra-red rays.

In all the observations and reductions involved in the work described above
Mr. Fowle has taken by far the greatest share.

The temperature data plotted in Plate V are reduced from the Internationaler
Dekadenberichte, published by the Kaiserliche Marine Deutsche Seewarte. The
reductions were made partly by R. Norris and partly by J. Dwyer.

(2) MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

Radiation of the stars.

Preliminary preparations were made for the detection of the radiation of
the brighter stars. It was at first thought practicable to mount the bolometer
in the center of the tube of the 50-centimeter diameter mirror of 1-meter focus
and to point the mirror directly upon the star to be examined, but it was
quickly found that the disturbances due to exposure to outside air were too
great to be permissible with the refined sensitiveness of the bolometric appa-
ratus. Afterwards the mirror and bolometer were placed within the inner
chamber of the observatory, and the starlight was reflected in from a 30-inch
plane mirror on the coelostat. The galvanometer employed was the one de-
scribed at pages 91-92 of your report for the year ending June 30, 1902.

The sensitiveness available depends largely on reducing the damping of the
needle, and a long time’ was spent in making the galyanometer case air-tight,
so that a pressure of 1/1000 atmosphere or less could be maintained without
rapid change. In this we were at length so successful that the change of
pressure was hardly appreciable in several months. Great difficulty was en-
countered in balancing the bolometric apparatus at the high sensitiveness em- -
ployed on account of small electromotive forces in the galvanometer circuit
and its shunts. Thus a balance would be obtained with a certain shunt across
the galvanometer, and on passing to the next shunt a very great deflection would
be found, due to a new electromotive force in the new shunt circuit. At length
it proved necessary to discard shunts wholly, and to employ instead a variable
resistance in series with the galvanometer. Great difficulty was still ex-
perienced in balancing, but not so great as to render it impossible, as before.
When once balanced the apparatus was well behaved. The sensitiveness ap-
peared from tests on candle flames to be very much greater than that obtained
by previous experimenters on stellar radiation. Unfortunately the difficulties
encountered were not surmounted until early in January, and bad weather pre-
vented a trial on the stars until more important work displaced the investi-
gation for the present.

New apparatus.

Bolometer.—In our previous construction of bolometers we have been guided
more by experience than by any theory in their design. While preparing for
the research on stellar variation it seemed very desirable to determine the
conditions which would insure the highest sensitiveness. Accordingly the
subject was studied from the standpoint of Fourier’s analytical theory of heat,
and numerous experiments were made to further enlighten it. As a result a
complete theory of bolometer construction was reached, and it is now possible
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

{o know in advance how to design and construct a bolometer to give the best
result under stated conditions.

In accordance with the results thus reached, a vacuum bolometer was con-
structed for the observation of stellar heat which is several times as sensi-
tive for the purpose as the best bolometer hitherto prepared here.

Celostat—A new celostat with two 15-inch mirrors was obtained for the
proposed expedition to a high-altitude station. The general design was pre-
pared at the Observatory, and the construction was by Mr. M. E. Kahler, of
Washington, excepting some work done on the clock at the Observatory shop.
A photograph of the apparatus as in use at Mount Wilson is here shown
(Plate VII).

Several unusual features may be noted. The rotating mirror is shown
mounted on a carriage which may travel on ways either east and west or
north and south, so as to be adjusted for the position of the sun at any
time in the year. The carriage is of the same height as the lower base of
the support of the second mirror, and the two mirrors may be interchanged
if desired, so that the rotating one can be fixed in one place and the east-
and-west and north-and-south motions can be made with the other. The
driving clock is fastened to the support of the polar axis and designed to run
equally well in any position, so that the adjustment of the axis for different
latitudes can be made without altering the driving mechanism. In order to
conform to the motion of the carriage, the clock is driven by springs instead of
weights. At your suggestion there was introduced a driving spring, which
is itself kept wound to a nearly constant tension by two larger springs. Thus
the driving force is uniform though the two larger springs run down. ‘The rate
of their unwinding is governed by an escapement driven from the governor
train. The governor itself is of the centrifugal type, but has springs instead
of gravity as the governing force, and will thus run in any position. The
accuracy of the clock is ample, so that the reflected beam from the ccelostat
frequently remains constant-in direction within one minute of are for a half
hour.

Standard pyrheliometer.—Mention was made in my last year’s report of a
new form of pyrheliometer then under construction. This instrument has
been completed and ferms a part of the equipment of the Mount Wilson expe-
dition. It appears to justify all the hopes that had been connected with it.
As stated last year, it receives solar rays in a hollow blackened chamber of the
shape of a test tube, from which little radiation can escape by reflection, or
heat by convection, owing to the deepness of the chamber and to its numerous
blackened diaphragms. A current of water circulates around this chamber
and takes up the heat absorbed on its walls. Platinum resistance wires serve
to determine the temperature of the water before and after its passage around
the chamber. Thus the sun’s rays entering a knewn aperture produce a
measurable rise of temperature in a known amount of water. A certain check
is had on the accuracy of the measurement, for a coil of wire is introduced
within the rear end of the chamber, and in this coii heat may be produced
electrically at a known rate. ‘This heat warms the air and indirectly reaches
the walls of the chamber, and may be measured as if it were produced by
radiation. :

At nine recent trials made on several different days, with the instrument in
different positions and with different rates of flow of the water current, the
heat “ found” ran between 97 per cent and 103 per cent of the heat intro-
duced. The mean of nine trials gave 100.4 per cent “found.” If, then, the
electrically supplied heat is thus closely measurable, much more should that

of the sun be, which is absorbed at once on the walls of the chamber instead
of indirectly by air convection.

The instrument is mounted equatorially and driven by clockwork, and the
rate of flow of the water current, lapse of time and temperature change
caused by radiation, are all recorded photographically on a moving drum.
Hence a continuous automatic record of the solar radiation is produced. In
use at Mount Wilson it is not easy to avoid considerable temperature change
of the apparatus, and this causes a slight “drift” of the record, but not
enough to prevent runs of several hours’ duration without attention.

A considerable part of the apparatus for the continuous pyrheliometer was
made by the International Instrument Company, of Cambridge, Mass. ‘The
more refined parts for the receipt and measurement of the radiation were
constructed by Mr. Kramer at the Observatory shop. In this, and in a great
amount of other work during the year, Mr. Kramer has combined skill with
rare willingness and interest in a way which deserves commendation.

(3) THE EXPEDITION TO MOUNT WILSON, IN CALIFORNIA.

From the very beginning, in 1902, of experiments in Washington on the meas-
urement of the solar constant of radiation it has been your aim to continue
these measurements at a more favorable situation as regards cloudiness, and
particularly as regards elevation. You long ago showed that in optical quality
the lower air is far inferior to that lying above, and you have repeatedly stated
your conviction that exact determinations of the absorption of the atmosphere
are impossible at stations near sea level. Congress having approved of your
plan to conduct these observations at high altitudes, apparatus has been col-
lected during the past three years for an expedition to a favorable station for
the measurement of the solar constant.

In the meantime the Carnegie Institution had been founded, and by invita-
tion of one of its officers you stated, in a communication to the Hon. C. D.
Walcott, dated February 28, 1902, your belief that the establishment by the
Carnegie Institution of an observatory to be situated at some high and cloud-
less point and engaged for at least a complete sun-spot cycle in the accurate
determination of the solar constant of radiation would be a worthy astronom-
ical undertaking and one most likely, in your judgment, to yield results of value
both from the standpoint of pure science and from that of practical utility
to mankind.

In 1904 the Carnegie Institution began the establishment of a solar obserya-
tory on Mount Wilson, in California, under the direction of Prof. G. E. Hale,
and the objects of this observatory include the measurement of solar radiation,
which you had urged. Almost immediately after the installation at Mount
Wilson had been begun, Professor Hale, recognizing the large share you have
had from the first in promoting the establishment of such an observatory, and
knowing of the preparations making at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
tory for an expedition to a high station to observe the solar constant, invited
you to send this expedition to Mount Wilson, and promised all possible coopera-
tion during its stay, and suggested that the work would, if desirable, be taken
up by the new solar observatory when the Smithsonian expedition should be
withdrawn. This invitation was accepted. The equipment, consisting of a full
spectro-bolographie and pyrheliometric outfit, the equal and in some respects
the superior of that installed in Washington, was sent forward in April, 1905.
The observers, C. G. Abbot in charge, and L. R. Ingersoll, temporary assistant,
reached the ground about May 10. Two shelters for the spectro-bolometer and
the continuous pyrheliometer, respectively, already framed in the valley below,
84 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

were immediately erected on Mount Wilson, and were finished, including all
their piers and accessories, in about two weeks. The spectro-bolometer was
completely installed and the first bolographic observations were made June 6,
1905.

In the meantime observations had been made nearly every day with the mer-
cury pyrheliometer, and these had given promise of great transparency and
uniformity of sky. From the 1st of June hardly a cloud was ever seen above
the level of the horizon for many weeks. Extraordinary calmness adds to the
advantages of this site. A few of the earliest bolographs were measured at
ence to see if all appeared to be well, and, as the measurements turned out very
satisfactorily, bolographic work was continued nearly every day thereafter,
leaving the reduction of the observations to a later time.

Investigations at Washington, as already reported, have given strong grounds
for the conclusion that the solar radiation varies considerably and frequently
in its amount. It would be most desirable if the Mount Wilson expedition
could give ample opportunity to test this conclusion, but in spite of the too
short time at present command it has been thought best by you to initiate it, and
at the same time to study more closely the manner of the solar variability. To
this end the work includes, not only solar-constant measurements, but other
studies designed to add to our knowledge of the whole question.

The expedition is under the greatest obligations for the continued aid fur-
nished by the director and staff of the Carnegie Solar Observatory. ‘The results
obtained will doubtless form a principal part of next year’s report.

SUMMARY.

The principal object of the Observatory during the past year has continued
to be the measurement of the solar radiation. The work of this and the two
preceding years strongly supports the view that the radiation of the sun is
frequently diminished and augmented for periods of a few weeks or months,
in consequence of a variability of the transparency of the solar absorbing en-
velope, and that this variation of radiation causes and quickly produces
changes of several degrees in the mean temperature of the Jand areas of the
earth. It is hoped that the study of the solar radiation will soon prove a val-
uable aid in forecasting climate.

Important additions and improvements have been made in the equipment of
the Observatory, both in buildings and apparatus. The new apparatus includes
a standard pyrheliometer, capable of continuously registering the solar radia-
tion and provided with means of certifying the exactness of its measures inde-
pendently of the theory of the instrument.

An expedition to measure and test the variability of solar radiation has
been sent to Mount Wilson, in Southern California.

Respectfuly submitted.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report on the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1905:

The publications received by the Institution and recorded in the accession
books of the Smithsonian deposit, Library of Congress, number as follows:

Quarto or Octayo or .

Oo lerdard

The accession numbers run from 460377468086.
s in the past a few of these publications were retained at the Institution for
the use of the scientific staff, but the larger number have been sent direct to the
Library of Congress. The entire sendings from the Institution required the use
of about 274 boxes, which it is estimated contained the equivalent of 10,960
octavo volumes. This estimate does not include, however, a large number of
public documents presented to the Smithsonian Institution and sent direct to
the Library of Congress without recording.
At the close of the year ending June 30, 1904, there remained in the Museum
library a number of the scientific series, together with books and pamphlets on
special subjects, belonging to the Smithsonian deposit, to be withdrawn, checked,
and sent to the Library of Congress, these publications haying been held at the
Museum when that Library was overcrowded in its old quarters at the Capitol.
While 7,805 parts were transmitted during the past year, it has not been pos-
sible to complete the checking, owing to the fact that the time of the small force
in the Smithsonian library was fully occupied with current work, but every effort
wili be made to finish the task before the close of the present year, when all of
the series of periodicals and publications belonging to the deposit, with the
exception of those in actual use, will be in the hands of the Librarian of
Congress. ;

The libraries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have
received during the year 418 volumes, pamphlets and charts, and 2,040 parts
of volumes, making a total of 2,458, and a grand total, including books for the
Smithsonian deposit and the Watts de Peyster collection Napoleon Bonaparte,
of 35,820.

The parts of serial publications that were entered on the card catalogue
numbered 26,000. One thousand seven hundred and thirty-five slips for com-
pleted volumes were made, and about 720 cards for new periodicals and an-
nuals were added to the permanent record from the periodical recording desk.

85
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Inaugural dissertations and academic publications were received from uni-
versities at the following places:

Ann Arbor. Erlangen. Marburg.

Baltimore (Johns Hop- Freiburg. Philadelphia (University
kins). Giessen. of Pennsylvania).

Basel. Grefswald. Rostock.

Berlin. Halle. Strassburg.

Bern. Heidelberg. Toulouse.

Bonn. Kiel. Manchester (England).

Breslau. Lawrence (Kansas). Zurich.

In continuing the Secretary’s plan to effect new exchanges and to secure
missing parts to complete sets, 1,405 letters were written, 301 new periodicals
were added to the receipts, and 527 defective series were partly or entirely
completed. In addition to the letters above referred to there were 175 postal
eards sent asking for current numbers that failed to reach the Institution,
which resulted in 103 being received.

The scientific staff and others have continued to consult the proceedings and
transactions of the learned societies in the reference room, and from the read-
ing room 21 bound volumes of periodicals were withdrawn and 4,568 scientific
periodicals and magazines were borrowed for consultation.

The sectional libraries maintained in the Institution, the Secretary’s library,
Office library, and the Employees’s library, together with those of the Astro-
physical Observatory, Aerodromics, International Exchanges, and Law Refer-
ence, have been used by persons from the other scientific bureaus of the Goy-
ernment, as well as members of the immediate staff.

In the Secretary’s and Office library 107 books were bound, and special at-
tention was given to collating the publications in the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, with the result that 118 completed volumes were bound at the Government
bindery. At the National Zoological Park 8 volumes have been added to the
library by purchase.

THE EMPLOYEE’S LIBRARY.

The popularity of the Hmployee’s library has continued, and during the year
2,262 books were borrowed. The new books added to the library by purchase
numbered 19, and 78 completed volumes of magazines were bound. ‘The send-
ing of about 40 of the books from this library to the National Zoological Park
and 26 to the Bureau of American Ethnology each month has been continued
with marked appreciation from the two bureaus.

THE WATKINS LIBRARY.

Within the last few months the trustees of the estate of the late Dr. J.
Hifreth Watkins have turned over to the Smithsonian Institution his large and
valuable library consisting in the main of books relating to engineering and
transportation. A book plate has been provided and the books listed, and it is
hoped that they may soon be available for the use of those interested in the
subject to which they relate.

THE JOHN DONNELL SMITH LIBRARY.

Through the munificence of Capt. John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, the
library of the Smithsonian Institution has become enriched by his collection
of botanical works, numbering about 1,600 volumes, containing books bearing
upon the flora of tropical America, carefully selected and substantially and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. reat

artistically bound. This donation was made in connection with the gift to the

‘Institution of his herbarium, and brings to the National Museum, where the
library will be deposited, an unrivaled basis of equipment for the prosecution of
2 complete botanical exploration of Central America and a critical study of its
whole flora.

WATTS DE PEYSTER COLLECTION NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.

It is very gratifying to report the,rapid increase of the Watts de Peyster
Collection Napoleon Buonaparte through the continued gifts of Gen. John Watts
de Peyster. The additions during the year numbered 1,775 volumes and 1,007
maps.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The Institution has continued to act as the representative in the United
States for the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, and has indexed
and classified for the Central Bureau at London the scientific literature of the
United States. During the past year the number of references sent to the
Central Bureau at London was 24,182, an increase of nearly three thousand
over the previous year, 2s follows:

All of the first annual issue of the International Catalogue has been published,
together with all of the second annual issue, excepting the volume of Zoology
and five volumes of the third annual issue, namely, Mathematics, Mechanics,
Physics, Astronomy, and Bacteriology.

MUSEUM LIBRARY.

In the Museum library there are now 24,170 bound volumes and 38,643 un-
bound papers. The additions during the year consisted of 3,573 books, 8,048
pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 1,952 books, of
which 101 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 3,755 pamphlets, of which
185 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit, and 12,216 parts of periodicals, of
which 1,309 belonged to the Smithsonian deposit. In the accession book 3,573
volumes, 3,048 pamphlets, and 563 parts of volumes were recorded. The num-
ber of cards added to the author’s catalogue was 5,942, which does not include
847 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued.

In connection with the entering of periodicals 55 memoranda were made
reporting volumes and parts missing in the sets, together with a few titles of
publications that were not represented in the library. The result of this
work was the completing or partly filling up of 23 sets of periodicals.

Throughout the whole year attention has been given to the preparation of
volumes for binding, with the result that 1,871 books were bound, and at the
close of the year there were several hundred more ready for the binder.

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general
library amounted to 40,400, including 9,192 which were assigned to the sec-
tional libraries.
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GrnrraL Aprrnpix to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of
its history, been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1905.

NEW MEASUREMENTS OF THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN.*

By A. R.. Hinks, M. A.

When I received the honor of an invitation to lecture at the School
of Military Engineering on some astronomical subject, I had little
difficulty in making my choice of a topic. There is just one subject
on which I may speak with some httle first-hand knowledge; and
by great good fortune that subject is concerned with a problem which
has both in its nature and its history a connection with the Corps of
Royal Engineers.

The problem of the determination of the distance of the sun is, in
some respects at least, the most fundamental in the whole range of
astronomy, for the number which represents it is involved in almost
any calculation of distances and masses, of sizes and densities, either
of planets or their satellites or of the stars. The distance of the sun
bears somewhat the same relation to other problems of celestial sur-
veying as the size and shape of the earth bear to terrestrial. It may
not always appear on the surface, but it is generally concealed some-
where in the depths of the calculations. And I am compelled to
confess that in one respect the earth measurers have the advantage
over astronomers. The utmost that the astronomer can do is to
show that the distance of the sun is so many times the radius of the
earth. But ask him to put it into miles and he is powerless to do
so until the geodesists have told him how large the earth is; and it
is there that, in the very nature of the case, we are compelled to
depend in the end upon the scientific labors of your corps.

A difference of 0°01” in the parallax is equivalent to 106,000 miles, or 170,000 kilometers.

Let us look at the matter for a moment as a problem in pure sur-
veying. To measure the distance of the sun we have as a base a
chord somewhat less than the diameter of the earth, since observa-
tions can not be made on a heayenly body when it 1s actually on the
horizon. Suppose we put our base line at nine-tenths of the diam-
eter. Our problem is to determine the distance of a body so far away
that the whole diameter of the earth subtends at it an angle of only
ubout 17.6 seconds of are; and with our somewhat diminished base
this angle is reduced to a little less than 15 seconds. I believe that
the length of your base upon the great lines of Chatham is about
1,730 feet. Imagine that from that base you had to determine with
an accuracy greater than one in a thousand the distance of an inter-
sected point about 4,500 miles away, as far away as Chicago, and you
have a problem which is by comparison simplicity itself. For the
ends of our 7,000-mile base are not visible from each other, being on
epposite sides of the world, and our angles at the base must be
determined by a complicated reference to the zenith, with all the
well-known impossibilities of determining absolute places in the sky
increased by the special difficulties that arise when the object to be
observed is the sun. You will readily grant that to determine the
distance of the sun by direct observation of that body is impossible,
unless you are content with an accuracy of about 1 im 10.

Now, it is a curious fact that there is a way of obtaining the dis-
tance of the sun with an accuracy of 10 per cent with no other instru-
ment than a clock keeping accurate time. You do it by observing
the times of minima of the variable star Algol. Every two days
twenty-one hours Algol drops more than a magnitude, and does
this with a regularity which would be unfailing were it not for the
fact that at one season of the year we are nearer the star by nearly
the whole diameter of the earth’s orbit than we are at the opposite
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. 103

season; and light takes about sixteen minutes to traverse that dis-
tance. In the middle of November the eclipses of Algol are taking
place eight minutes earlier than the average. In May, could we
observe the star so near the sun, they would be found eight minutes
behind their time; and a practised observer could, on a long series of
observations, determine that inequality, with a total range of sixteen
minutes, well within two minutes—that is to say, with an accuracy
of about 10 per cent. We have then only to combine this quantity
with the known velocity of light and we have a measure of the sun’s
distance. A mere curiosity in itself, it will serve to introduce us to
some indirect ways of determining the distance of the sun which
have, both practically and historically, a peculiar interest and im-
portance.

At the present time we are in the thick of a new determination of
the distance of the sun on a scale of operations greater than has been
known before. More than fifty observatories of the Northern Hemi-
sphere are engaged more or less deeply on the work, which has occu-
pied a great many of us closely for the last four years and will give
plenty of trouble to some of us for several years to come. Before
we enter upon the consideration of the new method and the new
opportunities we might well pause to answer the question, which is
by no means superfluous, How does it come about that, at the end of
the nineteenth century, which had seen attempts almost innumerable
to measure the distance of the sun, the result was still so much in
doubt that it was worth while to concentrate quite a large proportion
of the total astronomical energy of the world upon a new attempt?
I believe that’ we shall find some explanation of this fact if we
examine the history of the various values of the solar parallax that
were used in the Nautical Almanac during the nineteenth century.

A determination of the distance of the sun by direct observation of

the sun itself is impracticable; the sun is too difficult an object to

observe with any great accuracy: its distance is too great, and our
base is too small for any method of direct trigonometrical survey to
be possible. But we can in effect diminish its distance by substitut-
ing for it one of the planets, which can be more accurately observed,
for when the distance of any cne planet from the earth is known, the
dimensions of other orbits follow by the application of Kepler’s third
law. And at the same time we can, as we shall see, secure the ines-
timable advantage that the measures to be made are relative and not
absolute.

Let me digress for a moment to insist upon the importance of this
distinction. If you wished to find the difference in latitude and lon-
gitude between your Institute and the trigonometrical point at Dar-
land, you might determine the latitude and longitude of each and
take the differences, or you might triangulate from one to the other.
104 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

One is an absolute method, the other a relative, and it 1s scarcely
necessary to emphasize the difference in accuracy between the two.
We shall see that, various as are the kinds of measurement which
may be made to contribute to a knowledge of the solar parallax, they
are all of them relative measurements. For example, one may ob-
serve the displacement of the planet Mars among the stars, as seen
from a northern and a southern station—say Greenwich and the
Cape—or one may observe the displacement of the place of Venus in
transit across the sun from stations suitably chosen. In each case we
are measuring the displacement as viewed from different stations of a
near object with respect to one farther off, the displacement of Mars
among the stars or of Venus against the sun. We have secured the
advantages that the parallactic displacement to be measured is
greater than that of the sun itself; that the objects to be observed,
Mars or Venus, are better adapted for observation, and that the meas-
ures are relative.

In the middle of the eighteenth century Lacaille made observations
of Mars at the Cape of Good Hope, which were compared with others
made at various observatories in Europe, and he deduced a parallax
of about ten seconds. In the same century there occurred the two
famous transits of Venus of 1761 and 1769, which were very exten-
sively observed, among others by Captain Cook on his celebrated ex-
pedition for that purpose to the South Seas. Many and various were
the results obtained by different discussions of the observations, Lying
between eight and one-half and nine and one-half seconds, but decid-
edly less than the parallax found from Mars, and we find that at the
beginning of the nineteenth century the Nautical Almanac adopted
a value in round numbers, nine seconds, as the best that could be
made of them.

In 1824 the German astronomer Encke submitted to a very search-
ing examination the collected results of the transit of 1769 and
deduced the result 8°5776 seconds, which, with its imposing train of
decimals intact, was incorporated in our Nautical Almanac for 1834,
survived until 1869, and was responsible for the statement, which
many of us can remember in the schoolbooks, that the distance of
the sun is 95,000,000 miles.
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. 105

Meanwhile the attack upon the problem had been maintained in
several different ways, and particularly by an indirect method that
has many points of interest.

In the lunar theory there occurs, among the short-period perturba-
tions to which the motion of the moon is subject, an inequality in a
period of a month which depends upon the fact that the disturbing
action of the sun is greater on that half of the moon’s orbit which lies
toward the sun than upon the other half. The result of this is that
the moon is more than two minutes behind at first quarter and two
minutes ahead at last quarter of the place which she would occupy
were there no perturbation. It is clear that the magnitude of the
effect must depend upon the ratio of the distances of the sun and
moon from the earth; and since the effect is large, an oscillation
either way of about one hundred and twenty-five seconds, this should
give a strong determination of the solar parallax, provided that the
moon can be observed with the required accuracy and that the theo-
retical relation between the perturbation and the solar parallax is
firmly established. In 1858 Leverrier found in this way a value of
8-95 seconds; several other determinations supported this large
value, and practically all the determinations made since 1830, how-
ever much they might disagree among themselves, agreed at any rate
in one thing, that Encke’s value was much too small. We find, there-
fore, that in the Nautical Almanac for 1870, published in 1866,
Leverrier’s value, 8-95 seconds, is adopted, and the official distance of
the sun changed at one swoop from 95,000,000 to 91,000,000 miles.

But now preparations were in full swing for the observations of
the transit of Venus of 1874 and 1882, which for many years had been
eagerly awaited in the full expectation and belief that then, with all
the manifold improvements in the arts of observation, in the inven-
tion of the heliometer and the application of photography to celestial
measurement, the question of the solar parallax would be definitely
settled. We can not do more than glance at the most beautiful and
most complicated geometrical problems involved in the consideration
of all the circumstances of a transit of Venus. But these two
diagrams ¢ will show some of the circumstances of the very important
phenomena, the times of internal contact at ingress and egress, the
times when Venus is just completely on the sun and just about to
begin to go off. Great preparations were made for observing these
times of ingress and egress, and the results would undoubtedly have
been successful had it not been for the cruel way in which the
geometrical sharpness of the phenomenon is ruined by the lighting

up of the atmosphere of Venus; there was no instant when tangency
was perceptible, and, to be frank, the transit of Venus as a means of
determining the distance of the sun was a failure. The photographic
and heliometer observations had for various reasons met with no
better success than the observations of contacts; there was no con-
sistency about the results.

But just as the preparations for the transits were beginning in
1867 Prof. Simon Newcomb had published an elaborate discussion
of the solar parallax based upon several different methods. With
some of these we are already familiar, and I will call attention to one
only, the last, which we have not as yet discussed.

Components of Newcomb’s value.

Tt is an effect of aberration that every star describes yearly in the
sky an ellipse of which the semimayjor axis is about 20°5 seconds, and
this number is called the constant of aberration. It is the ratio of
the velocity of the earth in its orbit to the velocity of light. When
the constant is known and the velocity of light is known, the velocity
of the earth in its orbit is known; and since the time of describing
that orbit is also known, the size of the orbit and the distance of the
earth from the sun follow immediately.

In 1876 it appeared then that there was strong evidence against the
value 8°95 seconds; and without waiting for the results of the tran-
sit of Venus expeditions, the Nautical Almanac adopted for the while
the value 8-848 seconds found by Newcomb from this galaxy of results
which looked so accordant; and that value was first used in the
Almanac for 1882, the year of the second transit.

But meanwhile Sir David Gill, who had observed the transit of
1874 at Mauritius and had made up his mind very definitely that no
good would come out of the transit of 1882, had borrowed Lord
Lindsay’s heliometer and established himself on the island of Ascen-
sion to observe with the heliometer the opposition in 1877 of the
planet Mars. Every night the observing station in Mars Bay was
carried some six or seven thousand miles by the rotation of the earth
and the planet thereby displaced among the stars by some forty sec-
onds. The heliometer is by far the most refined instrument for the
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. LO?

visual measurement of distance from star to star; the observations
extended over months instead of hours; they could be pursued without
any of the disquieting feelings that a temporary breakdown would
ruin everything; and they were brought to a successful end in a paral-
lax of 8°78 seconds. But one doubt was cast upon the result. Was it
possible that the red color of Mars had influenced the measures syste-
matically? It could not be denied that the effect of the dispersion of
the air, which gave the planet a blue fringe above that might be lost
in the blue sky, and a red fringe below that would be indistinguish-
able from the red planet itself, might have produced some effect ; and
Sir David Gill resolved to try again, utilizing this time three minor
planets farther away than Mars, with less parallax therefore but with
disks so small that they were indistinguishable from stars.

In 1888 and 1889 five observatories, the Cape in the Southern
Hemisphere, and Yale, Gottingen, Leipzig, and the Radcliffe Obser-
vatory at Oxford in the Northern Hemisphere, combined to observe
the planets Victoria, Iris, and Sappho with the heliometer. The
labor was immense. The observations proved to be so accurate that
they demanded the use in a great part of the work of eight figure
logarithms. When only a few years ago the whole work was
published in two enormous volumes of Annals of the Cape Obser-
ratory, it might well have been thought that here was the last word
of observation for many vears. Yet we are now attacking the
problem with more energy than ever.

About ten years ago the end of the century was in sight, and there
was a general impression abroad that it was time to set one’s house
in order and to make a good start on the Ist of January, 1901. The
directors of the four nautical almanaes (the British, French, German,
and American) resolved to meet in Paris in 1896, and with the help
of certain distinguished advisers to agree upon a uniform set of con-
stants to be adopted in all the Almanacs from the year 1901. Among
these constants was the solar parallax. We may summarize the infor-
mation which was at the disposal of the conference thus:

Gill’s heliometer measures of minor planets gave 8 °802 seconds, and
no other direct observational result could be compared with this; the
transits of Venus were discredited even though some of the final
results had not, and have not even now, been published. The most
recent determinations of the constant of the aberration of light gave
8-799 seconds, the parallactic inequality of the moon, 8°794 seconds.
108 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

There were thus three powerful methods which converged upon a
‘value close to 8°80 seconds. But to set against them was a method
which we have not yet noticed.

The perturbations in the motions of other planets produced by
the earth depend upon the mass of the earth, and from them that mass
ean be determined. There is further a well-known relation between
the mass of the earth, the value of the gravitation constant, the length
of the year, and the distance of the sun, from which the latter may
therefore be derived when we know the others. Professor Newcomb
had thus determined the parallax in two different ways, and had
found two results agreeing closely among themselves, with mean 8-76
seconds, but differing widely from the others. No explanation of this
divergence could be found. But the evidence was 2 to 1 in favor of
8-80 seconds, and 8°80 seconds was adopted in 1896 as the value to be
used in all the almanacs from the beginning of this century.

It might well have been thought that the question would have been
allowed to rest there for a while. At the end of a century of labor
four principal results had emerged, and there was a majority of 3 to 1
in favor of 8°80 seconds. But there is a phenomenon, known in
politics as the swing of the pendulum or the flowing tide, by whose
operation a majority hardly won begins immediately to melt away.
A like phenomenon appears to affect the solar parallax. We have
seen how its adopted value has swung from 8°57 to 8°95 seconds, and
back again to 8°85 and 8°80 seconds. Scarcely had the resolution of
the Paris Conference been taken than the majority in favor of 8-80
secends began to melt away. The beginning of the century had been
chosen as an auspicious moment in which to make a change, without
considering that there were at the end of the preceding century many
investigations just then drawing to a close. The value of the aberra-
tion constant corresponding to 8°80 seconds is 20°478 seconds. Al-
most every determination of that constant published since 1896—and
there are many—had come out above 20°50 seconds, many of these a
long way above. Further investigation of the parallactic inequality
of the moon had not only altered the observed value of the inequality,
but had modified the theoretical relation by which the parallax is
deduced therefrom. The evidence for 8:80 seconds was giving way
badly ; and before the 1901 Almanac came into use we had this revised
table propounded by one of the chief instigators of the adoption of
8-80 seconds. The majority was now 3 to 1 in favor of a value at
least as low as 8°77 seconds.

I suppose that there will always be two opinions upon the question:
Is the adopted value of the solar parallax to depend upon direct
observation or are the indirect determinations through the constant
of aberration, the parallactic inequality, and the mass of the earth to
be allowed a weight in some proportion to their numbers? I take it
that those of us who have determined the parallax by direct obser-
vations may not unnaturally look upon these indirect methods as
interesting confirmations of our result if they agree with it, while if
they differ there must be something wrong with them. But in the
absence of a direct determination of overwhelming weight there
must always be a feeling of uneasiness when one sees three or more
results conspiring to deny the truth of one. And however that may
be, it is certainly true that about the year 1898 there was a very gen-
eral suspicion abroad that the value 8°80 seconds was too large.

At this moment there came a curious stroke of fortune. Doctor
Witt, of the Urania Sternwarte, Berlin, was engaged in a photo-

Fie. 1.—Eros campaign 1900-01. Distribution of Observatories.

graphic search for a minor planet which had long been lost. He
failed, but found instead a minor planet for which one would will-
ingly barter the remaining five hundred odd; a minor planet indeed,
but moving in a most remarkable orbit, lying for the most part
within that of Mars, very eccentric, considerably inclined to the
elliptic, and approaching the earth on favorable occasions within
about 15,000,000 miles. It was immediately recognized that here was
a new opportunity for determining the solar parallax and that the
determination must be made at once or left alone for thirty years,
for a comparatively favorable opposition was due in 1900 and no
more good ones till 1930 and 1937. At the meeting of the permanent
committee which directs the making of the astrographic chart and
‘atalogue of the whole sky it was resolved to invite a great coopera-
tion of observatories to make a combined onslaught on the problem.
The suggestion was readily taken up, with an alacrity, indeed, which
might almost have suggested that the observatories concerned had
nothing to do and were glad of a job, an imputation which is immedi-

ately rejected when one finds that some of the most energetic partici-
pants were precisely those observatories that had their hands most full
with the astrographic chart (fig. 1). By a cruel stroke of fate Sir
David Gill at the Cape was compelled to remain a spectator of the
work, for the planet came so far north that it was practically unob-
servable in the Southern Hemisphere, while in England we had the
unique spectacle of a planet north of the zenith.

Astronomy, shows very clearly the circumstances. Corresponding

positions of the earth and the planet are joined, and if we follow out
in Imagination the directions that these lines must have, remembering
that the orbit of the planet is inclined 10° to that of the earth, we
see that the planet described a loop at opposition, as all exterior
planets do, but that the loop was. of very unusual proportions
(Ginkess 33)

To discuss in any detail the circumstances of the apparition and
the way in which they can be utilized for a determination of the
parallax would take too long. But we may get a good idea of a
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. eel

fairly typical case by transplanting ourselves in imagination to the
planet Eros on the evening of the 2d of December, 1900, armed with
an imaginary telescope ridiculously out of proportion to the real size
of the planet, which is probably not more than 20 miles in diameter
(fig. 4). The earth is past inferior conjunction with the sun, and
appears as a crescent. The North Pole of the earth is tilted toward
us, and by the aid of this projection of the meridians and parallels of
latitude we can with great ease trace the path of each observatory
as it is carried round by the rotation of the earth and can measure
from the scales the angular distance at any moment of an observatory
from the center, or the distance between two observatories, which
angular distances as seen from the planet are the precise equivalents
of the parallactic diplacements of the planet as seen from the earth,

In the programme of observations there was one novel and prom-
ising feature—the application of photography. With the exception
of the transit of Venus observations, in which its success was not
striking, photography had not been previously applied in a deter-
mination of the solar parallax, for the very good reason that in
1889, at the time of the opposition of Victoria, there was practically
cnly one telescope in existence which was capable of taking photo-
graphs for exact measurement, that pioneer photographic equatorial
made by the Brothers Henry at Paris. The fact that there were in
1900 eighteen photographic telescopes engaged in observing Eros
shows how rapidly the equipment of astronomy has grown in the last
few years. We were so fortunate at Cambridge as to have our new

ea NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

photographic equatorial just completed and made to work. (I may
remark parenthetically that it took longer to make the machine
work than to build it, for when one embarks upon a large experiment
and sets up an instrument, the first of its kind, built upon improved
lines, one sets out upon a sea of troubles.)

The great advantage of the photographic method in such an under-
taking must be sufficiently well known by you. It is, of course, this,
that one is rendered very much more independent of continued fine
weather. A photograph of the planet and the surrounding’ stars
could be made in two or three minutes of actual exposure. Given an
hour’s break in the clouds, one could accumulate far more valuable

material than could be obtained in a whole night’s visual observation,
for the photograph once secured could be measured at leisure, by day
or on cloudy nights.

Throughout Europe the skies of that winter were far from clear.
Thad the pleasure at Cambridge of sitting up from dusk till dawn for
nearly three months on end and during that time had not half a
dozen nights clear right through. Had I been making visual observa-
tions I should have done little; as things turned out I was able to get
some five hundred exposures. The programme was to get four ex-
posures per hour throughout the night, making a number of exposures
on each plate, and moving the plate a little between each exposure.
NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN. Melis

The stars are then arranged in columns of fours; the images of the
planet, owing to its rapid motion, are in echelon.

Now each exposure gives very accurately the place of the planet
with reference to the group of stars around it, and for merely parallax
purposes the ideal would be to have pairs of such photographs taken
at the same instant at stations widely separated. By a very simple
use of the measures of some ten or twelve stars suitably disposed
ubout the planet, it would be possible to allow almost automatically
for the differences of refraction, orientation, scale value, ete., which
make the plates not immediately comparable, and to find at once the
parallactic displacement.

We have been speaking of the displacement as very large, and so
it is when compared with the displacements dealt with in previous
determinations. But look at it this way: We saw that the earth as
seen from Eros subtended an angle of 53 seconds. The seale of the
Cambridge plates is such that if we draw a circle having a diameter
of a little over 1§ mm. we represent the apparent diameter on our
plate of the earth as seen from Eros; and within that small circle the
whole of the parallactic displacement must necessarily lie. About
a millimeter was the average displacement obtained in a favorable
combination of observations, and when we consider that we are trying
to measure that with a resultant accuracy of 1 in 1,000 it does not
seem so very great after all.

We have put the problem heretofore in its very simplest form. In
actual fact the exposures at different stations were not simultaneous.
Early morning observations made at Cambridge might be contbinable
with evening observations at Lick more or less simultaneous, or with
evening observations ten or twelve hours before at (say) Oxford; or
they might have to stand alone. Any general method of utilizing all
the results must seeure the possibility of reducing each plate, so_ to
speak, on its own merits, to allow it to contribute its quota, be it
large parallactic displacement or none at all, to the general collection
of equations of condition. This requires that we shall know the
relative places of all those stars which are to be used as comparison
stars for the planet, right along the whole track of the planet. And
this derivation of a standard star system is by far the most delicate
and difficult part of the whole work. One must start with a founda-
tion of stars observed with the meridian cirele, and fill in the fainter
stars from the photographs themselves, taking care to provide at the
same time the places of all those faint comparison stars which have
been used by the visual observers. And all these places of stars must
be tied together, so to speak, by the overlapping of the photographs,
so that the system may run smoothly throughout its length. Abso-
lute errors of zero there no doubt will be, and must be, but it is
ee: NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

required that there shall be no sudden jumps in the errors exceeding
one or two hundredths of a second of are.

Now, when one comes to face a problem like this, one must inquire
very carefully what is the real accuracy of the photograph. There is
no doubt that the ordinary photographie telescope properly worked
will repeat itself very well; it will take two plates of the same region
which agree with one another excellently. But the question 1s, How
would two plates of the same region taken with different telescopes
agree? We know that individual observers have peculiarities of
their own which they can repeat almost ad infinitum. Does a photo-
graphic telescope do the same, or has it at last conquered that bad
habit of idiosynerasy which has made so much trouble in all refined
astronomical work of the older kinds? When we started on the
Eros campaign there was practically no information to be obtaimed
upon this point. «Almost all the photographic telescopes at work had
been engaged upon their own zone of the chart, and almost nothing
-was known of how the results from different instruments would com-
bine. But in our parallax problem this question is fundamental, and
must be answered as soon as possible. I therefore ventured to
propose to myself to undertake the reduction of a small section of
the photographic results, for a period of nine days in November,
1900, having before me two objects: Firstly, to discover how far it 1s
possible to combine photographs taken at different observatories, how
far, in fact, photographic telescopes are giving really accurate results
or merely reproducing their own errors; secondly, to obtain a pro-
visional value of the solar parallax, with a probable error if possible as
small as that found by Sir David Gill with the heliometer, and to find
out provisionally whether Eros was going to confirm that result or to
join in the secession from the adopted value.

Perhaps I may venture to think that the results of this enterprise
have been in some measure successful. I found that as a general
rule the results from different telescopes do not combine directly as
well as could be hoped and that there are many precautions which
must be taken in using them if we are to avoid serious systematic
error and a ruination of the parallax determination; but I believe
that it is possible to avoid these difficulties and that the photographs
properly treated will give a determination of the parallax of far
ereater accuracy than has hitherto been obtained. I found also that
the 300 exposures in that period of nine days, contributed altogether
by nine different observatories, gave a value of the solar parallax,
8-797 seconds + 0:0047 second, which is in such nice agreement with
Gill’s 8-802 seconds = 0:005 second that one may feel in one’s heart
(though of course must never express the feeling so prematurely as
this) some hope that, in adopting 8°80 seconds as the official value
of the solar parallax, the conference of 1896 was not so wrong as
some people have been prepared to believe.

I can not refrain from calling your attention to a by-product of
this work which has for me a singular interest, because it seems to
exhibit in a favorable light the accuracy which we may obtain with
these photographic methods. After Eros had been under observation
for some time it was discovered that its light was varying in a short

period, which was at first thought to be 2h. 38m. Afterwards it was
found that the alternate minima of light was unequal, and that the
true period should be reckoned as 5h. L6m., two equal maxima and
two unequal minima being included within that space of time
(fig. 5). The variation appears to be continuous, without sensible
pause, which precludes the idea that the planet is double and that the
minima are due to eclipses of one body by the other. We must find
some other cause. There are two which suggest themselves quite
naturally—irregularity of shape and irregularity of surface bright-

ness. For our purpose the important point is this—that either of
these causes might produce an apparent oscillation in the place of
the planet. To discover if this were so, I grouped the residuals in
my equations of condition according to their epoch into eight columns,
corresponding to successive eighths of the whole period of 5h. 16m.,
and took the means for each column. If there were a sensible
oscillation in a period of 5h. 16m., these would lie on a sine curve.
They obviously do not; there is no sensible oscillation in that period
(fig. 6). But notice that if we add together the first and fifth, the
second and sixth, and so on—-that is to say, if we search for the half
period of 2h. 38m.—we get quite strong evidence of periodicity (fig. 7).
116 NEW MEASUREMENTS OF DISTANCE OF SUN.

Now, the semiamplitude of the oscillation is only 0°08 second, a
quantity so small that one can not but feel doubts as to its reality.
At first I was myself inclined to disbeheve; but when a new distribu-
tion of the residuals, starting from a different zero of time, gave a
similar periodicity, 1t began to look as if there were something in it.
The more I look at it the more I believe that it is a reality, and that
the photographs have shown themselves accurate enough to detect an
inequality of 0°03 second, corresponding to a shift of 5 miles at a
distance of 25,000,000 miles—by far the smallest inequality in the
motion of a planet ever brought to hght by observation.

It is this circumstance that encourages one to believe in the accu-
racy of the photographs. There are altogether 10,000 separate expo-
sures of the planet which will within the next few years be meas-
ured and made available for discussion. If 300 give a P. E. of
0-005 second, what will 10,000 give, added to 6,000 or 7,000 sets of

visual observations? It would be going too far to apply the simple
rules of probability and say a good deal less than 0-001 second. But
JI fully believe that if this great array of observations is ever sub-
mitted to complete discussion the probable error of the result will not
be much above 0-001 second. And supposing that it should support
with its greater weight the value 8°80 seconds which has been
assailed, I believe that we should be justified in saying that the solar
parallax is 8°80 seconds, and in maintaining the proposition that the
determination of the solar parallax is a problem of geometry and
celestial surveying, and that upon the sponsors of the indirect meth-
ods lies the onus of showing cause for their disagreement.

This opens up an interesting prospect. Suppose that in course
of time there should come to be a clear and definite agreement among
the values found for the constant of the aberration of ight, and that
its value was (let us say) 20°54 seconds, corresponding, as this table
shows, to a parallax of 8-77 seconds, not 8°80 seconds, on the assump-
tion at least that the velocity of light is exactly determined, as it
seems to be, and that the simple theory of aberration is correct.

And suppose that by that time we are prepared to say quite defi-
nitely that the geometrical value is not 8°77 seconds but 8°80 seconds.
The most obvious solution of the difficulty would be to conclude that
the simple theory of aberration is not true, and to hand over the
problem to the mathematical physicists, who might in the result find
that a definite geometrical determination of the solar parallax had
provided just. the criterion which they required to settle certain vexed
questions in dynamics.

Again, should further investigation confirm the conclusion that
8-76 seconds is the only value of the solar parallax which ~ will
reconcile the existing theory of the motion of the planet with the
observed value of the constant of gravitation, it may be that the con-
tradiction between the direct and the indirect methods will at last
enable the dynamical astronomers to lay a finger upon that flaw
which exists somewhere or other in the theory and makes it impossi-
ble to say at the present time that all the motions of the. solar system
can be completely explained.

I have ventured to point out that the determination of the solar
parallax is a problem of wide interest, since it throws upon so many
different people the task of keeping up their particular end against an
attack whose accuracy is gradually becoming more and more deadly.
The dimensions of the earth, as obtained by geodetic operations, are
necessarily beyond the reach of any criticism derived from solar
parallax results.

But it is interesting to speculate whether astronomers will ever be
in the position to say, “ We have now determined the solar parallax
in seconds of are to a higher degree of accuracy than that of the
measurement of the earth,” and to call upon geodesists for better re-
sults. I can conceive only one direction in which we may be able to
worry the successors in your corps of Everest and Clarke. Is the
form of the equator a circle or an ellipse? I believe that there is
some slight evidence for ellipticity, and that it has been put as high
as one in three thousand. If that is so, it is just barely possible that
we may have to introduce into the computation of the parallax factors
for different observatories a term depending upon the shape of the
equator. But I confess that this prospect is remote, and that for
inany years, in all probability, geodesists who achieve accuracies of
fne in a hundred thousand and even talk of one in a million will be
able to take a serene view of the labors of astronomers to arrive at
the distance of the sun to one part in ten thousand.
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH A MOVING
CAMERA.*

By ALEX LARSEN. Chicago, II].

Lightning, with its accompaniment of thunder, has always ex-
erted a fascinating influence on the thinking mind. It is not strange
that a people living in an age when the laws of nature were less per-
feetly understood should have associated this beautiful and awe-
inspiring natural phenomenon with the powers and attributes of
their gods.

The ancient Norsemen recognized in the rumbling of the thunder
the approach of Thor, their most powerful god, in his heavenly
chariot, drawn by his two he goats; and in the hghtning flash they
saw the path cleaved through the air by the never-failing hammer
“ Mjolner,” wielded by the mighty arm of Thor when battling with
the enemies of the gods, the hammer always returning to his hand.
The myth is beautiful, and it would seem as if its authors had noticed
the peculiar flickering of most lightning flashes and associated it
with the forward and return movement of the hammer.

The principal object of this paper is to place before its readers
certain facts to account for this flickering of lightning flashes.

In the latter part of the summer of 1901, while taking somegordi-
nary pictures of lightning, the idea occurred to the writer while
noticing this flickering that if the camera be moved in a circle at
right angle to the flash the picture ought to show a widening of the
flash, if it was composed of separate parts, and thereby also deter-
mine its duration. The attempt to do this was made that year, but
without success. It was repeated again in 1902, and on July 17
several successful exposures were made which clearly showed that
most flashes are composed of several discharges following one another
at certain intervals in the path made by the first discharge. The
writer was unaware at the time that others had experimented in the
same line and had published their results.

a@The study of lightning flashes herewith presented was aided by a grant
from the Hodgkins Fund of the Smithsonian Institution,
: 119
120 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

The camera was moved by hand, being swung from right to left
and back again, each swing lasting about one second and covering an
angle of about 60°, which was also the angle of the lens. .The ap-
paratus employed was an ordinary magazine plate camera, which
for all ordinary purposes is the most convenient on account of the
rapidity with which the plates can be changed, this being cf great
importance, because, as a rule, the time most favorable for obtaining
good pictures is very short, seldom lasting longer than from ten
to fifteen minutes.

Several more pictures were obtained in 1903. The three most in-
teresting ones up to that year are shown in figures 1,2, and 3. (See
plates.) Figure 1 shows a flash obtained on July 17, 1902. The dis-
charge took place between two clouds. It will be noticed that it is
composed of a number of separate discharges (or rushes) and bands;
as many as thirty-four can be counted on the negative. As the flash
covers about half of the plate, and as the approximate speed of the
‘amera was about one second to cover the plate, or 60°, it follows that
the approximate duration of this flash was about half a second. Fig-
ure 2 shows a flash obtained on July 11,1903. This flash is interesting
for several reasons. It is composed of fourteen separate discharges,
the first one being the brightest, and having side branches pointing
downward, proving that the first discharge passed from the cloud
to the earth and that the resistance which it had to overcome must
have been excessive (the side branches prove that). At a distance
of 3 millimeters from the first rush is another discharge following
the same path, but without side branches (what appear as such are
really branches from the first rush). At a distance of 12°5 milli-
ineters from the last discharge will be seen two rushes 0°5 millimeter
apart, and from there for a distance of 10 millimeters are a series
of discharges close together, forming a broad band. The dark space
which divides this flash is a cloud through which the discharge is
passing. Another interesting fact about this flash is that the path
of it is spiral shaped, the motion is from right to left, or opposite to
the motion of the hands of a clock, looking downward from the
cloud. Figure 3 was obtained October 1, 1903. We have here a flash
composed, first, of two bright discharges close together, then there
appears to be an interval of about a fourth of a seeond, which in all
probability was filled in with a number of fainter oscillations (the
lines running across seem to indicate that), and at the conclusion
of the flash are four fairly bright rushes.

In the summer of 1904 copies of some of the photographs were
sent to the Smithsonian Institution for examination, and through the
suggestions and assistance of the experts of that Institution a new
method of moving the camera was devised.
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 121

A spring-motor movement (of the kind used to operate revolving
stands for exhibiting goods in show windows) was procured and
mounted inside a table specially constructed for the purpose, and a
stand for supporting the cameras was fitted to the central shaft.

As the speed of the motor was too slow, the fly-vane shaft was re-
moved and the vane moved to the next shaft, which was lengthened
so as to extend under the table. Thus arranged the fly vane
could be made to revolve in a liquid placed in a vessel under
the table, thereby preventing much of the vibration and_ get-
iing a more uniform speed. Figure 4 shows the arrangement of
the apparatus. The table top is removed in order to show how the
motor movement is placed; the fly vane is seen under the table. The
stand is usually revolved at a speed of one revolution in ten sec-
onds, which the writer has found to be the most suitable for ordinary
purposes. The reason for employing a motor movement with a
uniform speed to move the camera is to ascertain the exact duration
of a flash or the intervals between the rushes.

If the angle of the lens and the speed of the camera be known, it
is a simple matter of measurement to ascertain the duration of a
flash. The formula employed is as follows:

Call the angle of the lens (in degrees) =A°

Time for one rotation of stand (in seconds) =T

Width of plate (in millimeters )=W

Width of flash measured on plate (in millimeters) =N

AS
mat
Then time for flash (in seconds) — —- XN

The measurements should be taken from the middle of the plate,
owing to the distortion of the lens.

A number of photographs have been taken by this method, and
about nine out of ten show the multiplicity of a flash. The average
number of rushes for each flash is about five or six, and the time
varies from an almost instantaneous value up to about half a second
for a complete discharge.

The most interesting discharge obtained is shown in figure 5. It
was taken September 1, 1905, at 9 p. m. The storm during which
this flash was photographed began about 7 p. m., with the wind
northeast, which is something very unusual for Chicago. The wind
gradually changed to north and northwest. The temperature during
the storm was about 24° C., and the barometer varied between 29°89
and 29°92. The flash was obtained when the storm was most severe
and while it was raining very hard.

This flash is composed of forty separate discharges, made up of
one band, which in all probability is composed of a number of sepa-

sm 1905——12
122 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

rate rushes or oscillations very close together and one black dis-
charge. It is this dark discharge which makes this flash interesting,
and the photograph shows it running parallel and on both sides of
the first bright rush, extending 0.6 millimeter on one side and 0.1
millimeter on the other, the boundary line on the latter side not being
very marked. From this black discharge issue several side branches
on both sides, a large one spreading out over the other rushes quite
prominently. These side branches all pointing downward indicate
that the black flash was a downward stroke, and they also tend to
prove that it must have had a good deal of resistance to overcome.
Tt must have cleared the way for the first bright discharge, which in
all probability proceeded from the ground upward. ‘The difference
in width of the bright flash, measured at its lower and upper part,
would confirm this opinion, being for the lower part 0.88 millimeter
and for the upper part 0.22 millimeter.

An interesting question here presents itself. Have we here two
separate discharges with different rates of oscillation traveling the
same path? Can such a condition be possible? To the writer’s
mind the most plausible explanation would be that the two dis-
charges occupied two separate paths, one imside of the other, one
discharge forming, so to speak, a tube through which the other passed.

It may also be claimed that the bright flash is probably part of the
dark discharge for some reason rendered more lumimous. This
explanation may be the true one, although it appears as if the bright
flash is entirely separate. The measurements of the width of the
upper and lower parts of both flashes confirm this opinion, the
difference in width of the bright flash being 40 per cent and for the
dark discharge only 20 per cent. Authorities vary in their opinions
as to the probable cause of these dark flashes. It has been suggested
by some that there really are no black discharges, but what appear
as such are excessively bright flashes causing a reversal of the image
on the plate. This explanation may be the true one if we under-
stand the word * brightness ” to mean increased actinic power of the
light. In the black flash represented this chemical effect must have
been extremely high, owing to the fact that the smallest hair-like
extremities of the side branches are well reproduced on the picture
as black, in comparison with the broader and to all appearance more
powerful discharges which followed after.

It was at first thought probable that we had to deal with an inter-
ference phenomenon, but that idea was discarded. Then it was
suggested that the black discharge was probably due to slow oscilla-
tions (the width of it would tend to confirm this opinion), and that
what appeared as black on the plate would in reality be a dark red
discharge on a partially illuminated background. This opinion had
to be discarded for the reason that, if such be the case, the side
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 123

branches of the dark flash would have been obliterated by the other
rushes following. The effect of halation and solarization was also
considered, but rejected. There was thus but one way to account for
the phenomenon, namely, that the flash must have given out ligh!
of a wave length much shorter than the wave lengths of visible light
and with a power sufficient to render the portion of the plate struck
by it nonsensitive to ordinary light. Such a flash would appear
biack on a partially illuminated background or be invisible.

Dark flashes have been observed by the writer on several occasions
and only when raining very hard. They appear to the eye the same
as the accidental image produced after looking at a bright flash.
Such an image may be retained in the eye for quite a while after, but
‘an. not easily be confounded with a real flash.

Two other pictures of dark discharges have been obtained with
the moving camera, but are not so prominent; they likewise show the
first rush as black, but without a bright core and with no side
branches; one is of a horizontal and the other a vertical flash.

Below is a table of the measurements of this flash. The angle of
the lens was 60°. Time of rotation of camera, 1 revolution in 10
seconds. Width of plate, 127 millimeters. .The width of the whole
flash, 48 millimeters. Time for the whole flash, 0.624 second. The
average distance between the rushes, 1.2 millimeters. Average time
for each rush, 0.0156 second. The plate used was a “ Standard ”
ordinary plate. The contrast of the picture has been increased by
means of a double-contact print with lantern-slide plates. The
developer was “ Rodinal.” Time for developing, five minutes.

In the summer of 1905 a new departure was undertaken by the
writer at the suggestion of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the object being to obtain spectrum photographs of lightning.

Spectroscopic examinations of hghtning have been made by many,
but most of these observations have been visual, which at their best
ean only be rough approximations of the number of lines and their
relative positions. As far as the writer knows, only one institution
in the country—the Harvard College Observatory—had undertaken
any work in photographing the spectrum of lightning.

A crude apparatus was constructed, consisting of a camera with a
35-mnillimeter prism fitted in front of the lens, no slit being used, as
a lightning flash is a relatively narrow streak of light yielding a prac-
tically parallel beam. By.means of this arrangement a few photo-
graphs have been obtained, two of which are reproduced in figures 6
and 7. A spectrum photograph of a spark from a static machine, for
comparison, is shown in figure 8,

The spectrum shown in figure 6 is from a vertical flash, the picture
of which was obtained June 18, 1905. It was about 14 miles distant
and was taken at the end of a storm of local character. The spec-
trum of this flash resembles that from the static machine in most of
its details,
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 125

Figure 7 shows the spectrum of one of those horizontal meandering
flashes often seen at the conclusion of a storm of long duration. It
was obtained September 1, 1905. It differs considerably from figures
6 and 8, several lines being absent. The first line of this spectrum is
probably the same as the eighth line of the spark spectrum.

No definite opinion can at present be offered by the writer as to the
meaning of these changes of the lnes in the spectra of different
flashes; more material must be obtained before a positive statement
can be made.

Below is a table of measurements of the three spectra and their
probable relations. Several measurements have been taken, and the
nverage are here presented .

It may not be out of place here to give a few brief hints as to the
best method for obtaining lightning photographs, for the benefit of
the large number of amateur photographers scattered over the world.
Thunder storms are nearly always cyclonic in their character, their
diameter varying. When they extend over large areas it will usually
be found that most of the vertical flashes are at the circumference of
the circle through which the storm is passing. In the central part of
a storm the flashes are usually horizontal, or passing between two
4

126 PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA.

strata of clouds, therefore the best time for obtaining photographs
is either at the beginning or the end of a storm. At the beginning
the wind is usually very strong, hindering the work, so that it is gener-
erally best to wait until the front of the storm has just passed overhead
and then to expose the camera from a window or other suitable place
facing a direction opposite to that of the wind. In this way the
camera as well as the person will be protected from the wind and rain.
This rule holds good in most cases, although there are many excep-
tions, especially when the storm is local in character and of small
extent. A person must be on the lookout at all times and note the
direction in which most of the downward strokes appear and direct
the camera toward them. ;

It is useless to expose plates when there is nothing but sheet lght-
ning, for it will only result in spoiling them. Oftentimes there is ¢
mixture of sheet lhghtning and a few scattered ground strokes at
aneertain points. When that be the case, the chances for obtaining
pictures are shght, the sheet lightning soon fogging the plates, the
time for fogging in such cases being from five to ten minutes, depend-
ing on the frequency of the reflections. The best rule to follow is to
wait until a favorable opportunity presents itself, when the flashes
are about half a mile distant, then act quickly, have plenty of plates
ready to imsert in place of the exposed ones, and trust to luck. The
best way of holding the camera when swung by hand is to place it
close to the body, tilting it somewhat upward, so as to get as much as
possible of the sky in the picture, and swinging the body from side
to side. The time and angle of the swing can be regulated with a
little practice so as to be fairly accurate, say one second to the swing,
although the writer has found by experience that when a sudden
flash appears in front of the camera the evenness of the swing will be
somewhat disturbed, particularly if the flash is close to the observer,
unless the person be in possession of unusually strong nerves. When
pictures of horizontal flashes are desired the camera must naturally
have an up and down swing. These flashes are usually less intense
and the pictures of them sometimes require a very long time to
develop.

The developer preferred by the writer is “ Rodinal,” being con-
venient and clean, although any good developer will do, particularly
such contrast developers as “ Glycin ” or “ Hydrochinon.”

Different kinds of plates have been tried, but the writer has no
special preference for any one of the standard plates. The ortho-
chromatic plates do not seem to give better results than the ordinary
ones. Tilms give trouble in developing, because each exposure must
be developed separately. ;

Figure 9 shows the barometer devised by the writer, which he has
found very useful in the study of the variations of the atmospheric
PHOTOGRAPHING LIGHTNING WITH MOVING CAMERA. 127

pressure preceding and during storms. The instrument recommends
itself on account of the simplicity of its construction, its accuracy,
and the ease with which the readings can be made, less than one two-
hundredth part of an inch being easily read off without the aid of a
vermer.

The instrument shown in the illustration consists of a glass tube,
one-fourth inch inside diameter, 38 inches long, bent to an angle of
100° at a distance of 84 inches from the closed end, filled with mer-
cury, and mounted with the open end dipping into a reservior, which
in this case is 1 inch in diameter. The open end can also be bent up
to form a siphon barometer. The scale is placed along the upper
slanting part of the tube. A pointer is fastened to the lower part of
the instrument, the use of which is to indicate when it is in an exact
vertical position, a mark on the wall indicating this position. The
surface tension of the mercury is overcome by gently swinging the
instrument and returning it to its vertical position. The calibration
may be done by comparison with a standard instrument or by actual
measurements. The bend of the tube may be made at a different
angle, but should not be much less than 100° owing to the surface
tension of the mercury. With this angle the instrument will mag-
nify about six times, which has been found by the writer to be sufli-
cient for ordinary use. The range of the instrument described is
about 2 inches, and if a greater range is desired the slanting portion
of the tube may be made longer or a different angle of the bend be
substituted, although the proportions given have been found by
experience to give the best satisfaction. A tube with a small internal
diameter does not give good satisfaction owing to the surface tension
being greater.

THE TANTALUM LAMP:

By Dr. W. von Boiron and Dr. O. FEUERLEIN.

Parr I.—By Dr. W. von Botron.

Whilst the carbon-filament incandescent lamp remained for nearly
two decades the sole representative of glow-lamp manufacture, prog-
ress was being quietly made in this art. The firm of Messrs. Siemens
& Halske has for many years been working at a solution of the prob-
lem of an economical incandescent lamp, and arrived, some time ago,”
at the fundamental principle that the visible part of the radiation of
an incandescent body increases progressively with its temperature.
This warrants the postulate that the most economical lamp will be
that whose incandescent material will withstand the highest tem-
perature.

Messrs. Siemens & Halske had arrived at this conclusion and
charged me several years ago with the task of discovering a material
which should have a melting point considerably above the tempera-
ture at which incandescent hghting becomes highly economical, so
that filaments made of such a material would not melt or disintegrate
at that temperature. Whilst our laboratory work, founded upon
this idea, was going on, the first two advances in incandescent light-
ing were made public, one being the “ Nernst” and the other the
“Osmium ” lamp.

There are certain metals the melting points of which are known to
be considerably above 2,000° C., and the task resolved itself into find-
ing one which, while fulfilling the above requirement, could be easily
worked to form a filament, and not be very rare or difficult to pro-
cure. It was early observed that brown vanadium pentoxide, which,
according to Berzelius, does not conduct electricity, is, as a matter of

fact, a conductor even when cold. This observation induced me to
try whether vanadic acid could not be electrolytically decomposed.
tn this I succeeded, but the melting point of the vanadium obtained
proved too low for the purpose in view. Since the metals niobium
and tantalum are members of the vanadium group, niobium having
an atomic weight double that of vanadium, while the atomic weight
of tantalum is double that of niobium, it was thought that one or both
of these metals might prove to have the desired qualities. On ex-
perimenting with niobium on the lnes adopted for vanadium it ap-
peared that this metal has a considerably higher melting point than
ihat of vanadium, but not, however, sufficiently high. Moreover,
some of the niobium filaments which I made had a very strong ten-
dency to break up when heated by the electric current.

Tantalum was tried next. I reduced potassium tantalo-fluoride
in the manner prescribed by Berzelius and Rose and found that the
finely divided tantalum so produced became fairly coherent on roll-
ing, so that by this treatment metallic strips of it could be made. It
was also attempted to work tantalum oxide into the shape of a fila-
ment by mixing it with paraffin and to reduce it directly imto the
form of a metallic thread. In these experiments there was observed
for the first time a minute globule of molten tantalum, and this
globule was of sufficient toughness to permit hammering and draw-
ing into wire. Following out this observation, tantalum powder was
melted in a vacuum, and then it was found that the highly heated
metal parted with the gases it contained. In this manner I pro-
duced my first filaments of pure metallic tantalum, which were,
however, very small. When these had been used in lamps with
promise of good results, an attempt was made to devise a definite
process of purification. The potassium tantalo-fluoride was reduced
to metallic powder; this powder contains a small proportion of oxide
and of hydrogen which is absorbed during the reduction. When the
powder was melted in a vacuum the oxide and absorbed gas disap-
peared and a reguline metal remained; on carefully remelting this it
became so pure that no appreciable impurities could be detected in it.

The chemical properties of this pure tantalum are very remark-
able, and some of them are of such a nature as to lead me to suppose
that nobody other than myself has ever had metallic tantalum in
his hands. When cold, the material strongly resists chemical re-
agents; it is not attacked by boiling hydrochloric acid, aqua regia,
nitric acid, or sulphuric acid, and it is also indifferent to alkaline
solutions; it is attacked solely by hydrofluoric acid. Following the
behavior of steel, when heated in the air it assumes a yellow tint at
about 400° C., and the tint changes to dark blue when the tantalum
is exposed for some time to 500° C., or for a shorter time to 600° C.
Thin wires of the substance burn with low intensity and without

any noticeable flame when ignited. It absorbs hydrogen as well as
nitrogen with great avidity, even at a low red heat, and forms with
them combinations of a metallic appearance, but rather brittle. It
combines with carbon very easily, forming several carbides which,
as far as they are at present known, are all of metallic appearance,
but also very hard and brittle. The product which Moissan thought
to be tantalum was clearly a carbide of this nature or an alloy of a
earbide with pure tantalum, for Moissan himself stated that his metal
still contained one-half per cent of carbon. Considering the high
atomic weight of tantalum (183) it is obvious that a very small quan-
tity of carbon suffices to carburize a relatively large quantity of
tantalum. This view of the constitution of Moissan’s product is
confirmed by the properties he ascribed to the metal—namely, spe-
cific gravity 12°8, great hardness and brittleness. These are not
properties of pure tantalum. When in the form of powder, still
containing, as previously stated, oxide and hydrogen, the specific
gravity of my material is about 14; when purified by fusion and
drawn into wire it has a specific gravity of 16°8. It is somewhat
darker than platinum, and has a hardness about equal to that of
mild steel, but shows greater tensile strength than steel does. It is
malleable, although the effect of hammering is relatively small, so
that the operation must be rather long and severe to beat the metal
into a sheet. It can be rolled, as well as drawn, into very fine wire.
Its tensile strength as a wire is remarkably high, and amounts to 95
kilograms per square millimeter, while the corresponding figure for
good steel is 70 to 80 kilograms, according to Kohlrausch.

The electrical resistance of the material at indoor temperature is
0-165 ohm for a length of 1 meter and a section of 1 square milli-
meter (specific conductivity as compared with mercury 6:06). The
temperature coefficient is positive and has a value of 0°30 between
0° C. and 100° C. At the temperature assumed by the incandescent
filament in the lamp at 1°5 watts per candlepower, the resistance
rises to 0°830 ohm for a length of 1 meter and a section of 1 square
millimeter. The coefficient of linear thermal expansion between
0° C. and 60° C. is 0:0000079, according to experiments made by the
Imperial Normal-Aichungs commission. Fusion is preceded by a
gradual softening, which appears to extend over a range of tempera-
ture of several hundred degrees. The specific heat is 0°0365, so that
the atomic heat is 6°64, which is in accord with the law established

by Dulong and Petit.
Part II.—By Dr. O. FEurr.ein.

The results of the work carried out in our chemical laboratory, as
described by Doctor von Bolton in the first part of this paper, were,
of course, of the utmost interest to our incandescent lamp manufac-

turing department. As soon as Doctor Bolton’s experiments showed
that the originally brittle tantalum could be made ductile enough to
draw into wire by the usual methods, and that this wire could be bent
and coiled like a thin steel wire, it became possible to test it thor-
oughly as to its usefulness for incandescent lamps. The first trials
with wires of about 0°3 millimeter diameter gave most promising
results. They confirmed the fact that tantalum has a very high melt-
ing pomt and that it is but shehtly subject to disintegration in a
vacuum, even when subjected to a heavy current.

The first tantalum lamp that proved moderately satisfactory in that
it admitted of an exact measurement of the electric photometric
conditions and stood a burning test for some time, was completed
just over two years ago, viz, on December 28, 1902. This lamp had
a loop-shaped filament made of the first tantalum wire ever drawn.
The diameter of the wire was 0°28 millimeter, its effective hghting
length 54 millimeters, and its electrical resistance when cold 0°29
ohm. This corresponds to a specific resistance (1 meter length, 1
square millimeter section) of 0°331. The photometric measurements
made at efficiencies of 2, 14, and 1 watt per Hefner candlepower
showed potential differences of 4:9, 4°95, and 5-9 volts, currents of
5, 5°46, and 6°2 amperes, and illuminating values of 11, 18, and 37
Hefner candlepower, respectively. On being burnt at 1 watt per
candlepower the lamp had a life of twenty hours, during which it
blackened considerably.

As the chemical and mechanical manufacturing processes devel-
oped and the material became purer and the wires more uniform, the
results obtained also improved. The lamps lasted longer and black-
ened less; at the same time the specific resistance decreased until it
had dropped to the present figure of 0-165 for the pure metal. It is
clear that the material used for the first lamps still contained a con-
siderable quantity of impurities, probably niobium and _ carbides,
which caused the great disintegration and the nearly double specific
resistance. During these first trials we looked very carefully into
the question as to what dimensions the filament of a tantalum lamp
ought to have for ordinary voltages and illuminating values. From
the dimensions of the filament used in the first lamp we calculated
that, with this rather impure material, we should require a filament
about 520 millimeters long and 0:06 millimeter diameter for a lamp
for 110 volts, 32 Hefner candlepower, and 1°5 watts per candle-
power. These unusual figures increased when the specific resistance
of the material had diminished to the present value of 0°165, at which,
for a 82 Hefner candlepower lamp, a filament of about 700 milli-
meters in length by 0°055 millimeter in diameter was required; for
a 25 Hefner candlepower lamp a filament of about 650 millimeters
by 0:05 millimeter diameter was required. Thus, in order to con-
THE TANTALUM LAMP. has

struct a practical and useful lamp for standard voltages and illu-
minating values, we had to solve the problem of drawing the tanta-
lum wire in sufficient length down to a diameter of 0:05 millimeter
to 0-06 millimeter; this we succeeded in doing after long and labori-
ous trials. i

In July, 1903, we possessed the first tantalum lamp with a filament
of about 0-05 millimeter diameter. It had a loop-shaped filament 54
millimeters long, and it took 0°58 amperes at 9 volts and gave 3:5
- Hefner candlepower at 1°5 watts per candlepower. On the basis
of these figures a lamp having the same quality and diameter of wire
and working at the same efficiency on a 110-volt circuit would have
a filament 650 millimeters long and would give 43 Hefner candle-
power. The experiments thus far had proved that the task of pro-
ducing lamps for 110 volts and a maximum of 25 to 32 Hefner candle-
power was not an easy one in several respects. We had to solve the
problem of suitably and reliably fixing a filament rather more than
2 feet long within a glass globe which should not exceed to any great
extent the dimensions of the usual incandescent lamps. The first
and most obvious attempt was made, of course, by adhering to the
loop shape and accommodating the required length of wire by connect-
ing several such bows in series within the lamp. However, lamps
made according to this plan with two to four tantalum loops gave
results which were anything but satisfactory.

It appeared that, like all other metallic filaments which have hith-
erto been used for incandescent lamps, tantalum wire softens sensibly
at the temperature attained when worked at 1°5 watts per candle-
power. To use loop-shaped or spiral filaments similar to the carbon
filaments of the common incandescent lamps was, therefore, out of
the question. There was no difficulty in suspending the loops, but in
that case the lamps would have to be used exclusively in a vertical
position, a limitation which we wished to avoid in all circumstances.
Besides, such a construction would necessitate staying the loops firmly
to prevent them from becoming entangled with each other during
transport of the lamps. Nor did lamps made with loops of corrugated
wire (fig. 1) or of plain or corrugated metal ribbon give satisfaction ;
for although the loops were certainly shortened in this way, there
were other drawbacks which caused us to abandon this construction.
It soon became apparent that the one road to success lay in the direc-
tion of dividing the filament into a number of short straight lengths
supported at their ends by insulated holders. In this manner we suc-
ceeded at last, in September, 1903, in producing the first really sery-
iceable lamps for about 110 volts. This lamp is illustrated in figure 2.
and it will be seen that it contains two glass disks cast to a central
wire holder; each disk carries laterally twelve arms having small
hooks at their ends and insulated from each other. Through these

twenty-four hooks the thin tantalum wire is drawn up and down be-
tween the two disks. This is believed to be the first metallic incan-
descent lamp for nearly 110 volts which, lke the common carbon
glow lamp, can burn in any position whatsoever. This lamp sup-
plied about 30 Hefner candlepower on a 94-volt circuit at 1°5 watts
per candlepower. It lasted for 260 hours, and lost during that time
9-5 per cent of its illuminating power.

After this first practical success we redoubled our efforts to improve
the lamp further. As far back as about the middle of October, 1903, .

we succeeded in making the first 200-volt tantalum lamp, which was
of a design similar to the lamp just described, but with eighteen arms
on each disk and with a greater distance between the two disks. I
may add at once that it is of interest only as a curiosity, for it has
served no practical purpose. The length of its filament was 1,350
millimeters and the illuminating value about 60 Hefner candle-
power. In the course of further development the form of the frame
of wire filament for the 110-volt lamp went through different stages,
the principle of subdivision being always followed. Among other
constructions, we tried some in which, instead of one long filament,
THE TANTALUM LAMP. 135

a number of short pieces of wire were fixed on a supporting frame:
these pieces, connected in series, made up the total length required.
Figure 3 represents a lamp thus constructed, the wire being fixed
obliquely in sixteen straight pieces between two insulated supporting
stars. Such lamps offer the advantage that short pieces of filament
ean be used in the manufacture, but they are only reliable if the
wires used in the same lamp
are absolutely uniform in di-
ameter and quality. In the
end we arrived at the shape
represented in figure +, which
is for 110 volts, 25 candle-
power, and 1-5 watts per
Hefner candlepower. In this
form, differing from most of
the previous constructions, the
central support consists of a
short glass rod carrying two
disks, into which the arms,
bent upward and downward
in the shape of an umbrella,
are cast. The upper star has
eleven, the lower twelve arms,
each upper arm being in a ver-
tical plane midway between
the vertical planes in which
two adjacent lower arms lie.
Between these eleven and

twelve arms, which are bent
into hooks at their ends, the
entire length of the filament
is drawn in a zigzag fashion.
Its extremities, held by two of
the lower arms, are connected
with the foot of the lamp by
means of platinum strips.
The standard type for 110
volts 25 Hefner candlepower and 1-5 watts per candlepower has a
filament 650 millimeters long and 0-05 millimeters in diameter. The
weight of this filament is 0-022 gram, so that about 45,000 lamps
contain together 1 kilogram of tantalum. The shape of the glass
globe is adapted to the frame described above. Care has been
taken to make it of a size not exceeding the usual maximum dimen-
sions of common incandescent lamps of the same candlepower

(25 Hefner candlepower 110 volts). This shape offers a number
of noticeable advantages. In the first instance it is very stable
and will stand strong shocks without damage to the lamp. <A con-
siderable number of such lamps sent across the sea to test their ability
to withstand the hardships of transport came back unhurt, although
they had been packed just ke common glow lamps, and no
special care in any respect had been taken in their handling. The
lamp burns, of course, in any position, and can therefore be held in
any kind of fitting. The light is rather white and agreeable, and its
effect is particularly uniform if the lamp is provided with a ground-
glass globe.

We shall now proceed to describe the electric and photometric
properties of the lamp and its behavior in actual use. Numerous
trials for lengthy periods of time at 1 to 3 watts per candlepower
have proved the vast superiority of the tantalum lamp over the
carbon filament lamp under equal electric and photometric conditions.
Expressing this fact in figures, we can state that the tantalum lamp
consumes about 50 per cent less current at the same voltage, with the
same intensity of light and the same useful life; or that, at the same
economy, its life is several times that of the carbon type. Moreover,
at an initial efficiency of 1°5 volts per Hefner candlepower the tanta-
tum lamp has an average life quite sufficient for all practical require-
ments, so that this rating has been standardized for the 110-volt
lamp. Trials have also proved that the lamps have a life of several
hundred hours at 1 watt per Hefner candlepower, but in that case
they were very sensitive to variations of pressure and often showed
an early decrease of illuminating power. The useful life of the
tantalum lamp—i. e., the time within which it loses 20 per cent of
its initial illuminating power—averages between 400 and 600 hours
at 1°5 watts per Hefner candlepower. Some specimens have proved
to have a useful life of as much as 1,200 hours. The absolute life, in
